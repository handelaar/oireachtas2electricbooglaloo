Price levels within these areas are liable to fluctuate in accordance with conditions of supply and demand.  I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction with prices, nor am I aware that the prices paid are insufficient to give producers an economic return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, without prior consultation with the trade unions concerned, the Great Southern Railways Company are establishing a cadet system in their service from which all future <Col N="6" /> appointments to executive positions are to be made, and that membership is to be confined to staff who are not over 25 years of age and who have not less than four years' service, whether they entered the service through the open competitive examinations or not; and, if so, whether he has considered the effects of this step in relation to Sections 55 and 56 of the Railways Act, 1924; and whether he will accordingly seek for the withdrawal of this scheme which would be liable to create grievous discontent among the staff, particularly at this juncture when harmony is so essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function under Sections 55 and 56 of the Railways Act, 1924, in regard to a matter of this kind, and I do not propose to interfere with the discretion of the Great Southern Railways Company in matters of management.</P>
      <P>I understand from inquiries which I have caused to be made that the result of past circumstances has been to leave unqualified, if not actually to render unfit, most of the employees who might have shown promise in the direction of handling affairs of management.  It is to remedy this that the company proposes to bring into operation at the earliest moment the scheme to which the Deputy refers, under which the company intends to select by competition those of its employees of any grade, not more than 25 years of age, who show the greatest promise of aptitude and capacity for management, and to give these employees special facilities for qualifying in a four years' course of training, with, however, no guarantee of executive appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that this will not preclude the consideration of employees over 25 years of age for executive appointments, nor of persons outside the company's service, as may be necessary, for either participation in the course of training or for such appointments.  The scheme is intended to afford the company's employees fuller opportunities of advancement than formerly and should in due course improve the quality of the company's administration.  It does not appear to <Col N="7" /> me that the sections of the 1924 Act to which the Deputy refers are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that up to this every clerk who entered the railway service through competitive examination could hope in time to reach the executive grade and to become a chief officer?  Is it not obvious that this departure is a breach of faith with the clerical staff, as those who are now 26 years of age may abandon all hope of bettering their position no matter how brilliant they may be?  Further, is the Minister aware that if such a system as this had been introduced years ago the highly efficient official who is advising him in his transport legislation and who came to his Department from the railway service would have been ineligible for anything but a junior position in the railway had he remained with the company; and does not this illustration convince the Minister of the absurd nature of the proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the circumstances in which the Carrick Slate Company went into liquidation in 1935, the manner in which it disposed of the valuable quarry machinery and equipment; the prices, if any, realised by the sale of this machinery and equipment as compared with the prices at the time of installation, and whether, having regard to the State assistance afforded to this company, he satisfied himself that the company operated the workings in the best interests of the State and the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting of the directors of the quarry company held on the 2nd October, 1935, it was decided that the company go into liquidation and the debenture holding bank was requested by the company to appoint a receiver and liquidator.  The company had sustained a net loss of £1,986 in the year 1934.</P>
      <P>A receiver was appointed on the 8th October, 1935, and he subsequently advertised the property for sale as a going concern or otherwise.  The plant and equipment of the company were disposed of by sale and yielded a net amount after payment of miscellaneous expenses and the receiver's fees of £104 18s. 5d.  All the plant and equipment were sold in one lot by the receiver and it is not possible for me to relate the prices realised on the sale of the plant acquired out of the proceeds of the loan with the amount realised by the receiver for such plant. I have no reason to think that the company did not operate the quarry in the best interests of all concerned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the former employees of the Carrick Slate Company are now trying to eke out a bare livelihood by the hand manufacture of slates; if he will state in whom the mining rights of their former company are now vested, and if he will undertake to have a special investigation made as to the possibility of reopening the quarry and generally facilitating any persons interested in the re-establishment of this valuable national industry with a view to absorbing in productive employment all the former workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that some workmen are working the new Ormonde quarry and are paying rent to Mr. James Power, Knockroe, Ahenny, Carrick-on-Suir, who is stated to have bought the quarry in 1941. Generally, the title to the mining rights referred to in the question is obscure and investigation of the title would involve a considerable amount of expense in legal charges without any progress towards development in the absence of any group taking an interest in development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to give any assistance within my power to any persons possessing the necessary financial and technical resources to bring the deposits into commercial production again.  It must, however, be remembered that despite a considerable amount of Government help, both financial and otherwise, the quarry <Col N="10" /> company had to close down in 1935 as the quarry became uneconomic to work owing to the deterioration of the slate vein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part VIII of the Local Government Act, 1941, enables a county council to give approval to parish councils or, in fact, any local council established for furthering the general social and economic interests of the people in any locality in a county.  The county council may assist by providing village halls for parish council meetings and for lectures, general recreation, and other similar objects.  The county council can avail of the help of, and, if they wish, delegate functions to the parish council.  The attention of county councils was drawn to the provisions of the Act and the county councils of five counties have approved of parish councils but, except in Limerick, the number approved has been limited. The growth and expansion of the parish council movement depends largely on local initiative.  The Government, by the Act of 1941, has afforded all the requisite facilities for its development and I do not think that any amendment of the existing law in that regard is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that where a number of widows have been refused contributory pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts on the grounds that at the date of death their husbands had ceased insurance for the purpose of those Acts, such cesser was due to the absence of their late husbands at work in Great Britain for a number of years; whether, in fact, the insurance of the husband is preserved in such cases for sickness and disablement benefit, and, if so, whether he will amend the law or otherwise make provision to preserve the continuity of insurance for the purpose of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the position is that there are no reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain for widows' and orphans' pensions insurance. When a man who is insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act leaves the country and takes up insurable employment in Great Britain he becomes insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts in force in Great Britain without any continuity from his Irish insurance. He remains an insured person under the Irish Acts for 12 months after the date of his last Irish stamp.  If he dies within two years of that date, that is before he is fully qualified under the British scheme, and after the termination of his insurance under the Irish <Col N="13" /> scheme, his widow is not entitled to a contributory pension under either scheme.</P>
      <P>Proposals are being considered for amending legislation by which the insurance position under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts of persons who have gone or go to Great Britain for employment during the emergency will be adequately safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the safeguarding contemplated in the amending legislation will apply retrospectively to the persons who have been denied contributory widows' pensions because of the flaws in the existing legislation?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the county medical officer for health for County Mayo recommended in his report for 1943 that a sanatorium should be built in Castlebar as the present sanatorium at Creagh is badly placed and is difficult of access to patients and their relatives, many of whom are 80 miles from it; and if he will state what steps, if any, have been taken by his Department for the erection of a sanatorium in the best geographical and administrative part of County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report of the county medical officer of health for County Mayo dealing with sanatorium treatment.  Such reports are always addressed to the local authority and not to my Department. The provision of accommodation for tuberculous patients resident in its area who are in need of institutional treatment is a function of the local authority.  Subsequent to the issue of the medical officer's report a request was received in my Department from <Col N="14" /> the local authority for sanction to the erection of chalets for ten to 20 patients in St. Teresa's Sanatorium as a temporary measure.  This proposal was later revised by the local authority to include accommodation for 32 patients.  Full details thereof have not yet been submitted by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the fact that the capitation grant of 4/- per patient per week was fixed at a time when that sum represented approximately 50 per cent. of the weekly cost of the maintenance of mental hospital patients, and having regard to the fact that the present cost of maintenance is approximately £62 per annum, he will consider increasing the capitation grant so as to accord with present-day maintenance cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant towards the accommodation and maintenance of persons committed to mental hospitals is part of a system of financial subvention of local rates which has become established gradually over a long period.  At the time this particular grant originated the grants-in-aid of local taxation were few and had not attained their present proportion of about £5,000,000 a year.  The question of the revision of a particular grant cannot be considered apart from other grants which are applicable to the relief of rates raised for the upkeep of local services generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since February last the Pigs and Bacon Commission has been operating a scheme to secure an equitable distribution <Col N="15" /> of available bacon supplies through wholesalers and retailers.  Each month the Commission fixes a quota for distributors which is based on their average monthly supplies in the year ended 31st March, 1941.  Shortage of feeding stuffs has led to a decline in the number of pigs available for curing into bacon, but feed is now less scarce and there are signs of a revival in the pig rearing industry.  The number of pigs sent to factories for curing during the last two months has been appreciably greater than in the corresponding period of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that shopkeepers have been informed by their wholesalers this week that their quota&mdash;the quantity they received last month&mdash;is being reduced this month?  If that is so, what is the cause?  The shopkeepers were informed some time ago that there was a likelihood of an increased supply.  Will the Minister indicate why there is a decrease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota is decided upon by the Pigs and Bacon Commission, after taking into account the amount of bacon held in stock by the curers, future needs, and the trend of pig production. I take it the Pigs and Bacon <Col N="16" /> Commission have allocated whatever they think will be available for the month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that excessive prices are being charged by threshing mill owners in many parts of the country, and if it is his intention to have tightened up the regulation with regard to those charges; and further if he will state if any steps have been taken by his Department to ensure that efficient work is being done in all cases by the threshing mills in the various counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Emergency Powers (No. 337) Order, 1944, the charge to be made for threshing in any particular locality is restricted to an amount not more than 12½ per cent. above the charge current in the locality in 1941-42.  No evidence has been received that this limit is being exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, threshing mill owners who work for hire are obliged under the Emergency Powers (Portable Threshing Mills) Order, 1944, to have their mills licensed, and to ensure that the machines work efficiently.  Tillage inspectors in the various counties inspect threshing mills and investigate complaints of indifferent threshing.  So <Col N="17" /> far, mills inspected were reported to be doing satisfactory work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to charges, are not the threshing mill owners compelled to charge not more than 12½ per cent. over the 1941 rate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that charge may be related to 1941, but if it exceeds the 1941 charge by more than 12½ per cent., and if particulars are supplied to the Department, the necessary action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that it is very hard for a farmer to make a report, because these machines are rather scarce and the minute a man makes a report, that finishes him for the next turn of threshing. It is not that I want to level a charge against any officials, but in my part of the country I do not believe there is any such thing as supervision as regards the condition of the mills or the charges.  I think the Minister should endeavour to exercise some control over charges and the condition of the mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather big question to discuss at this stage.  That point has been considered over and over again.

Dip. Ed. degrees <Col N="19" /> through Irish, and who had practical experience in secondary schools of the teaching through Irish, and if he will state why he compels a local committee to regard a certificate like &ldquo;Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge&rdquo;, issued by his Department, as being more important than a degree of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Much difficulty had been experienced by vocational education committees in obtaining suitably qualified teachers of Irish, that is, teachers who, in addition to the necessary knowledge of the language, were able by organising activities designed to foster the language movement, to maintain the interest and progress of the students.  Following representations made in 1939 and 1940 by the Irish Technical Education Association, the Department decided to organise a special course for training for teachers of Irish.  This course was held in 1941 and a certificate (called the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge) was granted to the teachers who completed the course satisfactorily.  University graduates were eligible to sit for the preliminary examination for admission to the course and a considerable number of them presented themselves. These specially trained teachers have been very successful in organising and maintaining Irish classes in the districts in which they have been appointed, and it was, therefore, decided to restrict future appointments as whole-time teachers of Irish to persons who had obtained similar training and qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was conveyed to all vocational education committees in August, 1943.  A protest against the decision is recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the County Cork Vocational Education Committee held on 27th July last, and the usual copies of these minutes were received in my Department.  As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, there was no intention to evaluate the importance of a university degree, nor to institute a comparison between such a degree and any other qualification; it happened that duties were to be assigned to <Col N="20" /> teachers of Irish employed by vocational education committees, training for which would not be in the ordinary way covered by any courses hitherto available, and it was decided that the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge is the most suitable qualification for the special duties I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and myself are in accord with regard to the importance of this matter.  Does he think it right and proper that university graduates, who take their degrees in Irish and who have practical experience of teaching in secondary schools through Irish, should be debarred from being considered eligible for the position of teacher of Irish in vocational schools under the Cork County Committee?  Does it not prove that he is trying to bring in the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge to override the qualifications of first-class university students who took their degrees in Irish?  Is not that what he is trying to do, and is that right and proper?  Does the Minister not agree that university education should be the highest form of education in this country, and that all young boys and girls who possess those qualifications, the highest degrees they can get, should not be debarred from being considered eligible for vocational school teaching simply because some officer in his Department has some been in his bonnet and wants to bring this matter under some form of special rule?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of some official having a bee in his bonnet.  This decision is the result of prolonged consideration of the matter. The Deputy will recollect that I informed him that teachers of Irish under vocational committees are now being entrusted with special duties in the organising of activities designed to foster the language movement, and, as I have said, to maintain the interest and the progress of the students.  There <Col N="21" /> is no question of debarring university graduates from teaching if they satisfy the Department that they have the necessary qualifications.  I believe that the courses which have been instituted are the best method through which to obtain teachers who will be suitably qualified and suitably trained to carry out those duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday evening last I was speaking on Section 50 of this Bill, with reference to the way leaves payable to the Dublin Corporation by the Dublin United Transport Company; and the Minister was referring to an original agreement made in the days when there were only trams and which provided for a variation of the amount payable according to the mileage of track in use.  It must be remembered that in those days there was no other means of transport around the city but the electric trams &mdash;of course always provided one did not want to use the out-of-date method of horse trams.  The payment according to mileage was, in those days, the easiest and most equitable manner of arriving at the sum payable by the Dublin United Transport Company to the Dublin Corporation.  When omnibuses came into use, the Act of 1925 fixed the sum payable by the Dublin United Transport Company to the Dublin Corporation at £14,920.  There were other advantages to the Dublin Corporation: the road surface up to 18 inches on either side of the tracks was maintained by the Dublin United Transport Company, and there was also the right of the corporation to use the tramway standards to hold electric lights.  These two things definitely were worth, and are worth, some cash sum to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (4) of this section of the Bill, it is mentioned that an arbitrator will be appointed to go into this <Col N="28" /> matter, but the corporation view with a great deal of alarm the fact that the Minister has put into this sub-section (4) that the arbitrator&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;may have regard, so far as he considers equitable, to the extent to which the roadways of that road authority have ceased to be used or will cease to be used for the purpose of tramways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to mean that the arbitration may be largely decided by the amount of roadway which has ceased to be used by the trams.  I would like to ask the Minister why this question of cessation of wayleaves has come about and what new factors are present now, owing to the amalgamation of two companies, that were not present a few years ago?  No new form of transport, or anything like that has appeared.  If it were equitable for the Dublin United Transport Company to pay the corporation&mdash;and, thereby, the citizens of Dublin&mdash;this sum of money, why should that cease with the amalgamation of the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways?  That is what the corporation would like to know &mdash; what new factors have emerged which make it necessary to bring this matter before an arbitrator and subject that sum to the hazards of arbitration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Dockrell's protest in connection with this matter.  Under the agreement of 1925, the corporation made a bargain with the Dublin United Transport Company, which had the effect of perpetuity so far as these wayleaves were concerned.  The company at the time deemed it a very good bargain, so far as the question of monopoly was concerned and we contend now that the monopoly will be extended to Córas Iompair Éireann and, for that monopoly, the bargain should stand, or certainly its equivalent in cash compensation.</P>
      <P>We protest very strongly against this sinister sub-section (4) to which the Deputy referred and, particularly, to the words&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;to the extent to which the roadways of that road authority have <Col N="29" /> ceased to be used or will cease to be used for the purpose of tramways&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the tendency is towards a diminution of the tramway system and these words are very obviously an invitation to the arbitrator to assess compensation on a diminishing quantity.  In effect, the compensation which may ultimately be allotted to the corporation may be very inequitable.  The Dublin Corporation has a very serious interest in this, as it has derived an income of about £14,000 a year in this way, plus the amount expended in the maintenance of the roads.  That maintenance, of course, was liable to cease as the tramways themselves ceased, but nevertheless the burden of the upkeep of the streets will have to be borne in future by the corporation.  Therefore, there is considerably more involved here than even the £14,000.  I suggest that this particular sub-section (4) means that the Dublin Corporation and, therefore, the citizens of Dublin are getting an exceedingly raw deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, in reply, clarify the House on this point? In the 1925 agreement to which Deputy Dockrell and Deputy O'Sullivan have referred, was there a proviso that, whether the Dublin United Transport Company used the tram rails or not, their obligation to repair the roadway for a distance of 18 inches on either side of the tramline was to subsist, or had they the right under the agreement to inform the corporation that, as of a given date, they would cease to use the tramline, let us say, to Clonskeagh, and thereupon their liability to maintain that part of the roadway to Clonskeagh would cease?  If there was a permanent undertaking by the company to keep the breadth of the tramline and 18 inches on either side in repair in perpetuity, it seems that a very material matter of compensation would present itself to the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further point, to which I desire to call the attention of the Minister, namely, that a slightly different position exists concerning the roadway between Blackrock and Monkstown.  Under an agreement made between the company and the old council&mdash;the Blackrock Urban Council&mdash;the tramway company, now the Dublin United Transport Company, is liable for the upkeep of the roadway between the pathways on either side, that is the whole of the roadway.  In view of this section the upkeep of the roadway will in future fall on the local authority, that is the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council.  In that case a much greater liability is involved because the whole of the road requires to be repaired by the borough council whereas in the city the liability extends to only 18 inches on either side.  I should like to know whether the wording of this sub-section (4) will be sufficient to ensure that adequate compensation will be paid in respect of the wider extent of road, for the maintenance of which they were liable.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dockrell asks whether, if it were equitable that the Dublin United Transport Company should be required to pay a sum in perpetuity to the corporation by the 1925 Act, why we should seek to alter that position, he is begging the question.  The Deputy appears to be under the impression, an impression shared by Deputy O'Sullivan, that this payment is made <Col N="31" /> under an agreement which gave to the Dublin United Tramway Company some monopoly in the City of Dublin. That is completely erroneous.  In 1925 the Dublin United Tramway Company promoted a private Bill seeking power to run omnibuses but not giving them the exclusive right to run omnibuses.  The position at that time was that anybody could run omnibuses except the tramway company.  Because they were operating under a statute, they could not run omnibuses although, in fact, a number of other parties were operating buses at that time.  For some reason the Dublin Corporation opposed that Bill and the only agreement made between the tramway company and the corporation related to the opposition offered by the corporation to that Bill, opposition due to the political power which the corporation was able to exercise on the Committee considering the Bill.</P>
      <P>As an arrangement designed to secure the withdrawal of the corporation's opposition, the tramway company agreed to pay wayleaves to the corporation for an indefinite period at the amount at which they were paid in that year.  It is quite clear, however, that the Special Committee which considered the Bill had their own doubts as to the justice of that arrangement because they put into the Act, a private Act, words which had no relationship to its purpose and which could only be interpreted as an expression of their doubts.  The Act provides that &ldquo;notwithstanding any discontinuance or abandonment in whole or in part by the company of any of the existing tramway lines or equipment, the company shall continue to pay to the local authorities not less annually by way of wayleaves than the respective amounts now being paid by the company.&rdquo;  If they merely wanted to provide for that, they would have stopped there, but they went on to add the following words&mdash;&ldquo;unless and until provision to the contrary is made by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider it desirable that this question should now be considered. We are not proposing to ask the <Col N="32" /> Oireachtas to make a decision.  We regard it as necessary in any event that this annual liability which the new company will acquire from the Dublin United Transport Company should be capitalised.  The determination of the capital sum to be paid to the corporation on the termination of the liability is left to an arbitrator and we say to the arbitrator that he shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and may have regard, so far as he considers it equitable, to the extent to which the roadways of that road authority have ceased to be used or will cease to be used for the purposes of tramways.  I do not suppose that anybody will seriously contend that the transport organisation should continue to pay to the corporation in perpetuity charges which arose out of the tramways centuries after the tramways have ceased to exist.  That, no doubt, is the contention of the corporation. If the arbitrator thinks it reasonable, we are not debarring him from fixing a capital sum on that basis, but we require him to consider that matter.  We require him to consider whether it is equitable to have regard to the extent to which the roadways may cease to be used for the purposes of tramways.  If he considers it is equitable to have regard to it, then compensation is fixed on that basis.</P>
    <P>This section has nothing to do with the maintenance of roadways or with any other agreement between the Dublin United Transport Company and the corporation, as they were maintained by the Act of 1925 and they are still being maintained.  They are transferred to the new company.  The Dublin Corporation entered into an agreement with the Dublin United Transport Company to effect a reduction in the company's liability to maintain the roadways, corresponding to the abandonment of tramways. Similarly they entered into an agreement to reduce the amount of rates which the company had to meet.  It is quite clear that the company's liabilities in the opinion of the corporation had some relation to the extent to which tram tracks were in use.  The situation, however, in respect of wayleaves has been continued unchanged <Col N="33" /> because of the provisions of the 1925 Act, provisions which arose, not out of any concession given in Dublin to the Dublin United Tramway Company, but out of the opposition which the corporation offered to the tramway company being permitted to get power to do something which anybody else could do, namely to run omnibuses on the Dublin streets.</P>
    <P>The monopoly position which the company has since then acquired was achieved under another Act which had a precise purpose.  So far as there is an obligation upon a transport operator to contribute to the cost of maintaining the streets, the Dublin United Tramway Company in the past paid their road tax to the Dublin Corporation and would, no doubt, be still paying road tax to the corporation if the law had not been changed requiring the tax to be paid into the Road Fund. In so far as there is an allocation out of the Road Fund to local authorities, in proportion to the amount contributed in the local authorities' areas, the corporation will still continue to receive a certain sum in respect of the amount paid by the company in road tax.  I think there can be no question about the equity of the arrangement we propose here.  Neither can there be any question of the desirability of getting rid of this annual liability by capitalising it.  That is the main purpose of the section.</P>

      <P>But they were paying in the past and paying wayleaves, too.  We are very nervous up in Cork Hill, particularly in regard to that section about the arbitrator and the provision regarding what he considers to be equitable.  I think that that is putting queer ideas into the arbitrator's mind and we should like the Minister to clear up that matter more than he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise Deputy Dockrell not to be misled by the Minister's remarks.  The Minister is fighting <Col N="35" /> a bad case with considerable adroitness.  He has gone through several contracts made by the Dublin United Tramways Company during its history.  He recognises that the amalgamated company must take over the tramway company's assets and liabilities. There are certain liabilities which he, and some of those associated with him in putting this Bill through, do not like.  Therefore, they put him up to describe them as secured by blackmail, as irrelevant to the Act which imposed them upon the tramways company, and as conditions which any reasonable man would recognise as being utterly inequitable. With that introduction, he proposes to hand the matter over to the arbitrator. It is fantastic to say that the Dublin United Tramways Company went in, trembling like a shorn lamb, before the Dublin Corporation and said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we will give you £14,000 a year if you withdraw your opposition to the Bill before the Committee of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  The tramways company is not a bleating lamb in the presence of a voracious tiger.  It has demonstrated in the course of its honourable history that it is well able to fight its own battles against the Dublin Corporation or any other body. The truth is that, up to 1925, Dublin United Tramways Company had enjoyed, for the payment of wayleaves, a virtual monopoly of the transport of the city.  They would not put on buses because they wanted to continue the tramway monopoly, but others put on buses in spite of them.  Therefore, they had to make up their minds on the issue which confronted them inasmuch as the citizens were travelling by bus and would not avail of the trams.  They wanted to put on buses when they had either to put on buses or go out of business.  They came to Dáil Eireann to get their charter altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe what their payment of wayleaves up to 1925 had secured for them. They were the transport organisation in Dublin.  They were in a very advantageous position in the transport trade in Dublin.  The moment they went into the bus business they commenced with an immense advantage in their <Col N="36" /> favour over everybody else running buses.  The hard-headed directors of the company sat down and said: &ldquo;The right to get into this bus business, with our immense, additional advantages, is well worth a deal with the Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;  Dublin Corporation said: &ldquo;It is perfectly clear that our permission to you to have exclusive wayleave for trams since 1896 has put you in a very advantageous position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the private <i>entrepreneurs</i> in the bus business.  If you go into the bus business and get out of the tram business, you will leave us holding the baby and get an asset out of all proportion to what you paid in the past.  Therefore, we are going to represent to Dáil Eireann that you should not be allowed to operate buses at all, or, if you are, that some statutory charge should be laid upon you, payable to the corporation in perpetuity, for the right to run buses over the streets of Dublin.&rdquo;  Thereupon, the tramways company very prudently said: &ldquo;Look here, boys, let us make a deal.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say why other people were running buses on the Dublin streets and not paying anything to the Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was purely a matter of negotiation between the Dublin United Tramways Company and the Dublin Corporation.  The tramways company came to the conclusion that they were making a mighty good bargain in securing that the corporation would not make the representations which they proposed to make to Dáil Eireann with a view to having a statutory charge imposed upon the tramways company in lieu of the wayleaves which they would have ceased to pay under the original agreement if they went out of the tram business and went into the bus business.  They entered into a contract with Dublin Corporation which meant, in effect, if not in words, that they were to pay £14,000 a year in perpetuity to the Dublin Corporation.  Now, Córas Iompair Éireann, Teo., do not want to pay.  I have made many contracts which I should like to shed, but I have got the benefit of them and must go on paying.  Córas Iompair Éireann, <Col N="37" /> Teo., says: &ldquo;We do not want to go on paying.  Therefore, it is up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if the matter is raised on this Bill, to state our case exclusively and not to put the corporation side of the story at all.&rdquo;  The picture presented to us is that of the Dublin United Tramways Company coming forward with the simplest Bill possible to provide that they should be able to do what every other citizen could do.  Then, we have the big black wolf of the corporation coming in, blackmailing the tramways company and threatening to exercise political pressure on them.  Because of this, the innocent tramways company gently undertook to pay £14,000 to the corporation. Now, Córas Iompair Éireann, Teo., is going to mow the blackmailer down, restore equity and justice in the land and the Dublin ratepayer is going to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House may be persuaded by the Minister's eloquence and by his apparent indignation at the blackmailing activities and other iniquities of the Dublin Corporation but, so far as I am concerned, that cock does not fight.  I believe that the Dublin United Tramways Company did make an agreement and that Córas Iompair Éireann, Teo., wants to get out of it. I think that Deputy O'Sullivan, the <Col N="38" /> Lord Mayor, and other members of Dublin Corporation in this House should watch these sections closely and ensure that this matter will be referred to the arbitrator without trimmings, that he will be instructed to view this contract of the Dublin United Tramways Company, which is being taken over by Córas Iompair Éireann, Teo., in the same light as he would view any other contract taken over, without any reference to blackmail, double-dealing, or anything but what is on the record.  He should recognise that there is a contract in existence, and that it is desired to terminate the contract and to capitalise the liabilities of the Dublin United Tramways Company.  Those are the only relevant matters that the arbitrator can or ought to consider, and if he has any other matters to consider, in connection with the question of arriving at his award, then I suggest to the House, and to Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies who have spoken on this matter, that Córas Iompair Éireann, Teo., should not be relieved of the burden of taking over liabilities that were undertaken by its predecessor.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 110:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 51 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  As on and from the 1st day of January, 1945&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Agreement of 1887 and the Agreement of 1910 shall cease to have effect;</P>
      <P>(b)  the liability of the Northern Railway Company, under the Agreement of 1887 and the Agreement of 1910, to contribute a sum not exceeding £2,000 per annum towards payment of a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the 4 per cent. City of Dublin Junction Railways' Guaranteed Stock of the dissolved railway company and all liability, contingent or otherwise, of the company to the Northern Railway Company or of the Northern Railway Company to the company in respect of the said contribution shall cease;</P>
      <P>(c)  the company shall continue to operate the normal system of trains run before the said date for the purposes of, and in connection with, the mails services of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, over the Dublin Junction Railways and the company's railway between Westland Row in the City of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Mail Pier, until the company and the Northern Railway Company, with the consent of the said Minister agree otherwise;</P>
      <P>(d)  if, for convenience of working, the Northern Railway Company send any carriage or rolling stock over the Dublin Junction Railways and the company's railway between Westland Row aforesaid and Dun Laoghaire Mail Pier, no payment shall be made by the company to the Northern Railway Company in respect of any such carriage or rolling stock, nor shall any toll for haulage be charged by the company against the Northern Railway Company in respect of any such carriage or rolling stock.</P>
      <P>(2)  In consideration of the arrangements effected by sub-section (1) of this section, the Northern Railway Company shall, on the 1st day of January, 1945, pay to the company the sum of £8,000.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Northern Railway Company&rdquo; means the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland);</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Agreement of 1887&rdquo; means the agreement made on the 26th day of August, 1887, between the Northern Railway Company of the first part, the former City of Dublin Steam Packet Company of the second part, and the former Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company of the third part;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Agreement of 1910&rdquo; means the agreement made on the 7th day of July, 1910, between the Northern Railway Company of the first part, the former City of Dublin Steam Packet Company of the second part, and the former <Col N="41" /> Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company formerly the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company of the third part.</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Dublin Junction Railways&rdquo; means the railways constructed under the Dublin Wicklow and Wexford Railway (City of Dublin Junction Railways) Act, 1884.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, as originally framed, Section 51, provided for the continuance of the liabilities and rights of the guarantors of the 4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways guaranteed stock, and made arrangements to give effect to any agreement that might be arrived at between the guarantors for the termination of the arrangement, and, furthermore, provided for the appointment of an arbitrator in the event of such agreement not being made.  Since then, however, discussions have taken place between the parties, and, arising out of these discussions, it is proposed to insert in the Bill this new section in substitution for Section 51, which makes a new arrangement in relation to the City of Dublin Junction Railways.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin Junction Railway was built as a result of the agreement of 1887 which is referred to in the amendment.  That agreement was entered into by the Great Northern Railway Company, the Dublin Steampacket Company, and the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company. The capital of the City of Dublin Junction Railway was £300,000: £50,000 preference stock, £225,000 4 per cent. guaranteed preference stock, £25,000 unguaranteed stock, and there was also an issue of debenture stock.  The dividend upon the guaranteed stock was guaranteed in perpetuity by the three companies: the Great Northern Railway Company, the Dublin Steampacket Company, and the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company, which is now the Great Southern Railways Company.  The City of Dublin Steampacket Company's portion of the guarantee was liquidated by the lodgment in court of £35,000.  The Great Southern Railways Company have completed arrangements for the redemption of the City of Dublin Junction <Col N="42" /> Railways stocks in connection with which other amendments will be moved later.  In the main part, these stocks will be redeemed in cash, and, to a lesser extent, by the exchange of redeemable debentures of the new company.  The unguaranteed stocks were held entirely by the Great Southern Railways Company, and will be cancelled under the provisions of Section 117.  The new arrangement which has been arrived at in consultation with the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Great Northern Railway Company involves the payment by the Great Northern Railway Company to the new company on the 1st January, 1945, of a sum of £8,000, and thereafter the agreements of 1887 and 1910 will cease to have effect, with the exception of certain arrangements which are specifically retained by the wording of the amendment.  These provisions in the amendment relate to the running, by the company, of certain Post Office services over the line, and for reciprocity in regard to the use of rolling stock of the Great Northern Railway Company, and of tolls for haulage.  Until 1942 the guarantors had to make payments every year to enable the dividend upon the guaranteed stock to be paid.  In 1942 there was no call made on the guarantors. Under the old arrangement, however, the guarantors continued to be liable in the event of default, but would be entitled to recover the amount paid by them in respect of their guarantee out of any surplus which might be earned in other years.  The new agreement brings that old arrangement to an end.  The stock will be liquidated and cancelled; the guarantee will cease to be operative, and a sum of £8,000, will be paid by the Great Northern Railway Company as a result of which it will secure release from its liabilities under the agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 114:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 60, but in Part II of the Bill, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If any person trespass upon any of the railways of, or worked by, the company, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two pounds.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person is charged with an offence under this section in respect of trespass&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the fact that he had not received a personal warning against trespass shall not be a ground of defence,</P>
      <P>(b)  he shall not, in any case, be convicted of the offence unless the company proves to the satisfaction of the court that, at the date of the trespass, there was affixed, at the station of the company and at the level crossing nearest to the spot where the trespass is alleged to have been committed, a notice (painted on boards or printed, painted or enamelled on enamelled or other iron or any other material) in legible characters warning persons not to trespass on the railways of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  No person lawfully, crossing the railway of the company at any level <Col N="45" /> crossing thereof shall be liable to any fine under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  An offence under this section may be prosecuted by the company.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to make a new and clear provision in relation to trespass upon the company's railways. The position is that each of the companies that were amalgamated into the Great Southern Railways Company had a different law in the matter. That is an undesirable position.  By this amendment the law is made the same for all parts of the company's system.</P>

      <P>Is there any possibility that, say, an adjoining owner to the railway line would be prosecuted for crossing from one field to another or for driving his stock from one field to another?  I take it the Minister does not want to prosecute a farmer who is <i>bona fide</i> working his farm and who in the course of his business has to cross from one side to the other. Under this section, unless posters are displayed all over the place&mdash;and even if they are&mdash;a man might be put to considerable difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 116:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2) (a), at the end of <Col N="47" /> line 26, to add the following words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and shall be a person who in the opinion of the Minister is experienced in transport affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have down a series of amendments dealing with the constitution of the advisory committee.  Our idea is to try to give the public an opportunity of having some representation and some voice in this bureaucratic institution that is autocratically presided over by the Minister, and not by the chairman of the company.  The all-powerful person in this make-up is the Minister himself.  As I pointed out on the last occasion, he has the right to terminate the chairman's office at any time he desires.  If the public have some say in the constitution of the committee, if at any rate, the committee is representative of certain important interests in the country, they may feel, if there is a case to be argued, that someone on that committee holds a watching brief for that particular interest.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister indicated on the last day we were discussing this Bill that he was not prepared to change his views regarding this committee, but I should like to press the Minister to reconsider that matter.  I am not pressing for the selection of the particular bodies I have mentioned in the amendment.  I put them in merely to give the Minister some idea as to the constitution of the committee.  I suggest that he should get a certain number of important bodies to nominate panels, from which the Minister for Agriculture would pick, on the agricultural side, and from which the Minister for Industry and Commerce would pick on the industrial side and that the chairman should have some experience of transport affairs&mdash;although it is indicated in the section that this chairman need not necessarily have any particular qualification&mdash;and that the other members of the board ought to be representative of a particular and special interest in the country.  There is no use in labouring the point further.</P>
    <P>I may say that I think this advisory committee ought not to be merely ornamental.  I think if the House agrees to the constitution of the committee <Col N="48" /> as set out in the Bill it will be more or less ornamental and may very seldom be brought into operation.  It should have a very much more important place in the whole transport machinery.  If it had, we would get away from the idea that is being expressed here, with which I agree, that we are setting up a bureaucratic-autocratic machine and that the public generally will have no means of redress or of airing their grievances except, possibly, by way of Parliamentary Question and we have experience of the fate of Parliamentary Questions. The Minister simply tells the Deputy that he is quite satisfied that the particular machinery that exists is functioning properly and in the interests of the people and that is an end of it.  The advisory committee that we suggest need not necessarily be drawn from the bodies mentioned in the amendment.  These bodies merely occurred to me offhand.  I did not go to any trouble to select the very best bodies that might be suitable for that purpose, but if the Minister were to agree to the principle of the amendment I would be prepared to leave it to himself to select the bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under the Act of 1924 was that the Railway Tribunal was established to deal with all matters affecting the public in relation to transport&mdash;matters of law as well as of administration.  That arrangement was not a success.  The public did not avail of it because of the delay and the cost of taking their sometimes trivial cases to the Railway Tribunal. Even where cases were not trivial they <Col N="49" /> were intimidated by the high legal costs that they were risking, and the delays in getting effective decisions.  It is quite obvious that we have to get away from a position which has been tried and which after nearly 20 years has proved unsuitable to our circumstances. We propose to get away from that by trying out and following the lines indicated by experience.  Experience has shown that, in so far as the Railway Tribunal had judicial functions, they were not of such a character as to require a special court for their discharge.  The proposal is that the judicial functions previously exercised by the Railway Tribunal will be transferred to the High Court.  The High Court can adequately discharge these functions.  In so far as its functions related to administration experience has shown that it was unnecessary. As I stated in the Dáil on a previous occasion in 99 cases out of 100 where adjustments had to be made following representations from trading interests or special localities, adjustments were made by discussion with the officials of the railway company concerned, or by Ministerial representations to the railway company. That procedure not merely involved more expeditious action, but placed the parties concerned under no obligation in respect to costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose in this Bill to abolish the Railway Tribunal, to transfer to the High Court the judicial functions previously exercised by it, and to give to the Minister responsible to the Dáil the administrative functions.  To enable the Minister to discharge the administrative functions properly, it is proposed that he should have the assistance of an advisory committee, that will, where necessary, conduct a public inquiry into matters concerning which an application is made.  There may be applications for reduction of rates, for an alteration in the classification of merchandise, for the provision of additional facilities of a special kind in particular areas or a number of other matters.  Where it is clear that an application is of such a character that an opportunity should be given to other interests that may be adversely affected if the application was granted, to make their case, or to have a <Col N="50" /> general investigation into all the circumstances, the advisory committee will come into the picture and will conduct an inquiry, involving the publication of advertisements relating to the application in the Press, and an invitation to interested parties to come forward and give evidence.  We propose to give the committee the powers of the High Court to require the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents relevant to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>This section relates to the constitution of the advisory committee.  I want the Dáil to understand that it is not intended to be an independent authority.  It is certainly not intended that it should have any existence apart from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is his advisory committee, set up by him to advise him, and any idea that there should be a change of its character into an independent tribunal of any kind, or of constituting it a permanent commission of inquiry, is completely contrary to the idea on which the Bill was founded.  The provision in the Bill relating to the constitution of the committee was framed with that one idea, to give the Minister an advisory committee in whose capacity to advise him he has confidence. It is proposed that he should be free to put on the committee the persons he thinks best suited to act on it, subject to the limitations set out here, that one of the persons whom he appoints must be, in his opinion, experienced in commercial and industrial affairs, one must be a person experienced in labour matters, and the third person must have experience of transport affairs.  I should resist the idea that the committee should be constituted on any basis which would give members of it any functions to discharge, other than to advise the Minister, or which would put them in a position to influence transport policy on matters other than those which may be referred to the committee under various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have a number of amendments dealing with the constitution of the committee, and I want to say in relation to these that none of them should be accepted.  The chairman of the committee should not necessarily be <Col N="51" /> experienced in transport affairs.  He should be experienced in administrative affairs because this committee will deal mainly with questions of administration. That person should be one who had sufficient knowledge of the conduct of business to appreciate the importance to traders, and the significance to the transport organisation of the various applications that might be made affecting conditions of carriage and provision of facilities.  So long as he has on the committee a person who has experience of transport affairs the main qualification we should look for in the chairman is general experience in the administration of a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>An amendment in the names of Deputy Doyle, Deputy Lynch and Deputy McGilligan seeks to require that one of the members of the committee shall have experience of railway administration.  I pointed out that the wording of the section in the Bill requires one of the members of the committee to have experience in transport affairs, and I take it that these Deputies have the idea of placing special significance on railway experience rather than on transport experience.  I would resist that amendment vehemently, if there is behind the amendment the idea that the advisory committee should be given definitely a pro-railway bias or any sort of bias.  That is a wrong idea, and one that the Dáil should not accept.  We can get a person with experience of transport affairs on the committee, but I object to being limited to a choice of persons, whose knowledge and experience of transport affairs were in the conduct of railways.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the persons to be nominated as representative of agriculture and with experience in commercial matters should be chosen from panels submitted by various organisations, is one that I would also be inclined to resist.  We must bear in mind that this committee is an advisory committee appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to advise him, and that consequently he should be free to choose individuals who, in his opinion, are best able to advise him.  It is the Minister who has <Col N="52" /> to bear responsibility for actions, not the committee.  It is the Minister ultimately who has to bear the brunt and to justify those actions.  The committee has no responsibility to anybody but the Minister.  If, on its recommendation, he makes an order which arouses public criticism, it is the Minister has to answer.  If, in spite of recommendations, he refuses to make an order of some importance to the public interest, it is he has to justify his action, and he can neither excuse his action by referring to the recommendation of the committee nor drag the committee into any controversy which may arise on his decision.</P>
    <P>There is another amendment, in the names of Deputies Hughes and Cosgrave, which seeks to debar from membership of the committee a person holding any permanent office under the State.  I may say that, in my opinion, a person holding permanent office under the State would not ordinarily be the type of person whom one would put on an advisory committee of this kind, but I think it would be unwise to put a legal bar against the appointment of such persons in any circumstances whatever.  I can tell Deputies, however, that so far as my intentions have any bearing on their views in this connection, I would not propose to include on the advisory committee which I would appoint to advise me a person holding permanent office under the State.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with amendment No. 124 to Section 61 which proposes to authorise this committee to carry on a sort of roving inquiry into all matters affecting public transport. I think that should not be a function of the committee, and I would strongly resist a proposal that powers in that regard should be given to it.  I know that Deputies have the idea that in this matter there should be some brake on the Minister, that he should be made subject to the supervision of some external authority.  I think they are wrong in that.  In the last resort, it is the Dáil which must be held responsible for policy and it is to the Dáil, and to the Dáil alone, the Minister should be responsible.  Whatever organisation he may set up outside to advise him and to help him to discharge <Col N="53" /> his functions, it would be a wrong position to create in which the Minister could excuse his actions or inactions by referring to the fact that some other body had considered the matter and had advised for or against the course taken.</P>
    <P>This committee is intended to be an advisory committee and it should be nothing else but an advisory committee. I feel that if I were in opposition and this Bill were promoted by another Government, I would strongly support that point of view.  I would strongly resist any attempt to make this committee anything but an advisory committee, because by doing so it would appear to lessen the responsibility of the Minister to the Dáil and that, I think, would be in the long run be undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stressed the point that it is not the intention that this body should be anything more than an advisory committee, that it is not to be an independent authority.  To some extent, I would be in agreement with the Minister, but for one consideration.  He has brought the Railway Tribunal into this argument, and I submit it is very difficult to argue on this section without relating it to the Railway Tribunal and the fact that it is to be abolished.  The Minister has informed the House, and I am sure the information he has given is correct, that the discharge of the functions of the Railway Tribunal was so elaborate and costly that people who had a grievance with regard to freight charges or conditions of carriage invited his Department to intervene and that that intervention invariably brought about a settlement of the matter between the aggrieved party and the carrying company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that that did take place, but what strikes me about it is that the fact that his Department, the railway company and the public felt all the time that behind the intervention of the Department was an independent tribunal to which, as a last resort, they had a right to appeal, influenced the decision of all parties and their will to co-operate and find agreement along certain lines.  The attitude of the individual and of the company <Col N="54" /> might have been vastly different if they had not had at the back of their minds the knowledge that they had the right to appeal to that tribunal at all times.  That essential safeguard was there all the time, and although it might not have been brought into operation very often, the fact that it was there must have influenced to a very great extent the anxiety to reach a settlement.  Remove that, and the whole situation completely changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us an assurance that it is not his intention to appoint a public servant to this committee, but he has suggested that it would be very undesirable to have a legal bar against the appointment of a public servant.  We are legislating not merely for the Minister's term of office, but for his successors' terms of office as well, and what I regard as objectionable is the putting of a politician in a position in which he will decide freight charges as between individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any allegation of undue preference would be dealt with by the High Court, and not by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but it may be an obscure case of which the High Court or the Dáil might never hear. That is why I am anxious to put this committee in a position to initiate inquiries on their own.  I am not making any allegation, or suggesting that the Minister might follow that undesirable practice, but we are providing machinery which is left open to an abuse of this sort, and I do not think the House should agree to it.  We ought to put in the necessary safeguards to ensure that such machinery will not be abused.  My answer to the Minister's point with regard to his Department being used is that the Railway Tribunal was there all the time, and those engaged in the settling of any dispute or in the adjustment of any freight charges, had always in their minds the knowledge that there was a definite safeguard provided for by the appointment of an independent judge who would give an impartial decision on a case argued by an individual or group of individuals who wanted more favourable terms, and the defence argued on behalf of the company.  Although the <Col N="55" /> Department was invited to intervene, that knowledge definitely influenced the decisions made.  Remove that machinery which gives an independent judicial decision and there is a completely different picture.</P>
      <P>I disagree profoundly with the Minister on some of the fundamental principles involved here.  As I say, I do not suggest that the Minister will indulge in any of the objectionable practices to which I refer, but there is a responsibility on the Minister and on the House to put in the necessary safeguards, so that the public mind will be satisfied that whatever decisions are come to by the Minister are open to investigation by an independent body and so that there can be no innuendo to the effect that a partial decision has been given by any Minister.  I put it to the Minister that it is desirable in his own interest that some machinery of the sort should be provided.  That is the big issue which has agitated my mind.  If the Minister is not prepared to give way, he at least ought to look into it and provide some machinery which will satisfy the public that strictly impartial decisions are given by him.  Under this proposal, a very big and heavy responsibility is thrown on the Minister to exercise strict impartiality. The Minister knows as well as I do the suggestions which can be made in that respect, but if he puts in the necessary safeguards, the matter will be beyond doubt or question.  It would be in the interests of transport and of the individual himself for the time being and the person who will occupy his position later, that we should put in that safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point arising out of a remark made by Deputy Hughes which appeared to indicate a misunderstanding of the general scheme of the Bill. It is not intended that the Minister will exercise any judicial function or determine between one individual and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Maximum charges. That is the fundamental distinction <Col N="56" /> between this Bill and the 1924 Act. The 1924 Act set up a railway tribunal with power to determine standard charges and the railway company was required to charge these standard charges.  It could only alter the standard charges with the permission of the tribunal, except to the extent of the percentage mentioned in the Bill. That is all gone.  That old machinery is being done away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not anticipate that the maximum charges will not always operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position under the Act of 1924 is that the standard charges never operated.  The company never could charge the standard charges, and the business of the tribunal was concerned with applications by the company for permission to charge less than the standard charges.  They had to apply to the tribunal for that purpose, because that was the scheme in the 1924 Act.  We are getting away from that.  We are providing maximum charges.  The company may charge below the maximum but, if they do alter the rates to bring them below the maximum rates in respect of any class of goods, the new rates will apply to everybody.  There can be no discrimination between one individual and another.  There is a certain amendment which I shall move later relating to flat rates which must be borne in mind in that connection. But the scheme of standard charges and exceptional charges relating to standard charges, which was an integral part of the 1924 plan, is being abolished completely.  We are getting a simplified system of charges based upon certain principles.  One is that the public authority, namely, the Minister, can prescribe the maximum charges; that whatever charges are in operation must be equally available to everybody, so that there can be no discrimination between one individual and another.  That is the whole scheme of the Bill and it is quite simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters with which this committee will deal are entirely different. It will relate the maximum charges to the classifications, because the class into which a particular <Col N="57" /> commodity is put will determine the charges to be made for the transportation of that commodity.  There are frequent disputes between the company and the trader as to the proper classification of a commodity, and these matters could be referred to the Minister and settled in accordance with this procedure.  There are questions as to the facilities given, as to whether goods are dangerous goods and properly classified and charged for as such, the reasonableness of the charges made for some accommodation afforded other than transport, the facilities afforded for the expeditious conveyance of perishable goods, and the general question of the adequacy of the transport facilities provided in any area.  There are other matters which I could mention, but it is this type of general matter which will be referred to the Minister and may be referred by him to the advisory committee.  Whatever decisions are arrived at following an application of that kind will be implemented in Orders, and these Orders will be effective not merely for the benefit of the applicant on whose initiative the Order was made, but for every user of the transport company's system.  If there is any question of law, of undue preference, upon which a judicial decision is required, the application goes to the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to every possible aspect of it except the one which would concern me more than the others.  Where the carrying company, under the 1924 Act, apply for permission to operate a charge less than the standard charge, that is obviously all right and the public will be quite satisfied with that.  What I am concerned with is where a representative of the public, an individual or a group of individuals, want to object to the railway company's charging a maximum charge and where they feel that the maximum charge is too high.  To give an example.  There was a controversy recently about the freight charges for beet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a bad example to take because the actual charge in operation is 40 or 50 per cent. below the standard charge. </P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is a bad example or a good example, so far as the maximum or standard charge is concerned.  I know it is a good example from the point of view of people who want to get beet carried. So far as the standard charges are concerned, if we had a board constituted somewhat on the lines I suggest, the agricultural community anyway would feel that they had some say in the selection of that board.  They would feel confident that their representative's arguments and his interest in trying to secure favourable conditions for them would satisfy the public that their interests were properly looked after and safeguarded.  That is the reason why I suggest to the Minister that he might think of constituting a board on the lines I suggest.  He would get the different organisations to put up a panel from which the Minister for Agriculture would pick individuals and a panel on the other side from which the Minister for Industry and Commerce would pick individuals. I had some experience some years ago of going before the Railway Tribunal on the question of freight charges for beet and beet pulp and I felt we got every opportunity of arguing our case and that the decision arrived at was a strictly impartial decision on the case made and defended. The machinery may be costly or unwieldy from the administrative point of view, but it struck me that that sort of machinery would satisfy the public that they were getting a strictly impartial and fair decision so far as the fixation of charges, the carrying conditions, etc., were concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, some of these amendments in the names of Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cosgrave seek to give some voice to certain organised sections of the community in getting representation on this advisory committee.  So far as that is the idea, I support it and I support Deputy Hughes' idea that it may be desirable to alter the terms of this amendment if the Minister thinks fit.  The Minister has been very strong on the point that, since this is an advisory committee, he should definitely select his <Col N="59" /> advisers, so to speak.  I do not think he has established a case for that, because this is an advisory committee, it has not executive powers, and the Minister is not absolutely bound to accept the advice which it gives.  The Minister for Agriculture, for example, has a number of advisory committees and, particularly, there is the Consultative Agricultural Council, the members of which are not selected by the Minister, but are appointed by independent bodies.  He is not absolutely bound to accept their advice, and he would not be bound in this case.  I think the Minister would benefit by independent advice, and so would the sections of the community which seek representations through these amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not advert to the fact that since this section was drafted there was presented to the Government a very important report by the Vocational Organisation Commission, which suggested the setting up of a body with functions somewhat similar to those envisaged in this section. The Vocational Organisation Commission advocated the setting up of a transport council and they suggested that various interests should be represented on that council.  They suggested, too, that the bigger sections of the transport industry should be represented&mdash;the railways, the roads, private road users, users of public transport, shipping companies; in fact, all people engaged in public transport. They also suggested, as in Deputy Hughes' amendment, that the agricultural community should have direct representation on that council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that such a recommendation has been made, I think the Minister should take it seriously into consideration and if he cannot accept this amendment, he should make some provision for the acceptance, at a later stage, of the suggestions contained in the commission's recommendations.  I know the commission's recommendations are more or less conditional upon a certain amount of preliminary organisation taking place before the transport council can be constituted. I think, however, that some provision should be made in this legislation for <Col N="60" /> the ultimate acceptance of a transport council such as is envisaged, a council which could take the place of the narrower committee which the Minister advocates, or which is implied in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that what the public want is cheap, efficient transport both of themselves and their goods.  I take it that under the Bill the Minister is endeavouring to secure that an efficient transport system will be established.  In relation to portion of that transport system the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have certain responsibilities, certain functions to perform.  In the performance of these functions he will require advice.  I think the Minister is sufficiently experienced to realise that very often subordinates, particularly if they are associated with a person for any length of time, will attempt to give to their superior some advice which they think will be acceptable to him.  Very often the advice given in such circumstances might be wrong advice, certainly advice which would be less suitable to the circumstances than the advice which would be rendered by people in an independent capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section sets out that the advisory committee shall be composed of certain people selected by the Minister, and also by the Minister for Agriculture. They will be people who, in the opinion of the Minister, are experienced in commercial and industrial affairs and, in the case of the Minister for Agriculture, the person selected will be experienced in agricultural matters.  The reason why we put down this amendment, or this group of amendments, is to ensure that the Minister will have some chance of getting advice from people other than hand-picked individuals whom the Minister is nearly certain or will be partially forced to pick under the Bill as it stands.  The organisations which we have suggested were suggested at random or, at any rate, to the extent that they appear to be the ones best suited for the position; but there is nothing sacrosanct about them.  If the Minister has other bodies or organisations <Col N="61" /> which might be better suited for the position, we would be quite willing to accept them.</P>
    <P>The organisations we have suggested have, in one case, a connection with the agricultural community and, in another case, with the business community. They will be concerned with the welfare of the people from whom they are drawn.  From the Minister's statement it appears to me that he wants a person upon whom he can rely. He says that in the last resort he will have to bear the responsibility.  I believe the Minister will be far better prepared to bear the responsibility if the advice he receives is sound advice, not alone from the actual section concerned but viewed from the general transport position.  I suggest the Minister should select people who would be independent rather than hand-picked. I do not know whether the Minister has any particular scheme in mind, but under the Bill he can go to the Civil Service and pick an individual, though he says that that is not likely.  On the other hand, he may pick a person and, having experience of what Governments may do, I believe there might be a tendency to pick a political supporter, some person who wants a job.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals we have made there is an effort to find some impartial body, or to give representation on this body in an impartial manner in order to ensure that, so far as the public are concerned, they will be advised in their own interests and not merely in the interests of the Minister or the Civil Service or the State.  The real flaw in this Bill is that the Minister comes into it too much, fixing fares and freight charges.  Although there are maximum charges, the position is that ultimately the Minister can decide what he is going to fix as a maximum charge, and he may fix a maximum charge far out of proportion to whatever commodities may reach. There will be a tendency all the time that the company, in close contact with the Minister, may charge excessively for the transport of commodities, whereas if an independent body were available, it might ensure a lower rate of charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Transport might be better managed if it were run in an independent fashion rather than be all the time subject to State interference.  You have, on the one hand, a chairman nominated by the Government to look after the interests of the public.  Possibly that is desirable, but I assume that one person would be sufficient to look after the interests of the public without having the Minister directing him and very often, unless the advice is sound, misdirecting him, maybe from political motives, but at any rate subject to political pressure at any time.  If the Minister draws his nominees from semi-State appointments or semi-Civil Service positions, there will be an obvious tendency to depart from practical experience and you will find the Minister advised merely from one point of view, possibly with no relation to the actual requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prolonging the Debate, I want to say in connection with Deputy Cosgrave's fears that, with the possible exception of the maximum charges to be prescribed and the facilities to be afforded in particular areas, I cannot see any political interest of any kind associated with any of the questions which would be referred to this committee.  I think it is inevitable that the Minister will have no preconceived ideas one way or the other, and will be completely indifferent as to the recommendation which the committee will make.  The classification of the merchandise, the decision as to what are dangerous goods, the amount to be charged for terminal services, the articles which may be conveyed as passengers' luggage, the merchandise on which charges may be based on cubic capacity instead of on weight, the charges to be made by the company for the use of trucks where transportation by truck is not part of the contract&mdash;those are the questions which arise there.  They are questions of general administration, upon which a decision has to be taken by somebody, and where the special commercial interests of the company may come in conflict with the public interest.  It is for that reason the Minister is brought in, but the Minister's decision will be based on the facts, and I think it is <Col N="63" /> extremely improbable in any of those cases that he will have any interest other than getting a workable and fair arrangement&mdash;an arrangement fair both to the company and to the users of the services provided.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan has referred to the recommendations of the Vocational Commission.  That commission has criticised the trend in legislation here.  Instead of preserving the public authority, we are inclined to hand things over to Civil Service bureaucratic control.  That is the whole trend in legislation here.  The Minister is aware of the fact that the Vocational Commission has severely criticised that trend.  We are here as public representatives, and we should ensure that the authority of the people is preserved.  The amendments put down by us here strive to achieve that end.  They seek to ensure, in the transport machinery which we are providing here in this Bill, that some authority will be preserved to the people; that we will have some sort of representative control there, in the form of a board constituted on different <Col N="65" /> lines from what the Minister has suggested. Mind you, the board will not be complete and absolute, because the Minister can still reject the advice given by them, but they should be a little bit more independent than the Minister has envisaged in the Bill. They should be free to initiate inquiries or investigations which they feel may be necessary and desirable.</P>

    <P>There is a series of amendments here in the name of Deputy McGilligan, designed to substitute the High Court for the Railway Tribunal.  We have argued that principle a good deal here on the other amendments.  I have not discussed this matter with Deputy McGilligan, but his point of view seems clear.  We do not like the type of machine that puts a politician&mdash;if the Minister will permit me to describe him as such; I am sure he will&mdash;in a position to give decisions of this sort. The public may feel very uneasy about such decisions, in dealing with such important matters as the fixing of freight charges, the conditions for the carriage of goods, and matters of that sort, functions which were carried out by the tribunal, leaving out judicial decisions that are under this Bill being transferred to the High Court.  The Minister is not the proper person to exercise those functions, which should be exercised and controlled by a completely <Col N="69" /> independent body, so that the public can rest assured of strictly impartial decisions.  The High Court is an absolutely independent body and the public will feel sure of strictly impartial decisions on the cases made by an individual or a group of individuals seeking an adjustment in any charge. So far as the carrying company is concerned, in their defence of existing freight charges, it is a body like the High Court which should function in that case and not the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever case there may be against the Minister doing the work, I think the High Court would be a most inappropriate body.  It could not reasonably be expected to discharge functions of a non-legal character, as is proposed here.  The arrangement proposed in the Bill may not be the very best way, but the amendment which is proposed as a substitute for it is almost the worst. The idea in 1924 was to get a specialised tribunal, which would make a particular study of the problem and be in a position to give a competent opinion upon questions brought before it; but that tribunal related to a particular scheme of organisation which has now been abandoned.  I should say the High Court would be a most inappropriate body.  It is extremely appropriate to deal with legal questions, and all legal questions are, in fact, being referred to it under the Bill.  The only questions which are not being referred to it and which were formally discharged by the Railway Tribunal are the non-legal questions, on which the High Court would not be competent to offer an opinion at all.</P>

      <P>That has been the argument&mdash;that intervention in the Department settled the vast majority of cases.  I agree that that is so, but I think the fact that there was an <Col N="70" /> independent tribunal there influenced the minds of everyone concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That whole scheme&mdash; not merely the tribunal, but the whole scheme of which the tribunal was a part&mdash;is now being abolished.  There is no longer the question of standard charges and special charges; there is only the question of maximum charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But maximum charges may be standard charges.  So far as the operation of the company is concerned, in practice it will work out that the maximum charge fixed by the Minister will become the standard charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to get a simple classification of goods and a simple system of maximum charges in relation to each class.  This is entirely different from the old system, which produced 200,000 special charges&mdash;a most complicated system, where no one could tell the cost of transportation or what should have been charged for particular commodities.  Even the railway company was not always able to ascertain the position properly, and an enormous amount of staff work was required before anyone could even tell the proper charge for the carriage of certain goods.  That system, which produced 200,000 special charges, is being discarded completely and a simple system of standard classifications and maximum charges is being introduced, with the overriding provision that if an alteration takes place in the actual charges below the maximum it must apply to all transport users.  The Minister only comes in in the definition of the classification and the fixing of the maximum charges. The individual will be given every opportunity to ascertain the cost at which his goods can be transported and, if he has any reason to believe that the company is acting unfairly to him, he has an appeal to the courts.</P>

Publication of the proposals is required and the matter may be referred to the advisory committee.

      <P>I move amendment No. 172:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 94, and in Chapter VII of Part IV, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a transport undertaker agrees with a trader for the carriage of any of his merchandise at certain rates and subject to certain conditions (which said rates and conditions are in this section referred to as agreed charges), and</P>
      <P>(b)  the agreed charges are, on the application of the transport undertaker, approved by the Minister under this section,</P>
      <P>then, so long as the agreed charges are operative, the transport undertaker may, notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding Chapters of this Part or in any other enactment, make as respect the trader the agreed charges.</P>
      <P>(2)  The following provisions shall apply in relation to an application to the Minister for his approval of agreed charges, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the application shall contain particulars of the agreed charges,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the applicant shall publish, in accordance with the directions of the Minister, notice of the application and particulars as to the time and manner in which objections may be made to the Minister in respect of the application by any <Col N="82" /> traders who consider that their businesses will be detrimentally affected if the Minister approves of the agreed charges and the agreed charges are made,</P>
    <P>(c)  The Minister may, if he thinks fit, refer the application to the advisory committee for their report,</P>
    <P>(d)  the Minister, after consideration of the application, any objections duly made in relation to the application, and, in case he has referred the application to the advisory committee, their report and advice, may, subject to paragraph (e) of this sub-section, approve or refuse to approve of the agreed charges,</P>
    <P>(e)  the Minister shall not approve of the agreed charges unless he is satisfied that they represent a reasonable commutation of the rates and charges otherwise ordinarily applicable to the applicant's carryings of the merchandise of the trader concerned.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the Minister approves of agreed charges he shall fix the date on which they are to come into operation and the period for which they are to remain in operation, and the agreed charges shall come into operation accordingly and shall remain in operation only for the period so fixed unless continued for any further period or periods by the Minister who is hereby authorised in that behalf.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where agreed charges as between a transport undertaker and a trader have been approved by the Minister, the Minister may, on his own initiative or on the application made, within 12 months after such approval, by any other trader who satisfies the Minister that the applicant's business has been detrimentally affected by the agreed charges and after considering any representations made by the transport undertaker and in case he has referred (which he is hereby authorised to do) the application to the advisory committee, their report and advice, by order fix on the same basis as the agreed charges the charges (including the conditions to be attached <Col N="83" /> thereto) to be made by the transport undertaker for the carriage of such merchandise of the applicant as the Minister may determine, and shall by the order fix the period (which shall not exceed that for which the agreed charges are to remain in operation) during which the order is to remain in operation, and such order shall authorise, notwithstanding anything contained in the previous Chapters of this Part or in any other enactment, and oblige the transport undertaker to make while the order is in force charges for the carriage of merchandise of the applicant in accordance with the terms of the order.</P>
    <P>(5)  The transport undertaker concerned shall cause particulars of any agreed charges or charges fixed by order under sub-section (4) of this section to be available for public inspection at the head office of the transport undertaker and such other places as the Minister may require.</P>
    <P>(6)  If a transport undertaker fails to comply with sub-section (5) of this section the transport undertaker shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding five pounds for every day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section the expression &ldquo;transport undertaker&rdquo; means any body being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a railway company,</P>
    <P>(b)  the company, or</P>
    <P>(c)  a canal undertaker.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to agreed rates or, as they might be more appropriately described, flat rates.  The provisions which we are proposing to insert here are similar to, though not identical with, those contained in the British Act of 1933 which are used extensively in Great Britain.  However, they differ quite considerably from the uniform rates for which provision was made in the Railways Act, 1933.  These rates were never applied except for a <Col N="84" /> short period in respect of turf.  That was not a very satisfactory experience. These proposals will, probably, apply to large traffics such as sugar and cement and commodities of that kind which are compact and of uniform quality.  The operation of such charges would, probably, be attractive to companies engaged in the manufacture of goods of that kind, because they would enable them to dispense with a great deal of book-keeping and would facilitate the maintenance of uniform prices throughout the country.  From the point of view of the operator of transport services, it has always been difficult to make good the flat rate charges on the shorter mileages.  They are availed of on the longer mileages but, on the shorter mileages, they were not availed of and the goods went by road. The purpose of the amendment is to permit of agreed charges of that kind even though, on the shorter mileages, the charges may work out higher than the maximum under other provisions of the Bill relating to charges.  The agreed charges must be submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and there is specific provision that he must not approve unless he is satisfied that they represent a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; commutation of the rates and charges otherwise ordinarily applicable to the applicants' carryings of the merchandise of the trader concerned&rdquo;. In other words, it is intended that, even though the charge per mile may be higher than the maximum over the shorter distances and much below the maximum over the longer distances, on the average they should represent the same charge per mile as the maximum charges in operation in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to experiments along these lines when it was arranged that turf should be carried at a standard rate of 6/per ton from any part of the country. About a year or 18 months after that, when an application was before the Railway Tribunal for a continuance of that charge, the case was made that that charge of 6/- might be reduced to 4/-, with certain zoning arrangements. I should like to know whether the Minister has, with the Minister for Agriculture, gone into any aspect of the policy <Col N="85" /> involved or whether this is simply a permissive provision, without any consideration of policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, when speaking on this Bill, I was dealing with the effect that the Bill would have on local finances. When one makes a comparison of this Bill with the 1936 Act, one finds that a great financial responsibility or liability has been placed on the various county councils throughout the country.  Under the 1936 Act, rents were reduced by 25 per cent., and I think I pointed out, on the last occasion, that the county councils had still to arrange their balance sheets in regard to the payments that were outstanding on loans advanced for the erection of those cottages.  Now, if this Bill passes the House, becomes an Act, and is put into operation, it will mean that the rents of these cottages will be reduced by a further 25 per cent.  If that can be done, without imposing any extra burden on the finances of the county councils, well and good; but as I said on the last occasion, I am a member of the Louth County Council, and I cannot see why the baby of financing this Bill, if it becomes law, as we have been financing the Act of 1936, should be passed over to us.  Of course, I realise that the farmers' annuities have been halved, and the money that used to go across the water is now being retained here; but that is a very different thing.  That whole matter is arranged through the central authority, but in this case the finances are going to be arranged through the county councils.  Take the case of Louth, for instance.  Roughly speaking, <Col N="86" /> I think that in County Louth we have something like 1,600 cottages, of which 1,000 were built prior to 1922. The remainder were built since 1922. One can readily see at a glance what extra burden, if the rents are to be further reduced, that will place on our finances.  These moneys were to be paid into the Exchequer in order to pay off this loan.  So far as the farmers are concerned, there was a reduction of 50 per cent. in the amount of their annuities, and that money has been held here in this country, instead of being sent across the water.  Now, the argument, from the point of view of the agricultural labourer is this: Why, if the farmers get a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities, should we not also get a reduction in our rents? I think that from the point of view of ordinary equity and justice, there should be a similar reduction there, and I also think that the amount payable by the various county councils should be reduced to an equal extent &mdash;that is, 25 per cent.  If this Bill passes into law, then the amount of our repayments may be reduced by something like 50 per cent.  That is what it will amount to if this Bill becomes law, and I would ask the Minister to make a full statement in connection with this matter of the payment of outstanding loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see, of course, the great value of the building of cottages for agricultural labourers, but I want that question to be related to the cost of the erection of those cottages now, as compared with a few years ago.  I also want the Minister and the House to bear in mind the rents to be charged for these cottages, which, it seems to me, would require a payment of about 90 per cent. by the State.  At the present moment, the rent of these cottages would amount to 4/- or 5/- a week, and I cannot visualise Pat Murphy, let us say, paying 4/- or 5/a week when he realises that his neighbour, across the road, is getting a cottage for about 9d. a week.  That is the situation that exists at the moment, and there is no getting away from it.  That is the kind of thing with which public bodies in this country will be confronted when it comes to a question of the provision of <Col N="87" /> houses for agricultural labourers, who have no houses at the moment, and who are anxiously waiting for them. It will not be an enviable position for any public body to be in.  It is a situation that will create difficulties, not alone for this House, but for every public body in the country.</P>
    <P>Take the case of cottages that, in or about 1923, were built at a cost of £120 or £130.  There was an appreciable rise in costs of building after 1922, and I have no doubt that after this emergency the cost of building such a cottage will amount to anything from £400 to £450.  In addition to that, the tendency will be to ask for better houses and better accommodation in these cottages, to suit the agricultural labourer and his family.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to this question of a loan and the section of the Bill dealing with the matter of succession, or what the tenant of the cottage will do with his cottage, the provisions in that regard were rather vague in the 1933 and 1936 Acts, and I am afraid that that question will also be rather vague so far as this Bill is concerned, if it is passed into law.  I suppose it may be assumed that, to all intents and purposes, the tenant of such a cottage is its absolute owner, although it may take some years to pay off the loan that was granted for the purchase of the cottage.  I think that, legally, it is held that such a tenant is the absolute owner of that cottage.  That was so, although I admit that it was left rather vague under the 1936 Act. It appears to me now, however, that there is a provision in this new Bill which seeks to change that, affecting the right of the owner of a cottage to will, give or pass on to his lawful successors the ownership of that cottage. I understand that, under the old Act, the man concerned could even will his cottage to a millionaire, although he might not actually be the owner of the cottage at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they must give good reasons for withholding their consent, and although the Bill states that the person concerned must be an agricultural labourer and resident in that cottage, he can go out and get work with a farmer and stay there. That is my opinion, and I may say that it is the opinion of certain men who, by profession, are entitled to give an opinion on this matter.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have the words &ldquo;lawful successor&rdquo;, which again deal with the question of relative. I would like to have a definition of the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in the 1936 Act.  &ldquo;Relative&rdquo; could mean anybody living in the house of the cottage owner.  It might be, as we say, a thirty-first cousin who had returned from America or England.  Under the law a man can will his house to anyone he likes, and that person will be his lawful successor.  In fact, the lawful successor need not be an agricultural labourer at all; he could be a man of means.  But, while the man of means might, in such circumstances, get the cottage, the genuine agricultural labourer who was possibly waiting for it cannot get it and may have to wait for years until a new cottage is built for him.</P>
      <P>The more one studies these Acts the more bewildered one becomes.  The 1936 Act was rushed through before an election.  At the time we had people with glib tongues going through the country telling the agricultural labourers that they were going to get houses for nothing.  I do not know if that was good from the moral point of view, but it certainly was done. Now, they are going one better, and saying that they are going to get their rents down to 9d.  When the time comes for fixing the rents of the new cottages there will be a lot of sport in the country, I think, over all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all that can be done, well and good, but, as a public representative, I would be slow to favour anything that would impose any extra burden on the financial resources of the people in the various counties.  We must also relate this to what our future plans will be.  It is being said that we are considering great schemes of reorganisation <Col N="89" /> for the building of houses and hospitals, and for drainage.  These schemes are all very good in their own way, but they all tend, in the ultimate, to increase the rates, including the rates which agricultural labourers will have to pay for the cottages they occupy.  That is the difficulty that I feel in considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was argued by Deputy Norton and others that the reason why so few people took advantage of the 1936 Act was that the terms in it were not favourable.  I think they were not bad, and in support of that I point to the fact that over 550 tenants in the County Louth thought the terms so favourable that they were induced to make application to become owners of their cottages.  I think that a great many more tenants will do the same. I have no objection to this Bill, nor had I to the 1936 Act.  What I do ask is that the Government should take over the baby and not be handing it on to the county councils.  We on the county councils have enough trouble under these Acts as regards the cost of vesting.  The Minister has pointed out the great difficulty there is in the matter of proving title.  The average cost of vesting, in the case of these cottages, runs from £2 to £3 per cottage.  If you multiply 60,000 cottages by £2 or £3, the cost of vesting runs into a very big figure.  In my view, that money could be more profitably spent in other ways.  A lot of it goes in coming up to Dublin and searching through musty files to try to get title for those plots.  We all know that it is very difficult to prove title in the case of some of these cottage plots.  The Minister told the House that some of these cottages had been built for 40 years.  Under the old-fashioned system, a farmer probably gave a bit of land for the building of the cottage, and there was no trouble taken at the time about title.  The cottage was built.  But now we have engineers going around measuring up and trying to trace these bits of land on maps, so that the whole thing is becoming very costly so far as the county councils are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no analogy whatever between these Labourers Acts and the <Col N="90" /> annuities which are the concern of the central authority.  I am, naturally, sympathetic with the position in which agricultural labourers find themselves to-day.  Yet I must relate this Bill, and the previous Acts, to the future, especially as regards the building of cottages and the rents at which they can be let, and compare those rents with present rents.  The man who cannot pay 1/- or 9d. a week for a cottage cannot pay anything.  If men are not able to do that, then it certainly is no great tribute to the economic position in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>We have then the question of repairs. Even when the cottages are vested under the 1936 Act their repair is still the responsibility of the county council.  Let us suppose that a cottage is owned by a poor widow who is living in the house by herself.  If the roof is blown off in a storm and she has not the means to do the repairs, the county council is bound to do them under the 1936 Act.  I presume the same will apply under this Bill.  If the county council is not able to recover the cost of the repairs in court, the most it can do is to add a little extra per week to the rent.  I could quote numerous examples where it would be utterly impossible for poor tenants, such as a widow or an old man living alone in a cottage, to meet the costs of repairs.  The county council will have to do them and then try, as best it can, to recover the cost from the tenant.  But how can one expect to recover from people who may have no means except perhaps 5/- per week outdoor relief?  They may not have even the old age pension.</P>
    <P>These Bills are all right on paper, but when they are put into operation the provisions in them present great difficulties to the officials and members of county councils.  When the county managers are preparing their estimates of rates they have to make provision for a sum to meet the deficiencies arising under various cottage schemes. The county manager has to get the money.  That is the position that the county councils find themselves in at the moment.  In view of the fact that there is practical unanimity amongst all members of the House and the people of the country on the question <Col N="91" /> that anything that can be done should be done to better the position of the agricultural labourers, I cannot see why the responsibility should devolve on the Leader of the Labour Party or of any other minority Party in this House to introduce a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>I think that should be the duty of the Government, and I think that if they were to do it they would have the support of all Parties.  I do not think it is a correct procedure&mdash;and in saying this I mean no offence to Deputy Norton&mdash;for the leader or members of any minority Party in the House to introduce a Bill of this type, and then hand it over to the Government to have it put into operation.  I think that, before such a thing is done, the matter should have careful consideration. I am prepared to do anything I can to uplift the agricultural labourer, but as a public representative, as a member of the Louth County Council, I do not think it is fair or just that the county councils should have to carry the added financial responsibility that will be imposed on them when this Bill becomes law.  To a lesser extent, the same responsibility was put on public bodies by the 1936 Act.  When the rents were reduced by 25 per cent., our repayments of the loan charges were not proportionately reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech which we have just listened to from Deputy Coburn is the sort of speech which I should have thought would have been made by the mover of the resolution to give this Bill a Second Reading.  It was a speech which indicated the difficulties which are embedded in this problem.  He pointed out the very serious considerations which would have to be taken into account before effect could be given to the provisions of this Bill. Unfortunately, until Deputy Coburn spoke, the House was left under a very grave disadvantage.  The mover of the resolution to give the Bill a Second Reading took no pains at all to inform the House as to the real content of the <Col N="92" /> measure, or the scope of the proposals. And yet this Bill is not a simple Bill.  It does not deal with trifles.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill affect valuable properties, numbering almost 62,000 cottages, representing an original capital investment of almost £11,000,000.  The properties, of course, to-day are worth considerably more than that.  They are properties which belong to the ratepayers, to the local authorities.  They are properties which have been built for the purpose of ameliorating the living conditions of a very large class of our population.  If full effect were given to the provisions of the 1936 Act, which has already become law, the result would be to transfer from the community to private individuals the ownership of these properties. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is not in issue at the moment.  What is in issue is whether equity and justice will be done as between one section of the community and the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill were to become law, the effect would be, within a very brief period, to strip the local authorities of all the assets which arise out of this original investment of £11,000,000 and to leave them a considerable burden of liabilities.  Surely, if the leader of a Party with a social programme puts a proposal of that kind before the House, we should hear a reasoned speech in support of that proposal. Yet I would refer any Deputy who is listening to me now, and was not listening to Deputy Norton, to read the report of his speech in introducing this Bill, when it appears in the Parliamentary Debates, and he will not find in that speech one factual statement in support of this Bill.  All that was said by the Leader of the Labour Party in support of the Bill was that it was designed to reduce the heavy burdens now imposed on the tenants. He said nothing of the additional burdens which would be imposed upon the already burdened ratepayers, ratepayers who, we are told by members of Clann na Talmhan, by members of the Fine Gael Party and by members of the Labour Party, are already overburdened. We will find on the Order Paper motions, in the names of responsible <Col N="93" /> members of Clann na Talmhan, urging the State, urging the central authority and urging the general body of the community, to accept responsibility for burdens which are already imposed by law upon the ratepayers as a section of the community.</P>
    <P>If there is any justification for the proposals that are contained in this Bill, if the contention is that the ratepayers as a body are in a position to accept the additional burdens which the provisions of this measure would impose upon them if it became law, what justification is there for the resolutions which will shortly come before this House asking us to relieve the ratepayers of burdens which they are already called upon to bear? These people cannot have it both ways. If the ratepayers are unable to bear the cost of the roads, if they are unable to bear the cost of the mental hospitals, if they are unable to bear the cost of providing additional houses for the people, what justification is there for saddling them with the additional burdens which the provisions of this Bill would impose upon them?</P>
    <P>We had better look at these proposals in a realistic way.  There is no justification for getting up here and making vote-catching speeches.  We all of us must realise that the exigencies of the past five years, the need to maintain ourselves free and at peace, have involved this State in heavy commitments, commitments which will have to be discharged during and within the next 20 or 30 years, commitments which will have to be met each year out of taxation until they have been redeemed.</P>
    <P>To build the 60,000 cottages, which would be affected by this Bill, the local authorities and the State between them have already accepted a liability for capital sums amounting almost to £11,000,000.  When these cottages were built, there was an understanding that the cost of them would be borne by three interests, by the tenants, by the local authorities and by the State.  In order to meet the view that it would be socially advantageous if tenants of existing cottages were enabled to become owners the Act of 1936 was passed; it <Col N="94" /> enabled any tenant of a cottage who fulfilled the qualifying conditions of the Act to become the owner ultimately of any cottage in fee simple by the payment of a very modest annuity. The conditions prescribed assured to the tenant purchaser who was then paying rent an immediate reduction of cash payment of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases, and in the case of over 40,000 of the cottages, the weekly rent averaged 1/2.  Under the provisions of the schemes which have been approved since 1936, instead of a weekly rent of 1/2 which did not give the tenant one tittle of ownership in the house in which he resided, he is in the fortunate position, if he has applied to purchase his cottage, and if vested, of having an immediate reduction of 25 per cent. in the weekly payment of 1/2.  Instead of paying a rent of 1/2 he pays a terminable annuity of 10½d. which, in the course of time will make him the owner of the cottage in fee simple.  Surely it cannot be contended that a scheme which gives to the tenant an immediate reduction of that sort is unfair or unjust to him.  At the same time, his purchase increases the obligations of local authorities.  Bear that in mind.  Of course when that reduction was given the local authority had to accept increased responsibility for meeting the charges on the loans.  In circumstances such as these, no person can reasonably contend that that scheme was unfair or unjust to the tenant or imposed onerous burdens on him.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Norton, however, it is reasonable to say that a proposal which gives a tenant of a house an immediate reduction of 25 per cent. in cash payments is unfair and unjust. I think if most of us could to-morrow enter into an agreement to purchase our houses upon terms which would enable us to secure an immediate reduction of one-fourth in our cash outgoings, we certainly would not regard such a scheme as unfair or unjust, or imposing a heavy burden upon us.  In that connection we must also remember that the houses which are being purchased under the 1936 Act have considerably appreciated in value since they were built.  If you wanted to buy a <Col N="95" /> house equivalent to one of these cottages to-morrow, you would pay very much more than £180 or £200 for it. These are the houses, 40,000 of them, that under the conditions of the 1936 Act, can be bought out for a payment of 10½d. a week, for as short a period, in some cases, as eight or nine years, but, in no case, running for longer than 29 years, even in the case of houses built immediately prior to 1923.  The majority of our people are reasonable and fair minded and notwithstanding the statements which we hear from the Labour Party, few of them are going to accept the contention of Deputy Norton that the terms which have been approved of in a purchase scheme covering 58,000 of these cottages under the 1936 Act are unfair or unjust to the tenants.  So much for Deputy Norton.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy's case for the Bill was even more extraordinary.  He said plainly that he did not believe in this purchase scheme at all, that he thought it much better for these houses to remain the property of local authorities. There might be something to be said for that view.  At least, we know this, that as long as the houses remain the property of local authorities they are likely to be available for the class of people for whom they are built.  That is another issue with which we are not concerned at this stage.  I think Deputy Coburn is one who takes Deputy Murphy's point of view.  So insincere and such a sham is the whole of this agitation for a reduction in the annuity payable under the cottage purchase scheme that while Deputy Murphy supported the Bill, he did so, not because he believed in it, but only because he felt the Act had become a dead letter.  Here is a Deputy who declares he does not believe in the proposal he is advocating, yet he wants that principle to become effective, and to make the Act which he says has become a dead letter a live reality, an effective instrument for the transfer of the houses from the ownership of local authorities to the ownership of the tenants.  In order to prove that the scheme was a dead letter, Deputy Murphy adopted a most extraordinary technique.  Unlike <Col N="96" /> his leader, Deputy Norton, he did put some figures before the House, but the figures he put before the House were highly selective.</P>
    <P>The Deputy had been well supplied with statistics.  He had, as I have, a tabular statement giving details of the transactions which have taken place in every county in Ireland under the Act of 1936.  I know that the table is in three heads.  One shows the number of cottages in the purchase schemes submitted by the boards of health; the second shows the number of applications made for purchase; and the third, the number of cottages vested.  Deputy Murphy, in his endeavour to prove that the Act was a dead letter, gave the House very full information under two of these heads. He referred to West Cork first.  West Cork being his own constituency, he was naturally most familiar with it. He told us that the number of cottages in West Cork covered by the schemes was 1,421 and that the number vested was nil.  He also, however, in that connection rather significantly indicated that, so far as the members of the board of health of which he was a member when the 1936 Act became operative were concerned, they did not believe in the thing at all, so that when people wanted them to adopt purchase schemes and made applications to purchase, they thought it was a needless and unnecessary thing to have to make inquiries into title.  He certainly gave me the impression that, so far as West Cork was concerned, everything possible had been done by the local authority there to discourage people from coming forward to make applications under the Act.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer to Cavan and said that, in Cavan, 1,201 cottages were covered by the purchase scheme and that 918 cottages had been vested. The number of applications to purchase&mdash;they were 976&mdash;he did not give. If we take Cavan, we find that almost 80 per cent. of the cottages in the county under the control and in the ownership of the Cavan County Council have become the subject of applications to purchase and that of all the cottages in the ownership of the county, over 75 per cent. have been <Col N="97" /> vested.  That does not look as if the Act had become a dead letter in County Cavan.  The same is true of a considerable number of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>Monaghan was, I think, one of the other counties the Deputy referred to. In Monaghan, he said, the number of cottages covered by the purchase schemes was 555 and the number vested nil.  I pressed him in relation to Monaghan and the other counties to give the really significant figure, that is, not the number of cottages vested but the number of cottages in respect of which applications for purchase have been made.  No cottage can, or should be, vested until the tenant purchaser is in a position to get clear title.  Is there any Deputy who would challenge that principle?  Would Deputy Murphy, who laid so much stress on the fact that after a number of years only about 3,400 cottages had been vested, want a local authority to enter into a purchase agreement with the tenant of one of its cottages, and the tenant to bind himself by that agreement, and then to find that it was not in a position to give the tenant clear title and good title?  Do Deputy Norton, Deputy Murphy and those who made so much play with the fact that so few cottages have been vested want local authorities to sell these cottages under false pretences to the tenants, to sell them when they themselves had not got the title to them?</P>
    <P>The real reason why so little progress has been made is not that the terms of the Act are not attractive. The mere fact that nearly 10,000 tenants have already applied for purchase, even in the circumstances which have existed since 1939, shows that the terms are attractive.  But there is, of course, this great difficulty, that a very large number, two-thirds, of these cottages were built prior to 1914.  The agreements which were entered into between the farmer who had the land and the local authority which wanted to build a cottage thereon were so nebulous and so unbusinesslike, if you wish, that, in respect of the great majority of these cottages, title has not been registered and the local authority has no clear title at all.  That <Col N="98" /> is why there have been so few vestings.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there have been, as I have pointed out, a considerable number of applications to purchase. Let us consider the record in that regard.  This Act became law at the end of June, 1936.  Regulations were issued at the end of March, 1937, but it was found necessary to amend these regulations, and the regulations governing the submission and adoption and general administration of purchase schemes were not made definitive until 8th August, 1938.  That is when the 1936 Act really began to operate.  What has been the history since?  On 31st March, 1940, within 19 months, if my hurried computation is correct, after the regulations had been made in final form, no fewer than 6,666 applications to purchase had been made.</P>
    <P>In 19 months, 6,666 people had made applications to purchase.  That does not look as if the Act was a deadletter, and it certainly does not look as if the terms were unattractive to the tenants.  That was the position on the 31st March, 1940.  On the 31st March, 1941, the number of applications to purchase had gone up to 7,156, and, remember, that at this time the emergency had well developed.  Everybody knew that it would become difficult to get building material.  Everybody felt that, perhaps for a time, it might be better if somebody else had the responsibility for maintaining your house rather than yourself.  That was, as I said, the position as it had come to manifest itself on the 31st March, 1941.  On the 31st March, 1942, the number had risen to 7,828.  On the 31st December, 1942, nine months later, the number of applications to purchase had increased to 8,421.  On the 30th September of last year, the number had gone up to 9,131, and on the 31st March this year the figure of 9,453 had been reached.</P>
    <P>Mark the continuous increase over this whole period of the emergency when most people would have been glad to have allowed others carry responsibility for maintaining their homes in a habitable condition.  Yet, notwithstanding the fact that every person who made an application to purchase was aware of the fact that, if <Col N="99" /> purchase became effective, if the cottage were vested in him, he would have to accept responsibility, in this time of difficulty and in this time of high prices, for keeping his house in repair, and was aware, too, that, if he did not keep his cottage in repair, the local authority would, as Deputy Coburn has pointed out, come in and repair it for him, repair it, if you like in spite of him, and recover the cost from him.  Over the four years since 31st March, 1940, the number of applications to purchase had gone up by nearly 3,000, or 50 per cent. over what it had attained in the 10 months immediately after the passing of the Act.  I contend that, in the light of these figures, it is just ridiculous to say that the Act has been a dead letter, that the Act has not been attractive to the purchaser.  On the contrary, the figures prove undeniably &mdash;for it is a denial of common sense and intelligence to contend otherwise&mdash; that the terms have been attractive and that the Act has been effective for the purpose for which it was designed.</P>
    <P>Now consider the other side of the case.  I have already pointed out that purchase schemes under the existing Act give to the tenant purchaser an immediate reduction of 25 per cent. in his cash outgoings on his weekly payments. They do not do that, as I have said, without transferring that burden somewhere else, and that burden will be transferred to the backs of the ratepayers. Because Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy were at pains not to put the full facts of this matter before the House, and because Deputy O'Higgins, in speaking on this measure, pointed out how serious were the disadvantages which he laboured under owing to neglect on the part of those who were sponsoring this Bill to put the relevant figures before the House, I have circulated a statement here to-day which I hope will be of assistance to the House and will help them to appreciate what really is involved in the measure.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to point out is that, whereas, prior to the 1936 Act, the total amount that would have been payable by the tenants was £243,000 a year, under the 1936 Act, if every <Col N="100" /> tenant availed of its terms, the aggregate cash payment of the tenants would be reduced to £182,000, but on the other hand, the liability to be borne by the local authorities would increase to £307,000 a year.  If this Bill were to go through and full effect were to be given to its main provisions&mdash;there are two serious provisions in it: one, that the annuities should be reduced by 50 per cent., and the other, that upon the terminable annuity there should be an overriding limit of 50 years&mdash;then the position of local authorities would be that there would be 10,000 houses in respect of which they would not be paid one penny.  Is there any justification for that?  Is that anything short of expropriation? Does it matter very much whether the property to be expropriated belongs to a local authority or to a private citizen?  Once you accept the principle of expropriation, where is it to end?  If it is to be the cottage belonging to a local authority to-day, who knows what it will be to-morrow? Whose farm is it to be, whose land is it to be, whose business is it to be, once you accept the principle of expropriation? And the principle of expropriation is embodied in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is there anything just or equitable in that?  Yet, that is the sort of proposal that the Labour Party brings forward.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where an abandonment order <Col N="102" /> has been made in relation to a railway line owned or operated by a railway company, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where the railway line has been carried over a public road by means of a bridge which the railway company were, immediately before the date (in this sub-section referred to as the operative date) on which the order comes into force, under a liability to maintain&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Minister shall appoint a date (in this paragraph referred to as the appointed date) for the purposes of this paragraph,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the railway company and the local authority in whose functional area the bridge is situate may, before the appointed date, enter into an agreement for the removal or other method of dealing with the bridge (including, if necessary, either the restoration of the public road to like or other equally convenient state as it was in before it was interfered with by the makers of the railway line or the diversion of the public road) upon such terms and conditions as the parties thereto think fit, and, in that case, the liability (except such (if any) as may be imposed by the agreement) of the railway company to maintain the bridge shall cease upon the execution of the agreement,</P>
    <P>(iii)  if no such agreement is so executed, but the railway company remove the superstructure of the bridge before the appointed date, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the liability of the railway to maintain the bridge shall cease as on and from the date of removal, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the local authority shall, as on and from the date of removal, be liable to maintain so much of the bridge as remains after the removal of the superstructure, and</P>
    <P>(III)  the railway company shall pay to the local authority <Col N="103" /> compensation for any expenses which the local authority may incur by reason of the liability so imposed on them,</P>
    <P>(iv)  if no such agreement is so executed or if the superstructure of the bridge is not so removed, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) the liability of the railway company to maintain the bridge shall cease on the appointed date, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the local authority shall, as on and from the appointed date, be liable to maintain the bridge, and</P>
    <P>(III)  the railway company shall pay to the local authority compensation for any expenses which the local authority may incur by reason of the liability so imposed on them,</P>
    <P>(b)  where a public road has been carried over the railway line by means of a bridge which the railway company were, immediately before the operative date, under a liability to maintain&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Minister shall appoint a date (in this parágraph referred to as the appointed date) for the purposes of this paragraph,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the railway company and the local authority in whose functional area the bridge is situate may, before the appointed date, enter into an agreement for the removal or other method of dealing with the bridge (including, if necessary, either the restoration of the public road to like or other equally convenient state as it was in before it was interfered with by the makers of the railway line or the diversion of the public road) upon such terms and conditions as the parties thereto think fit, and, in that case, the liability (except such (if any) as may be imposed by the agreement) of the railway company to maintain the bridge shall cease upon the execution of the agreement,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> (iii)  if no such agreement is so executed, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the liability of the railway company to maintain the bridge shall cease on the appointed date, and</P>
    <P>(II)  as on and from the appointed date, the local authority shall be liable to maintain the bridge, and</P>
    <P>(III)  the railway company shall pay to the local authority compensation for any expenses which the local authority may incur by reason of the liability so imposed on them;</P>
    <P>(c)  if the railway line crosses on the level any public road, the railway company shall, not later than such date as the Minister may fix, remove the rails and do all such other things as may be necessary to render that part of the said public road on which the railway line crossed fit and safe for use by the public, and thereupon the liability of the railway company to maintain the said part in repair shall cease;</P>
    <P>(d)  the liability, imposed on the railway company by Section 68 of the Railway Clauses Act, 1845, to maintain any works (other than bridges over or under the railway line) of the kind mentioned in the said Section 68 made, in pursuance of that section, for the accommodation of owners and occupiers of land adjoining the railway line shall as from the operative date cease, but the railway company shall pay to any owner or occupier of land adjoining the railway line for the accommodation of which any such works were made in pursuance of the said Section 68 and which the railway company were immediately before the operative date liable to maintain, compensation for all such injury or damage (if any) as he may sustain by reason of the cesser of the liability of the railway company to maintain those works;</P>
    <P>(e)  where any bridge (being a bridge which the railway company were immediately before the <Col N="105" /> operative date liable to maintain) was, in pursuance of Section 68 of the said Railway Clauses Act, 1845, made over or under the railway line for accommodation of owners and occupiers of land adjoining the railway line&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the railway company, before such date as the Minister may fix for the purpose, do the following works, namely, replace the said bridge by a crossing on the level over the site of the abandoned railway and render the said crossing fit and safe for use, then, as from the completion of the said works, the liability of the railway company shall cease and they shall not be under any obligation to maintain the said crossing in repair;</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the railway company do not before the said date do the said works&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the railway company shall as on and from the said date cease to be liable to maintain the said bridge,</P>
    <P>(II)  the railway company shall pay to any owner or occupier of the land adjoining the railway line for the accommodation of which the said bridge was made compensation for all such injury or damage (if any) as he may sustain by reason of the cesser of the liability of the railway company to maintain the said bridge.</P>
    <P>The proposal is to substitute the new sub-section for sub-section (4).  I might mention that since I submitted the amendment, the Minister for Local Government has drawn attention to the fact that there are cases where county councils are charged with the maintenance of main roads in urban areas and, because of that, it will be necessary to alter the wording of the amendment, if inserted in the Bill, by a further slight amendment, on the Report Stage.  I shall arrange to have such an amendment submitted.</P>
    <P>The need for the revision of the sub-section <Col N="106" /> arises out of representations made by the Great Southern Railways Company to the effect that they should be placed in a position whereby the company would be at liberty to restore works on the abandonment of a line to the like or equally good state they were in before the making of the railway. Following representations from the Department of Lands, it was considered that under clause (c), as originally drafted, liability for maintenance, etc., might be transferred to the owner or occupier of land at the time the works referred to were constituted. The proposed new sub-section provides that where the abandonment Order has been made, the provisions set out in the various clauses will operate.</P>

      <P>That is true, but of <Col N="108" /> course it may frequently happen, and does happen, that the facilities provided by road are better than the facilities provided by rail.  I mean that a trader sending goods, say, from one shop to another, may find it more convenient to have the goods taken from one shop door and delivered at the other shop door than to have them taken from one railway station to another railway station.  It is not a fair comparison to calculate the cost of sending goods by road as against the cost of sending them by rail.  Included in the cost of sending them by rail must be the cost of bringing them from the railway depot to the store where the goods are to be delivered.  Ordinarily we can arrange that the charges will be related to the facilities.  For most classes of goods the actual cost of transport by rail will be lower than the cost by road, but the facilities will not be the same.</P>

      <P>There was a special problem there in so far as on the Clifden line, owing to an arrangement which was made&mdash;I need not go into the reason for it now&mdash;the cost of transporting cattle was substantially below the cost of transporting cattle over corresponding distances on any other portion of the railway system. There was a change made by bringing into operation in that area the standard charges that applied everywhere else.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 178:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 103, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where a mechanically-propelled vehicle or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle is used for the carriage of merchandise, then, subject to this section, the merchandise shall until the contrary <Col N="109" /> is proved, be deemed for the purposes of the Act of 1933, to be carried for reward.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  merchandise, which is supplied by a person in the course of a trade or business carried on by him is, for the purpose of delivery to the customer, carried in a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person or in a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  merchandise, which is to be or has been subjected to any one or more of the following processes, namely, repairing, cleaning, laundering and dyeing, by a person in the course of a trade or business carried on by him is, for the purpose of collection from or delivery to the customer, carried in a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person or in a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person,</P>
    <P>the merchandise shall, for the purposes of the Act of 1933, be deemed not to be carried for reward.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by a person or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by a person is used for the carriage of merchandise the property of that person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by a company or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by a company is used for the carriage of merchandise the property of any company which is in the same ownership, or under the same management, as the company owning the mechanically-propelled vehicle,</P>
    <P>then, subject to sub-sections (4) and (5)  of this section, the merchandise shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Act of 1933, not to be carried for reward.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a vehicle (being a mechanically-propelled <Col N="110" /> vehicle or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle) is used for the carriage of merchandise, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the vehicle is registered in the name of two or more persons,</P>
    <P>the merchandise shall, for the purposes of the Act of 1933, be deemed not to be the property of the owner of the vehicle, unless it is proved that it is the common property of the persons in whose name the vehicle is registered.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person is, in relation to the carriage of merchandise, charged with having committed on a particular occasion an offence under the Act of 1933, and</P>
    <P>(b)  it is proved that the merchandise was on the said occasion carried in a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person or in a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by that person, and</P>
    <P>(c)  it is alleged by that person that the merchandise was his property, and</P>
    <P>(d)  it appears that the merchandise was not manufactured or produced by that person, but was acquired by him, and</P>
    <P>(e)  the court is of opinion that (having regard to the circumstances of the acquisition, the purposes for which the merchandise is capable of being used, the recentness of the acquisition and the calling of that person) the merchandise was not <i>bona fide</i> acquired by him for the purposes of his trade or business or for his own private use,</P>
    <P>the court shall, for the purposes of the Act of 1933, deal with the charge on the assumption that the property in the merchandise never passed to that person and that the merchandise was on the said occasion carried for reward by him.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of Sections 103 and 104.  The amendment combines, on the suggestion of the parliamentary draftsman, <Col N="111" /> the somewhat scattered provisions relating to carriage for reward at present set out in Sections 2 and 4 of the Road Transport Act, 1934, Section 2 of the Road Transport Act, 1935, and Sections 103 and 104 of this Bill. It is considered more suitable to have all those provisions combined in one section.  We are, therefore, proposing to repeal those sections of the previous Acts, and not to move Sections 103 and 104 of this Bill.  There is no other change effected by the amendment other than that of regrouping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the type of evasion which this section is designed to prevent is not in regard to the casual type of transport to which the Deputy refers.  The practice did grow up of a number of traders in a town appearing, on paper, to be combining to form a company to purchase a lorry to carry their goods.  It was in most cases only a purely notional company. In practice, one individual purchased the lorry, and got this fictitious organisation behind him as shareholders in the company of which he was the operative.  In that way there was successful evasion of the law, and what we are aiming to do here is to ensure that the goods in the lorry will not be deemed to be the property of the owners of the lorry, unless all the owners of the lorry have a common property in the goods.  The Deputy will see that that device, if adopted, will prevent the type of evasion to which I have referred.  In such a case as the Deputy referred to there would be no question of reward, and of course we are concerned only with carriage for reward.</P>

      <P>It has been strongly recommended by everyone having the best interests of the community at heart, particularly of the small producers, that small producers such as small farmers should combine to purchase such mechanical implements or <Col N="113" /> vehicles as they may be unable to purchase individually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a number of small farmers join together and form a co-operative society to own a lorry, and that lorry is used for conveying the farm produce of each individual member of that co-operative society, will they be debarred under this section from using that lorry for that purpose?  I think it would be most unfair if that were to happen, because I do not see any reason why a number of farmers may not join together to own a lorry in order to enable them to get their produce delivered to the market at the cheapest possible rate, and to get such necessary materials as manure, lime and so on.  As I see it, those people will be debarred from carrying out that work unless they all combine co-operatively to purchase the produce which is being carried.  I do not think that is desirable, nor do I think it is possible for small producers, such as small farmers, co-operatively to purchase the materials which they require to be carried.  As a matter of fact, it would be absolutely impossible for them collectively to own the produce which is being sold.  If a number of farmers own a lorry, that lorry would have to go from one farm to another to collect wheat, oats, barley, or any other produce they wish to convey to the market.  That produce would not be the produce of the co-operative society which owns the lorry; it would be the property of the individual farmers who are members of the society.  Those people would be debarred by this section from carrying on that work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. That has been the position for the last ten years.  Nobody can carry goods for reward except he has a licence to do so.  That has been the law since 1933. The various changes which have been made in this bill are merely designed to prevent evasions of that law.  I think if we decide to bring the transportation of goods for reward under control we cannot seem to make the <Col N="114" /> exceptions suggested by the Deputy. Those exceptions would nullify the whole purpose of the legislation, and would open wide the door to its complete evasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers to consumable goods only.  Mainly, co-operative societies deal with agricultural produce&mdash;milk, butter, flax, potatoes, oats.  Deputy Cogan referred to a lorry.  That is not a typical case nowadays.  What is typical is that a society buys a tractor.  The tractor is used, in the first place, to operate a mill when threshing.  Secondly, the members get a trailer, and carry goods in that.  Then they start a flax mill also.  Under the section, they are prohibited from taking any flax to the mill from the co-operative society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm on which the flax grows is the property of an individual farmer and the flax does not become the property of the society until it is delivered at the mill.  While it is being carried from the individual farm to the mill, does it not remain the property of the farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be a simple matter for the society to arrange to purchase the flax on the farm, if they want to do it that way.  I think that is the practice adopted in the grain trade, where the grain merchants buy the grain on the farm and transfer it in their own lorries.  It is their property once they buy it.</P>

      <P>That is so.  All the changes which are being proposed here&mdash;except some which are by way of easement&mdash;are intended merely to deal with successful evasions of the Act which have appeared since it was passed in 1933, mainly by reason of the difficulty of proving that the goods on the lorry were not the property of the owner of the lorry.  We are proposing to change that now by the various proposals set out here.  In so far as these proposals are effective, they merely make good what was the intention in 1933.</P>

      <P>On and after the passing of this Act there shall be no legal limit to the number of mechanically-propelled vehicles owned by citizens of Éire and used for the carriage of merchandise, the property of the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in putting down this amendment was to ensure that, as far as possible, there would be no interference with the rights of the owner of a private lorry or other mechanically propelled <Col N="116" /> vehicle for the conveyance of the owner's own goods.  The Minister has repeatedly stated that it is neither his intention nor the intention of Córas Iompair Éireann to interfere with the private lorry owner, but I am anxious that something should be embodied in the Bill definitely protecting his rights. I can foresee a situation developing which may severely tempt the company to interfere with those rights &mdash; that is, in the case of the private lorry owner becoming a real menace to the existence of this company and to its successful and profitable working.  I can see that there would be a temptation in that case to interfere with the rights of the private owner.</P>
    <P>I agree that this amendment may not cover the position adequately, but I think that a provision such as this should be inserted in the Bill, so that it would be definitely impossible to restrict in any way the number of private citizens of this State who may own lorries or the number of lorries which may be owned by one individual. That should be definitely embodied in the Bill and there should be no restriction.</P>

There is no necessity for it, as there is no restriction on the number of vehicles which a private owner may use for the carriage of his own goods and the company is not empowered to interfere with the carriage of goods by those who own them.  That is the law at present and it will be the law after this is passed.</P>

    <P>Where the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, within whose district a plate issuing station is situated, is satisfied that any mechanically propelled vehicle (in this section referred to as the original vehicle), in respect of which a vehicle plate was issued at that station, is undergoing repairs, he may, if he thinks fit, on the application of the licensee under a merchandise licence who is the owner of the original vehicle, issue to the licensee a permit (which shall be in such form as the Minister directs) to use, for the purposes of the merchandise road transport business authorised by the licence, during such period (not exceeding ten days from the date of the permit) as he thinks fit, another mechanically propelled vehicle (in this section referred to as the substituted vehicle) of the like kind, the unladen weight of which, if the licence is a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence, does not exceed the unladen weight of the original vehicle, and, in that case, sub-section (2) of Section 34 (which relates to an obligation to carry <Col N="119" /> vehicle plates on vehicles carrying merchandise) of the Act of 1933 shall not, during the period specified in the permit, apply in respect of the user for the purposes of the said merchandise road transport of the substituted vehicle.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 185:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(1)  Where a licensee, whose existing standard lorry weight is less than his maximum lorry weight, applies to the Minister to amend his merchandise (existing carrier's) licence by increasing his standard lorry weight to his maximum lorry weight, the Minister shall amend the licence accordingly.</P>

      <P>the word &ldquo;licensee&rdquo; means a licensee under a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence, other than any such licence granted by virtue of Section 106 of this Act;</P>
      <P>the existing standard lorry weight for a licensee shall be taken to be the weight which was his standard lorry weight on the establishment date;</P>
      <P>the original standard lorry weight for a licensee shall be taken to be the standard lorry weight specified in his licence as originally issued or, if his standard lorry weight has been increased or determined under sub-sections (1) or (3) of Section 11 of the Road Transport Act, 1934 (No. 17 of 1934), his standard lorry weight as so increased or determined;</P>
      <P>the maximum lorry weight for a licensee shall be taken to be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case his original standard lorry weight is four tons or less&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  his original standard lorry weight increased by one-fifth, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  two tons and five hundred-weights, whichever is the greater, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in case his original standard lorry weight exceeds four tons&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  his original standard lorry weight increased by one-tenth, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> (ii)  four tons and sixteen hundred-weights, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The standard lorry weight for an existing carrier's licence, as determined in the Act of 1933, had reference to the unladen weight of the vehicles used by the applicant during the qualifying period.  Certain provisions later gave power to increase the standard lorry weight such as those made in various sections of the 1933 Act.  Other sections of the 1933 Act provided that the Minister might increase the standard lorry weight in a case where an unserviceable vehicle had been replaced by another vehicle of greater unladen weight but of substantially the same carrying capacity.  Another amendment made in 1935, provided an automatic increase to two tons on application, owing to difficulties experienced in replacing 30 cwt. vehicles by vehicles of the same weight. Another section of that Act provided that where the body of a vehicle is worn out and is replaced by a similar body of Irish manufacture which has a greater weight, a compensating increase in the standard lorry weight might be allowed.  In addition, increases in the standard lorry weight were given where it was found that creels were normally used but had not been included when the vehicle was weighed for registration purposes during the qualifying period.</P>
    <P>Owing to the increasing difficulty of getting accurate information in regard to the vehicles used in the qualifying period, and to the spiralling process of claiming increased weight through the more general use of creels and the use of native timber in body repairs, it has been almost impossible to administer the provisions of the 1933 Act and the amendments which I am proposing now in regard to standard lorry weights are intended to stabilise the position once and for all, and, at the same time, to compensate licensed hauliers reasonably for the increase in weight due to the use of native timber, and the use of creels or other causes.  It is well known that road hauliers try to evade road tax, that they strip their vehicles of movables in order to bring them down to the standard <Col N="122" /> lorry weight specified in the licence. The Irish Licensed Hauliers Contractors' Association made representations in this matter and are responsible for the proposal to effect such increases as are contemplated here. These increases will operate to compensate hauliers in all the circumstances in which we consider compensation should be given and will stabilise the position in so far as no further variations in lorry weight will be permitted after the enactment of the Bill.  What I have said in regard to standard lorry weights, applies also to standard tractor weights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the original standard lorry weight exceeded four tons it will be increased by one-tenth.  The position under the 1933 Act was that every person then engaged in a hiring business was entitled to a licence for vehicles of the same carrying capacity as he had then.  In order to effect that intention we devised a system of standard lorry weights.  Whatever the standard weight of the vehicle he had then was, he got a licence to operate a vehicle of a similar weight.  For the reasons I have mentioned, we have modified that position from time to time.  When heavier bodies made of native timber were used we permitted an increase.  When creels were used for the carriage of turf we permitted an increase.  A number of modifications have been made within the last ten years, all of which were increasingly difficult to administer because they related to the position before 1933.  We propose to get rid of that difficulty by stabilising the position. In this proposal we are giving everybody the percentage increase in the standard weights set out here, and once they have got this increase, they will get no further increase.</P>

      <P>Every document purporting to be a copy of an entry in the register of merchandise licences kept under Section 29 of the Act of 1933, and purporting to be certified by an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce to be a true copy of such entry shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting so to certify or that he was such officer, be received in evidence in any legal proceedings and shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be a true copy of such entry and to be evidence of the terms of such entry.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that a certified copy of an entry in the register of merchandise licences kept under Section 29 of the Road Transport Act of 1933 shall be received in evidence in any legal proceedings and be evidence of the terms of such entry. This provision is on similar lines to a provision in the Road Traffic Act of 1933.  The need arises from the fact that the holder of a merchandise licence commits a breach of the Act by carrying goods of a class not included in his licence or by operating outside his area.  There is no provision at present for furnishing a certificate signed by an officer of the Department setting out what is contained in the merchandise licence.  When prosecuting, Gárdaí have had to take the actual register into court and, as it is becoming a very bulky document, it has been found impracticable to transfer it to country districts for the purpose of prosecutions.</P>

    <P>(3)  Where the Minister by an Order under this section requires any canal undertaker to execute any works, he may, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, require the local authority in whose functional area the works are situate, to pay to that canal undertaker, as a contribution towards the expense of the works, such sum as he thinks proper, <Col N="130" /> and in that case the canal undertaker may recover the said sum from the local authority as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I should like to say that I may have to revise it on the Report Stage, following representations which I have received from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is concerned with its provisions.  It is considered desirable to have some arrangement under which, if works have to be performed which would improve road facilities, the full costs of executing these works will not fall upon the canal undertaker, that, to whatever extent will be regarded as reasonable, they will be met by the local authority of the area.

      <P>In the case of a railway undertaking, if there is an accident, under similar circumstances, which involves an inspection by an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, then on receipt of the report of that inspector, the railway undertaker may be ordered to carry out certain works.  We are proposing in this case that the Minister may, by Order, require any canal undertaker to comply with any recommendation of an inspector duly appointed under Section 14 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, and &ldquo;any Order of the Minister under this section shall be complied with by the canal undertaker to which the Order relates and in the event of non-compliance shall be enforceable by the High Court on the application of the Minister&rdquo;.  The complaint may come from any source. In other words, there need not necessarily <Col N="131" /> be an accident or some development which would necessitate an inspection, but if, for any reason, the Minister may require an inspection to take place in regard to these matters, and if the inspector recommends that works have to be undertaken by the canal company, then the canal company must carry out these works.  If the works concerned have to be limited to the repair of the canal, well and good, but if the works recommended by the inspector entail, not merely repairs to the canal itself, but the providing of improved facilities for the public, then it is considered proper that the local authority concerned should contribute towards the cost of the provision of those facilities. For instance, it might be a case of a bridge or some other obstruction&mdash;a bridge, for instance, which might be too narrow&mdash;and if we were to put the whole cost on the canal company it might be possible that they might just leave it as it is.  If it is a question of widening the bridge, for instance, then I think that a portion of the cost should be borne by the local authority concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 195:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Before the First Schedule to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The dissolved railway company shall have and be deemed always to have had power to redeem in cash by agreement with the holders thereof any of the following stocks, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>North Wall Extension, Lines 1 and 2&mdash;£100 shares.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  New Ross and Waterford Extension Railways' Guaranteed Stock.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' Debenture Stock, 1884 and 1887.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' Debenture Stock, 1894 and 1897.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' Preference Stock.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' Guaranteed Stock.</P>
    <P>4 per cent.  Redeemable (1947) Debenture Stock.</P>
    <P>On the 4th January, 1944, Great Southern Railways issued a circular letter to the holders of New Ross and Waterford Extension Railways' Stock and City of Dublin Junction Railways' stocks, informing them that reconstruction proposals were contemplated and offering them redemption in cash at par, or redemption by issue in exchange of 3 per cent. redeemable debenture stock of the new company, when issued.  A circular letter was also addressed to the holders of Great Southern Railways' 4 per cent. redeemable (1947) debenture stock, offering redemption in cash at £102 on 30th June, 1944.  The London, Midland and Scottish Railway, by agreement, accepted cash at par in respect of the North Wall Extension Stock.  The holders of the stock, in the main, elected to accept redemption in cash. In the case of the North Wall Extension, lines 1 and 2, the amount was £126,800, and the amount redeemed in cash at par, on 5th April, 1944, by agreement was £126,800.  In the case of the 4 per cent. New Ross and Waterford Extension Railways' guaranteed stock, the amount redeemed in cash was £199,495 out of £200,000, and the <Col N="134" /> amount to be redeemed by issue in exchange of 3 per cent. redeemable debenture stock, by agreement, £505. In the case of the 4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' debenture stock, totalling £130,230, the amount redeemed was £129,536, and the holders of £700 worth of stock accepted debenture stock.  Similarly, in the case of the 4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways' guaranteed stock and in the case of the unguaranteed stock, and also in the case of the 4 per cent Great Southern Railways redeemable stock, totalling £344,931, it was decided to accept redemption in cash to the extent of £307,731.</P>
    <P>This amendment sanctions the redemption in cash, already effected by agreement, amounting, in all, to £1,024,657.  Provision is made under Section 13 (1) of the Bill, and an amendment to the Third Schedule, No. 206, which I shall propose later on, for the redemption by issue in exchange of 3 per cent. redeemable debentures of the balance of the stock not redeemed for cash.  Part of the 4 per cent. redeemable stock of Great Southern Railways, together with 3½ per cent. stock of the Dublin United Transport Company will be carried over as liabilities of the new company, under the provisions of the Railways Clauses Act of 1863.  The idea is to get rid of all these stocks and have only the two main stocks in the company.</P>

      <P>The total amount redeemed in cash was £1,024,657.  The amount which will be redeemed by the issue of debenture stock is £15,104. The £25,000 of unguaranteed stock in the City of Dublin Junction Railways, held by the Great Southern Railways Company, will be cancelled, and the balance, that is, the £37,000 of Great Southern Railways debenture stock, and the mortgage debentures of the Dublin United Transport Company, will be carried over as liabilities of the new company.  Both these debentures are due for redemption in 1947.</P>

      <P>It was in all cases except the one I mentioned.  The redeemable debentures in the Great Southern Railways Company are redeemable at par in 1947.  The company exercised the opportunity of redeeming them at £102 per £100 of stock except to the extent that the holders of £37,200 of stock would not accept these terms. They will get their redemption at par in 1947.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the White Paper which the Minister has issued that the paid-up capital of the company will, at the outset, total £13,401,290, consisting of £9,875,556 redeemable debenture stock.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds at the disposal of the company and, possibly, funds secured by bank overdraft, were utilised to get rid of these liabilities.

An account will have to be given then as to how the resources available to the company will be utilised in the light of this position and of how this redemption was effected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may prove to be so, in so far as if the company finds itself short of cash next year, it may have to issue new debenture stock to provide itself with the cash.  If it finds that it has completely tied up its liquid assets by means of these redemptions, it may have to issue new debenture stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill reaches its final stage, we would like to get a picture from the Minister as to what exactly has happened in the matter of the paying off of these debentures, whether in cash or otherwise. I think it is desirable that we should get as full a picture as possible on the financial side of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to get that information.  I assume that what happened was that the manager of the company went to the company's bankers and said: &ldquo;We have these liabilities and we are anxious to liquidate them; we think it is good business to liquidate them, having regard to the interest charges attaching to them, and <Col N="137" /> we want your assistance or support in order that we may be able to redeem all these liabilities for cash at par.&rdquo; Now, to what extent that may have affected the liquid financial position of the company I cannot say at the moment, nor do I think anybody could attempt to give a clear picture of it until later in the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company will start off with the capital liabilities indicated in the Bill: that is, the substitute debenture stock, plus the common stock which will be issued in exchange for Great Southern Railways stock.  It will have the right to incur new capital liabilities to the extent of £6,500,000. When it is constituted it will be faced with the problem of financing its activities. If the company does not require fresh capital for that purpose, it will not issue it until these liabilities will have completely disappeared.  If the company does require fresh capital for any reason, such, for example, as the provision of liquid assets for this purpose, it will have to issue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 196:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before the First Schedule to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The company, the Dublin Corporation and the Grand Canal Company may enter into an agreement (in this sub-section referred to as the said agreement) with respect to the maintenance, opening and closing of the Victoria Bridge across the Grand Canal in the County Borough of Dublin, but the said agreement shall not have any force or effect unless confirmed by the Minister, who is <Col N="138" /> hereby authorised, if he thinks fit, to do so.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the said agreement is confirmed by the Minister, the following provisions shall thereupon have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the said agreement shall have statutory effect,</P>
    <P>(b)  each of the parties thereto shall, notwithstanding any limitation on the power of that party to enter into it, be deemed to have power to enter into the said agreement,</P>
    <P>(c)  It shall be the duty of each of the parties thereto and each of the said parties is hereby empowered to carry out the said agreement so far as the provisions thereof are to be carried out by that party.</P>
    <P>The amendment relates to the Victoria Bridge.  It merely authorises the company, the Dublin Corporation and the Grand Canal Company to enter into an agreement.  The position is that, because of the effect of existing statutes, they could not enter into such an agreement and give it statutory effect. This is the only way in which the companies may enter into an agreement, and if they do, that agreement will have statutory effect.  We are authorising the various parties to make such an agreement, irrespective of any limitation on their power to do so imposed by statute.  I am not at all sure that it may not be desirable to go further than I am suggesting at the moment, and to include a provision to the effect that, if there is not an agreement, the matter will be submitted to arbitration and disposed of by arbitration.  I think everyone will agree that it is desirable that something should be done about Victoria Bridge.  Whilst it is clear that it is in the interests of the corporation that a better bridge should be put there, it is equally clear that it would be unfair to impose on the transport company the cost of putting a better bridge there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that, if there is no agreement, some arrangement may be imposed on the parties by the Minister for Local Government <Col N="139" /> and Public Health, I think that both the company and the Grand Canal Company would be violently opposed to it.  At least, they would not regard the Minister for Local Government as an impartial person for the purpose of deciding on the equities of the position as between the Dublin Corporation and these commercial organisations. They would assume that he would be prejudiced in favour of the Dublin Corporation, and that the companies would be left with the worst of the bargain.  What I propose is that either we merely empower the parties to come to an agreement, and provide that if they do come to an agreement it will have statutory effect or else we will go a step further than that and say that if they do not come to an agreement an arbitrator will be set up to decide what is a fair arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 196a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the proposed new section to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the absence of any such agreement as is hereinbefore provided for nothing in this Act shall alter or lessen the rights and obligations of the company, the Grand Canal Company and the Dublin Corporation under the Dublin Tramways Company (Extensions and Alterations) Order, 1899.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation, the Grand Canal Company and the Dublin Transport Company have had very definite rights and obligations binding on each other in respect to the use of Victoria Bridge, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Tramways Company, under the Extensions and Alterations Order, 1899, were bound at their own expense to rebuild this bridge over the canal in accordance with plans approved by the city engineer and the <Col N="140" /> engineer of the Grand Canal Company, and thereafter to maintain and keep it in good order and repair.  The control and management of the bridge were to remain as theretofore with the Grand Canal Company and the Tramways Company were to have no right in connection therewith save that of user only.</P>
    <P>The Transport Company's obligations for the running of the lines over the bridge continue and the abandonment of them would not of itself release the company from these obligations.</P>
    <P>If the Transport Company's obligations were to be terminated by legislation, the Grand Canal Company should be compensated and restored to their former position of obligation to maintain the bridge and its approaches. I submit to the Minister that, having regard to all the circumstances, the acceptance of this amendment is desirable.  I am advised by the Corporation's Law Agent that this would meet the case from the corporation's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that amendment No. 196a is unnecessary because the incorporation of the Railways Clauses Act transfers to the new company all the obligations of the old company, whatever they are.  Some of the Deputy's legal colleagues might not agree with the Deputy as to what these obligations are but, whatever they are, they are transferred.  There is a situation in which the company have obligations in relation to the bridge and there is a general desire that something should be done to get a better bridge.  I am merely proposing that if the three parties concerned agree on some arrangement which will be satisfactory to all of them, that such agreement as they make will have statutory effect.  That may be sufficient.  In fact, I should assume that with goodwill in all quarters it would be sufficient. The Deputy says if they do not agree let the Minister for Local Government say what is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that would be a fair arrangement because the Minister is not an impartial party in this matter. He would be unduly influenced in <Col N="141" /> favour of the local authority.  Whether he would be or not, it is natural to assume that the Transport Company and the Grand Canal Company would think that he probably would be. Therefore, I am not disposed to accept the Deputy's amendment to let the Minister for Local Government impose some arrangement on the parties.  If the view is that it is not sufficient merely to give statutory effect to any agreement that may be voluntarily arrived at, then I would contemplate going further and bringing in an amendment which would provide for arbitration on the obligations of the parties in this regard.  May I say as to what the obligations of the company may be, there are, I believe, diametrically opposite legal opinions in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the maintenance of the obligations of the company is concerned, there is no need for any amendment.  The obligations of the Dublin United Transport Company are transferred in full to the new company.  I think we should do more than that, however.  I think, in addition to transferring these obligations we should empower the new company and the corporation and the Grand Canal Company to make a new agreement in relation to that bridge.  They cannot do it now.  At least, any agreement which they made could not be brought into effect without legislation. Now that we are legislating for transport purposes, we should do something about it.  That is why I am proposing amendment No. 196.  I am proposing that if they do agree, that agreement will have statutory effect, notwithstanding any other enactment to the contrary.  I think it might be desirable to go further and say that if they do not agree the matter must be referred to arbitration, so that something will be done about it and the present situation, which means that there is a bridge unsuitable to modern traffic blocking an important highway of the <Col N="142" /> city, brought to an end as early as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is quite possible that it may be found necessary to reconstruct the present Victoria Bridge, Dublin, or erect a new bridge of a more costly type to make it more suitable for present-day traffic, this amendment would provide for an amicable agreement between the Transport Company, <Col N="143" /> the Grand Canal Company and the Dublin Corporation.</P>

It relates to the lodging with the Minister for Industry and Commerce of a copy of any agreement made with the trade union representatives of employees in regard to rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service.  The company is required to do that under the Railways Act in respect of railway employees.  Section 10 of the Railway Act, 1933, provides similar machinery for the regulation of rates of pay, etc., of the road transport employees of the railway companies, but there is no provision for the lodging of an agreement with the Minister and that omission is being remedied by this amendment.</P>

      <Col N="145" /> This amendment provides for the repeal of almost identical sections which provide in respect of the particular railway lines to which they refer for a fine of £2 for trespass by persons subject to certain warning notices being displayed by the railway company.  Amendment No. 114 provides for an almost identical provision which will apply to all the lines of the company.</P>

      <P>The First Schedule as originally drafted provided for the total repeal of the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918. I understood at the time, and I think I said on the Second Reading, that water rates are now included under Public Health legislation.  The law agent to the Dublin Corporation has pointed out, however, that charges for water supplied by the corporation to Bray Urban District Council and to Dun Laoghaire Borough are regulated by an Order made under the 1918 Act. We intended to repeal the Act and it is, accordingly, necessary to qualify the repeal.</P>

      <P>Before paragraph 8 to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A dissolved company shall, on and after the establishment date, continue to be liable under the Income Tax Acts to prepare and deliver any statement, return or particulars required for the purposes of those Acts for any year of assessment ending on or before the 5th day of April, 1945.</P>
      <P>(2)  Assessments to income tax for any year of assessment ending on or before the 5th day of April, 1945, may be made on a dissolved company on or after the establishment date, and income tax in respect of any such assessment so made, which shall have become final and conclusive, shall, when it becomes due and payable, be deemed to have become due and payable before the establishment date.</P>
      <P>(3)  For the purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph the secretary of the company or other officer performing the duties of secretary of the company shall be deemed to be secretary of a dissolved company or other officer performing the duties of secretary of that dissolved company.</P>

    <P>(4)  The company shall be and is hereby empowered to deduct out of the emoluments of any person holding an office or employment of profit under the company any income tax charged on the dissolved railway <Col N="147" /> company in respect of any office or employment of profit held by such person under the dissolved railway company.</P>
    <P>This amendment is proposed at the suggestion of the Revenue Commissioners. By Section 10 of the Bill the railway company and the transport company are, subject to the provisions of the Second Schedule, dissolved on the establishment date.  Normally, when a company is wound up a liquidator is appointed for the purpose of winding up its affairs and distributing its assets.  Its corporate existence continues until liquidation is completed, and assessment to income tax on the company may be made during the liquidation period.  As there is no liquidation period in the case of a dissolved company, the paragraph is required to enable the assessment on the companies to be made after the establishment date in respect of the periods ending before that date.</P>

    <P>(2)  Assessments to corporation profits tax for any accounting period ending on or before the 31st day of <Col N="148" /> December, 1944, may be made on or after the establishment date on the dissolved transport company and corporation profits tax in respect of any such assessment so made, which shall have become final and conclusive, shall, when it becomes due and payable, be deemed to have become due and payable before the establishment date.</P>

    <P>(4)  In this paragraph references to corporation profits tax shall be construed as including references to excess corporation profits tax.</P>

The present reorganisation scheme does not affect the clearing house staff, and consequently no provision is required to be made for them in the Bill.

    <P>(iv) service (being service which is recognised for the purposes of a superannuation scheme, within the meaning of Section 42 of this Act, or an existing superannuation fund, within the meaning of Section 43 of this Act) with any former road transport undertaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the interpretation of what we have before us, it is agreed that an individual could only be compensated on the length of service. That is the basis for compensation, but in actual operation in the service, it may happen that an individual after, say, 20 years' service is promoted from one grade to another and only then enters the superannuation fund.  There might be the case of a man with 25 years' service who enters the superannuation fund only after getting promotion in his twentieth year of service. He may become redundant under the Bill after 25 years' service and having been five years in the fund.  As the amendment stands, he would be entitled to compensation for the period of five years.  We suggest he should get compensation for his whole service of 25 years.</P>

      <P>I have no idea of the type of cases the Deputy has in mind, but continuity of service is not a prerequisite for compensation on redundancy and if an employee was voluntarily absent from the company's employment for any reason, I do not see that that period should count.  I thought when I read the amendment that the Deputy was thinking about employees of the company who may have joined the armed forces of another country during the present period.  In so far as that was voluntary absence, I doubt if it would be desirable to impose this obligation on the company.  It does not destroy their right to compensation in so far as continuity of service is not necessary to establish it.</P>

I believe there are a couple of such cases and, if I am correctly informed, these people got permission from the directors who had authority to give such permission before the present chairman <Col N="154" /> took office.  I should like him to look into it because I am certain it is not the desire of anybody to penalise two or three people.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that there are special exemptions mentioned and others which are not?  The point is that if the company for any reason gives a voluntary release to some of its employees without breaking their service, their service ought to be regarded as continuous. There are special circumstances detailed in the Bill and the point sought to be covered here is that if the company voluntarily releases men from its employment for any purpose, these men to return whenever required by the company, they should not be regarded as having broken their service. They are still retained on the pay sheet of the company and should not the same conditions apply to them, irrespective of the purpose for which they left the company's service, so long as the company releases them for a period and they go back into the service of the company on the expiration of that period?  In the meantime, they have been retained on the pay sheet.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 1 (2), page 52, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  if that person was temporarily <Col N="156" /> absent from his employment with a former transport company for a period of less than one year on account of &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the temporary closing or reduction of services on a railway line, due to conditions resulting from the present war, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the cessation or reduction of any other transport services, due to the said conditions, or</P>

    <P>(iv)  any trade dispute to which he was not a party,</P>
    <P>such temporary absence shall be included in the period of his pensionable service.</P>
    <P>This gives effect to the greater part of the amendment proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan, Keyes and Larkin.  It provides for the reckoning, as part of the pensionable service of an employee, of temporary absence not exceeding one year, due to the temporary closing of railway services or other reduction of transport services, to illness or accident or to a trade dispute to which the employee was not a party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Disemployment caused through the suspension or reduction of services resulting from a trade dispute in which other employees of the company were involved.  Leaving out the Great Southern Railways, the Deputy will recollect the case of the Great Northern Railway which had a strike in 1932.  The conciliation grades went on strike, and, after they had been on strike for a number of weeks, the work arising in the company's shops, where there was no strike, so diminished that a number of shopmen were paid off.  The Deputy will remember the case because we had a long controversy here arising out of the decision of the umpire under the Unemployment Insurance Acts as to the right of these workers to unemployment benefit during the weeks they were paid off.  These men were disemployed by reason of a trade dispute to which they <Col N="157" /> were not a party.  I do not think it would be reasonable to expect the company to compensate men for a period in which they were on strike of their own decision, but it is reasonable to expect them to pay compensation for time lost to a man by reason of a strike involving some other section of the company's employees which ultimately necessitated temporary suspension of his employment.</P>

      <P>Before paragraph 4, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.  Compensation payable to a person who shall without his consent be by reason of transfer in any worse position in respect to the conditions of his service as a whole, shall be a lump sum of money to be determined by the company, subject to an appeal as to the amount thereof to the standing arbitrator and such arbitrator may if he so thinks fit upon the hearing thereof award as compensation in lieu of a lump sum of money an annual allowance to be paid to that person not exceeding in any case twothirds of his remuneration and emoluments and, subject to that overriding limitation, not exceed an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his pensionable service.  In fixing the nature and amount of compensation to be awarded in cases within this provision all the circumstances of the case shall be taken into consideration including any prospective loss or injury.</P>
      <P>This reinstates the position under the 1924 Act and enables the arbitrator to fix either a lump sum or an annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have provided in my amendment that it must be a lump sum.  I do not think that we should provide for a lump sum or annuity.  I think the compensation in these cases should be by way of a lump sum. The position under this Bill is somewhat <Col N="162" /> different from what it was in the 1924 Act.  As I explained previously, when the railways were being amalgamated in 1924 it was contemplated that there would be a considerable redundancy of staffs and that a lot of people would have to be let go, in fact that the more that went of their own accord the better it would be.  This is an entirely different situation.  We do not think anybody should be encouraged to retire unless definitely held to be redundant.  They are required for the company's service and, if there is a worsening of the conditions of employment or future prospects or some other deterioration in their situation following the change, then we should compensate them by a lump sum and let them continue in the company's service.  I think that is a more equitable arrangement than one which involves payment of an annuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the arbitrator would make it a big lump sum in a case of that kind.  It would be obviously a considerable alteration in the conditions of employment.  In my view, the mere putting of the obligation on the company to pay compensation by way of a lump sum will in fact ensure that avoidable changes in status or the nature of a person's employment will not take place.  However, I want to draw a distinction between this Bill and the other Act.  The other Act did provide that any person who retired before the amalgamation would be pensioned.  They were encouraged to retire and got compensation by way of pension.  We are not doing that here.  We do not think they should be encouraged to retire.  The other Act recognised that there would be such redundancy, that it would be completely impossible to employ everybody who was taken over in the type of employment in which they were <Col N="163" /> engaged previously.  That situation will not arise here.  The few changes that will be made, which will involve compensation under the lump sum provision, will relate merely to future prospects and chances of promotion, where a lump sum compensation would be added.</P>

      <P>I asked the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to raise, on the Adjournment this evening, some circumstances associated with the meeting held by the Taoiseach at Ennis on Sunday last.  I was informed that it would be inadmissible, on an Adjournment debate, to refer to any matter of Government policy.  Consequently, I do not intend, at this point, to discuss in any detail the rather sensational and startling and disturbing statement made by the Taoiseach, in so far as that statement affects the Army.  It was a statement to the effect that, post-war, the age limit for the Army would be 30 years, with the exception of senior officers.  I think that such a statement, unexplained, must have a disquieting and disturbing effect on any non-commissioned officer, soldier, or junior officer who is in or about 30 years of age. We have a great pension scheme for the Army which was intended to attract the young men of this country to adopt the Army as a career.  It lays down the minimum term for a pension as 14 years' service.  A man cannot join the Army until he is 18 years of age.  Under this new scheme announced in Ennis he will be &ldquo;turfed&rdquo; out of the Army at the age of 30, so that no pension will be possible, unless for very senior officers. However, that is a matter of policy which I do not intend to pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather regrettable that major questions of this kind are not discussed in Parliament, or not discussed at the Defence Conference.  The reason that brings me to my feet this evening is that, whether it was intentional or otherwise, all the circumstances attending last Sunday's meeting in Ennis showed very scant respect for Parliament.  It was a distinct discourtesy to the Defence Conference <Col N="165" /> and was a public insult to the Leader of the main Opposition Party.  The Defence Conference, as everybody knows, was brought into being in the early days of the emergency so as to stimulate recruiting for all branches of the Army and of the emergency forces.</P>
    <P>Recruiting was slow and it was suggested that if all Parties in this House got together on a common platform and made common appeals throughout the country and convinced the young men and others in this country that there was nothing political about the defence organisations, the response would be very gratifying.  It was.</P>
    <P>In the early days of this movement, Government Ministers took to platforms by themselves, unaccompanied by any other representatives of that conference.  After serious consideration was given to the matter, it was decided officially that, if there were any parades or meetings of L.D.F. and other forces at which speeches would be made, all the Parties participating in the Defence Conference would be invited to send a representative, who would get an opportunity of speaking. Little by little there was ample evidence of the desire and deliberate intention of Government Ministers to work away from that undertaking, that official agreement, that honourable pact and, deliberately and insidiously, to turn such platforms into political platforms.</P>
    <P>Of late that intention has become more pronounced.  On Sunday we had the Leader of the main Opposition invited to attend and to speak in Ennis. When he got down there he was informed that the Taoiseach, the head of the Fianna Fáil Party and one of the Deputies for that constituency, would be the only persons who would be allowed to speak.  The Leader of the main Opposition was brought there under false pretences.  The decision taken, whether by the L.D.F. locally or by military officers or by the Minister for Defence, reversed the decision arrived at by the Defence Conference.</P>
    <P>I think the House is entitled to some explanation as to why a decision on <Col N="166" /> matters of such grave importance as were outlined by the Taoiseach at Ennis, affecting vitally the livelihood and careers of very many junior officers, non-commissioned officers and men in the permanent forces, was taken and announced without any reference whatever either to Parliament or to the Defence Conference.  I think an explanation is due both to that conference and to Parliament.  I demand a full and thorough investigation as to why agreements arrived at by that conference, and unanimously agreed to, were dishonoured, and as to whether that was by instruction of the Minister or by decision of the local people or of Army officers.</P>
    <P>The continuation of the Defence Conference as a body that may have certain uses depends on a thorough investigation of all the circumstances associated with the public insult which was offered to the leader of this Party on last Sunday.  I am asking that a thorough and searching inquiry be made as to the responsibility for the decision to prohibit him or any representative of his or any representative of Clann na Talmhan, the Labour Party, or members of the Defence Conference from speaking at any such fixture.  When was the decision to prohibit such speakers arrived at?  Why was the Defence Conference not notified that their decisions had been reversed, and would no longer be carried out.</P>
    <P>I believe that that conference, representing all Parties, had very beneficial effects in this country.  I believe that their effort in getting a response to the appeal for men not only in the Army but in the other emergency forces should be recognised and appreciated, and that the Government and the people should be grateful.  I think that people who have had such a good effect by working together and bringing others together should not be treated in the manner in which members of that conference have been treated, particularly on last Sunday.  Either that body is a body to be consulted and to advise, or it is an entirely worthless body which should be discontinued.  If it is to be there to consult and to advise, then an explanation is required <Col N="167" /> as to why matters of major Army policy are enunciated from a platform which I am entitled to call a political platform in the town of Ennis, and are kept secret from the members of that conference.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister aware of the disturbing effect those remarks had on members of the permanent Army who are over 30 years of age?  I wonder is he aware of the number of calls, telephonic and otherwise, received by members of the Defence Conference following the publication of that ill-considered statement?  I wonder if he appreciates the ignominious position in which members of that conference were placed when they had to reply to everybody: &ldquo;I never heard a word about it in Dáil Eireann or in the Defence Conference.  Such matters were never discussed there.&rdquo; An investigation is required as to the circumstances in which all but one were prohibited from speaking at this meeting.  It was in order to give the Minister an opportunity of putting forward an explanation, if there is one, that I asked the permission of the Chair to raise this matter this evening.</P>

      <P>I can hardly imagine that the Taoiseach consciously contemplated announcing in Ennis on Sunday last an Army reorganisation policy which would give the nation an Army consisting, in the main, of persons of not more than 30 years of age, but, from the inquiries which have reached me, there is no doubt that the Taoiseach's remarks on that occasion have, whether correctly or incorrectly, created the impression that the Government contemplates an Army which would, except in the higher branches, have no personnel over 30 years of age. No other country in the world has contemplated building up its defence forces on a basis of that kind.  The whole Army organisation could not possibly be built up in any country on the basis of such an upper age limit. I can hardly imagine that the Taoiseach deliberately contemplates a situation of that kind, but his remarks on the occasion, as reported in the Press, are certainly open to that interpretation. <Col N="168" /> It is because his remarks are open to that interpretation that the Taoiseach's speech has caused grave disquietude amongst people serving in the Army at present who are over 30 years of age, who have decided to make the Army a career, and who expected that, in return for long service in the Army, they would be permitted to soldier there for their allotted span and receive a pension on retirement.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's speech, as reported in the Press, and that is the only information I have on the matter, might indicate that the Government contemplates premature demobilisation&mdash;the demobilisation of people who are over 30 years of age.  To issue a blanket order of that kind would cause very serious hardship to a large number of persons in the Army who would be unable to adjust themselves to civilian life with ease or smoothness in existing circumstances.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has already acknowledged, and as the whole nation, without political distinction, is aware, a great debt of gratitude is due to those who voluntarily joined the Defence Forces of this country during the past five years.  I think everybody in the nation desires that they should be treated considerately and fairly, and that no precipitate steps should be taken regarding their demobilisation until adequate provision has been made for them.  I think, therefore, that the Taoiseach might avail of this occasion, seeing that his remarks have caused some misunder-standing, to indicate in more detail what the Government's proposals are in so far as Army reorganisation is concerned, and that he should give the House an opportunity of discussing those proposals in a general way before any irretrievable decisions are taken by the Government.  I think the Taoiseach should assure those who are vitally interested in this matter that it is not the Government's policy to demobilise persons who are over 30 years of age, unless those demobilisations are accompanied by some adequate provisions for safeguarding the welfare of those who will be affected by them.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat surprised at the manner in which Deputy O'Higgins decided to raise this matter, and I must say that I was more surprised at the lines which he took in his speech. It must have been obvious&mdash;and I am sure it was clear to everybody who was listening to the speech in Ennis on Sunday, or who read it&mdash;that the Taoiseach was speaking of a post-war period.  He was making it clear to the members of the L.D.F. who were paraded there before him that there would be a place in the post-war army for the L.D.F.  The plans which he was speaking about had not been considered by the Government and, therefore, I am sure nobody will suggest that they should be placed before the Defence Conference before the Government had examined them.  When the plans have been examined by the Government, I have no doubt whatever that the Leaders of the various Opposition Parties will be consulted before the plans are implemented.  It surprises me to hear Deputy O'Higgins talking about the position of officers in the Army, as from his experience, he must surely know that these men have entered into a contract with the State and that the State will honour that contract.</P>

      <P>The question of inviting people to attend at the Ennis parade rested with the local committee, as also did the question of speaking from the platform.  When I was asked the question&mdash;as I was asked it&mdash; whether there were to be speakers other than the Taoiseach, I said&mdash;and the Army authorities agreed with me&mdash; that it was undesirable to have a series of speeches at an army parade, especially <Col N="170" /> in view of the fact that there was a dinner being given by the local committee, at which we all were invited to attend and speak.  If Deputy Mulcahy had anything of importance to add to the statements made by the Taoiseach, he was being offered a platform there in the hotel from which he could have made any statement he desired to make.  I made a speech at that particular function&mdash;it was late, and I had to get away, so I do not know who spoke after me&mdash;but I was rather surprised to find that Deputy Mulcahy had left.  I do not know why he did go away, as I understand he was invited to speak.</P>

      <P>This is, as I have mentioned in the beginning, a matter dealing with the post-war period.  I can say to Deputy Norton also that the contracts which we have entered into with the officers and the men of <Col N="171" /> the Army will be honoured.  There is no question whatever of having an army only of men of 30 years of age. It must have been clear to everyone who was listening that the personnel of whom the Taoiseach was speaking was the active fighting personnel.  We all know that the administrative personnel is of an older type.  The young men of 30 years of age, if they have administrative ability, too, would, in course of time, proceed into that particular branch.  When the Taoiseach was speaking of men of 30 years of age, it must have been obvious that he was speaking of the field force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, before he concludes, if he recollects that there was a decision arrived at by the Defence Conference, the Minister himself being one of the sponsors of it, that, if there were speeches at any such meetings, each Party participating in the conference would get an opportunity to send forward a speaker?  That was not subject to any decision by any local body, whether in Ennis or any other place. When the local committee in Ennis was approached on the question, they were very decent and very apologetic, and they said the military had prohibited it.  I want that looked into.</P>

      <P>I feel that other members of the Dáil on the platform would <Col N="172" /> have as much right.  However, there is very little time left now, and I am sure the Taoiseach is anxious to make the position clear as far as he is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly have difficulty in understanding what all this is about.  I was invited to distribute certain prizes and was very happy to do so; and it was intimated that I might, if I wished, address the parade, and that it would be well if I did so. I had two objects in my speech&mdash;first, to tell the members of the L.D.F. and the people of the country as a whole that, in regard to this matter of general post-war planning and policy, the question of national defence was not being forgotten.  The question of national defence, after the emergency, surely is as important&mdash;in certain directions, more important&mdash;than a lot of other things we are planning and thinking about.  I wanted to assure the people of the country&mdash;and, in particular, to assure the defence forces&mdash; that the question of national defence and the organisation necessary to defend our liberties in future was not being forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to want of courtesy, either to the Defence Conference or the House, surely it is not suggested that I can never open my mouth in public on any particular matter, without coming here first to the Dáil and telling the House I intend to make a speech.  I made it quite clear that all policies, or anything in connection with policies or post-war planning, would need legislation and would, of course, have to be brought before the Oireachtas and that these matters would have to be discussed before any official decisions would be made &mdash; even by the Government.  What has happened actually is that in regard to the committee for post-war planning, this question of our defence came up. Naturally, the first thing to do is to get from the military authorities their recommendations, in the light of their experience during the emergency through which we have just passed. The moment that these come along, they will have to be examined in detail by the Government as a whole, <Col N="173" /> and the Government will have to make up its mind to approve or disapprove of certain plans.</P>
    <P>When the Government has got to that stage, that would be the time&mdash; and I agree it is desirable in matters of defence&mdash;to get the agreement of all Parties.  It may or may not be possible to do that, but surely the Government is not going to be precluded, if it considers there are certain plans which are important from its point of view for the interests and safety of the country, from bringing these plans before Parliament if it is not able to get agreement between the different Parties?  As I say, it is natural that we should try, even in the post-war situation, to get agreement.  If I were trying to get agreement, I should be inclined to go to the heads of the political Parties and bring them in in a matter of this kind rather than to bring in the Defence Conference, which is a purely emergency organisation.  I certainly do not feel in the slightest that I have been discourteous either to the Dáil or to the Defence Conference in making the statement I made.  The thing that surprises me most is that anybody who read the speech would have any doubt as to what its general meaning was, that I was talking of post-war plans, and that I said what almost everybody who had any idea of military matters at all will agree with.  That is that if you want to have a first-line Defence Force, that must in the main be composed of young men.  I mentioned the age of 30 because I wanted to give some idea of what I meant by young men.  I said that the younger officers and men of the field force would have to be of an age which would be roughly about 30 because I wanted to give some idea of what I had in mind when I was talking of young men.  The whole question of recruitment for the Army, how we are to get the class of officers and men we want, what inducements are to be given, what is the career offered&mdash;all that would have to be thought out. My view and the view of everybody who has given any thought to the matter&mdash;I do not think there can be any question about it&mdash;is that the younger <Col N="174" /> the active elements of our Army are, the better will be its efficiency.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is the time to discuss the question of actual policy but there was an indication generally of the sort of problem we shall have to face.  My purpose was to get the people generally to understand that that is one of the problems.  Of course in addition to the front line defence, you will have a reserve.  If we want to preserve our liberty, unless there is some world organisation which will provide for collective security, I doubt if we can get on in future without having made preparations in advance so that we shall not find ourselves in the position in which we shall again have to build up a territorial force.  Some policy will have to be adopted to deal with that.  With regard to the disturbance which it is suggested officers feel, I cannot understand that statement at all.  Anybody who read my speech, anybody who attempted to read it at all carefully, and who was not content merely to glance at the headings in the newspapers, must be aware that I was talking of the future.</P>
    <P>The other point in my speech was to try to get the Defence Forces to stand steady.  I do not believe that we are out of the wood yet.  A very dangerous world position may arise, not merely before the war ends, but for a period after the war ends.  It would be a tremendous mistake, in my opinion, if having built up our Defence Forces with such care and trouble we were to think: &ldquo;Everything is grand, everything is fine&rdquo; and go on as if the emergency did not exist.  I think that would be very wrong.  The second purpose of my speech was to ask those in the Defence Forces to stand fast until those who are responsible for the safety of the State at the moment can say to them: &ldquo;Look here, the emergency is now past.&rdquo;  We are bringing in a scheme which we shall try as far as possible to dovetail into the present position so that we can, by a gentle transition, pass from our present position into the future.  There will be at the end of the term the question of how we shall manage so as to get into the new situation.  We <Col N="175" /> have contracts which of course will be kept.  One of the things which Parliament will have to consider is how we are going to get this transition, how we are going to manage so that we will have officers in future coming in and entering into contracts of a type different from those which exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that this question was raised at all as I cannot see the point of it.  I read my speech again in three newspapers since I heard this question was going to be raised to see was there anything in what I said which would reasonably justify anything like public anxiety.  I could not see it.  It might as well be said that if I am to talk about post-war planning in another direction as well as defence, I am not to speak about that unless I have first of all discussed it here in the Dáil.  The Dáil ought to discuss, in the main, definite propositions which are brought before it.  Everybody knows as I have indicated that changes of that kind can only come by legislation, that they will have to come before the Dáil.  The Dáil in the main has to deal only with practical propositions, complete and definite decisions, and <Col N="176" /> not with general considerations such as I had in mind when I was speaking.</P>

      <P>I can only tell the Deputy that I know nothing about the violation of an agreement, but what I do know is that when there was a question of recruiting, when we were asking for recruits and talking to the public in general, there were speeches from all Parties and I can see the reason for that.  On this occasion I went down to address a military parade and to present cups to the winners in a military competition.  I kept myself to things that dealt with matters of national defence and, as the Minister has pointed out, it was not a question of a series of speeches.  It was not a question of talking to the public in general.  That is quite a different thing in my opinion.  I know nothing about a violation of any agreement.</P>

      <P>Following the reopening of Bristol Channel ports to Irish coal-carrying ships the question of using ports other than Dublin was reviewed.  As only comparatively small quantities of coal are provided from Bristol Channel ports relatively few shipments are involved. It is frequently necessary to send ships which have discharged cargoes of Welsh coal to Scottish or English ports for their next cargoes. On consideration of distance alone it would not be the most economical use of our limited shipping facilities to send such ships to Cork.  Apart from this difficulty, I understand that, while the Bristol Channel ports are practically equidistant from Cork and Dublin, most of the ships at present engaged on the coal trade would lose considerable time if bad weather should be encountered in making the voyage to and from Cork.  This consideration is of particular importance during the winter months.  As long as it remains necessary to secure the quickest possible turn round of the ships I do not consider that I would be justified in arranging for the assignment of Irish coal-carrying vessels for discharge at Cork.</P>
