      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that great hardship and inconvenience is caused to the public waiting for buses in inclement weather, and if he will consider having put in force a system of advance booking for long distance buses so as to obviate waiting in a queue when no seat is available.</P>

      <P>With a view to minimising the inconvenience caused to bus passengers waiting in queues at the Dublin terminus long distance buses of the Great Southern Railways Company are, in practically every case, brought to the hazards as early as one hour before the scheduled starting time in inclement weather.  The question of a system of advance booking of tickets has been examined, but for many reasons has not been found practicable.  The machinery involved would be very unwieldy and costly, and advance booking would lend itself to speculation in tickets.  Even if a practical working arrangement could be reached there would be many disadvantages; for example, persons compelled to travel on business at short notice would be under a disadvantage as compared with holiday travellers, who would be in a position to make arrangements well in advance.  Persons coming to the city from country areas on business might find themselves unable to return home on the <Col N="256" /> same day unless they had secured return accommodation, which would involve correspondence and advance payment of fares.  For these and other reasons it is not proposed to adopt a system of advance booking on omnibuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise what the Minister has said in the case of fully booking a bus up, but, surely, the company could issue priority tickets up to say three-quarters of the carrying capacity of the bus, leaving the remainder to be filled by casuals.  In other places people are able to secure advance bookings, and surely it ought to be possible to do so in the open air. Will the Minister look into the matter again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the proposal by certain fuel distributors working for the board of assistance to acquire the garage situated between the private houses 58 and 60 Cabra Park, Dublin, a residential district which is over a mile away from the district of West Cabra where the fuel depôt is required; that the present tenants of the garage to be acquired are two young sons of a widow mother who is supporting a large family as a result of the business done in the garage, which is already supplying turf to close on 300 tenants in the Cabra area; and if, in view of these circumstances, and the fact that another official fuel depôt is within 200 yards of the said garage, he will consult with the board of assistance with a view to establishing the proposed depôt in a more convenient place and thus preventing the eviction of the brothers Farrell from the premises now proposed to be acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the next question on the Order Paper, which asks whether I am aware of the need <Col N="257" /> for a fuel depôt in Cabra.  I am aware that the need exists, and I am also aware that the Commissioners for the Dublin Board of Assistance took every step possible to acquire suitable depôts in all parts of the city for the administration of their fuel scheme, and having regard to the extent of the problem the system of distribution which they have organised has worked very successfully.  In the Cabra area, however, very great difficulty was experienced in securing suitable premises.  Finally, as a last resort, a depôt at the rere of 28 Norfolk Road was rented.  The use of these premises was objected to by a firm of solicitors on behalf of local residents.  The premises are altogether unsuitable and the commissioners propose to acquire premises adjoining Cloyne House in the vicinity.  These premises consist of a large yard, outhouses and sheds therein which are at present used for the stabling of a horse and dray.  I understand that the yard has not been used hitherto as a store for the disposal of turf.  Originally they were offered voluntarily for use as a fuel depôt, but the offer was later withdrawn. It was, therefore, necessary for the commissioners to seek compulsory powers to acquire them.  The firm of solicitors which objected to the use of the Norfolk Road depôt also objected to the proposed depôt at Cloyne House.  If all these objections were yielded to the area would be left without a fuel depôt.  As the objections are to the use of both premises, the commissioners propose with a view to providing the best available facilities for beneficiaries under the scheme to acquire the more suitable premises at Cloyne House.  At Norfolk Road depôt no cover could be provided for the applicants and the residents were inconvenienced by the congestion in the laneway behind the houses at Norfolk Road and Cabra Park as it was frequently blocked completely when fuel was being delivered to or distributed from the depôt.  The proposed new depôt will be a distinct improvement. Shelter is available and traffic congestion in the neighbourhood will be considerably reduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not <Col N="258" /> answered the last part of my question in which I asked if he was aware that the two sons of a widow, who is rearing a large family out of the proceeds of the business carried on in the premises about to be acquired, are about to be evicted.  The Minister must be aware that there are many more suitable sites available in the area for a depôt which, if acquired, would not cause the eviction of anybody.  The two sons of this widow are already engaged in the fuel business.</P>

      <P>Since receiving the deputation I have circularised local authorities in the matter and proposals for increased remuneration for permanent nurses have been sanctioned in three counties and for midwives in two counties.  Proposals for improved scales of salary for midwives in four other counties are at present under consideration.  I also informed nursing associations that they should submit statements of complaints which they desired me to take up with particular local authorities.  I also invited them to make representations on behalf of nurses whose salaries appeared to be below the average salaries paid to nurses in similar posts in the same or other similar institutions, and to make similar representations on behalf of midwives.  On 30th November I requested them to submit their separate complaints so far as possible simultaneously in order that they might be considered comprehensively for the whole country.  It is understood that the nurses' organisation has issued a questionnaire to its members with a view to eliciting the necessary data for such a submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I rose to address the House on the adjournment last evening, I rose with rather mixed feelings, because my mind was full both of amazement and amusement at the speech which I had heard delivered by the Deputy who preceded me in the debate.  I heard from a Deputy, who describes himself as a member of the Farmers' Party, a most bitter and virulent attack upon the farmers of Ireland.  I heard from a Deputy, the policy of whose Party is fixity of tenure, that fixity of tenure should be torn up and that 50-acre holdings all through the Midlands should be given to migrants from the West of Ireland. I heard a statement from a Deputy of a Party who are, as far as their political views have been made known &mdash;and they were clearly made known by their leader&mdash;in favour of complete separation from Great Britain and the establishment here of a Workers' Republic, the strange statement that the British market was the only market in which we could sell any produce.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy travelled outside the matters under discussion in this House, that the Chair was very lenient to him in the early part of his speech and that the Chair gently rebuked him towards the end when it was discovered that the transgressions were conscious transgressions.  I do not intend to follow the Deputy in so far as he was outside the limit of the matters under discussion here, in so far as he was outside matters which appertain to this Vote for Agriculture, but I will, just to a small extent, deal with matters which can possibly be brought under this Vote and which he has discussed, such as the enlargement of holdings in Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attack which was made upon the farmers of this country was to this effect, that the farmers are tyrants, bullying the farm labourers, and that the farmers are entirely unjustified in paying their workers a sum of £2 a week when English farmers are paying £8 and £10 a week and, therefore, it is <Col N="264" /> quite improper for Irish farmers to expect their workers to work for less than £8 or £10 a week.  I do not know where the figure of £8 or £10 a week, paid by English farmers to their farm labourers, comes from.  It certainly is not borne out by any official statistics I have seen with regard to farm wages fixed in England.  But let me assume for purposes of argument that there has been some recent order which escaped my attention and that £8 and £10 a week are being paid to farm labourers in England.  Then, I suggest to Deputy Cafferky that he should begin his reforms very close to home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky told us that he is not a farmer.  He is a member of a Farmers' Party, although he is not a farmer.  He is a carpenter and he told us last night that he is a member of the Woodworkers' Union, but there are farmers in Clann na Talmhan. Why not start converting them?  I think Deputy Donnellan is a farmer and I know that Deputy Cogan and Deputy Blowick are farmers.  I think they all keep workmen.  I wonder if they all pay their workmen £8 and £10 a week, and, if not, why not? Deputy Cafferky says it is quite a wrong thing for farmers not to pay their labourers £8 and £10 a week. Why does he not convert his neighbours beside him?  Before he starts attacking and abusing farmers in this House, would it not be very much better if he could say: &ldquo;Look at the magnificient converts I got.  I brought all my Party round.  They were dishonest fellows who paid only £2 a week a short time ago, but I brought them round to the £8 and £10 a week basis?&rdquo; I do not know whether speeches of that nature can be described as straightforward politics.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Cafferky said that the lands of the Midlands should be broken up and given in holdings of 50 acres to migrants from the West, and that then there would be no difficulty about solving the tenantry problem.  I am very strongly in favour of bringing migrants from the West of Ireland to the Midlands, but I do not hope that any large number of West of Ireland tenants can get farms as large as 50 acres.  Where is the land to come <Col N="265" /> from?  All the land of the Midlands is now occupied by farmers, and the great slogan of Clann na Talmhan during the last election was fixity of tenure.  In order that migrants can be brought up from the West of Ireland, it will be necessary to tear fixity of tenure right up.  There is no land which is not being occupied.  What is the policy of that Party?  Is it Deputy Cafferky's view?  Has Deputy Cogan changed from what he was during the last Dáil, or is that Party deliberately speaking with two tongues?  Has it one tongue for one part of the country and another tongue for another part?  Are they deliberately and openly political tricksters, or have they any definite policy on that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy calls the bad example.  Our views have always been put forward perfectly fairly, properly and logically.  If Deputy Donnellan is of the opinion that there should be fixity of tenure, let him say so; if he has changed his views, let him say so; but do not let us have one member of a Party preaching one thing and another member preaching another.</P>
      <P>We come then to the third matter: the English market.  Deputy Donnellan made it perfectly plain by his telegram to Mr. Seán McBride that his Party was in favour of the establishment in this country of a workers' republic.  The establishment of a workers' republic is certainly not the way to gain the British market.  It is the most fatal way of attempting to gain the British market.  Are they still in favour of the establishment of a workers' republic?  Is that their political outlook?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was raised on the question of the British market and as I am of the opinion, and as I think every sensible Deputy is of the opinion, that the gaining <Col N="266" /> of the British market is a matter of prime importance for Irish agriculture, I think I can venture to say that the Party which is in favour of leaving the British Commonwealth of Nations cannot be convinced of the importance of the British market.  If, however, you, Sir, think I should not pursue that matter further, I shall not do so.</P>

      <P>I have, and I very cheerfully obey the ruling of the Chair.  It was stated earlier in this debate that there was a difference between the inhabitants of the towns and the people who live upon the land, and Deputy Fagan spoke in reprobation of a statement made outside the House, that the inhabitants of the towns had backed up the country people and the farmers during the economic war.  I deny most specifically that the economic war was of the slightest benefit to the farmers.  In my view, it was a war as detrimental to the interests of the farmers as could possibly be waged.  I would not deal with the economic war at all were it not that I cannot understand the views of a Deputy who seemed to state that the economic war was over.  The economic war is not over; it is still on; and there never has been any placing of us again in the <i>status quo ante bellum,</i> in the position in which we were before the war broke out?</P>

      <P>What I am dealing with is the present condition of affairs and, in the present condition of affairs here, we are not in the position in which we were before the econo- war broke out and I say that the economic war is going on at this present minute.  I shall tell the House why.  Before the economic war broke out, there was no restriction of any kind on the import of any of our farm produce into the British market.  If we had an animal in any county here, whether Donegal, Kildare or Kerry, before the commencement of the economic war, that animal could be brought over to Great Britain and marketed as freely in Birkenhead, Glasgow or Shrewsbury as any animal reared in Devonshire, Yorkshire or Lanarkshire.  That is not the position now.</P>
      <P>The free entry into the market which was the existing condition of affairs prior to the economic war has not been restored and the same hostile methods of dealing with us, the same putting of quotas on stuff going into Great Britain, as was their weapon during the economic war is the weapon which is still being used against this country.</P>
      <P>If somebody, by negotiation, could get this country back into the position in which we were before the outbreak of the economic war, then the person who could effect that would be the greatest benefactor to this country that the mind could imagine.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be making some sapient remark but, unfortunately, he has not made himself sufficiently clear for me, with my limited intelligence, to be able to follow him.  As to the statement that the town and country are not in union at present, I wish to express as strongly as I can my disagreement.  In my opinion, and I think it is the opinion of most persons, if not every person in this House, the towns and the country, the urban interests and the agricultural interests, are not hostile.  They are supplemental one <Col N="268" /> to the other.  I believe that the majority of the people in this country are convinced of that.  Let me assume, even for a moment, that it were otherwise&mdash;and I am not putting my argument now on any principle of enlightened self-interest; I am putting my argument upon the simple line of duty&mdash;even if there were hostile interests between the country and the towns, which I deny, still in a crisis like this there is something higher which the people of this country, I am satisfied, do recognise, and that is that we are joint citizens of the same State, that we all rejoice and are proud to rejoice in the name of Irishmen, and that it is the duty of every person who has land in this country to labour as best he can to see that his fellow-Irishmen in the towns do not suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I come down to the actual problems facing us to-day I find, as has been pointed out by Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Fagan and other Deputies, that there is a shortage of seed wheat in this country.  That is indisputable.  During the last discussion upon this matter on the Estimate which was debated immediately after we had assembled in the autumn, Deputies from our side of the House, especially Deputies Morrissey and Fagan, put very clearly their views as to what the situation with regard to seed wheat would be.  The Minister then gave us a very reassuring statement that the situation as regards seed wheat would be perfectly all right.  It is not all right.  Spring wheat seed cannot be got.  One can pardon a Minister if he makes a mistake in a matter of judgment.  But no Minister with a competent staff behind him should be mistaken on a question of fact.  It is really very distressing to think that, when statements on a question of fact are made by Ministers in this House the country cannot place implicit reliance upon them.  When a Minister, with all the resources at his disposal, who ought to know whether there will be a shortage of seed or there will not be a shortage of seed, makes a statement which, in fact, turns out to be wrong, I say there must have been gross carelessness somewhere.  If we have to discount <Col N="269" /> every statement by Ministers, Ministers might as well not speak in the House at all.  If Ministers take rosy views which sound very nice for the purpose of one debate, but which will be found to be completely without foundation a very few months afterwards, then surely the whole confidence of this House and of the country in Ministers and in Ministerial utterances must be completely destroyed.</P>
    <P>This year, thank goodness, we have been fortunate in our spring weather for the getting down of our crops.  But let us look forward a little bit to the harvest.  Having fine weather now, we may not have fine weather in the harvest.  It must be the devout wish of everybody that we shall, but we may not have.  I heard complaints made in this House of a labour shortage in parts of this country, of farmers unable to get farm workers in sufficient numbers to save their crops last year.  I heard complaints that, while a number of soldiers were allocated to help farmers in their work, that was not well done or adequately done.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider this question of farm labour for the harvest.  So far as I know the country, at any rate, I think there is an abundance of permanent labour; but the casual labour which is required for the harvest is not easy to get and, in some places, cannot be got at all.  Harvest labour is not very highly skilled labour.  In fact, one might say it is not skilled labour at all.  I wonder if a volunteer band of workers could not be established who would go down and help farmers to gather their corn crops during the crucial three or four weeks when the corn crops are being garnered in this country.  I do not mean taking down the unemployed from the towns.  What I mean would be a volunteer corps of persons in quite a different position; that the young men who play football and tennis in the summer, the men in clerical positions, young, healthy and strong, would be asked: &ldquo;Will you spend your holidays helping the farmers on their farms?&rdquo; I believe that, if you set to work, you could organise a volunteer corps of workers who would help farmers who are short of <Col N="270" /> labour for their corn crops to get over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>The major portion of this debate on agriculture dealt with the question of dairy farming.  I do not know dairy farming from the inside.  I cannot speak with authority on this subject as, say, Deputy Bennett can, but it seems to me that the dairy farmers of this country are very greatly handicapped in their competition with the dairy farmers of New Zealand in that they are attempting, with a dual purpose animal, to compete with a nation that has a single purpose animal.  New Zealand is not relying on a dual purpose Dairy Shorthorn or anything of that kind.  New Zealand is relying entirely upon the milk breed, largely, I think upon the Jersey.  It must be perfectly obvious to everybody that if you have two persons in competition, one of whom goes in entirely for a milk breed of cattle and the other for a dual purpose animal, the person who is relying on the single purpose animal must be able to produce cheaper and, therefore, can oust the person who is relying on the dual purpose animal, because there is no real dual purpose animal at all.  You cannot get a perfect milker and a perfect beef animal at the same time.</P>
    <P>I heard the remark made recently about the beautiful heifers that were being driven through the streets of Dublin and sent away to be sold and that that represented a loss to Irish dairying.  I think I am only very slightly overstating my case when I say that if she is a beautiful heifer she is no use for milking at all.  I am very slightly over-stating my case when I say that the uglier the cow is the better milker she is.  If you get a cow with a beautiful straight back, that is simply a dream to look at, beautifully fat and quite a picture, I do not think anybody would buy her for dairy purposes, whereas if you see an extremely ugly cow, with a back like a razor almost, it is quite possible that she will astonish you with the number of gallons of milk which she will produce. In my view&mdash;and I think it is pretty generally acknowledged&mdash;the dual purpose animal cannot compete with the single purpose animal.  If Irish dairying <Col N="271" /> is to be put on a really substantial basis our farming economy must be based not on a mixture of dairy farming and the production of store cattle but on dairying and nothing but dairying. Of course, when I say nothing but dairying, that is, <i>qua</i> cattle.  There would be pig and poultry farming in addition.</P>
    <P>I hear a good deal about 400, 600 and 700 gallon cows.  Six hundred gallons are the limit at which it is estimated a cow becomes profitable, but I do not think that is really the correct measure by which the value of a dairy herd should be estimated.  I think the amount of food which the animal consumes should be taken into account.  Compare the British Friesian and the Jersey.  I have no statistics, but the British Friesian will eat possibly twice as much as the Jersey will eat and though the British Friesian may give a greater number of gallons of milk than the Jersey, she may be a very much more expensive animal.  The yield is not the sole consideration; it is the yield for the quantity of food consumed that should be the real test.</P>
    <P>On the question of dairy farming, after this war we may be in a very favourable position.  Remember, the tide of battle has already swept over Holland, Belgium and Denmark.  The dairy herds in these countries have already, probably, been consumed, or will be consumed before this war is over and it may take a great number of years before these countries will be able to get their herds into the condition in which they were before the outbreak of war.  It may take them eight or ten years, possibly less; but those are the years in which we ought to capture a very large portion of the foreign market for ourselves.  I think that we should be at the present moment poised for a swoop upon the British market, for our butter, poultry and pigs, the moment that this war ends.  We will still have our New Zealand rivals, but it is quite possible that, for some years, our Continental rivals will not be able to produce.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal of talk about the wealth of farmers and the <Col N="272" /> enormous sums farmers are making. There may be farmers in parts of this country, who have very first-class land and are carrying very large crops of grain, who are making very large fortunes at the present time, but there are other farmers in this country who are by no means making very large fortunes.  I wonder if those who talk about the wealth of farmers and the money farmers are making are aware of what has been the trend of the cattle trade for the last six months. I know that cattle that were bought last August, that were properly fed on hay or silage or good grass during the winter, cattle that one would expect would pay £6 or £7 for their winter keep are, at the present moment, not paying more than £1 or 30/- and, in certain cases, if they were badly bought, are not paying at all. In circumstances like that, it seems very difficult indeed to say that the farmers are rolling in money, or that they are coining unjustifiably.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the policy which was enunciated from the benches opposite by Deputy Patrick Hogan when he was Minister for Agriculture is still the sound policy for this country.  His view, of course, was that our main reliance should be upon our live stock and our live-stock products, and that we should feed our live stock as much as possible on the produce grown on our own land.  At the same time, he was of the opinion, which I think subsequent events have entirely justified, that, in order that our pig industry should be in a successful condition, the great thing was to have cheap food for our pigs; that imported cheap food, especially maise, was the raw material out of which we could manufacture the finished pork or bacon.  Unfortunately, that policy was departed from, and a combination of departing from that policy and establishing the now, for practical purposes, defunct Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board has had the effect of destroying our pig industry.  It is upon the revival of our pig industry and upon not merely the revival but the extension of our poultry industry that we must place reliance, in my opinion, next to our live-stock industry in the shape of cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> Certain Deputies have spoken about the organisation of agriculture in the future.  No doubt, Irish agriculture will require a certain amount of organisation in the coming years, but I should like Deputies to bear in mind that, although interference with the farmer may be very beneficial, at the same time it may be horribly detrimental, and that the experience we have had of attempted organisation in recent years far from being beneficial has proved itself very detrimental indeed to the welfare of Irish agriculture. I hope it will not be thought that every alteration is an improvement, but that we will continue to build upon our old foundations. Indeed, I think that any person setting about an improvement of Irish agriculture could not take a better watchword than the watchword which Sir Horace Plunkett and Father Finaly coined when they established the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and that motto is: &ldquo;Help the farmer to help himself.&rdquo;  It may be, and I think it would be, very beneficial to farming generally if experimental farms were established throughout this country.  Agriculture is making great strides in various parts of the world.  It will take a very long time before the knowledge derived from experiments in other countries has permeated down to the ordinary farmer in remote districts in this country.</P>
    <P>Agricultural papers are not widely read; amongst small farmers they are not read at all and, if there are no farms near them to demonstrate what can be done, there is no method by which they can acquire knowledge of such things as, let me say, improved grass seed mixtures, or soil analysis and other things of that kind with which Deputy Hughes dealt exhaustively and on which I do not wish to follow him.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture if he would consider approaching the Minister for Forestry and asking him if some of the land which he has got at his forestry stations, and which is not required for forestry purposes, could be used as experimental farms.  There is a forestry station, for instance, at Ashford, in Galway, on the borders of Mayo, <Col N="274" /> and there is a good deal of land there which is not being used for forestry purposes at all.  They have also acquired Dunsandle, County Galway, and they will not require the whole of it for forestry purposes.  Mote Park, in Roscommon, I am told, has also been acquired as a forestry station.  I would suggest to the Minister that those forestry stations should set up three experimental farms.  If he takes Ashford, which is in a poor part of the country, he should set up about a 20-acre farm, farming it in the ideal way in which a 20-acre farm ought to be farmed.  Some people in this House may smile when they hear of a 20-acre farm, but remember that that is the size of the majority of the farms there; in fact, the majority of the farms in Connaught are far below 20 acres.  If you take a 20-acre farm, and show the ideal way in which that farm should be run, with proper rotation, proper seeds of every kind and proper stock, showing the people completely up-to-date farming on that scale, it would be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I would then go to a place like Dunsandle, where the land is very much better, and establish there a 100-acre farm, or, if you like, a larger farm than that, and let the Department of Agriculture demonstrate what they consider to be the perfect way of running a farm of that size.  Of course I know that we have agricultural colleges, and that they do a certain amount of farming, but it is not the same thing. There they have all the most up-to-date machinery that can be got.  The 20-acre farm that I am speaking about, which would be a one-horse farm, as it were, would have to be worked with the amount of machinery which would be at the disposal of an ordinary person running that 20-acre farm.  I think you will not get local farming brought up to the highest level to which it can be brought in view of the recent progress in agricultural knowledge unless you establish experimental farms of that kind.  I think it would also be very useful in another way: we would see the costings; we would see how very little is really made out of farms of that nature.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that I <Col N="275" /> should like to say to the House, but, in a debate of this nature in which a large number of Deputies wish to partake, I do not think it is quite playing the game to speak at too great length; neither do I think it is quite playing the game to repeat in different words what has been said by previous speakers.</P>

      <P>This debate has now gone on for a considerable time.  I wondered, when the last speaker was talking, if we were debating the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture or something in connection with the Land Commission.  In the main, the members of the House can be quite proud of themselves for the way in which they have approached this Estimate.  It has not come in for any scathing remarks.  Some of the Deputies were critical in what they had to say about it, but for all that they approached it in a business like way. The three points on which the debate mainly hinged were: (1) a more intensive agricultural education; (2) the dairying industry about which I know nothing; and (3) food production, which I think is the most important of all, and at the present time should be treated as a very serious matter. That brings me back to the remarks made by the last speaker when he said that he believed that the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was the best policy for this country. I wonder if we had that policy in operation to-day what would be the position of our people?  I will say no more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards agricultural education, a very great amount of work has been done both by the Department of Agriculture itself and the agricultural colleges throughout the country.  We have a number of agricultural instructors who are doing very good work indeed.  They have been of great benefit to the people.  The unfortunate part of it is that our farmers, in general, do not avail of their services as widely as they should. The lectures given by the agricultural instructors on crop rotation, grass seed mixtures and seed testing <Col N="276" /> have been invaluable to all those who have followed them, as well as the talks over the radio.  Mention was made by the Minister, when introducing the Estimate, of the sums of money that are expended on publicity such as on posters and advertising in the newspapers.  That is all very well in itself, but I think that neither posters for advertising in the newspapers are of the importance of the discourses that we hear over the radio from officials of the Department and from practical farmers.  I am sorry to say that these discourses have not got sufficient circulation.  It is only a small percentage of farmers who have the wireless in their homes.  Consequently, very few of them hear the very fine talks that are given over the radio.  I believe that, instead of putting advertisements in the newspapers or issuing posters, it would be much better to pay, if necessary, both the national newspapers and the local newspapers for the publication of the discourses that are given over the radio.  In that way, the importance of these discourses would be brought home more to all the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that the elementary education that the agricultural instructors are giving by way of lectures and practical demonstrations throughout the country is the education that is most necessary at the present time.  All this talk about higher education is all right in its own way.  It is all right for that small percentage of the people who will make use of it and demonstrate and theorise to the rest of us, but I would not like to go so far that all farmers would be expected to take out degrees in agriculture.  I believe that the worst thing that could happen to this country would be if we were all to become collar-and-tie farmers.  That type of farmer would not produce very much food.  He might be very good theoretically, but from the practical point of view he would be a hopeless failure in many instances.  All the agricultural instructors have, of course, gone through the various courses in the colleges.  The unfortunate part of it is that a bigger number of them is not employed.  I think it would be advisable if more money were spent in that <Col N="277" /> way: that, for every agricultural instructor we have at the present time, we would have at least three from this on.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the picture.  A number of young farmers have been turned out by the agricultural colleges. They have gone through the courses there and have even come to Albert College and got their degrees there.  When, however, they got their degrees, their anxiety was not to return to work on the farm but to get a position under the Department of Agriculture.  Members of the Dáil know very well that since the compulsory tillage scheme and the farm improvement schemes were started, hosts of those young people have come along to Deputies asking for recommendations that would be of help to get them into what they would look upon, perhaps, as a soft job.  That was their reaction to a college course.  Consequently, I would not like to see all our farmers having to undertake a course of secondary education before they could be regarded as good farmers. No matter how scientific we may become, or how well educated we are, in farming at any rate there is one thing that we cannot disentangle from knowledge of that kind, and that is, that we have to give the knowledge the application of energy and, to a certain extent, labour, and hard labour in many instances.</P>
    <P>We have been told all about New Zealand, Denmark and the rest.  I understand that Deputy Hughes himself is a very practical farmer.  I do not know if he went either to Denmark or to New Zealand to find out how to run his farm properly.  He gave a quotation from the <i>Trade Journal</i> yesterday to indicate that there was a decrease in our agricultural output and production over a certain period.  I would be very much surprised to learn that there was a decrease in the production and output on Deputy Hughes' own farm.  I do not believe there has been any such decrease on the Deputy's farm.  If we want practical demonstrations, there is no reason why we should have to set up experimental farms at a cost to the State.  We have a number of farmers all over the country, good <Col N="278" /> practical men, who are making a success of farming.  Many of them have succeeded in doing that without having had the advantage of a college education.  Why not hold up such men as a model to other farmers instead of carrying us over the seas to New Zealand and Denmark for examples? I think that those men could offer the best illustrations and demonstrations to our own people.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I know nothing about the dairying industry.  Since I became a member of the House 12 years ago I have heard the subject debated time and time again.  Seemingly the real grievance with dairy farmers is that they are not getting a sufficient price for their milk.  That may be true, of course&mdash;I am not in a position to judge&mdash;but I believe that there must be something wrong also with those who are engaged in the dairying industry itself.  It has been rightly stated by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that we cannot have the two ends of the stick, that we cannot have the good milk-giving cow and the good beef cattle at the same time.  Deputy Hughes made a suggestion the other day to the effect that the Hereford bull should be eliminated.  I do not think that would be very popular all over the country.  After all, it is a very circumscribed area that has the dairying industry as its chief industry, and there are areas of the country where the Hereford calf is very useful and suitable for the farmers.  It is an animal that is early to market and brings in a useful amount of cash after a year or one and a half years, and if there is to be any such thing as the elimination of the Hereford it will have to be on a regional basis.  Have the double dairy bull in the dairying areas, but certainly do not cut out the Hereford in the other areas of the country where he is of such great importance.</P>
    <P>I will now come to a point made by Deputy Halliden, who put his case very fairly indeed, except in so far as he said the Government had been parsimonious in their treatment of the dairying industry.  From his point of view, that may be quite right, but I think the Government have gone a long way to <Col N="279" /> meet the claims of the dairying industry. He mentioned cow testing, and said only 4 per cent. of the cows of the country were submitted for test even though the association had been established for 25 years.  His complaint was that the Government had not gone far enough to give proper remuneration to the supervisors engaged on this work.  I understand that there are cooperative creameries in many parts of the country, particularly in the South of Ireland, that have large sums of money to their credit, perhaps not as a result of what was made on the purchase of milk and the sale of butter, but because they have gone into numerous other lines of business.  The fact remains that they have money made as a result of their business and enterprise.  If cow testing is so valuable in the minds of those who are, or ought to be, in a position best to judge, I think it would be up to the dairying industry itself&mdash;those engaged in the dairying industry&mdash;to have a sufficient number of supervisors provided, and to pay them the remuneration suggested, instead of looking to the State.</P>
    <P>Food production forms the most important part of this debate, and everyone is agreed that it is most essential, particularly at the present time.  The Minister made a statement the other day which certain Deputies have misrepresented as fully as they possibly could.  They declared that he said the farmers were wealthy, that they were more wealthy now than at other times.  He made no such statement. He said the farmers were better off now than they were before the war, and were better off than at any time since 1920.  That was by no means an inaccurate statement.  At the same time he made it quite plain that he was not alleging in any way that the farmers were in a strong financial position or that they had become very wealthy.  The farmers are much better off than they were because of the fact that they have a sense of security, at the present time and since the war started, that no other section of the community has.  That is largely due to their own labour, and because of the fact that they produce on their own <Col N="280" /> land the essentials that are required to make life fairly pleasant&mdash;that is, good staple food such as wheat and oats, and also bacon, eggs and butter. That is where they come to be better off than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>But the Minister's statement was twisted to bring in something else, and I am sorry to say that a Deputy like Deputy Norton who, I am sure, is very interested in the welfare of other sections of the community, struck a certain note which, I think, was a very inadvisable note to strike.  He mentioned that the agricultural labourers are in a worse position to-day than at any time for the past 25 years.  That is a statement with which I do not agree, and I am sure that the agricultural labourers do not agree with it either.  The Government brought in a measure in 1937 to improve the wages of the labourers and to see that they would not be treated as slaves.  A board was set up and since that time the weekly earnings of the agricultural labourers have gone up by 100 per cent.  Whether that Act is being enforced rigidly or not I do not know, but I am aware that all farmers who have an interest in their agricultural labourers&mdash;and they ought to have an interest in them&mdash;are not in any way trying to evade what was provided for in that Act and what was established by the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>I hold that the agricultural labourers are a very important section of the community and, as one who works alongside them and eats at the one table with them, and regards them as just as good as, if not better than himself, I hold that if there is to be a further increase in agricultural wages, then the farmers also will have to get a corresponding increase for their produce. If that is done what is going to happen?  Where is the extra money to come from?  Has it not to be found in the pockets of the other sections of the community, the people whose case was put forward so strongly here when the Vote on Account was considered last week, the people with the small fixed incomes and the people who, perhaps, are receiving assistance in one way or another?  An increased price <Col N="281" /> for the farmers and increased wages for the labourers are going to have their reactions in that way.  The money will have to be found in the pockets of other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to walk down O'Connell Street or through Grafton Street or some of the other principal streets of the City of Dublin and see there a certain show of wealth, but if we walk through other portions of the city covering a far greater area than O'Connell Street or any of the other swanky streets, we will observe conditions totally different.  Are we to put over on the unfortunate people there that increased cost?  That is what the Government has to consider, and has been considering, and it is a very big difficulty.  I should like to see the agricultural labourers getting a much higher wage, but I am firmly convinced that, even though we farmers at present have the best of things, we would not be in a position to pay the increased wage mentioned unless we placed an additional burden on the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk of slavery and slavish conditions in connection with agricultural labourers. The people who make remarks of that kind are people who know nothing about the agricultural labourers.  They have never worked with them and have been far away from them at all times. There is no real slavery in agriculture to-day, because the greater part of agricultural work is carried out by tractor-powered machinery and horse-drawn machinery.  I remember real slavery in agriculture when I was a youngster, 35 years ago.  The crops in many instances were sown by hand with a spade; corn and hay were cut with a scythe; and corn threshed with a flail in the winter time.  We have none of that now.  With regard to conditions, the farmer who employs his men all the year round&mdash;and he is the greatest asset to the community; I do not mind making the fellow pay right well who will keep a man only for a few months of the harvest when he is in a bit of a hole&mdash;is not so tyrannical as some people would lead us to believe.  They are a very humane type of people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> We hear all this talk about a weekly half holiday and an annual holiday.  I fear we have a long way to go before that will be possible in this country. There is no comparison whatever between the agricultural labourer and the labourer working in the town, because the agricultural labourer is out in the healthy atmosphere of the country.  There is a big difference between the agricultural labourer and the blacksmith's apprentice, a man who gives three or four years to serving his time to the trade, and there is no comparison at all between them. The good farmer who wants to get his work done will find plenty of work for his workmen to do, during the bad weather in the winter, around his houses and his yard.  He will not keep them out in a downpour.</P>
    <P>The only slavish part of agriculture at present is what is due to the variation in the weather at the time the beet is being pulled.  It is due also, of course, to the fact that the sugar company insists on having the beet brought to the factory within a prescribed period.  That week or fortnight of work happens to be very slavish, but that is all the agricultural work which I see is very slavish. I think it very inadvisable and injudicious at a time like this to attempt to make the agricultural labourers believe that they are being enslaved, that they are only slaves.  It is not a good or a wise policy for the agricultural labourer, the farmer or the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The coming harvest, I hope, will be much better than was the past harvest, but as the previous speaker rightly said, all efforts should be concentrated on organising all sections for the saving of the crop.  If we had sufficient machinery in the country which could be purchased, there would not be so much need in that respect, but unfortunately we have not got that unlimited supply of machinery.  It is more important for the people of the towns to co-operate than it is even for the farmers, because the farmers will not starve, while the people in the towns are running a great risk and a very grave danger, and I believe that if the business <Col N="283" /> people and other people in the towns got together, they could do a good deal to help the farming industry. The farmers will not ask them to work for nothing.  I have never yet known a farmer who was not prepared to pay his labourer what he agreed to give him, and I am quite sure they would be prepared to pay at a time like this for any help they got.  There are a number of people who are not registered at the labour exchange in the towns who could be very useful, but it is a case of not being asked and not being organised.</P>
    <P>It is up to the people of the towns and cities to treat this as a very serious matter.  I do not say at all that they have not helped the farmers in the past.  I always recognise the fact that our enjoyment of the security we have at present, in having the greater part of the land divided and landlordism smashed, is due largely to the people of the towns.  It was the artisans and small businessmen all over the country who helped to achieve that position, and what they were prepared to do in the past, even though it cost many of them a good deal, I am quite sure they are patriotic enough to do now, if only it is put up to them.  Finally, I hope that this whole subject of agriculture will be treated in a very serious and businesslike fashion, and that any criticism or suggestions put forward will be put forward with good intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is a very astute parliamentarian. He knew perfectly well that Deputy Donnellan and I were absent from the House on important business, in common with representatives of the other political Parties, while Deputy Cafferky was speaking last night.  He knew, therefore, that we had no opportunity of hearing what Deputy Cafferky had to say, and he proceeded to give the House his version of what the Deputy said.  The Deputy has informed me that the statements attributed to him by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney were not made by him.  The Deputy accused Deputy Cafferky of having said that farmers should be <Col N="284" /> compelled to pay their workers the same wages as are being paid to agricultural workers who travel to Great Britain.  Deputy Cafferky said nothing of the kind, as I am informed.  He did draw attention to the problem which exists, owing to the fact that the custom has prevailed in the congested areas of the west of Ireland of workers travelling to Great Britain and earning in a few months sufficient to maintain themselves for the remainder of the year, and he naturally pointed out how reluctant these people would be to work in this country for lower wages which would not enable them to accumulate the same amount of savings as they would accumulate in two or three months in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>That is a problem which will require to be tackled.  There is no doubt whatever that in many parts of Ireland there is a labour problem and a shortage of labour.  Unless we are able to provide a means by which the surplus workers of one area may be able to secure employment in other areas where workers are lacking, it will be difficult to deal with production and an expansion of production on the lines we desire.</P>
      <P>That, I think, was a reasonable statement on Deputy Cafferky's part. So far as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney accused Deputy Cafferky of stating that he desired the migration of people from the west of Ireland to lands in the midlands to a far-reaching extent, I want to say that this Party stands for fixity of tenure, that it has made it a plank in its platform and that, as Deputies will recall, I tabled a motion demanding that fixity of tenure be restored and, as soon as the Private Members' Order Paper becomes less congested, I intend to renew that motion.  Who destroyed fixity of tenure in this country?  It was Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's own Party in the Land Act of 1923.  I do not want to dwell any further on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with agricultural policy we have to divide our attention more or less between conditions as they exist during the emergency and as they will exist in the post-war period. To my mind we, as the Parliament of <Col N="285" /> this State, must direct our attention, first of all, to the immediate present and consider very carefully how we will meet any situation which may arise within the next few months.  We have to plan carefully and efficiently. So far as this debate has proceeded up to the present, there was a certain air of unreality about it, inasmuch as a great deal of time was devoted to post-war agricultural problems while very little attention was directed to the problems of the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Last week I raised a question in connection with our seed wheat supplies. I do not want to hurt the Minister's feelings by drawing his attention to a very grave mistake which appears to have been made by his Department in regard to the assembling and storage of spring seed wheat last year.  But I do want to direct his attention to the urgent need for making sure that no mistake will be made in regard to the conserving of seed wheat supplies for the following year.  We want to ensure that, wherever good spring wheat is sown this year, a careful record will be kept of it and that wheat will be earmarked for preservation for the following year.  That is an elementary precaution which the Minister should be now planning to take for the coming year.  There are various methods by which the seed wheat supply can be safeguarded.  It is desirable, first of all, that the growing crop should be inspected before harvesting and that, as far as possible, farmers should be encouraged and induced to store as much as possible of the spring wheat for the following year, because there is no method by which spring seed wheat can be stored more efficiently and securely than unthreshed in the sheaf, provided of course that the stacks in the haggard are properly constructed on frames to safeguard the wheat from the depredations of rats and mice and other losses, and that they are properly thatched and secured.  Some definite inducement should be offered to farmers to store the largest possible amount in their own haggards.  That is the first essential.  Then adequate precautions should be taken to see that merchants who undertake to store spring wheat&mdash; I am referring principally to spring <Col N="286" /> wheat because it is more likely to go wrong&mdash;will store it properly in good condition, not heaped together in too large quantities, and that all precautions will be taken to preserve the germination and fertility of the grain.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I want to say that there is bitter disappointment amongst farmers, in my own constituency probably more than in any other, inasmuch as they have been to a large extent compelled to purchase imported seed wheat.  I do not want to say anything against the quality of that wheat; it would not be wise to say anything at the moment.  But, having regard to the fact that this is seed which is not acclimatised and about which there can be no very great certainty as to its quality, I think the Minister should give some assurance that, in cases where there are failures which can be proved to be due entirely to the seed, some recompense will be made to the grower.  If such an assurance were given, it would make for a better feeling and more confidence on the part of the growers.  I do not intend to pursue that question any further.</P>
    <P>I want to say that farmers in my constituency, and I think in every other constituency, are falling in wholeheartedly with the efforts to produce the wheat supplies that are required.  We do hear complaints that it is rather unfair that Wicklow should be compelled to grow wheat to the extent of one-tenth of the arable land, when you have fertile counties like Monaghan compelled to grow only one-twenty-fifth. It may be due to some influence that Monaghan is getting off so lightly as compared with poor Wicklow. I think, however, the farmers are wholeheartedly falling in with the Governmental policy and the national policy in regard to supplying the nation's needs.  The sowing season is now so well advanced that we hope that, no matter what happens, the maximum amount, not only of wheat but other essential crops, will be got into the larder.  The weather has been favourable and I think the farmers have taken full advantage of the favourable circumstances to do their utmost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> When we come to consider the question of harvesting the very extensive and, I hope, very much increased cereal crops during the coming year, no member of the House and no farmer would be justified in ruling out the possibility of a much more serious shortage or even a complete elimination of supplies of imported tractor fuels.  It is the duty of the Department of Agriculture, and it is the duty of this House, and of farmers, to envisage the situation which would arise in those circumstances.  I am quite confident that even in the circumstances of a complete elimination of imported tractor fuels, we would still be able to cope with the very increased harvest of the coming year, but it would require a considerable amount of planning in advance, and of organisation. In the first place, a very large percentage of our reapers are drawn by tractors.  If we are compelled to substitute horses for tractors in all cases, it will mean that the existing number of reapers and binders in the country would be altogether insufficient to cope with the harvest, because a tractor-drawn reaper and binder would cover a much larger area than a reaper and binder drawn by any team of horses.  I think that must be taken into consideration.  Therefore, we will have to face the fact that the entire harvest cannot be tied by mechanical reapers and binders unless we are able to import in the near future a considerable number of reapers.  It is not too likely that we will be able to do so. We will have then to face up to the fact that, in areas where the science of tying corn by hand is unknown, we will have to resort to that method, and, if that is the case, it will require mobilisation of man-power.  It will also require some instruction and some training of persons who are entirely new to this operation.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem to be faced, particularly in the midland counties and the big tillage counties, where the tractor and the reaper and binder have displaced hand work. Now is the time to begin planning and to make all the arrangements for the recruitment of the additional labour that will be required for that work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> It will also be necessary to make arrangements for the provision of additional horse-power for such work. Deputy O'Reilly drew attention to the fact that in the County Meath, where, I suppose, cereal crops are now grown as extensively as in the County Wexford, there are less than half the number of agricultural horses.  That, again, will create a problem to which the Department of Agriculture will have to direct immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong&mdash;I do not think there are any statistics available&mdash;but I think at least 80 per cent. of our cereals are threshed by oil-driven engines. At any rate, it would be somewhere between 75 and 80 per cent. Have the Minister and his Department given attention to the problem of getting cereal crops threshed?  I believe that here, again, is an extremely difficult problem.  About 25 per cent. of the threshers are steam-driven. The number possibly could be increased by putting into commission steam threshers which have been discarded and which may be lying idle.  I think the number of such threshers which would be suitable would be very small.  We have then to consider the means by which 70 or 75 per cent. of the harvest is to be threshed.  The problem would be solved to a certain limited extent by getting farmers to store their cereal crops securely and extend the threshing period, perhaps, by three or four months.  That would help.  There are other suggestions which would naturally occur to any intelligent Minister or member of this House.  For example, if electric current were available in sufficient quantity it might be possible to direct a certain amount of it to threshing operations, particularly in areas adjacent to villages and towns, but there does not seem to be any great prospect in that direction.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle one views the question, one thing is certain, that if there is a further decrease in the amount of tractor fuel and in the number of mechanical aids available, we shall have to compensate for that to a large extent by recruiting additional man-power to agriculture.  For that additional man-power we have to draw on whatever sources are available. <Col N="289" /> That is a problem in regard to which information should be immediately collected from each county to ascertain the deficiencies that exist in regard to labour.  Every farmer, particularly every large farmer, should be asked to report as to whether he is certain of having a sufficient amount of labour for the harvest or not.  If he reports that he would require additional labour, the Department should immediately take ways and means of ensuring that that labour will be available.</P>
    <P>Of course, that does not end the problems that would arise in the event of a shortage of tractor fuels, motor spirit, and so on.  The problem of collecting and conveying cereals to the mills would present many difficulties. There would be greater difficulty in collecting and conveying sugar beet to the sugar factories.  All those are matters which have to be considered very carefully.  Plans in regard to them must be carefully laid, and all possible precautions must be taken to guard against a breakdown.  There is no doubt that we can solve those problems if we face up to them.</P>
    <P>There are two attitudes in regard to matters of this kind which are to be deplored.  One is the attitude of the man who says: &ldquo;This prospect is too deplorable to be considered.  We must not consider it at all.  It could not be dealt with.&rdquo;  That is a foolish and undesirable attitude for anybody to take up. On the other hand, we have the foolishly optimistic idea that everything will come right; that nothing can go wrong; that, while misfortunes may happen to other countries, they could never happen to us.  We should not adopt either of those lines of thought. Instead, we should be prepared to take note of what has happened in other countries, face the realities of the situation, and lay our plans to overcome whatever problems may arise.</P>
    <P>In this debate, we have been asked to consider a number of motions which are on the Private Members' Order Paper.  One stands in my name <Col N="290" /> and in the name of Deputy O'Driscoll, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in order to promote the expansion and development of the agricultural industry and to safeguard the interest of farmers and farm workers in the post-war period, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should immediately adopt a long-term policy guaranteeing economic prices for all the main products of agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been advocating that policy for a long time in this House.  I have held the view that you cannot get in agriculture the measure of efficiency which everybody in this House desires and which every speaker in this debate has advocated unless you have some security of price, some security of income for the agricultural producer.  It was very nice to hear Deputy Childers, in a refined Oxford accent, lecturing us upon our deficiencies.  He tells us that we are a second-rate agricultural country, but he also assures us in a patronising tone that if we made a serious effort we might succeed in becoming a first-rate agricultural country.  I should like to know in what way the present Government, of which Deputy Childers is a supporter, has contributed towards making this a first-rate agricultural country?  Did the policy of deliberately depressing all agricultural prices during the first five years of the present Government's administration tend towards efficiency? Did the indiscriminate slaughtering of good calves tend in that direction? If we are to have efficiency, the farmer, whether he is extensively engaged in tillage or whether he engages in dairying or in any other branch of agriculture, must be able to look forward to a number of years of secure markets and secure prices.  Farming is not a short-term occupation.</P>
    <P>It is not an occupation that can be conducted from week to week.  It is an occupation in which the intelligent operator must plan far ahead.  We all know that the ordinary crop rotations are usually on a five-year term.  We know that it takes at least five years to produce a dairy cow.  All those facts <Col N="291" /> are familiar to us.  Therefore, unless the State stands behind the farmer, and gives him a measure of security, it is impossible for the farmer to plan efficiently.  I am reminded of this by an incident which happened some years ago when the Department of Agriculture, through the public Press, advised the women of this country to sell their turkeys early at Christmas time, thus preventing a glut in the markets later on.  A large number of women took the Department's advice and sold their turkeys early, with the result that the price afterwards increased by more than 6d. per lb.  One of the angriest women I have ever met was a woman who had sold all her turkeys early&mdash;if she could only lay her hands on Dr. Ryan, what she would not do with him. That is just one example of what foolish, lighthearted, irresponsible advice given by the Department of Agriculture can lead to.  Planning must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>When we state in this motion that we want guaranteed prices for the main agricultural products, I want to make it clear that we are not demanding guaranteed prices for every agricultural product.  I do not think it would be either possible or desirable for the State to guarantee economic prices for everything that the farmer produces, but there are at least four or five main lines of production with regard to which guarantees could and should be given.  First of all, there is wheat.  No matter what conditions may prevail in the post-war period, we will require to grow a minimum amount of wheat in this country.  It must be at least 50 per cent. of our maximum requirements, and it would probably be desirable to grow even more than that.  In order to ensure that growers of wheat will take a deep interest in this branch of agriculture, that they will direct their attention to the improvement of the strains and varieties of seed as well as to the improvement of the methods of production, it is desirable that there should be a long-term guarantee on the part of the State that prices will be economical&mdash;that they will even be generous.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty whatever in connection <Col N="292" /> with the implementing of that undertaking, because wheat is being grown and will be grown exclusively for the home market.  The same considerations apply to sugar beet.  Sugar beet growing is an industry which was introduced into this country 16 or 17 years ago.  It was an industry which was entirely new to this State, but once the farmers were shown that it was reasonably profitable, they put their energy, their enterprise, and their skill into the cultivation of beet with remarkable success.  I think I can safely say that the sugar beet growing industry is firmly established here, and it has a home market for its product. It has increased the national wealth enormously.  It has provided a huge volume of employment within the State.  It is in every respect a sound national industry, and it is one in regard to which the State should have no hesitation whatever in guaranteeing economic prices over a long period.</P>
    <P>Of course, sugar beet growing was for many years denounced by orthodox economists as being unsound.  We were told that it was a subsidised industry. I suppose it is, but it has justified the subsidisation. In that respect I want to say that the deep-seated prejudice which some orthodox economists have for subsidisation should be dispelled when they consider the success that has attended sugar beet growing.  The sugar producing industry in this country is a sound industry which provides a large amount of employment. It is also of importance since it tends to raise the fertility of the soil.  That is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>The next item of importance to be considered is butter.  Here again there are thousands of reasons, many of which have already been emphasised in this debate, as to why butter production and the dairying industries should be preserved and given adequate guarantees for their security over a long period.  What is true of butter is also true of bacon pigs and eggs.  With wool and flax, these are all branches of agricultural production which could be safeguarded over a long period.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned wheat, sugar beet, butter, bacon pigs, eggs, wool, flax <Col N="293" /> and seed potatoes.  There is one other branch of agriculture in respect of which I would also suggest that long-term guarantees in regard to price should be given, and that is, the stall-feeding of cattle.  If the agricultural products which I have mentioned are guaranteed a market and an economic price over a long period, the farmer can look forward to a certain security of income in the future.  He can plan for raising the standard of efficiency on his farm, and for improving the equipment on his holding and his farm buildings.  He can feel a certain sense of security.</P>
    <P>We have from time to time talked a lot about fixity of tenure.  What our forefathers meant when they asked for that was, security in the possession of their homes.  To-day the farmer who has not some measure of security in regard to prices has not security in the possession of his home, even though he may have legal fixity of tenure in his land.  How many farmers were driven out of their homes during the 20 years that elapsed between the outbreak of this war and the end of the last one?  They were driven out by reason of the collapse which took place in agricultural prices, and insistence, on the part of the State, that farmers should continue in production regardless of whether they were paid for their labour or not.  Now, we farmers are sometimes accused of being unpatriotic and disloyal to the State when we demand fair recompense for our work, but there is no lack of patriotism and no failing in our duty to the State when we make that demand, because we realise that, unless the farmer is adequately recompensed for his work, he cannot continue to produce.  He may endeavour to keep on producing at an uneconomic price, but sooner or later he will either become bankrupt or the fertility of his soil will become completely exhausted. That happened during the years of the depression.  At that time farmers, in many cases, when they found that the prices for live stock, butter, pigs and other farm products declined, had to turn to the intensive growing of cereals even though they could not procure manures.  In that way they had to exhaust the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> Other farmers had to turn to the subletting of their land over long periods, and thereby completely ruined their land.  All those evils were due to the fact that the State never had the courage to come forward and stand behind the agricultural producer and say: &ldquo;If you produce the maximum from your land and give the maximum amount of employment that can be given on it, at the same time preserving and improving the fertility of your soil, we, the Government, acting on behalf of the community, guarantee to you that you will get a fair return for your work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government give the guarantees which we are asking in this resolution, they can rest assured that the farmers will do their utmost.  I am in complete agreement with everything that has been said in regard to the necessity for improving and increasing the efficiency of work on the farm, and in regard to raising the standard of agricultural education.  I believe that there is an almost unlimited amount of knowledge accumulated by scientists in regard to live-stock production and live-stock breeding, of improvements in regard to soil fertility, the growing of crops and the growing and cultivation of grasses.  All this knowledge should be brought home to the individual worker.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say, in regard to improving the educational standard of our workers on the land, that we have got to rely to a large extent upon our young people.  It is during the years that intervene after young people leave the primary schools that the maximum amount of knowledge can be acquired by them in regard to agriculture and other subjects. I do not advocate the raising of the primary school-leaving age as primary education is at present imparted. I believe that post-primary agricultural education is urgently necessary, but at the same time I can see the evils in a wrongly directed system of agricultural education or post-primary education.  I can see and fully realise that it is wrong to seek to impart agricultural education entirely in theory.  A boy leaves the national school and proceeds to a <Col N="295" /> secondary school.  Even if we assume that in that secondary school the theory of agriculture is taught, that boy, unless he has had some actual experience of work on the land, will never develop into a farmer.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by an experienced farmer that unless a young fellow succeeds in getting his hands dirty on the land before he reaches the age of 16, he will never be inclined to dirty them on the land afterwards. I think that is quite true.</P>
    <P>It has been stated again and again in this House, and I may incur a rebuke from the Chairman of our Party, Deputy Halliden, when I more or less contradict the statement that the dairy cow is the foundation of the agricultural industry.  I do not agree that the dairy cow is the foundation of the agricultural industry, although she plays an important part.  I hold that the foundation of the agricultural industry is the farmer's wife.  For that reason, if it is essential that boys who are going to devote their lives to agriculture should get a thorough agricultural training, it is equally important that girls who intend to settle on the land should receive a thorough agricultural training.</P>
    <P>This applies not only to farmers' wives, but also to the wives of agricultural labourers.  I know from experience, and it is probably the experience of other Deputies, that wherever you see a farmer who has got on well on his holding, who has brought up his family well, and the members of whose family have been successful in life, there is always a woman in the case, and the woman is always the farmer's wife.  For that reason I hold it is desirable that girls should receive an adequate agricultural education.  It is unfortunate that the rural science education given in our vocational schools is not being availed of by those who intend to live on the land.  It is being availed of mainly by those who intend to get away from the land, and that is why I stated on a recent occasion that vocational education in our rural areas has not been a success.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister carefully to consider <Col N="296" /> the motion which we have tabled, and I should like him to let the House know, when he is replying to that motion, what his attitude is.  I have no intention of forcing the Minister's hand.  I am anxious to hear him state his side of the case.  If he indicates that the Government are prepared to make a reasonable attempt to meet the demand which is contained in that motion, I would be slow to ask for a division upon it, but I should like to have an assurance that the outlook which is outlined in that motion is receiving favourable consideration from the Department.  The Minister knows that in Great Britain at the moment there is a ferment of agitation among agricultural producers for similar guarantees in regard to the future, and therefore he should endeavour to keep in step with the agricultural policy of other States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to learn that the Minister has given some hope that the veterinary college will be more energetic in the future in relation to live-stock diseases.  The agricultural community have suffered very considerably in this connection for many years.  Probably the Minister will remember that this is a subject to which I have drawn attention on several occasions during the last three or four years.  The farmers have lost thousands of pounds through these diseases, and some people would go a great deal further as regards the losses sustained through mammitis alone.  There are other diseases which are just as bad I will instance abortion.  Some farmers will tell you that the country suffers more from tuberculosis than from abortion, but I question that.  I had occasion during the last 12 months to buy a lot of heifers.  They were bought all over the county, and the time came when they had to pass a test for tuberculosis or abortion.  40 per cent. of them were cast for abortion, and about half of 1 per cent. were cast for tuberculosis.  That is a remarkable state of affairs.  If that position is allowed to continue, it will do more harm to the dairying industry than anything else.  By this time of day we should know more about abortion than we do.  We have been pressing for <Col N="297" /> more serious attention in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I suggest that if the veterinary college is to prove of use to the farming community it should be provided with some sort of ambulance.  Although you cannot have a perfect ambulance at the moment, it should be possible to make arrangements to convey beasts to the college for examination.  It would not cost a terrible lot to procure a vehicle for that purpose.  An ordinary trailer behind a motor car would suffice, and it should be easy enough to get a car for that purpose. In that way we could bring beasts to the college to have them examined when local veterinary surgeons cannot detect what is wrong.  I could cite the case of a neighbour who had a bullock with timber tongue.  It was not the animal's tongue that was wrong but another part of the body.  It beat all the veterinary surgeons in the locality and it was not until the animal was killed that it was possible to discover the source of trouble.  I discussed the matter with the college authorities but as they had not seen the animal they could not express any opinion.  If there was any kind of ambulance to bring up that beast it would have been of great assistance; not only would it have been of advantage to the farmer concerned, but it would also be of advantage to the veterinary staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was speaking to-day he referred to the economic was and he said it was not over yet.  He met with a certain amount of criticism over that.  I would not mind Deputy Briscoe feeling inclined to criticise, because he would not have experience, but I was rather surprised at the Minister taking it in such a jovial way, because the Minister knows, as all of us who have to deal with cattle know, that when beasts go to England they are detained for two months&mdash;that is, if they want to get near the expected price&mdash;and if they are detained for such a period they are sold for 5/- a cwt. less than beasts reared in Northern Ireland.  That means on a 12-cwt. beast, the loss will be at least £3.  If a farmer has a dozen animals to sell it will mean £36.  I do <Col N="298" /> not think the economic war can be considered over if that state of things exists, and it does exist; there can be no question about it, and I do not think that even the Minister will question it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the growing of wheat, there was consideration last harvest when the amount of wheat available in the country was ascertained.  The farmers were accused of not making proper returns, and I think it was insinuated that the Civic Guards were to some extent negligent in that respect and that wheat which was alleged to have been sown had not been sown.  I think that there will be far worse returns this year, no matter how accurate you are in measuring the area under wheat.  The return will be a great deal less than it was last year because the land has not got what the wheat requires.  It is impossible for land to grow oats for a couple of years and then wheat, or <i>vice versa.</i>  The land cannot do it.  There comes a time when everything must end, and I think the Department will very soon find that the growing of wheat year after year is a silly undertaking and that we are merely throwing good seed into the ground in order to grow weeds which will only destroy the land.</P>
    <P>What is the position in Northern Ireland?  The people in my part of the country have to be conversant with the position of farmers across the Border, and we find that the Government there are not satisfied merely to procure artificials for the farmers.  They insist on their purchasing artificials&mdash; a certain amount of slag and superphosphate&mdash;which they must throw on their land in order that it may be kept going.  They go even a step further and say that, if they are letting out their land, they must put in grass seed of a certain standard.  The farmer cannot just pick it up in the hayshed and scatter it around his field.  He cannot buy seed on the market which may be of no value.  I bought grass seed from a trader some time ago, and, having had it tested, I found that it contained 50 per cent. grass seed and the rest weeds.  In Northern Ireland, they cannot sow such seed.  It must be seed of a certain value and purity, and they <Col N="299" /> can add whatever they like in the way of clover and other smaller seeds afterwards. They must have pure seed to start with and, when this emergency is over, their land will not be vitiated, but, if anything, improved.  We are doing the contrary; we are using the land for growing, or trying to grow, crops which it is utterly impossible for the land to grow.  I probably know as much about this question as any other Deputy because I happen to be an auctioneer in a small way.</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to set land at present.  I have offered land for practically nothing; I have offered land for the sake of having it tilled; but the neighbouring farmers would not take it, because, they said, there was nothing to be got from it.  They believed they would not get the cost of the seed out of it.  That is happening all over my district, and the question arises of how we are to meet this problem.  We cannot get artificial manures at present, so the only thing to do is to grow crops which can be manured with farmyard manure.  One of these crops is potatoes.  To grow an acre of potatoes will cost something in the region of £40, and a farmer will not grow a lot of potatoes unless he knows what he will get for them: I remember only a few years ago when we could not sell potatoes.  They were thrown in the back of ditches to rot, while others were thrown in the rivers, and, when we appealed to the Minister, the only relief he could give us was to suggest that we send them to the alcohol factory at something like 2½d. per stone.</P>

      <P>If a man is to spend £40 on an acre of potatoes, he will surely look to what he will get for them when the crop is ripe.  The Farmers' Party moved a motion a couple of weeks ago here requesting a subsidy for potatoes <Col N="300" /> and corn.  I did not vote for that motion because I did not think it would be reasonable to grant a subsidy for oats.  We are getting a certain subsidy for wheat, or we are getting a fixed price which is satisfying us, and I did not see any advantage in voting for a subsidy for oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The British farmers are getting it in respect of lea land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and they are getting it in Northern Ireland, too, but we are getting a very fair price for oats at present.  It is a free market and we can get as much as the market can give us.  Although I did not vote for the motion, I did not vote against it, because I thought that if the Government gave a subsidy on potatoes, it would save my Labour friend from accusing us of getting 2/- a stone for them.  If a subsidy were given, there could be a fixed price so as to prevent the price from rising too high and so that the poor man in the city, who is dependent on potatoes to a great extent when there is a scarcity of bread, would not be mulcted in an exorbitant price.</P>
      <P>If we got a subsidy for potatoes, we would be able to grow wheat next year, if the wheat scheme is still in operation.  The sooner we begin to realise that this war may last for years, the better.  We do not know when it will end, but if it does not end in the next couple of years, and there is more difficulty about importing wheat, I can see that this country will be in a very poor position.  If we grow a potato crop, a turnip or other root crop this year, we will have manured ground which will grow wheat next year.  If you do not do that, to my mind, you cannot grow wheat.  It is impossible to grow wheat on lea land, at least in my part of the country.  It might be possible in the richer lands of Meath, but in my part of the country, it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way to grow wheat, that is, after a potato crop, and if the Government want wheat, they must secure the growing of more potatoes, and there is no reason why the Government should not try to encourage the growing of potatoes, because it is well <Col N="301" /> known that potatoes give three times the amount of food for human beings that wheat gives.  In these conditions, the Government would be well advised to see if they cannot induce the farmers to grow more potatoes or some other suitable root crop.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about the farm labourers.  I employ a good many of them, and, if the most of them get £2 in cash per week, they actually get over £2 per week.  Some people say that they are in a bad way, but I do not think they are at all in a bad way. They are at present the most comfortable employees we have in the country.</P>

      <P>To begin with, they get in or about £2 per week.  They get potato ground free and they get milk free.  All my men get two quarts of milk and some get more.  They have their own vegetables they probably get turnips out of the turnip field and cabbage out of the cabbage field.  They have free firing.  Will any Deputy tell me that the salaried man&mdash;the bank clerk, for instance&mdash;is as well off as the labourer to-day?  I agree that the money he is getting is not extravagant, but compare it with the money which the ordinary bank clerk who has been in the bank for two or three years gets. Which is the better off?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind the golf; that is only a side issue.  The farm labourer has no appearance to keep up and he is living in a free house.  Speaking for myself, all my men have free houses. Consequently he has not to pay the rent which the ordinary bank clerk has to pay, which would be £70 or £80 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then as to the farmer.  Where is he to get the money to pay labourers at present?  Years ago we used to talk about the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; farmer, and that meant a farmer who kept 12 cows and a bull.  Such a farmer would have about 40 acres, and it would take all the foodstuffs grown on the farm to feed these cows and their calves.  The <Col N="302" /> farmer would have very little for sale. He would be depending on the sale of the milk from these cows and the sale of the calves.  What would you put down as the return for each of these cows?  I have been discussing the matter with some farmers here, and I was saying £15.  They said that would be too much.  Let us say £15.  That is a very fair average for the milk supplied to the creamery, and the sale of the calves.  For 12 cows that would mean a return of about £180 a year. That man must at least keep one labourer, even if his family are employed on the farm.  One labourer will cost £100 a year.  Therefore, he has £80 left to pay rent, taxes, rates, and for the up-keep of the place.  The veterinary surgeon will also cost something. He has all these things to meet out of, we will say, £80 a year.  These are facts which we cannot get over. You can extend that if you like to the farmer who employs three or four men or even five or six men.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the farmer? He has to be out day and night.  In the winter he has to go away to fairs long before daylight.  Whether it is wet or dry, he has to go out.  The farm labourer nowadays is not expected to work outside all the time in the winter.  There are jobs inside for him and he is comfortable for the day.  My instructions to my men are that they are not to stay out in the wet.  They are no good to me when they get wet.  I tell them that there is plenty of work for them inside.  The labourers are in a different position altogether from the farmers.  They are in a better position to-day than the ordinary farmer.  As to those people who are receiving the dole, I think there should be some means of providing them with employment.  If I were head of the State I would see that every man would get a job.  I would not pay anybody for standing at corners waiting to see which horse would win the next race.  Every one of these men should be employed, not at the top wage, but at a reasonable wage and then they could look out for another job and improve their position.</P>
    <P>When I was calculating the farmers' expenses I did not mention machinery. <Col N="303" /> And machinery now costs three times what it cost pre-war.  A hoeing machine which used to cost £15 would now cost about £40.  Deputy Beegan said that the farmers were in a better position than those in any other industry. I wonder has he considered what other industries are making.  I do not want to go into that matter now, as we will have an opportunity when the Estimate for the Minister for Supplies comes on.  Let me, however, give one illustration.  The fixed price for wool at present is 1/10 or 2/- a lb.  The making of a blanket costs 1/4 a lb. and it is sold wholesale at 7/6 a lb.  These are figures that I only got yesterday.  The manufacturer, therefore, is getting 4/- profit.  As I say, we are told by Deputy Beegan that the farmers are in a better position.</P>

      <P>I understand the fixed price at present of wool is in or about 2/-.  I should like to ask the Minister about tractors.  We are not able to deal with all the tillage work at present.  We are given to understand that there is a likelihood of some tractors coming into this country.  I understand that there were about 120 tractors on the other side for this country, but that we could not get the shipping space for them.  I have been told that these 120 tractors went to Belfast&mdash;that the firm that got them said they were intended for here. Probably the Minister will make inquiries and see if some tractors could not be procured.  Tractors are hired in Northern Ireland to do work in Monaghan and Cavan and there is a question as to whether we will be able to get kerosene for them.  I wrote to the Department about that matter but I have not got a reply yet.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter.</P>

But I have many connections with farmers in their lives.  I live near them. What compels me to intervene in this debate is that Deputy Halliden yesterday attacked the Minister for Lands.

That is what the Minister for Lands said, but Deputy Halliden gets up and twists his words and says the Minister <Col N="306" /> for Lands said that an increase in the price of milk could not be given because the Farmers' Party had asked for it.

He put the neck out and he said: &ldquo;We will take drastic action.&rdquo; He did not say he would spill it down the drains.

      <P>When the question of agriculture is mentioned, I think the Dáil loses perspective.  The moment the question of agriculture is mentioned, we all lose perspective.  We get excited. As a matter of fact, it has forced me to talk here for the first time.  The farmers of Ireland are misrepresented by the Clann na Talmhan Party and, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I must again refer to County Cork.  I represent North Cork.  Deputy Halliden also represents North Cork. Deputy Halliden said that he represents <Col N="307" /> the small farmers of North Cork. He does not.  I do not think a small farmer voted for Deputy Halliden.  The big farmers voted for him.  The small farmers voted for me.  Therefore, I represent the small farmers of North Cork and can speak for them.  The small farmers of North Cork have a voice in this Legislature through me and I am entitled to put their view. Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skinner</NameTxt>
      <P>Through me, the farmers of North Cork will speak.  I say they are misrepresented by Deputy Halliden and the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I say this much, that the farmers in North Cork do not come cringing and craving or asking for a higher price.  They are a hard-working, comfortable body and they are quite entitled to the highest price they can get for milk, but they are not going to take the nation by the throat. The farmers of North Cork are hardworking and they are getting good prices.  I do not say they are millionaires. The big farmers that Deputy Halliden represents may have suffered some losses.  They refused to go in for tillage during the economic war.  The small farmers went in for tillage and they are not suffering the losses that the farmers who voted for Deputy Halliden are suffering.  There is a great deal of discussion about agriculture and about the land.  I think the farmers are the backbone of the nation.  They are producing what we live on but the fact that they are producing what we live on does not give them the right to come to the nation and say: &ldquo;We demand this or we will starve you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of North Cork are not doing that.  The farmers are producing food, but they can sell everything they produce.  There is an open market for it.  The price of wheat and beet is controlled but it is a fair price.  This nation is passing through a crisis, and the Farmers' Party get up here and talk as if we are living in normal times.  We are not living in normal times; we are living in terrible times, <Col N="308" /> when the life of the nation is threatened. This is not the time to talk about prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skinner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity you are existing.  Now, we will take the small shopkeeper living in a country town. He has to compete with the farmers in business, because they have co-operative stores in the town and are trading there.  The small trader in a country town is couponed and quotaed.  He is restricted in the amount he can sell and the price at which he can sell it. But have you heard one squeal out of him?  You have not.  He does not send Deputies up here to the Dáil to cry out on his behalf.  He says: &ldquo;Well, God fits the back to the burden.  We are losing, but we are willing to make a sacrifice for the nation.&rdquo;  What does the Farmers' Party do?  It is their misrepresentation here in the Dáil that is causing trouble.  Those men, Deputy Halliden and other Clann na Talmhan Deputies, are coming in here weeping for and misrepresenting the farmers of Ireland, while calling themselves a Farmers' Party.  We all know that that is humbug.  The people of Ireland know that the farmers are being misrepresented by Clann na Talmhan, and, if we go to the country again, Clann na Talmhan will not come back here.  If they did come in here again, at the next general election they would still misrepresent the farmers of Ireland and weep for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party is sitting over there.  Labour are hard hit, because when prices hit anyone they hit the small man first; they hit labour first. What outcry has labour raised?  They have made protests, but generally speaking they have said: &ldquo;We must put up with it for the nation's sake.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Deputy Halliden and Clann na Talmhan come in here and tell us: &ldquo;We are dying of starvation.&rdquo; They come in here with their eyes streaming saying: &ldquo;Oh, save us.&rdquo;  They came in here last July, saying: &ldquo;We cannot grow wheat; we cannot do it at all&mdash;not at 50/- a barrel.  No, we cannot do it, but give us 55/- a barrel and we will grow all <Col N="309" /> the wheat you want.&rdquo;  Was that the answer of the farmers of Ireland dur- a national crisis?  It was not.  It was misrepresentation by Clann na Talmhan, by Deputy Halliden and Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Cogan.</P>

      <P>The only thing I learned from Deputy Cogan's speech was that farmers are like poets-they are born, not made.  That was the only interesting thing he told us this evening.  He said: &ldquo;You must be born a farmer&rdquo;&mdash;like a poet.  If you put science into farming Deputy Cogan says it is no good-you must be born a farmer.  If you are trained to be a farmer, it is no good; you must be born one.  I do not believe that at all.  Deputy Hughes talked about failures amongst the farmers, and what he would do by soil tests and all that to prevent the failures.  That is all very interesting, of course, but it is a lot of &ldquo;hooey.&rdquo;  I admit that agriculture is the backbone of the country, but other people must live, too.  The small trader must live.</P>

      <P>And the solicitor, and the barrister, and the parasite.  Deputy Hughes said that if the Government goes down and removes the partial failures, then agriculture will be successful. But if a man fails in business, they say: &ldquo;Hard luck.  He got it in the neck.&rdquo;  No one gets up here in the House and says to the Government: &ldquo;Go down and help Mick So-and-so. He is going to fail in business.&rdquo;  It is too bad about him, but why should the Government step in to help him?  But Deputy Hughes asks the Government to step in and help partial failures amongst the farmers.  If the farmer is too lazy to learn his own job, why should the Government step in and help him to learn it?  Deputy Hughes <Col N="310" /> talked about soil tests.  Any farmer can have a soil test if he wants it. It is time somebody got up and told the farmers' misrepresenting Party where to get off.  I am not afraid to do it.  I may lose votes over it, but I am not afraid to do it.  Any farmer can get a soil test.  He can even get it free by sending up his soil to any college to be tested.  That is not very hard for the farmer to do.  It might cost him 3d. postage.  If the farmer is not prepared to spend 3d. in learning about his farm, why ask the Government to help him?</P>
      <P>I probably have delayed the House a bit too long, but it is time somebody said those things.  When an agricultural Estimate comes up here everyone is afraid to open his mouth against agriculture.  They will speak in favour of agriculture, but they will not speak against it, because they might lose the votes of the farmers.  It is time the House learned that the Farmers' Party, Clann na Talmhan, and some Deputies in the Fine Gael Party who are following the Farmers' Party, are making a racket out of farming.  It is time someone told the House about that.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go very deeply into the farming question except to say that the food position is the most important.  I should like if the Minister and the House would view the position of agriculture in two categories&mdash;first, the present time, and secondly, the post-war period.</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is wise to be considering the post-war period now. We are not out of the war yet.  The Irish people must look to the farmer to see that they will get through the present emergency successfully.  The Minister has taken a very strong stand in the matter of compelling farmers to till their land.  I think it is a mistake, especially on the poor land in Connaught, to compel people to sow wheat on it since it is wholly unsuited for the purpose.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. I know that in certain parts of that Province, where I saw wheat growing last year, the yield was only about two barrels to the acre, whereas if oats had been grown on the land it is likely that a good crop would have been obtained. I am glad to have the Deputy's correction.</P>
      <P>The production of milk and butter is of equal importance with the growing of wheat.  The Minister indicated that there has been a serious decline in dairying.  It is a side of agricultural life that I do not know much about. I find it hard to understand why we were able to export so much butter in 1939 and today have to live on such a small ration.  Somebody has said that we are consuming more butter now than ever.  It is difficult to reconcile that with the present day ration of butter.  In regard to milk, I do not see how any farmer could produce it at less than 1/- per gallon.  I can say that from the little personal experience that I have had.  Some people say that if the producer gets more than 1/- per gallon the price of butter will have to be increased to such an extent that it will be outside the reach of the worker.</P>
      <P>I think a way out of the difficulty would be to have two prices for butter: one for the worker and the wage-earner, and a higher price for those who can afford to pay for it.  That is a view that I have always held.  Those who form the huge queues that we see in O'Connell Street going to the pictures and to other entertainments, to race-meetings and so on&mdash;those who are able to live in luxury&mdash;if they want more butter they should get it and should pay for it.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I thought it a pity that the Deputy should have wound up his speech in that way.  I do not think he should have brought in that question of fresh air.  We will agree that the farm labourer is not living under slave conditions. The other night, when the Minister was speaking of the position of farmers, he made the statement that he would not say that the farmers were the wealthiest section of the country, but that he did say they were better off than they were in 1920.  I agree with the Minister on that.  There is one thing that the Minister, Deputy Beegan and every other member of the House will have to agree about, and it is that farm labourers comprise the poorest section within this community, and that they should not be in that position.</P>

      <P>I have said in this House more than once, and many times outside, that the farm labourer is the backbone of this nation, and that without his efforts all of us would be starving.  Is there a member of the House who will deny that the farm worker does not belong to the worst-off section of the community?  I think it is criminal that anybody should have to be in receipt of doles, but the people who are in receipt of them are proportionately better off than a farm labourer.  No responsible Deputy should say that the farm labourer has the advantage of having fresh air.  He has to work hard for 54 hours a week.  If he is worth being kept by any decent farmer he must work hard and co-operate with his employer to make a success of that farmer's business, both for his own sake and that of his employer.  The farm labourer has no weekly half-day and no annual holiday.  There is no Conditions of Employment Act to make his lot easier, nor does he enjoy any of the privileges accorded to other sections of the community.  He is treated not as a slave but as the next thing to being one.  I am not blaming the farmers for that position. I blame some of them who are in a position to give better wages than they are paying to their workmen.  I <Col N="313" /> am not blaming the farmers in general because, until quite recently, they were not in a position to provide their farm workers with a decent wage. Therefore if we want to put the farm labourer in a better position we must give guaranteed prices to the farmer over a certain period so that his position will be bettered to enable him to give reasonable wages to his workers.</P>
      <P>Some people denounce subsidies. Where do they come from?  Out of the pockets of the people.  Why should not the well-to-do, those with the huge salaries and the good conditions, not be compelled to subsidise the farmer and the farm labourer? They are dependent to a large extent on the work of the farmer and the farm labourer.  Therefore, some of the means that they have should be taken from them and given to the farm labourer.  To give an illustration, we are subsidising turf at the present time to the extent of £1 8s. 6d. a ton.</P>
      <P>Why not subsidise the farm labourer to the extent of £1 8s. a week and give him a decent wage?  There would be nothing wrong about it.  If the present position is allowed to continue, a serious condition of things may arise. The worker is too educated now to remain in slavery.  Is it not hard to expect a farm labourer in County Dublin to rear eight children on £2 a week? I suggest it is hard for that man to continue, especially when he sees his little girl getting work in a factory and receiving 10/- a week more than he does.  I am not denouncing the wage; I merely say that his girl can get work in a decent Irish factory, where they recognise decent conditions and give good wages.  That man's daughter, 21 years of age, receives 10/- a week more than he does, and he has to rear eight children.  I am not saying she is receiving too much.  She is receiving a just wage, but how can you expect any of the sons to step into the father's shoes and continue to produce food for the nation in view of that difference in wages?  The same applies to the Civil Service and to other professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every section of the nation is relying on the farmer and the farm labourer, but yet they are keeping them in drudgery and slavery.  I hear murmurs <Col N="314" /> of dissent from parts of the House, but nobody will contradict me when I say the farm labourer is very badly treated.  I will take as an example gardeners, who are not covered by the Agricultural Wages Board.  I trust the Minister will include them. If their position is not improved, in a few years we shall have no gardeners around County Dublin.  There are people of wealth and title who are giving gardeners only 24/- a week because they are not covered by the Agricultural Wages Board conditions.</P>
    <P>Some people have misrepresented a recent statement of mine.  I said that I could congratulate the Minister to a point when he established the Agricultural Wages Board.  Apparently the Minister was satisfied that the agricultural worker was not being treated properly.  Where I blame the Minister is that I feel the representatives he has on the Agricultural Wages Board do not directly represent the workers. Take County Dublin as an illustration. There are two men representing the farm workers.  There is a decision by the Agricultural Wages Board to give a certain wage in County Dublin and that decision was reached about a month ago.  One of the men who is supposed to sign has been in England for the last nine months.  Whoever is responsible should, when it was found that this man was absent from the country, have consulted those who represent Labour and arranged to have a representative of the farm labourers here.  I suggest that the finding of the board does not represent the views of the workers in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Beegan on the point of co-operation.  Farm labour is different to other work in the sense that if the farm labourer has not an interest in the farmer for whom he is working he is not worthy of employment. We must bring about a better understanding between the farmer and the labourer.  For years there has been misunderstanding.  Some farmers treat their employees properly and have their confidence, but in many cases one is out to &ldquo;best&rdquo; the other, and unless you have some spirit of co-operation, some give and take between the farmer and the labourer, then there is not much future for agriculture.  I know <Col N="315" /> you have some labourers&mdash;fortunately they are few in number&mdash;who will watch the clock on a harvest evening and probably leave a stack of corn unfinished, they are so anxious to get away.  They do not consider that the next day might be wet.  I appeal to the labourers to work until 11 o'clock, if necessary, and to see that the corn is secure before they leave off.  If the farmer is decent he will compensate them.  If you have not a spirit of give and take between farmer and labourer, there is very little hope for agriculture.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Fagan and Deputy O'Reilly speaking, and if anything can convince the Minister that what I am saying is correct, that the farm labourer is treated badly, it should be this.  Both Deputies stated that thousands of tons of the best of corn went rotten in Meath and Westmeath because there were no labourers to attend to it.  I know that is true. But why did they not indicate the cause?</P>
    <P>Every Deputy must be aware that Irishmen and their sons have gone all over the civilised world looking for an honest day's work.  They went to England, Scotland and the United States, all over the civilised world in fact, and even into the uncivilised world, in an effort to seek an honest living and to help their parents and others dependent on them by sending back money.  Can any Deputy here say that if they were given a fair wage in their own country they would not prefer to go to Meath and Westmeath and save the harvest there?  That was the most serious statement that was ever made here.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of the year food was rationed in this country and, later the same year, according to those Deputies, food went rotten because we had not the labour to harvest it.  At the time when that food was going rotten we had 70,000 unemployed in the country.  I suggest that that system is wrong&mdash;I do not care who is responsible for it.  There should not be men in receipt of the dole when the food required by the Irish people is allowed to rot in the fields.  No Irishman has <Col N="316" /> ever been afraid to work.  They go to foreign countries where they are recognised as good workers, and as good citizens too, and their records in foreign countries will prove that.  I cannot understand the statement that decay has set in and that Irishmen are not prepared to work.  I do not believe one word of it.</P>
    <P>So far as farm work is concerned, our people must realise that a man will not work for a wage that will keep those depending on him just above the borderline of starvation when he knows there are opportunities within his reach to earn better money.  I am sure there is not one person who will blame a labourer for trying to improve his condition.  I think the Minister should set up some commission to see what could be done.  I realise there are difficulties, but surely they can be surmounted. We have surmounted greater difficulties.  We should raise the wages of the farm labourer to £3 a week.  I may be laughed at for suggesting £3 a week, but I think everyone will admit that if you take a family of seven, devil a much in the way of luxuries will they have on that amount.</P>
    <P>There is even a further slur cast on those who work on the farm.  I had a man in with me a few minutes ago in connection with a widow's pension. You, Sir, will naturally wonder how this arises on the Vote for Agriculture, but it is the case of a farm labourer who died in County Dublin, and whose widow applied for a widow's pension. Because her husband worked at agriculture, she gets less than the woman next door whose husband worked at industrial work.  Even after a man dies, little is made of him.  Should his widow die, his three orphaned children are despised because their father worked at agriculture, in that they get a lesser amount than they would get if their father had worked at industrial work.  I am quite certain that every Deputy will admit that that is a system which we must change.</P>

      <P>I should like the time to come when this House would change <Col N="317" /> the law.  I feel that those engaged in agriculture are not getting justice and I appeal to the Minister to set up different machinery.  On the question of tillage, the production of milk and so on, if we want to get the production, we must give the farmer a price. He should get it.  Remember that there are thousands of farmers in Connaught and other parts of this country who are just above the borderline of starvation and who are rearing families merely to send them to a foreign country to earn a few shillings to keep the home together.  They are not able to keep the home out of what they can take out of the farm.  Within the last few months, I saw where a Deputy congratulated the Government because they had given these people the opportunity to leave the country to earn money in order to subsidise the home. That is a very poor and unsound national policy.</P>
      <P>These people should be given a fairly decent standard of life. Previously, these people reared a large number of pigs and poultry, and I ask the Department to review the position with regard to pig and fowl rearing. It is a tragedy that the rearing of fowl has declined to such an extent.  I feel that the Minister, through the radio and through his instructors, should encourage these people to keep more fowl.  I know they are frightened away from the idea by the price of, and the difficulty of securing, feeding.  There are 63,000 cottiers in the nation, and I hold that every one of these people should be encouraged to keep a certain number of fowl.  As a matter of fact, I believe that the local committees of agriculture should give them subsidies to enable them to start the keeping of poultry, and particularly hens, because, with butter so scarce, eggs would be a great help to these poor people, as well as providing a greater surplus for sale to the towns and cities. The Minister would be doing very good work if he sent out more instructors, held more meetings and gave more encouragement to these people to rear poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to pigs, a Deputy said that he could not understand how the price of bacon was now only what it <Col N="318" /> was when bacon was sold at 120/-. What I cannot understand is that during the last war, when the price of pigs was practically double what it is to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said that the amount of increased income to the farmers was £30,000,000 of which the amount given to labour was only £2,000,000 or £2,500,000.  That should be sufficient proof that labourers have been treated unjustly, because everybody will admit that whatever little standard the labourer was brought up to in recent years, he had no standard at all heretofore, and the very fact that a sum of £30,000,000 has gone to the farmers and only £2,000,000 to the labourers is proof that he is in a very bad way.  As I have said, if farming is to be a success, there must be cooperation between the farmer and his labourers, and, if profits are made, they should be equally divided between the farmer and his labourer, because one has to keep a home as well as the other.  I appeal to the Minister to abolish the present Agricultural Wages Board, or to set it up under different conditions, in the hope that we will have some machinery which will give the worker a wage which will keep him and his dependents in a condition of reasonable comfort.</P>

      <P>There is one matter which gives real pleasure to anybody listening to this debate and that is that it seems that all sections appreciate and realise the important <Col N="319" /> part which agriculture plays in our national and economic life.  At the risk of being tedious, I wish to reiterate those sentiments, lest there might be some slipping back to what at one time was a different point of view among some sections of our people.  It is probably the impact of the emergency, the practical experience we have had and the realities we have had to face which have contributed to that position. I always consider that this debate is one of the most important of the debates we have here from time to time and in order properly to appreciate the administration of agriculture in this country, I think it reasonable to consider why the agricultural industry exists.</P>
      <P>I put the reasons for its existence under three broad headings, all of importance, but I put them in what I consider to be their order of importance. The first reason, as particularly exemplified at present, is the raising of food for our people, which is undoubtedly the most important; the second is the providing of gainful occupation and gainful employment for the farmer and his employees; and the third is the creation of surplus produce with which we can build up an export trade and, in return, import into the country those necessaries which we cannot produce at home.  Having those three headings firmly in my mind, I now come to consider what are the future prospects of the industry, in the light of our experience at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, of course, in the discussion in the year 1944 to relate our minds to that particular situation and the particular problems that exist as a result of what is going on in the world at present.  But the agricultural industry is such that it cannot be properly considered except from a long-term point of view.  The one thing which we must realise is that, when the unfortunate conflict in the world, particularly in Europe, is over, we will have at our doors the greatest opportunity the farmers of Ireland ever had to dispose of their surplus produce.  Most businesses, even the most efficient&mdash;and some of the most <Col N="320" /> efficient are judged by the salesmanship that they can put into the selling of their goods&mdash;have to advertise their wares and send out their travellers to do so.  We will have our markets assured.  Not only will we have our neighbour, Great Britain, but we will have many continental countries coming to us, not for their daily food, but for the ancestors of the herds and stock which they will have to rear in their own countries. With that in view, will the agricultural industry be able to live up to the situation?  Unless we take time by the forelock, I have very great doubts on the subject.</P>
    <P>As a result of a number of matters, the industry at present is in a very shaky condition.  When I say it is in a shaky condition, I do not say it is falling to pieces.  What I mean is that it is a factory whose machinery is worn out; its bearings have got hot from not being properly oiled; the plant is overworked; to a large extent from the point of view of future planning, it has become disorganised.  That was only natural.  The contributing force to that was the necessity to concentrate in the main on those things which we require urgently to meet the food situation.  While anything I say here is intended to be of some assistance to the general outlook on the problem, I do not think it would be fair to the history of agriculture during the past few years if I did not attribute the shaky condition of our general agricultural system to a very grave fault, a want of wisdom on the part of the Government.  Fortunately, that policy has been mended during recent years and recent months.  But one of the contributing factors, the most important contributing factor, has been the general approach, from which now the Government have receded, but which at the commencement of the war was made to agriculture. The Minister had a point of view, and he was entitled to it.  He laid too much emphasis on the growing of grain.  He came to the conclusion that the most important thing to grow was grain, and that no other food mattered.  Definitely, he and the Government have receded from that position.  They were obsessed by the idea that the potentialities and <Col N="321" /> energies of this country and the farming community should be given altogether to the growing of grain, to the exclusion of every other kind of food.</P>
    <P>As a result of bitter experience, it has been realised by everyone that there are other foodstuffs equally as important as grain, because grain is food for animals, which are turned into human food.  A large part of this discussion has turned on the subject of milk, and the result of the Government's original policy in this matter has been that that end of the industry, the production of meat, cattle, bacon, milk, poultry and so on suffered from the over-emphasis upon grains.  Both branches of the industry are complementary and supplementary to each other.  You must have general farming carried out in a sensible fashion.  That is being realised now.  There is a forward movement to restore the poultry industry which, I think, has the backing of the Government behind it. There is a forward movement to try to put the bacon industry back to where it was before, and there are forward movements in other directions. They are beginning to realise that it is not only on grain that human beings live.  But, supposing it was a fact that grain was the only food that mattered, still the industry itself would be suffering very harshly if it were cultivated to the exclusion of everything else.</P>
    <P>On that particular question, I think it is useful to go back on the history of agriculture in this country to discover a certain fundamental factor that was overlooked.  Those of us who are familiar with the country get to know a piece of land over a number of years. We direct our attention to a certain corner of a field or a certain piece of land that has been neglected for years and years, and we gradually see the forces of nature overcoming that piece of land; the scrub, bracken and fern creeping up and overrunning that piece of soil reclaimed for the use of mankind by generations and generations of hard work.  Left to nature alone, the soil of this country would revert to what it was before the skill, energy and genius of the Irish people turned it into its present fertility.  Some people who do not understand or appreciate <Col N="322" /> the difficulties that our ancestors went through in removing the scrub, draining the land, and introducing the plants and the food that grow here now, seem to think that if you do not grow grain or potatoes or something else, grass will grow there instead.  No such thing.  The ordinary grasses sown in this country and subsequently turned into permanent pastures are there as imported foreign crops, in the first instance, and are not naturally indigenous to our soil. The result is that we must carefully continue this battle against nature to keep that fertility that we so hardly won.  We have worn out that agricultural machine, probably not very visibly at the moment, but to an extent whose effects will be very severely felt later on.  That robbing of the fertility of the soil is something very much more important than people realise.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is stated that it is a political catchword.  It is no such thing.  Persons in touch with farmers, such as the merchant in a country town or others who may have occasion to write a cheque for a big crop may say that the farmers were never making so much money, that they were never as well off as they are now.  It may be true in some instances that cash is passing, but it must be remembered that when the farmer receives a cheque for his big crop of grain, the amount of the cheque, which represents, in the opinion of the person who is paying it, an abnormal profit, includes a large sum which in an ordinary business would be written off as depreciation of machinery, but which in the case of a farm means reduction in the fertility of the soil.  That is a consideration that is entirely overlooked. The farmer at the moment, in so far as he is receiving money for his produce, is being paid both capital and interest.</P>
    <P>Having, perhaps, wearied the House with what I consider to be the outline of the position, I now come to the possibilities and the conditions of the industry and the best way of approaching the problem.  As I see the problem at the moment, I visualise that big factory upon which we all depend <Col N="323" /> working double shift.  I see it creaking at every joint, with steam escaping on the pipe joints and its machinery wearing out.  I see the necessity of running it on hot bearings, if you like, but I also recognise the difficulties and the dangers involved as regards the future of the industry in this country. It is not that I fear that the markets are not there, but that I doubt the capacity of our land to meet the requirements of those markets.</P>
    <P>In an effort to solve our difficulties in that respect, I divide the farmers of this country broadly into three classes from the point of view of the position they occupy in the industry, but first of all there is a class that I consider to be the most important of all, to which I will have to refer when I come to say a few words about the agricultural labourer and his wages. The first and the most important class is the small farmer who works his own small holding by himself and the members of his family.  He is the man who, in my opinion and in my experience, gets more out of the soil per acre of his farm than any other farmer in the country.  The next class is that a little higher in the scale: the man who by reason of the size of his farm, the district in which he lives or the nature of the production in which he engages, employs anything from two to four men and works his farm with them and with the assistance of his family.  He has, perhaps, more up-to-date machinery, more horses and more implements, but I do not think that, per acre, he gets anything like the results that the really small man gets who works his own small holding himself. The third class, not as numerous as the other two, is the really big man who works his farm like a modern up-to-date factory with a very large number of employees and with a very large amount of up-to-date machinery. When you gather in those three classes you gather in everyone who is winning the wealth from the soil by the direct employment of himself or of others.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy <Col N="324" /> would give me time I shall deal with it.  I promise that I am not overlooking it.  There are general problems attaching to the position of those three classes; there are particular problems which attach to each.  In order to harness the enegies of those three classes of farmers, in order to derive the best benefit from their existence and their ownership of the soil, in order that the industry can run effectively, we have to search down now to discover the best method of dealing with the industry generally from the Government's point of view.  I know Deputy Larkin is very interested in the fourth class, the agricultural labourer, and he will be glad to know that I have some notes with regard to that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy.  I will probably be able to cover that class.  A considerable amount of discussion here has turned on the question of the wages of the agricultural labourer.  I want to be quite frank on the subject. I think the agricultural labourer has a desperate and a very difficult time at present and finds it very hard to make ends meet, owing to the high cost of living and for other reasons.  On the other hand, except for the abnormal prices that exist at the present time&mdash; and even in the absence of abnormal prices&mdash;the average farmer finds it very difficult to pay what I consider to be even an inadequate wage.  That is the problem that this country, as a great agricultural community, has got to face.  I have given it a considerable amount of thought and I have come to this conclusion: that as the soil is the wealth-producing unit of the country it will come to this, that we will have to increase the number of our small holders who own and work the land themselves at the expense of those who, year in and year out, are not able to pay a decent rising wage and at the same time make a profit, and that the payment of a reasonable wage at a proper level will have to be the pleasure of the man who employs a person otherwise than for the purpose of making <Col N="325" /> a profit, such as the man who employs a gardener or extra hand for his own amenity, and so forth.  There is no good in one section getting up here and saying that the farm labourer's wage is inadequate and another person saying that the farmer cannot afford to pay the wage.  Both statements are true and it is our duty here to find a solution.  There is not any solution at the moment.  I cannot see any.  The whole future of our industry depends upon our wit and genius in our combined efforts to find some solution.</P>
      <P>How it is to be done I do not know, unless the man who was the labourer before becomes the owner of the soil, even though it means making our people smaller holders than they are at the present time.  We should organise ourselves with a view to meeting those problems.  We can only do so by goodwill from all sections of the community. I have heard townspeople&mdash;I suppose I myself am as much a townsman as a country man&mdash;talking in the most disparaging tone of the farmers, the people who work the land.  That is most unjustifiable, and they do it because of a lot of silly and senseless talk.  The agricultural labourer and the farmer himself have spent weary days, and wet days, endangering their health, working overtime during the past two or three years, while balls have been rattling on tennis courts in Dublin.  The people who play those games of tennis, people from 17 to 20 or 25 years of age, are the first to grumble because they are short of potatoes.  Fortunately, that is a mentality which does not exist with everyone. It is a mentality which should not exist at all in our country.  It is un-Irish.  The farmer has always been gibed at by those who do not appreciate him.  Sometimes it is the son or the grandson of the farmer, who comes up to the town or city, who is the first to gibe at his cousins' or his uncles' occupation.</P>
      <P>The second thing we must appreciate is that everyone of us&mdash;the professional man, the business man, everyone of us in this country&mdash;depends upon agriculture.  Every other industry is subsidiary or ancillary to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> What made one of the greatest towns in the world, one of the million-population towns&mdash;the town of Chicago? It was the hard work of the pioneers and farmers of the middle-west of America that built up Chicago and all its industries as a vast distributing centre.  We in this country have to build up our agricultural industry, and get away from old-fashioned methods.</P>
    <P>We have to copy the methods in countries such as the United States of America which pay their employees on farms wages far beyond what we could ever dream of here, and are still able to sell their produce at a profit. We have to organise our industry on a basis of efficiency, on a basis of solidarity, not on a basis of living from harvest to harvest, but on a long-term, well planned basis.  We have to go in for new and improved sidelines.  We have to realise that the purchase of goods by members of the public has changed to a certain extent.  We in this country, which depends for its wealth on what it can get out of the soil, have to realise the enormous revolution there has been in the past few years in the canning of all sorts of things which we can grow here, which can be canned.  We have to put our bacon industry on such a basis that, as soon as the doors are opened and we can get into other countries with our produce, we will be able to supply what they want.  We have to keep out of some of the markets those who were our competitors before this war.  Holland, Poland, Denmark&mdash;each one of those three countries for a number of years before the war sent at least twice the amount of bacon that we sent to England.  We have to organise a proper and efficient selling department. We will have the customers, but we have to see that those customers get our goods at the earliest possible moment and in the best condition.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous opportunity at our doors.  Do not let us say: &ldquo;This country cannot grow wheat.&rdquo; This country can grow wheat, good wheat which makes very tasty flour&mdash; wheat as good as any that is imported. But this country is not a granary like <Col N="327" /> the middle-west of America, or parts of South America, or Russia, where the yield is three or four barrels to the acre.  We have to concentrate on all those side lines&mdash;poultry, pigs, butter, bacon.  First of all, let us grow food for ourselves, so that everyone will have enough to eat. Secondly, let us organise our industry on such a basis that the best will be got out of the soil.  Thirdly, let us make our produce so good that we can compete with other nations. Lastly, let us not forget&mdash;I do not know who it was, but for some reason or other someone mentioned slave labour here&mdash;that the greatest and the finest job that a man can do, old or young, rich or poor, is to dig a spade into the soil and help nature to give us what God Almighty intended us to get.</P>

      <P>One thing which struck me about this debate was the grand atmosphere which prevailed.  It was not exactly a mutual admiration society, but at least it was very pleasant to listen to the various speakers.  All were in a very helpful mood.  Many speakers stood up and said that they did not understand the dairying industry, and then each of them started to give a lecture on what he knew nothing about.  Still, the atmosphere was pleasant.  I am reminded of Dean Swift's famous aphorism to the effect that he who made two blades of grass grow where only one grew before did more for this country than the whole race of politicians.</P>

      <P>But his sayings still survive.  They are printed in every language in the world.  He was a master thinker.  With regard to the dairying business, I would not say it is the principal business in Munster, but it is sometimes put down as that. Our land in Munster generally may be a little bit better than in the other provinces, but we are not a dairying province in any sense of the word.  I kept 32 cows at one time and now I am down to 20.  I kept 150 sheep, and <Col N="328" /> I have only 100 lambs at the moment. I never reared less than 100 lambs.  In the ordinary course I tilled about 30 acres of land.  I was never a rancher, nor are my neighbours ranchers.  In the Golden Vale it is practically confined to dairying, because the corn stretches there, but we in the light lands of South Tipperary and the rest of the county outside the Golden Vale are engaged in mixed farming.  We know as much about sheep and pigs and every other branch of the industry as any man in Wexford, we will say, which is supposed to be a tillage county.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to learn recently that about half the butter manufactured in Ireland is still home-made. We have two forms of butter, the creamery and the home-made.  Last week I was speaking to a neighbour and said that we were going to get 1/- a gallon for the milk.  He said: &ldquo;What good is it; we want 1/1 or 1/3.&rdquo;  I can tell the Minister that he will not find people falling over one another to produce milk at 1/- a gallon.  Let the Minister take heart of grace and not repeat what was done in connection with the wheat growing.  The sowing of wheat was held up when the producers were refused £2 a barrel. Eventually, when it was found that the country was on the verge of starvation the Government agreed to give 50/- a barrel.  My opinion is that even at 1/- a gallon milk will be scarce.  The sooner that is realised, the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes, who opened the debate in a fine form, was in the County Tipperary last week.  He mentioned that he learned a lot about dairying during the week-end.  I want to suggest to him that the dairy farmers in the County Tipperary know as much about farming proper as any member in the House.  They are tillage farmers as well as dairy farmers.  To come back to the butter position, a friend of mine explained why he was going to town so much lately instead of his wife.  He said that if the wife went she would be pestered by people trying to wangle a lb. of butter from her at 4/- per lb. I was in the County Clare myself last autumn and was told that the local butter buyers were getting no butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Where was the home-made butter going?  It was going everywhere.  The Minister need not bother whether he will pay 3d. per lb. more for butter or give the 1/- a gallon for milk in the summer instead of the 10½d., the home-made butter particularly will be sold at 4/- a lb.  We have butter going across the Border at 4/- a lb. to-day.  There is no hand-made butter in my area, but I know that is happening. We are all familiar with the song <i>Cailín Deas Cruidhte na mBo</i>, but I am afraid you will not see many pretty girls milking the cows now.</P>
    <P>After spending a sleepless night suffering from sciatica, I was up on Sunday morning at 6 o'clock and saw how hard my own three sons and three workmen had to work in order to be able to get to early Mass.  They had the cows to milk and 100 lambs to look after.  That is typical of what goes on in the dairying districts.  I carry on tillage farming as well as dairying, and after milking the cows the people have to face the fields.  Later on those boys had to attend an L.D.F. parade.  Some of them cycled 11 miles to a hurling match, and when they came back after 6 o'clock (old time) in the evening they had again to milk the cows.  On the eve of St. Patrick's Day they were so busy that they did not get in to their tea until 7 o'clock, and had to be up the following morning at 6 o'clock. That is what is going on in the dairying districts.  And this is a free State?  No, it is a slave State.  A few weeks ago, in the motion that was moved by this Party, we asked for a fair price for the essentials of life.  Yet the members of this House, with the exception of 12 and ourselves, voted against it.  That was not right. We were not beggars, suppliants or cadgers.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring before the House soon a motion for the setting up of a veterinary research department, something on the lines of the dispensary medical system.  The old cow doctor was a useful kind of man, but his day has passed.  Perhaps he killed more than he cured.  To-day the &ldquo;vet&rdquo; is the most welcome man that comes into an Irish farmhouse.  The trouble is that the poor man cannot afford to pay <Col N="330" /> him.  The idea of my motion is to have a veterinary dispensary system whereby the poor man will be able to get the services of a &ldquo;vet&rdquo;.  Half the diseases in cattle are, in my opinion, due to the fact that cattle drink water from old foetid pools.  I know a pool from which 20 families were taking water.  In the time of Sir Charles Cameron that water was analysed and certified not to be fit for human consumption.  I ask our friends on the Labour Benches to support us in having this veterinary research system set up.</P>
    <P>I have here a paper from which Deputy Hughes quoted yesterday.  I am surprised that he omitted to give the quotation which I am now going to read.  Lord Beaverbrook has the best brains in England writing for this paper which he owns.  Here are some of the things he suggests: &ldquo;Nation should own water supplies; Labour Party wants control of supplies; national water commission to be set up with a view to putting water supply into the rural houses in England.&rdquo;  I hope that the members of the Labour Party will help us to get this veterinary research system established.  As I have said, most of the diseases that cattle suffer from are due to the fact that they drink water from these stinking foetid pools.  I wonder how Deputy Hughes missed reading that.  There was another quotation that I had intended giving, but I cannot lay my hands on it at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the question of agricultural education, I worked hard on my father's farm until I reached the age of 16 when I left to enter business.  It was a 35 Irish acre farm, not a big one, but through the death of an uncle we got another 85 acres, making a farm of 120 acres in all.  I was a Dublin shopkeeper, but I went home.  I was fond of Dublin and am fond of it still; I love every stone in it, and the Dublin accent, when you hear it down the country, is like a mother's smile on a May morning.  I went back to the land. To make use of an Irish bull, if I were living in Dublin for the 25 years that I have been out of it, I would be ten years dead.  It was love of the land that drove me back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> We have been there since 1601, since the invasion of old Kinsale.  I would not sell my holding for £1,000,000. Neither would the men in the old Irish homesteads along the hillsides and through the valleys sell their farms.  That is what kept us through years of drudgery&mdash;the love of the land.  We hear a lot of talk about Danish farmers.  It is all humbug.  The Macs, the Kellys, Burkes and Sheas were driven to the mountainsides and the planters got the big estates on long leases.  They built their houses and palaces.  How many of them are there now?  When the English and Scotch colonists went to America and the colonies they were the best farmers in the world.  Why?  The Irishman did not go to the land.  He felt there was no security there and that he would ultimately be evicted.  The Irish went to the towns and cities.  It is a great pity they did not go to the land.</P>

      <P>The Irish are second to none as farmers; they are well able to do their stuff.  My three sons are good farmers, as good as any I know; I would back them against the products of Ballyhaise, Glasnevin or Clonakilty.  We hear a lot about book knowledge.  No doubt when Baldwin wrote his famous treatise for the national schools it did help, but the model schools were worked by the farmers' sons while the teacher was teaching his Latin and Greek.  All this agricultural college stuff is pure humbug; you must learn farming on the farm. We are able to produce all the stuff that is needed, but why are we not given sufficient assistance?  We had 16 agricultural instructors applying for a temporary vacancy in South Tipperary. Is it that we have too many of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Zealand was mentioned, and there was reference also to the American ranches by Deputy Esmonde. What is the position in America?  They have 50,000,000 acres there that will not grow grass.  Wheat is a necessity in war time and we are prepared to <Col N="332" /> grow it.  It is all humbug to say that the country people cannot continue to grow wheat.  A milk supply is a very big problem.  Another important factor is the mobilising of labour.  You will not get through the coming harvest without mobilising labour along the lines suggested by Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies.  When I was coming to the Dáil I found the corridors of the railway train filled with first-class passengers, among them people I knew from South Tipperary. Many of those people would be much better engaged in helping to harvest the crops, as Deputy Esmonde said, instead of running around rattling tennis balls.</P>
    <P>You will have to mobilise labour. In the city here I have seen poor fellows who would be better off working. Why do you not give us the money?  I made suggestions with regard to the production of sugar beet.  It might mean having sugar at 7½d. or 8d. a lb., but as against that you must consider the fine fruit that was allowed to rot last year because you had not sufficient sugar to make jam.  If you concentrated on the production of sugar you would have enough to barter with England for rubber boots and nailed boots and petrol and paraffin.  Only for the fine spring the consumptive homes would be filled ten times over.</P>
    <P>Ever since the Free State was established you have allowed money to go out of the country.  Why was that allowed and why did you not utilise it in developing the country?  God has been very kind to us by giving us fine weather to plant our crops.  The Minister should exercise some care in the distribution of farming implements. The British and American machines are good and we will be glad to have them.  It is difficult to get appliances for farming machinery.  After trying through Tipperary, I had to come to Dublin to get wrenches.  I had orders for 25 and I succeeded in getting four in a second-hand shop at a cost of 61/3. Unless we take proper precautions, the harvest will fail.  To use another Irish bull, we may have to make hay with the corn if we cannot bind it.  If the country is not to be allowed to starve, very serious attention will have to be given to those matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> We hear talk about New Zealand. Deputy Larkin (Junior) and Deputy Connolly quote that country very often, but New Zealand is a country of virgin soil compared with a worn-out country like Ireland, which has been tilled for about 6,000 years.  What is the good of comparing New Zealand with Ireland?  There is no parallel when Ireland is a poor, worn-out country.  We are suffering from lack of artificial manures, but we are doing the best we can.  I suppose the Minister is making the best of a tough job. We do not agree with everything he does, but I say to him that he must give us a shilling a gallon for milk, or he will be running the same risk as that which he ran when the Government would not give 50/- for wheat.  At present 57/6 is not enough for wheat.</P>
    <P>I do not want to batten on the people, but the labourer is worthy of his hire.  We hear about half holidays and fortnight's annual holidays for workers, but our boys are working 12 and 14 hours a day.  I have seen them working up to 10 o'clock at night, old time, in order to enable the threshing machine to go to the 30 decent neighbours who help us.  Holidays will have to be forgotten, and you will have to mobilise your unemployed in some way if the country is to be saved from starvation. We on the land will not fail you; we will do our bit; but you cannot put a quart into a pint bottle. Our men are getting &ldquo;cruits&rdquo;, as we say in Gaelic&mdash;&ldquo;humps&rdquo;&mdash;from working, and it is about time that was realised.</P>
    <P>You will have to increase the price of wheat, and I tell the men on the Leinster farms that we are producing the bullocks which make the manure of their straw.  I tell them that their economy will fail, outside County Kilkenny, and that they are interlocked with us.  We are all in the same boat, but 1/- a gallon is not going to give you enough milk.  Neighbours have come to me and asked what is the good of it?  You will not get the milk at 1/- a gallon.  Let us not hair-split. You will not get enough beet at the price of £5 a ton for washed beet drawn free from the farm.  The farmer is the galley slave of the whole nation and it is time to end that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> You all walked in to vote against our proposed subsidy of £3 for lea land, to your shame, except the ten just men on those other benches.  We are not cadgers or beggars.  Give us a fair crack of the whip and we will respond. We are, as a matter of fact, responding, but you are not helping us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Cleirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is dragging on at a laborious rate, and I am convinced from the speeches I have heard since it started that the Minister would not be justified in making the slightest change in his agricultural policy.  I am further convinced that if the criticisms of the Department which we have heard here are the criticisms which are made throughout the country by Deputies of the various Parties, the farmers do not want, and will not have any change in the Minister's policy.</P>
      <P>I have heard from the Clann na Talmhan Benches three different policies on farming matters.  I have not heard one single encouraging suggestion as to how any of these different policies should be put into operation. From the opposite benches, too, the policy suggested has not been very clear, and I think the debate has taken a very unreal turn.  The reason for that is that the policy of the present Minister is the best policy for the country, at the moment, anyhow, and for some years past, and that were it not for his policy over the past ten years of trying, in the very early stages to turn the people's mind towards tillage and production, and trying to preserve the home market for the farmers, this country would be in a very sad plight. We do not now hear from a certain Deputy the suggestion that tillage and wheat and beet are all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and, with the exception of one Deputy, who, I think, was not serious about it, we do not hear to-day the suggestion that tillage on a very intensive scale is anything but the policy required at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has taken an unreal turn because the Minister's policy is a good policy and because it is bringing fruitful results.  That unreal turn takes the form of asking, as Deputy Cogan now asks, for a long-term <Col N="335" /> policy of guaranteed prices and for preparations to feed Europe, to feed England and to stock England and Europe with cattle in the post-war period.  Is it not the fact that we cannot rear any more cattle than we are rearing now or produce any more pigs than we are producing now?  We are not able to produce even sufficient food for ourselves with all the genuine effort being made by members of every Party.  It is all very well to have plans for the future if the future works out along the lines for which those plans are prepared, but would it not be foolish to risk our present economy by embarking on any plans for a future which we cannot foresee? The Minister was asked by Clann na Talmhan to guarantee that the Danish farmer would not come back into the English market when the war is over.  He was asked by Deputies on other benches to guarantee that there would be food and stock for Europe when the war is over.  I think it is ridiculous to make haphazard suggestions of that kind.  The Department would be wise to consider plans for such an eventuality, but I do not think that we could now start producing the stock or storing up in cold storage the food which will be required by any of these countries in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>We have listened for the past two days about the slaves on the land.  If anything will tend to injure farming in this country, it is the type of speeches, political wrigglers' speeches, which were made here in the past two days about the slaves on the land. There are no slaves on the land and there is no slavish work on the land, either.  It is a lordly occupation, and, as the last speaker said, it is an occupation of which the men on the land are proud.  These speeches about slavery on the land do not become anybody here and they do not enhance the political prestige of anybody.</P>
    <P>In the West, any how, there is difficulty in getting labour to work on the farms in some cases.  But labour is well paid in the West for working on the farms.  I have as much to do with <Col N="336" /> them as anybody else.  There is no complaint from the labourers who work on the land as an occupation.  It is only a part-time occupation for them in the West.  I know there is the attraction of the towns, and, if they read the propaganda speeches made here, there will be a still greater attraction to the starvation of the towns, if they begin to feel that working on a farm is a slavish occupation to be looked down upon.</P>
    <P>There is an attraction in the West for going to England, but let nobody think that the farm labourer in England is well off.  He has to work slavish hours.  It is only the extra time he puts in that makes it worth his while to work on the land in England.  The contracts these men sign provide for a wage of £3 a week.  They have to work long hours of overtime to make the money that they do make.  I have letters from mothers, whose sons have gone to England to work on the land, and who were refused leave by the British Government to transfer into industrial occupations there, asking me if I could do anything to get them transferred from the land into industrial occupations.  The British Government will not allow it.</P>

      <P>They are not. They are only given subsistence allowance in individual cases.  I have signed more forms for workers than the Deputy, because hundreds of them go from my district.  It is only an individual here and there who gets a subsistence allowance in addition to the £3 per week.  Even then, he is not able to send money home, unless he works long hours of sweated labour and works on Sunday and, as I said, there are many applications from men in England, through their parents here, asking people here to work some kind of miracle so that the British Government will allow them to leave the land and go into industrial occupations because the wages are higher.  The suggestion was made yesterday by Deputy Cafferky that some of these men make £10 per week in a rush season with long hours, and he asked <Col N="337" /> why the Minister cannot give them that here.  Where is the use of making silly suggestions of that kind?  Will the Farmers' Party draft a scheme by which wages as attractive as those in England, either on the land or in industry, can be given here to workmen? If they can draft such a scheme, why do they say that the reason the men have to go to England is that the Government will not give them a wage which would enable them to remain here?  It cannot be done under the present system.</P>
      <P>Nobody who has complained about the slavish work of the farm labourer has suggested what his wage should be, unless the last speaker from the Labour Benches was indicating the Labour policy when he said that the profits of a farm should be divided fifty-fifty.  Is that to be accepted as the Labour policy?  Deputy Tunney said that when the farmer's profits were weighed up, the labourer's wages should be 50 per cent of the farmer's profits.  I do not think the farmers will accept that.  I doubt very much if the Labour Party would stand over such a suggestion.  It is a new idea of Labour in this country.  If that is the basis on which farm labour is to be employed, then the labourer will become part owner of the holding and will get a handsome amount.  I believe that that is not even seriously meant by Deputy Tunney.</P>
      <P>It could not be, because, a little over a year ago, he made a speech in Mayo in which he said that the Dublin farm labourer was living in the lap of luxury on account of the present Government's policy, and that labourers in the west of Ireland were dying of starvation.  That was before he became a Deputy for Dublin.  Now he says that the Dublin labourers are starving. Why must people make crossroad speeches here in order to catch votes?  Why not make them at the cross-roads?  If there is a decent suggestion to be made with regard to farm labourers why not make it here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion that the farmers are badly off.  It would suit me to play up to them, too, but I will not do that.  Does not everybody know <Col N="338" /> that since the Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up there were never fewer applications for assistance than in the past 12 months?  Does not the whole country know that the banks here are very anxious to lend money to farmers and that they are not even asked for a loan by farmers?  Does not the whole country know that the deposits in the banks throughout the country are piling up and that the major part of them consists of the hard earnings of farmers at home or the hard earnings of farmers' sons abroad? When farmers are not demanding money, why did the suggestion come from the Farmers' Party last night that the Government should raid the banks and give £100,000,000 to the farmers at 1½ or 2 per cent. interest to enable them to run their industry?  I wonder do the Farmers' Party approve of that suggestion made by Deputy Cafferky?</P>

      <P>The major part of that £100,000,000 in the banks is farmers' deposits.  I should not like to see this Government raiding the banks and taking the hard earnings of the farmers and of the farmers' sons and giving it to ne'er-do-well farmers who will always borrow money in the hope that they will never have to pay it back, as many did in the last war and paid through the nose afterwards for it.  I doubt very much if the responsible heads of the Farmers' Party would even suggest such a policy, apart from allowing an unthinking member of their Party to suggest it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputy Cogan came into the House afterwards and offered an apology and stated that the speech was made in his absence.  I would advise them when they are on important work, as Deputy Cogan and Deputy Donnellan were last night, to place some watch-dog, like Deputy Halliden of Cork, over the members of <Col N="339" /> their Party so as not to have their pitch queered in their absence.  It would be a very wise thing for them to do.</P>
    <P>I must thank sincerely Deputy Cogan for the tribute he paid to the beet industry.  It was a timely tribute from a member of the Farmers' Party.  He stated that it is a sound and businesslike industry run on businesslike lines and that this country was the better of it.  It was time that the deputy leader of the Farmers' Party stated that, because for the past six months the beet industry in my county was staggered by attacks to the effect that its directorate was controlled by Jews, and that the directors were getting the profit in thousands of pounds salary every year.  A shock was given to one of the Mayo Deputies of the Farmers' Party last week when he asked for the names of the Jews on the board of directors, their nationalities and their salaries.  They were all Irishmen and good Irishmen, with good business records and, with the exception of the chairman, they were not drawing thousands a year, they were getting only £300 a year as directors of the board.  So, the Jews &ldquo;went by the board&rdquo;.  Furthermore, there was a statement made in this House that the beet growers who produce beet for the factories were being dealt with crookedly at the factory by not getting a proper return either in weight, in sugar content or in price.  When Deputy Heskin, who is a beet grower and farmer, contradicted his colleague and stated that the beetgrowers had their own representative at the beet factories to see that their interests were looked after, it was asked, were not these men likely to be bribed? Are these men, who are farmers, likely to be bribed and likely to let down the beetgrowers?</P>
    <P>I am very thankful to Deputy Cogan that he has at least tried to make good the slur that has been cast on beetgrowers and on the beet industry.  We had this evening, from Deputy O'Donnell, a demand on the Minister, at this stage, to increase the price of beet.  He is asked to increase the price of beet after too many contracts <Col N="340" /> for beet have come in at the present price.  We had Deputy Cafferky last week asking the Minister to reduce the sugar content from 17.5 to 16.5&mdash;which would mean a very big increase in the price of beet&mdash;and stating that the beetgrowers were not getting a fair deal.  The time to say that was when we were saying it to the Minister, before the price was fixed months ago.  The attempt now to cover up failure to do anything on behalf of the beetgrowers in fixing a price will not get anything across the Beetgrowers' Association, which has steered clear of political Parties and which is fighting a genuine case for the beetgrowers and will, I hope, in future.  As a matter of fact, it has been stated that the price, £4 per ton, for beet is intended to mislead the beetgrowers because the sugar content must be 17.5.  It must be known to members of the Farmers' Party, some of them who take an interest in farming and particularly in beet growing, that the average price per ton throughout the country last year was £3 18s. 3d.  It was only 1/9 below the maximum price for the maximum sugar content fixed.  I think it is a credit to the beetgrowers that they succeeded, without sufficient artificial manures, in getting beet of such a high sugar content and in going so near the maximum price. This year they will have a tougher problem.  I did think something better should be done, owing to the difficulty in obtaining artificial manures, but the beetgrowers are better judges.  They have come along with contracts at the fixed price which I think will give us more beet, probably, than the factories will be able to handle within the time at their disposal.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I should like the Minister to do, if it can be done now, and that is, to try to get the egg industry on a sounder basis.  In the past couple of years, egg production decreased considerably, not because of the price of the eggs, but because of the lack of feeding stuffs.  I think the small farmers in the West of Ireland are providing against that for the future but there should be more cooperation between the egg producers <Col N="341" /> and the egg dealers and egg exporters. As far as I find the position at the moment, because of ignorance of the requirements and ignorance of the laws, the egg producers take very little care in disposing of their eggs in a marketable condition and, because of competition, traders very often do not find it wise to refuse eggs because they are soiled or if there is an odd trade egg in the basket.  There should be a system of propaganda carried out through the Press, the vocational schools, the wireless, giving instructions to egg producers and advising them as to a better and more regular system of marketing their eggs.  If that were done, I think it would place the egg industry in this country on a very sound footing for the future.</P>
    <P>There was a complaint made against the Minister yesterday evening in regard to a consultative council.  We had all been pleading with the Minister to set up a consultative council and the Minister was attacked yesterday evening by Deputy Cafferky, who insinuated that the consultative council was composed solely of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  As a matter of fact, a Deputy who sat in Deputy Cafferky's benches until very recently is a member of that consultative council. I wish these people would take one another into confidence and tell one another what they are doing so that they will not attack the Minister for not having representatives of various Parties on the consultative council. I think the consultative council, formed as it is, will be a very helpful body and, to my own knowledge, they have made very helpful suggestions to the Minister on one or two occasions. I hope the Minister will find it convenient to meet the consultative council frequently in the future and discuss with them many matters dealing with agriculture in general.</P>
    <P>There has been abuse of the Minister because last week a farmer was unable to get seed wheat.  That man should not be a farmer if he waited until last week to look for seed wheat.  I do not see why he should have left it to the last ditch.  Why should the Minister be blamed if the seed wheat which might have been available for him a <Col N="342" /> month ago has gone elsewhere?  As far as I can discover, I think there is enough seed wheat, but I think some better system might be devised by the Minister in providing seed wheat.  For instance, if the Minister would give a bigger price for wheat threshed in January or in February, it would be an inducement to farmers to let their seed season in the stack, and in that way he would get the soundest, healthiest and best seed wheat for the following year.  There is no inducement at present to a farmer to do that, and he threshes it out as soon as he can.  If the inducement of a bigger price were given, it would help considerably.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the position in connection with the wool trade, if he had anything to do with it.  Complaints are being made that the price of wool is too low, and that farmers are going to be ruined in the coming year because of the present price fixed for wool.  Practical farmers whom I know, and with whom I have discussed the position, have stated that the price of wool is a good price. All I would like the Minister to ensure is that when it comes to the fixing of a price for cloth, he will fix the price of the material in relation to the price fixed for wool.  If he does that, I think everybody will be grateful and nobody will complain that the price at present fixed for wool is in any way too low.  It is a good, handsome price, if other prices are fixed in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>In general, I think the country should be very grateful to the Minister for Agriculture.  If we are to speak as members of the Government Party, I know that this Party are grateful to Deputies of other Parties who, many of them against principles they formerly held in regard to tillage, since the emergency, have done everything possible to encourage the people to get over the tillage bias and to produce food in this country to feed our people.  We are in a happy position as far as food is concerned, and if the obstacles attendant on a labour shortage are, by the allocation of labour and machinery, surmounted in the coming year, I think the people <Col N="343" /> will be grateful, and we will be in a happy position, I hope, next autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has now lasted for nearly two days, and I do not want to be guilty of mere repetition. A good deal of time was spent in talking about generalities.  In certain respects the debate resembled an auction; at one time the farmers were up for sale and at another time the labourer was up.  There was fairly keen competition as to who would bid the highest.  But there was a number of speeches about which there was an air of reality.  In this country at the present time we have to meet a challenge. The emergency is a challenge to our economy&mdash;to show ourselves and the world that we can produce, first of all, sufficient human foodstuffs for our own requirements; secondly, sufficient animal foodstuffs; and thirdly, that we can produce sufficient, if possible, for export.  There were two speeches during this debate which I think contributed in a large measure towards showing the way in which we can increase our production here.  They came from different sides of the House. The first was from Deputy Hughes. Whether we agree with Deputy Hughes or not, we must acknowledge that he is a master or as near as it is possible to be a master of agricultural science and agricultural knowledge.  He has spent a considerable time studying the question in all its aspects, and in addition he has practical knowledge of it. From the other side of the House we had Deputy Childers' speech, which, if not as practical, at any rate dealt with the economics of agriculture.  In my opinion it differs to a large extent from the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture.  Those speeches demonstrated one factor, which as far as I can see is lamentably lacking in the general tone of speeches in the present food production campaign, and that is the need for increased production. For a number of years our production of both live stock and crops has been practically static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the live-stock trade has deteriorated to a certain extent and <Col N="344" /> the crops have gone up, but, taking one with the other, we have remained more or less static.  Last year, as compared with the previous year, the total volume of agricultural output declined by 7.7 per cent; as compared with 1941-42 the live stock and live-stock products showed a decline of 7.8 per cent., and crops showed a decline of 7.4 per cent.  That is a serious situation, because if we have next year a decline comparable with that, or anything like it, we will eventually reach a stage when we will not have sufficient to meet our own requirements, and if transport is restricted or curtailed in any way we will not even be able to distribute the food we have.</P>
    <P>I think it is pertinent at this stage to inquire how we propose to contribute to post-war reconstruction and rehabilitation if we are not able to produce sufficient for our own needs.  I am quite confident that we should be able to make a fairly large contribution, relative to our resources, to post-war reconstruction, but that contribution must come in the main from our agricultural produce.  I am quite confident that certain of our industries will be able to contribute to the export trade, but in the main our capacity to assist the afflicted peoples of Europe will depend on an exportable surplus of agricultural produce.  The Farmers' Party dealt at length with certain requirements of the agricultural industry, but no member of that Party&mdash;and I listened to a good many of their speeches&mdash;struck what is, in my opinion, the kernel of the problem, and that is increased production. Deputy Halliden mentioned the fact that, in regard to the cows not on test as compared with the cows not on test, there is a difference of something like 150 gallons per annum in the milk yield.  His argument was that at 9d. per gallon that would amount to a very large sum to the farmer.  That is perfectly true, but why did he not explain that, if we were able to increase our milk yield here to something comparable with that on the continent, or in Great Britain or New Zealand, even the present price would be a remunerative one for the farmer?  The position here is that the cows not on test are <Col N="345" /> worse than the cows on test, and the cows on test are 200 gallons per annum below the cows on test in Great Britain and Denmark before the war.</P>
    <P>I will concede that, at the present time, we have not the foodstuffs that we had pre-war.  We have not artificial foodstuffs, such as cotton cake and the other cakes that we normally had, but, even when we had those foodstuffs, we were not able to increase our milk production to the same extent as they were able to do it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is one interesting feature of which I have heard in connection with milk production.  It is in connection with a herd in County Wicklow, from which the yield now is the same as it was pre-war.  It is a herd of Friesian cattle.  I will admit that they are practically totally unsuited to the general requirements here, but it is an interesting fact that a herd which was formerly fed on concentrated foods and every type of highly productive mixture that was available is now producing, on only oats and hay and roots, the same milk yield as it produced pre-war. The Department might inquire how it is that feeding-stuffs, which, pre-war, were regarded as being of such nutrition content and regarded as contributing in such a large measure to the milk yield, were not able to give better results than are obtained at the present time when those feeding-stuffs are not available.  I do not think the experience of that particular milk producer is borne out elsewhere, but it is important to bear in mind the fact that it is possible, by judicious feeding of home-produced feeding-stuffs, to maintain the same standard of milk yield as was formerly achieved with imported cakes.</P>
    <P>On this question of live stock, I doubt if we are developing along the right lines.  We have had in this country for a number of years the benefit of the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925. That Act was designed to do away with nondescript cattle, or at any rate to ensure that, so far as shorthorn cattle were concerned, the bulls used were up to a certain standard; in other words, a licenced bull had to be up to a minimum standard.  I am inclined to think we have reached a stage when <Col N="346" /> we will have to go further when dealing with the question of one breed as against another.  We have tried here for a number of years to improve our stock merely by having licensed bulls, so far as shorthorns are concerned, and making sure that white-heads, Aberdeen Angus and other breeds are pedigree.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the standard of licensed bulls has, more or less, been allowed to remain static; that there has not been a higher standard required, if not every year at any rate every three or four years. The average shorthorn licensed bull at the present time is not much better than the shorthorn of 1925.  An even more serious aspect of the question is that the shorthorn bulls which the Department are distributing are not having the desired results, and I am afraid that is one of the reasons why our milk yield has not increased.  The Department, so far as I am aware of the schemes they are operating, have dairy shorthorn and beef shorthorn bulls which they distribute throughout the country, the dairy shorthorns to certain counties and the beef, or single dairy, shorthorns to other counties to produce what is generally regarded as the dual purpose animal. If I may be pardoned for quoting a personal experience, it is impossible, I think, to get the dual purpose animal properly.  You may get it with one cross.  I have not the statistics, nor do I think they are published by the Department, but I think it is correct to say that in 80 per cent. of the cases where the progeny of beef shorthorn bulls are mated with dairy shorthorn cows, or with the average cow, they revert back to beef.  I think the Department are aware of the fact that, over a fairly long number of years, the tendency has been a reversion to beef. It may be asked, how are we going to correct that?  I think there is only one way of doing it, and that is, to regionalise to a certain extent.  Do not allow the Hereford, the Aberdeen Angus or any other breed into certain areas or counties.</P>
    <P>We have had compulsion now for a number of years in the case of tillage <Col N="347" /> and of other operations related to our agricultural economy.  In this matter, I think we must have compulsion to the extent that, in the areas where dairy shorthorn bulls are distributed there will be a prohibition against the entrance of other breeds of cattle into those areas.  That may have this result, that our milk supplies will be coming from certain areas wholly and entirely.  We could go further and insist that milk suppliers who are supplying milk to towns and cities, and who are registered under the Milk Production Act must keep dairy shorthorn bulls.  In all the larger cities and towns there are very fine herds of half-bred shorthorn cows or, at any rate, milch cows, and in many cases you see Herefords or Aberdeen Angus bulls running with them.  If we are going to secure an increase in our milk yields&mdash; and, mind you, bad and all as the position may appear in other countries to-day, there will be keen competition from these countries, and we will have to produce cattle of high quality if we are to keep our place in the post-war world market&mdash;it will be necessary for us to insist on registered milk suppliers keeping registered dairy bulls.  The general tendency of the Department's scheme, as now operated, is to have a reversion to beef, so that we are not getting milch cattle of a fairly reasonable standard, especially from the shorthorn bulls which are being distributed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of milk production is that we here are principally concerned with producing milk from spring to summer and autumn.  I listened to a member of the Clann na Talmhan Party who more or less agreed with that policy.  Our difficulty is to produce sufficient milk to have an even supply in the winter not only for consumption as fresh milk, but for butter making. We must try to alter our economy so as to have milk production in winter and summer.  The old-time method of farming, of cows calving in the spring and summer and, with few exceptions, not calving again until the following spring, will not do now.  We must modernise our methods and try to have a level milk production.  In that <Col N="348" /> respect we will have to follow industrial practices with a level production all the year round&mdash;that is if we want to compete with other countries after the war, and supply our own requirements.</P>
    <P>While on that question, I believe that cow testing is a valuable asset in keeping production up to a uniform standard.  It is valuable for a number of reasons.  One is that you know exactly what your cows are producing; you know the standard of butter fats and you are able to estimate, from the quantity and quality of what each cow produces, what the herd as a whole produces for the food consumed.  In that way if farmers are supplied with shorthorn bulls they will be able to find out after a number of crosses how often they can afford to cross beef shorthorns and dairy cows.  If you go in wholly for a double dairy beef shorthorn or single dairy cattle, the progeny is too light and too long in the leg to be of any use either as a store or beef animal.  The position is that, with the exception of certain counties, we have not sufficiently developed milk production on the one hand or beef production on the other.  If you go in wholly for beef you will not have sufficient milk for ordinary requirements.</P>
    <P>We have long had a good reputation for our pedigree stock.  I think that the results at the shows for a long number of years indicate that we are going to continue to enjoy that reputation.  I would like to put this point to the Minister and to the Department: that when they go across to England or Scotland to buy pedigree stock they should not be limited to a certain price.  In regard to that, I believe that bureaucracy is completely at fault.  I know that in the cattle end of the Department they have excellent advisers.  I have often heard from the officials, when they came home after buying bulls at the other side and when asked why they did not buy certain other animals that had gone elsewhere, that they were limited to a certain price.  We know that it is not always the most expensive animals that are the best.  I think it would be well worth while spending more money so that we <Col N="349" /> might get a name for ourselves as being amongst the buyers of the best stock in England and Scotland.  In that way we would be able to convince farmers elsewhere that our stock was as good, if not better, than anything that they could produce.  In the case of those high priced animals our representatives often drop out of the bidding although in order to secure one of them it might only mean going another £100 or £200.  For that comparatively small sum the high priced animal goes to the Argentine or to a Scottish buyer.  The result is that, so far as pedigree stock are concerned, they are able to do better than we can.  It was only recently, however, that I read an article in a farming paper published in England in which it was said that the Irish cattle which go over there are, from the point of view of quality, better than the cattle which the English farmers themselves are able to produce. I would urge the Department to stretch a point, and I would urge the Minister to consider our general reputation in limiting the amount which the Department's inspectors or advisers are allowed to spend.</P>
    <P>At the present time we are much concerned with the production of food. The Minister stated he was fairly satisfied with the sowing of crops, in so far as he was informed by his advisers and in so far as he could see for himself. I am inclined to think he is a bit of an optimist in that respect because, so far as wheat is concerned &mdash;it may have been their own fault, either through not sowing sufficient winter wheat or not realising in time that they intended to sow spring wheat in greater quantity than winter wheat &mdash;but the farmers left it late to get good spring wheat seed, and the position now is that the only available seed&mdash;and in many places even it is not available&mdash;is Manitoba.  While the Minister assured the House last week that it was all right, I think that he should ensure that the people are convinced that it is all right.  The impression I got from contact with the people who had to sow Manitoba wheat is that they understood that last year a quantity of it was sown in the Department's farm and that the yield was <Col N="350" /> only eight barrels to the acre, and, while many farmers might be satisfied with that, their fear is that if the Department's farm was able to get only that amount, how could they be expected, with their limited resources and machinery, to produce anything like eight barrels?  The other fear is that Manitoba wheat does not stand up as well as other wheat.</P>
    <P>With regard to crop production, I think the Minister is not sufficiently aware of, or he does not register that he is unduly perturbed about, the available supply of machinery.  He admitted he was trying to get all the machinery he could, but, even with the machinery he has, he is satisfied that the best use is being made of it, and that it is being distributed as widely as possible and, where he has the distribution of it, does he think that it is in the hands of people who will make the best use of it?  Speaking for my own county, numerous farmers got to threshing only in the past month, and some have not threshed yet.  It may be that the rush of spring work came on and that as they had not threshed before the spring work, they could not thresh any sooner.</P>
    <P>In connection with the distribution of available machinery, I mentioned on the Supplementary Estimate that the Minister should control the prices which tractor owners and threshing-mill owners charge, and, similarly, what the labourers accompanying the machines charge.  Last year farmers were held up to ransom in this connection. The price asked one day was 22/6, and on the following day it had increased to 25/-.  It is not good enough to have one section of the community threatening another with illegal or any other action.  We are in this thing as a united nation, united in our resolve to solve our problems and united in the understanding that if we do not attempt to solve them, as a united nation we will go down.  We must realise that the individual&mdash;and in many cases it is only the individual &mdash;with a threashing-mill or a tractor at a certain time of the year is a very important factor in producing food.  Last year a number of them took unfair advantage of the farmers who had not sufficient machinery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> As regards the rotation of crops, I think that the Minister and his Department do not sufficiently inform farmers of the best method of rotation.  Every farmer carries out crop rotation according to his own idea and, of course, most of the farmers are more or less right.  They follow roots and cereals intermittently, according as they believe they get the best results.  But from the information accumulated on the Department's farms, they should distribute knowledge more widely among the farmers, not alone by leaflets but by lectures, and, if it is at all possible, by practical demonstration. I want to make a distinction between experimental and demonstration farms.  There is a tendency among farmers, when you talk about a Depayment's farm, to say that it is all very well for the Department to do that on their farms, because they have unlimited resources and all the necessary requirements, but how could farmers be expected to do it?  I suggest that in certain parts of the country demonstration farms might be established to show the farmers how they could do it, and I would vary the size of the farm according to the locality.</P>
    <P>I would explain the cost entitled and prepare a balance sheet, if necessary. The general tendency among farmers is that they are inclined to regard the Department of Agriculture as a body apart, and the Department's farms as institutions apart from the ordinary practical work a farmer has to deal with.  I have no doubt there has been a great improvement among farmers arising out of the assistance they secure from the Department, and as a result of the manner in which they utilise the knowledge and experience accumulated by Departmental inspectors on the Department's farms.  But I think it should go further.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, in connection with agricultural education, that they had endeavoured to extend it and he did not seem to be satisfied with what has been done up to the present. I think he is quite right.  In this country we have not fully realised the benefit of scientific farming and the benefit that science as applied to <Col N="352" /> farming can be.  I admit that it is easy to decry an institution which has all the necessary requirements, but there is no doubt that since the war other countries actually involved in the war have applied, in a truly unimaginable way, modern scientific knowledge, crop rotation and so on, and they have obtained very satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>Research work is also an important factor.  I suggest the amount mentioned in the Estimate here is totally inadequate for the requirements of this country.  The losses which farmers suffer annually as a result of cattle diseases of all kinds are very considerable. There are certain diseases which, as every farmer knows, contribute in a very large degree to those losses&mdash; mammitis, abortion, and so on&mdash;and all these diseases reduce substantially what the farmer makes out of his land and out of his live stock.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is not a farmer&mdash; certainly there are not very many&mdash; whose income is not cut down by one-fifth annually by losses due to animal diseases.  It is within the power of man to reduce that loss, because, with veterinary education which has reached a fairly high standard, it is possible, just as it is possible and has been possible in ordinary medicine to reduce mortality, to deal with farmers' losses due to livestock disease.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of disquieting factors about our agricultural production. One is in relation to pig producing and the other to poultry keeping.  In both of these branches of our agriculture and particularly in pig production, there has been a great decline over a number of years, and while, as Deputy O Cleirigh mentioned, for the last two years, poultry keepers could not get the necessary feeding stuffs, since we have ceased to take the full extraction from wheat a certain proportion of pollard and other offals should be available which will have to be distributed over both poultry and pig production.  It can be used also, of course, for stall-fed cattle, but if the Department could import even a small quantity of maize, it would greatly assist in keeping up poultry production. If necessary, I would ensure <Col N="353" /> that the pollard available goes to poultry keepers, or certainly a proportion of it, because, as we all know, very little will feed a number of poultry.  In that way, we would be able to increase our egg production. There is no use in talking about increased egg production, even on the basis of 10/- an egg, if we have not got the feeding stuffs to give the poultry.</P>
    <P>We heard about industrial farming, and a comparison was made between this country and Russia.  I do not for one moment believe that the farming methods which suit Russia would suit this country.  Russia is a country of vast extent, with a huge population, who are satisfied with a far lower standard of living than we are, and the farming they engage in is no more suited to our requirements than our mentality is like the Russian mentality. We are essentially a country of small or medium-sized farmers who in many cases exist as a self-contained community.  They exist as a self-contained community to the extent that, with the exception of certain necessary articles which they cannot produce themselves, they live, not alone financially, but from the point of view of food, out of what they produce on the land.  The figures at present show that over a number of years the tendency, possibly as a result of shortages of feeding stuffs and other necessary articles which were formerly available, has been for the consumption of home-produced food to increase each year.  Each farm appears from the figures&mdash;they are more or less approximate&mdash;to be consuming more of the food produced on it.</P>
    <P>It is up to every Deputy and every individual who desires&mdash;and I am quite sure that most members of the House desire&mdash;to see us weather the present situation, to render every assistance, so that we may weather this emergency, not alone in a satisfactory manner so that we may have pride in ourselves, but in a manner which will demonstrate to the world that we are a country worthy to be free, that we are worthy of freedom, that&mdash;and this, in my opinion, is one of the values of freedom&mdash;we are able to do our own job better than anyone else, that we are able to meet our own requirements <Col N="354" /> and solve our own problems in our own way; that our way is as good as, if not better than, many of the methods we see adopted throughout the world, and which have brought untold misery when diverted to other ends; and that we, by our own industry, our own labour and our own knowledge, are able to satisfy the requirements not alone of our farmers, but of all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to realise that, as well as being unpatriotic, it is morally wrong for any section to attempt to hold up to ransom or to coerce by threats of any kind&mdash;and this goes for all sections&mdash;another section. We are all members of one community, and to make wild statements that one section or another is the backbone of the nation, or that one portion of our agricultural economy is more important than another, is absolute nonsense. It is childish, because we could scarcely get on for any length of time without all sections working together to solve a problem which is not an individual problem but a problem of the whole community as a community.</P>

      <P>Having listened to this debate for the last three days, I would say that there must be some truth in the Tower of Babel story, because it has been the most extraordinary debate that any human being ever listened to.  We have had all the authoritarians, from the Minister down to the rank and file of every group, coming here with contradictory views, not only of life itself but the problems which follow every action in human life.  I never saw a more suave and self-satisfied submission by any man than that given by the representative of the Government in the Department of Agriculture.  It is the first time I have listened to the Minister when speaking at any great length.  I have always, unfortunately, been engaged in some other occupation when he spoke previously at length, but I made it my business to hear him from beginning to end on this occasion.  He started off in an optimistic mood and finished up with a laugh.  There is nothing to laugh at in the condition of this country at present, and I do not think it comes well from the Govern- <Col N="355" /> ment Benches, more particularly after hearing the speech of that intelligent gentleman who knows everything and everybody and how to run the whole universe, Deputy O Cléirigh.  His was a most impudent and audacious statement, which I do not think was ever equalled in any public representative body.  I suggest that he ought to be sent out to speak over the radio&mdash;he would bring the country to a standstill in 24 hours.</P>
      <P>What is the problem, given a country and its people?  How best to make use of the country and the efforts of its people.  Is that not the problem? Deputy O Cléirigh congratulates a Government which, after ten years, cannot produce food for the people. That is his conclusion.  His words were: &ldquo;We have failed to produce the necessary foods.&rdquo;  Yet, previous to that, he congratulated the Government on having the most omnipotent Minister for Agriculture.  Which statement is true? Either one or other must be untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister would never at any time claim that he knows everything about agriculture.  He has had opportunities that many of us did not get in regard to the ownership and use of land and university training. What has he done during the past year and what does he suggest should be done in the future?  He admits absolute failure himself.  It is admitted in his own official documents.  There has been a decline in production, notwithstanding every effort made by the Government in the way of publicity and propaganda by the most outstanding figures in our nation.  They had means of propaganda open to them which were open to nobody else.  We had the Leader of the nation, the admitted spokesman of the nation, going out campaigning and doing work that no other man in his Party, I suppose, is able to do, with the goodwill, so far as we know, of every Party in this House.  Yet the Minister comes here with this story that there has been a reduction in the gross output of foodstuffs in the country.  If I were to come before a public assembly charged with the responsibilities of a Minister to <Col N="356" /> make that statement after the effort that was made by propaganda, lectures and discussion, I would submit myself to the House and withdraw.  I say that it is the most inglorious passage I ever heard from any responsible man in any public assembly in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>We were told a moment ago in a very able speech that we ought not to bother about countries outside, that we should not take any notice of what happens in other countries.  We were told that by a man who is well read and who has got modern ideas. I am surprised at Deputy Cosgrave, the son of an able man and a statesman. He said some very useful things, but he spoiled the whole of his advice to us by the suggestion that we ought to withdraw into our own little patch of earth or, as a farmers' representative described it, into mud and misery.  I did not think that the four green fields of Caithlin Ní Houlihan could be described as mud and misery.  We used to sing about them and tell all the world about them and describe them in beautiful passages, such as Deputy O'Donnell did.  Now we are told they are mud and misery.  Mud, of course, is only matter in the wrong place.  Of course when properly treated it becomes earth.</P>
    <P>This debate has been an interesting one.  I listened to Deputy Hughes, and I agree with what Deputy Cosgrave said, that he is one of the most studious men in this House.  He is a man who undoubtedly knows what he is talking about.  Deputy O Cleirigh said that men spoke in this House who did not know what they were talking about.  The Deputy himself conveyed to me the impression that he lacked an understanding of what he was talking about.  I have listened to Deputy Hughes dealing with this matter on three occasions during the past few months.  I think he will agree with me that he repeated himself on these occasions, but good things cannot be said too often.  I am quite sure that when Deputies turn to the records of this House and read Deputy Hughes' speeches, as I have had the pleasure of reading <Col N="357" /> them on two occasions, they will agree that we have thinking men amongst the agriculturists in this country.  Whether we agree with Deputy Hughes or not, his suggestions are thoughtful.  The important thing is to try out a thing and, if it fails, try some other avenue&mdash;try and try again.  Is not that the lesson of life that we all had to learn?  Deputy Hughes gave facts and figures in support of his arguments.  His arguments were very closely reasoned and he showed a deep knowledge of his subject. He is not a blatherskite who talks in this House for the purpose of getting his name on the records. He showed earnestness and a desire to help his country and did not speak from a selfish point of view.  He spoke with calmness; he was not bitter like I am, because I am a bitter man.  Even the Ceann Comhairle admits that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes approached this matter as he would an ordinary discussion or as an educationist who had authority to speak in a class would.  I think the Minister will agree that that was his approach to the subject.  It is a pity that we could not have kept along that line throughout the debate, instead of saying helpful things about each other, trying to bring up the dead past, always digging up the dead past or, metaphorically, taking the nation by the throat, so to speak, and holding it up to scorn and ridicule.  I wish we could, even for one session, forget about the past.  Of course, we cannot forget about the past, because out of the past we must learn for the present and plan for the future, but we could agree not to refer to the past.  But this problem does confront us, and I suggest that we ought to face it as one family.  Let us argue this as a family would argue it.  Sometimes there are bitter recriminations even in a family. But we should approach it in the family spirit and with the cohesive power of a family.  When anyone outside tries to injure a family they combine against him.  We should face <Col N="358" /> this as one family, though we may differ among ourselves.</P>
      <P>If we could only combine during this crisis, what a magnificent effort we could make during this coming year when we are facing bitter enemies. There is no nation in the world that ever had to face such enmity as this nation had all through its purgatorial years.  Now that we have got to face the most powerful forces in the world, instigated, as has been said by a Deputy, by poisoned propaganda, surely we should have some regard and respect for each other, some understanding of each other, and some love for each other.  The task before us is to take advantage of the great blessings that have been showered upon us for the betterment of every man, woman and child in the country.  We should forget each other's shortcomings and, in the spirit of understanding, go forward to the task.  We cannot do that without getting rid of what I call the embittered passages in which men who say that there should be no class appeal are the first to raise this class appeal, this bitterness of class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one who has always spoken on behalf of one section of the community, an inarticulate section of the community. As one Deputy said, the farm labourers are an important section of the community; they are the most active units in the community and are living under deplorable conditions. The Deputy used the word &ldquo;slavery&rdquo;. It was the correct word to use, although exception was taken to it. The negro slaves in America were far freer than the ordinary worker in the agricultural area who has to seek his daily bread.  At least, the negro slave had to be fed.  He could be whipped and harassed, but he had an assured shelter and an assured measure of food.  Even his child was protected by the slave-owner, because he was of value, just as the farmer takes care of his horse, his cow, his calf.  But who takes any care of him who was born in the image of God and His likeness, the agricultural labourer?  Nobody. He is to be used and brutalised, abused and exploited.  If he is required, he is hired.  When he has given all his energy to those who have hired him in <Col N="359" /> the heat of the day, he is told, in the dark of the night, that he is no longer required, that he may or may not be wanted in the morning or that he may not be wanted for a week and a day. Surely that is not the spirit in which we ought to approach this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any man in this country dare say that he owns the land.  The only right he has to his holding, small or large, is the right to use the land.  This nation, under God, owns the land, and those who have control of the use of the land are permitted under certain conditions to use it.  That is proved by the Government's Order to the farmers that, whether they like it or not, 33? per cent of the arable land must be tilled. Therefore the farmers have no right to the land except by permission of the people.  That permission is given under certain conditions.  Are the landholders carrying out the conditions? Eighty per cent of them are doing so genuinely and enthusiastically; 10 per cent indifferently and, perhaps, 10 per cent are determined that they will not use the land or let anybody else use it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde started out to give a review of agricultural economy and take us into the future.  I am personally not going to take the House into the future because I am quite sure many Deputies would not accept my view.  Deputy Esmonde did give us a fairly correct record of the past.  He suggested that there were four categories of farmers, although when I asked him what about the fourth class he suggested that he only meant three. I never forget.  I have a memory like an elephant.  I remember that he said he was going to deal with four sections of the farming class.  He dealt with three but he forgot the fourth class&mdash; the dangerous and bitter enemy of this country, that has held this country up to ransom for generations, the class that on their 500-and 1,000-acre holdings will not till one acre if they can possibly evade doing so.</P>
    <P>Then there is the larger farmer who controls a large measure of God's footstool but who uses it as he thinks <Col N="360" /> best for his own benefit and aggrandisement. There is the middle-class farmer, perhaps the hardest worked, even harder worked sometimes than the smaller farmers.  I know many of these men&mdash;sensible men, like Deputy Hughes&mdash;who have a clear vision of life and of how the land ought to be used not for their own purposes but to prove to the world that we can use our resources and prepare for the future. The small farmer has not time for that. He is all the time with his head stuck into the earth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky said that there are 132,000 farmers who have less than 15 acres.  A man with 15 acres is not a farmer; he is a joke; he is worse off than the labourer.  I do not know how any man could have the audacity to suggest that 15 acres is an economic holding.  Men who are good farmers, like Deputy Hughes and Deputy Bennett, will tell you that it is uneconomic, a waste of time and energy. It is futile to talk about men going out to till the earth with a spade.  The day of the spade is gone.  In this country we use 157 different types of spade. Does not that show what a modern race we are?  Some of the types of spade we use to-day must have been used in the Garden of Eden.  Nearly every parish in Mayo has a different type of spade.  I am associated with a firm&mdash;Henshaw&mdash;that makes the best spade in the world&mdash;the Clonskea spade.  In my part of the country, the Six Counties, we have only 11 different types of spade.  That is because we are a hard-headed business people.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Cosgrave said, in this matter of agriculture we have a lot to learn.  I would not take 25 acres in Mayo if they were given to me as a gift.  Not because I do not love Mayo. I think, with George Bernard Shaw, that the most beautiful vista in the world is to be seen from portion of County Mayo.  The beauty of Mayo cannot be expressed by me.  I am not gifted with words.  But the conditions of life in Mayo are such that when men escape from them and go to England, it is like going out of Purgatory into Heaven.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> It has been suggested here that those who earn big money in England have to work long hours.  I lived in England and went to school there.  I have never known Irishmen to get anything in England except what they got by hard work, and sometimes by work they ought not to be proud of.  I have spoken to men who have gone over, and have tried to advise them not to go.  Before Christmas I went over there to see if I could give any comfort to our people who are working in industries there.  In one part of Norfolk there had actually been a riot because Irishmen had earned £21, on acreage, pulling beet, while the Englishman was getting his guaranteed wage.  Despite what Deputy O Cléirigh says, the guaranteed wage under the Agricultural Wages Board in the counties of England is 65/- minimum for a 49-hour week, and 1/3 an hour overtime, except on Sunday, when they get full time.  As a matter of fact, although I was never inside a public house in my life, I saw a notice in chalk outside a public house to the effect that no drink would be served to Irishmen. I know the reason for that If a Mayoman got a few drinks, he would have to be held down.</P>
    <P>Our people who go to England have to work hard.  I have worked with those men.  I have carried on propaganda with them; I know how they live and I know how they can work.  Do you think those men go over to England because they want to go there? Deputy O'Donnell tells us he would not sell his property for £1,000,000.  I do not believe he would, but I am quite sure his three sons would consider the proposition.  A Mayo man is like any other man; if he cannot get a living in the hardy mountainy places of Mayo surely he will travel an easier road if he can find it.  How is it that 117,000 men and women have gone to work in the industrial areas in England during this present crisis?  They do not go over for love of England or through willingness to bring her out of difficulties. Why is it that Peadar O'Donnell is moving around amongst the workers over there to try to advise and help them?  He is not doing that for England, surely?  He is doing it because he wants to safeguard our people during <Col N="362" /> the crisis.  If we could have given those men a chance to live in their own country, do you think they would have gone across to England?  Do you think they would not come back to-morrow if they were given the chance?  Suppose I went to my farmer friend, Deputy Cafferky, and asked him for a job in the harvest or even in the spring, he would offer me the minimum rate of wages set down by the Agricultural Wages Board?  What a joke&mdash;the Agricultural Wages Board, comprised of two representative farmers, two representative labourers, and two persons who represent the public.  They fixed the wages which I will be offered, if I apply for a job as a farm labourer, at 36/- a week, but as from 7th February of this year they have agreed that a man over 20 years of age, an adult worker, is entitled to £2 a week.  That means working a 54-hours week for £2 instead of a 49-hours week in Great Britain for a minimum of 65/-</P>
    <P>I was astonished that Deputy Bennett&mdash;a man whom I always listen to with great attention&mdash;should view the position from a totalitarian point of view.  He suggested that the idle men are there, and should be put to work. He did not say so, but I think he suggested that those idle men should be put to work by force.  He said he knew men who were getting home assistance &mdash;we all know them&mdash;and although he did not say that they should be made to work I think he almost suggested it.  I do not think anybody in this House could seriously suggest that that method should be applied here. If it is applied, we may look out for trouble.  Another gentleman here got up, and he did suggest that men should be made to work.  Very well; let us make all men work.  Let us say: &ldquo;If you do not work neither shall you eat,&rdquo; but let it apply to everybody. Does anybody suggest, in his most embittered moments, that the 51,000 men and women in the City of Dublin who are signing at the labour exchange are doing that because they do not want to work, or because they lack appreciation of their duty to the State? How is it that so many young men&mdash; the finest men that this or any other country has ever produced&mdash;have come up to Dublin since 1939 from the bog <Col N="363" /> areas, the tillage areas and the dairying areas?  We had a dispute here some time ago about the handling of turf in Dublin.  Out of 540 men in one section, 470 were men who had been up from the provinces only a few months.  I said to some of them: &ldquo;What is the idea of coming up here to Dublin?  Why do you not stay at home?&rdquo; The reply was: &ldquo;There is nothing for us down there.&rdquo;  At the same time, the Government are forcing young men in Dublin to go down to the bogs.  Just imagine a young man brought up in Dublin and sent down to cut turf.  As I said in the House a few weeks ago, I could get one of the lads in my union in County Kildare to cut more turf in one hour than any man in this House would cut in a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that those men, who were reared on the land, are coming up here.  They are being offered £2 or 36/- a week for working a 54 hours week on the land, when they can come up to Dublin and get a minimum of 65/- for 44 hours. Can anybody justify driving those men up to Dublin, when they could be provided with a decent chance of life and reasonable hours of work in their own townland or parish?  Cutting turf is skilled work.  Even the men who are footing the turf have to be skilled men. The only work we have to do on the turf in Dublin, outside of clamping a few feet, is the job of filling it into sacks.  The average labourer could learn that in an hour or two.  Surely that could be left to the men in Dublin, the men who have been put out of the building and other trades.  Those men from country districts should be brought back to their own areas not by force but by suggestion.  We are told we should respect the rights and liberties of man, but at the same time the Government are saying: &ldquo;You cultivate that piece of ground, or we will go in and take it from you.&rdquo;  Those are the contradictions.  My friend Deputy Tunney said that this Government has done more for the farm <Col N="364" /> labourer than the other Government did.  Analogies are dangerous things. What did the other Government do for the workers?  To my knowledge, nothing.  What has this Government done for the workers?  They have set up certain social services, which were really only a sop.  Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Cafferky want 1/- a gallon for milk.  What is the reason why they should not be given 1/-?  We hear boasts that there are £170,000,000 lying idle in the banks.  Suppose we give the farmers this 1/- a gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is welcome to that time as far as I am concerned. In raising the particular subject of which I gave notice at the opening of the Dáil to-day, I wish as far as possible to avoid being misunderstood or having my action distorted.  I am aware of the fact that honest people may require to have a thing clearly put before them but no matter how clearly it may be put, it will be distorted by dishonest people. In case there may be any doubts as to my position in raising this matter, I want to make it very clear that the position of this Party, and everyone in this Party, is absolutely and in an unshakable manner behind the Government's reply to a request which was made to this Government by another State lately.  It is necessary to make that clear for this reason.  The Taoiseach and the Government from the very beginning, when the matter came under our notice, were made aware of our position. I was under the impression that it was agreed between ourselves and the Government that it was undesirable <Col N="365" /> for us to refer to the matter in public.  The Vote on Account came before the House and it was not referred to in a public and specific manner from these benches.  Honest people, and others less honest, misinterpreted that silence with the result that General Mulcahy yesterday in the Seanad had to make clear the attitude of this Party.  I am reaffirming that attitude.</P>
      <P>I raised the question on the adjournment purely of the propriety of discussing the conduct of any foreign Minister in this country through the channels of the Press.  I am not, in raising that particular matter as to propriety or procedure, championing any individual in any dispute that he may have with a newspaper or anybody else.  An article appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day.  The article, in the main, was dealing with and replying to propaganda in other newspapers, which propaganda was harmful to this country.  As far as the article was dealing with such propaganda, and correcting misunderstandings that might arise through such propaganda, I have no fault to find with it, but in the course of that article it was stated that certain information alleged to be false could only have reached such newspapers either through the Head of the Government here or through the representative of the United States of America in this country; that they were aware of the fact that such information was not given by the Head of the Government; that ordinary people, therefore, would believe that it had been given by the representative of the United States in this country; and if that was incorrect, that particular representative of the United States was called on to deny the statement made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My questions were as follows: Was the Censor made aware of that particular article?  Did it meet with the approval of the Censor, and further, in present circumstances, did he consider it safe and wise and proper that, where a charge is made or suggested against a Minister representing another country, the name of that particular Minister should be pulled into a controversial article in a newspaper? <Col N="366" /> I want to know, further, were the ordinary diplomatic channels used before that article was written, in order to ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the statement made?  My net point is this: whether it is in keeping with the national dignity of this State, and with the reputation we have for courtesy and for hospitality, that we should allow the name of an honoured guest, no matter who he may be, whether his name is Gray, Maffey or Hempel, to be dragged into the controversial columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>, and that that should be done with the approval of the Censor and in a paper that is generally regarded as a Government organ.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a reputation, hardly earned, for being a people determined to stand over their rights, no matter what the odds may be, a people, no matter how gravely or acutely they may differ, who will always be found to stand together in defence of those rights.  We have in addition to that a reputation, deservedly earned, for hospitality, for courtesy, for proper decorum, for knowing how to behave at home and abroad, nationally and internationally. I doubt if we are setting a healthy headline in allowing the columns of any national newspaper, a national newspaper closely associated with the Government, to be used in order to draw into a controversy the name of any Minister representing any foreign country and living here in our capital. As the Taoiseach has frequently said, in our neutral position we are in the position of balancing on a razor edge. If articles of this kind, in association with names, are to appear, is it perfectly wise, is it perfectly safe, is it making our neutrality more secure, is there even the possibility of a misunderstanding and of offence being taken where none was meant?  If there is even the remotest possibility of offence being taken where none was intended, then I think that such articles should not be allowed to appear.  The article was headed &ldquo;Denial Needed&rdquo;.  The suggestion is that denial by the American Minister is needed in order to clarify the situation. I was informed since I raised <Col N="367" /> this matter to-day by the Press&mdash;that before that article appeared in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Press</i> was telephonically informed&mdash; yesterday evening&mdash;on behalf of the American Minister that he had given no such interview as is referred to in the editorial.</P>
    <P>In other words, if that be true, before that article was written they had a denial by the Taoiseach, which is mentioned in the editorial, and a denial by the American Minister.  Yet, the article goes out a day afterwards asking the American Minister, as it were, to clear his name by giving a denial.  As I have said, I have raised this matter on the question of proper behaviour, on the question of hospitality and courtesy, on the question of introducing any element that may make a difficult situation more difficult. In raising this matter, I am not departing one inch from the expressed determination of all elements, classes and Parties in this country to stand over the firm refusal of the request made.  I am not championing the particular Minister referred to in the editorial.  I am questioning the advisability of a Government Department, in times of difficulty and delicacy, allowing to reach the public, through our national newspapers, articles that might be taken as as giving offence either to a Minister of a foreign country or to the foreign country that sent that Minister here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that Deputy O'Higgins has seen fit to describe the article as one that &ldquo;gives <Col N="368" /> offence to the Minister of a friendly country in our capital and provocation to a friendly country.&rdquo;  It is no such thing.  I hold very strongly that the only person to whom that article could give offence is the special correspondent of the newsagency that circulated untrue reports about the Government and the people of this country.</P>
      <P>It was this same special correspondent, representing the Associated Press, that, apparently quite deliberately and after he had been officially informed that it was untrue, circulated the story that the Irish Red Cross had invited Axis representatives to a ceilidh in St. Patrick's Hall on St. Patrick's night and had not invited the American Minister.  The publication of that story, without repudiation, could only help to bedevil the relations between the people of Ireland and the people of America and create the impression that the Irish Red Cross deliberately insulted the representative of a Government and of a people to whom they have every right to be grateful for the magnificent gifts they have received from the American Red Cross during the past couple of years. The Irish Red Cross, naturally, felt it their duty immediately to repudiate that lie&mdash;the lie that they had insulted the American Minister by inviting Axis representatives and ignoring him. The <i>Irish Press</i>, on the 22nd March, published a leading article denouncing the action of the Associated Press in this regard.  That leading article of the 22nd March&mdash;the day before the publication of the article to which Deputy O'Higgins refers&mdash;had the effect of securing circulation by the Associated Press of the Red Cross denial of the untrue statement.  It had that good effect.  Otherwise, it looked as if the denial by the Red Cross was not going to be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to this leading article to which Deputy O'Higgins refers, it will be noted that it deals with a further untruth which was circulated by this same special correspondent of the Associated Press and was, in fact, part of the same message which misrepresented the Irish Red Cross.  This second part, however&mdash;the part dealt with in to-day's leading article&mdash;did <Col N="369" /> not reach this country until yesterday: the first part was dealt with in the previous day's <i>Irish Press</i> article which, as I have said, had the effect of securing publication of the Red Cross denial.</P>
    <P>Now, let anybody read the full story which was circulated by the Associated Press, and I think that any reader would infer from it that it was from the American Minister that this special correspondent of the Associated Press received the alleged information regarding the Red Cross function and, further, that it was from the American Minister that he also received the allegation that the Taoiseach was overcome by ungovernable fury, shouting and thumping the table, when he received the American Note of the 21st February.  It is incredible that the American Minister would be guilty of circulating such a hostile description, intended to misrepresent the interview which he had with the Taoiseach, or that, in fact, he would commit so grave a breach of diplomatic courtesy as to tell a Press correspondent, no matter who that correspondent might be, even true details about what happened between himself and the Taoiseach upon such an occasion.  The American Minister, yesterday, repudiated the first part of this special correspondent's statement, and I feel certain that he will also repudiate the second part, which was published in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day.</P>
    <P>We all remember the recent past and we remember that this is not the first occasion upon which the American Minister felt compelled to repudiate certain journalists.  It will be remembered, in fact, that it was only last week that he did so in regard to the story that was doing so much damage abroad and which was attributed to him by the <i>New York Times</i> correspondent in London: the story in connection with the alleged Axis diplomatic bags.  That happened only last week, and I felt that it was in the interests of the good relations which have existed between the Irish and the American peoples that the American Minister should have been given the opportunity, by this article in the <i>Irish Press</i>, of repudiating to the Irish people the falsehoods which <Col N="370" /> were being circulated abroad on his alleged authority, and, accordingly, I passed the article for publication.</P>
    <P>I only want to add this: that since the beginning of this war a number of foreign newspapers have tried to bedevil the relations between Ireland and England, and between Ireland and the United States of America. Deputies know, generally, the manner in which Censorship is operated here, and in order to stop one word from borrowing another and to prevent our people losing their balanced judgment by the publication in our papers of unfair attacks by individual trouble-making foreign journalists, I have prohibited, consistently, since the beginning of the war, the publication in our papers of these attacks, except in the case where definite allegations were made which had to be countered in the national interests by authoritative statements here in the Dáil or in our newspapers.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, I think, to any honest observer that while the Censorship upheld, as was its duty, the decision of the Irish people to remain neutral during these years, it refused steadfastly to allow this country to be dragged into the propaganda war against any side; particularly as it is well known that we have steadfastly tried, in every way that we could, to prevent any ill-feeling being created between the Irish people and our nearest neighbour, and between the Irish people and that country in which there are more members of the Irish race than in all the other countries in the world combined. It is our interest and our heartfelt desire as a people that good relations with both these countries should continue.</P>
    <P>These good relations, however, cannot last if deliberate misrepresentations about the acts and attitude of the Irish people and their Government are circulated abroad without authoritative repudiation.  I can only hope that American and English news agencies will put an end to the unfair and untruthful propaganda war against the Irish Government and people: that they will do so, if not in the interests of truth and justice or of this small <Col N="371" /> Irish people, then at least in the interests of the peoples of the United States and Great Britain, with whom it is our desire, now as in the past, to have peaceful and friendly relations on the basis, of course, of free and equal nationhood and of reciprocal respect for each other's rights.</P>

      <P>I take no exception whatsoever to the Minister's statement, but I think that, inadvertently, no doubt, he overlooked the last portion of my statement, to the effect that I had been informed that the <i>Irish Press</i> last evening was notified, on behalf of the American Minister, that he gave no such interview as alleged.  If that is correct, does not the Minister consider that it was entirely inadvisable that the article should appear, calling on the American Minister to deny a thing which he had already denied, if my information is correct?</P>

      <P>I would agree altogether with the Deputy, but the Deputy is mixing times.  I dealt with the Deputy's statement, and with this article, on the basis of the information I had up to 8.45 this evening, and I understand that in or about that time, as I thought would happen, the American Minister has repudiated this business, as asked by the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
