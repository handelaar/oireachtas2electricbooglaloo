    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he can state the approximate number of cattle traders who usually went weekly to the British markets and likewise the number of British cattle traders who came weekly to Ireland to carry out business in the markets and sales of live stock; and whether he can state the average number who crossed in November, 1943; December, 1943; January, 1944; February, 1944, and March, 1944, and whether he can make a statement regarding future prospects for such trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of travel permits issued by my Department to cattle traders residing in this country is, approximately, 200; I have no information in regard to the number of travel permits issued by the British authorities to cattle traders residing in Great Britain.  Travel permits are valid for an unlimited number of journeys within a year, and there are no statistics available as to the frequency with which they are used.  It is not possible, therefore, to say how many cattle traders travelled during any particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, I understand that, under the special temporary restrictions recently imposed by the British authorities, cattle traders, in common with other persons travelling on business, will not normally be granted travel facilities, and cattle traders are, therefore, not likely to be able to <Col N="1178" /> travel between the two countries as long as the present special restrictions remain in force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate if he received any communication from the British authorities before the suspension came into force, indicating that the suspension was likely to take place in regard to those cattle jobbers who were going across from this country to England?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will have to ask the Deputy to put that down as a separate question.  I do not think it likely that there would have been any special mention of cattle traders in any communication received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Looney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the hardships inflicted on many ex-internees who, although having prior to internment several years' stamps to their credit, have on their release after two to four years been deprived of unemployment until they have acquired 12 stamps in the insurance year following the period of enforced absence from employment in accordance with Section 8 of the Unemployment <Col N="1180" /> Insurance Act, 1920; and, if so, if he is prepared to grant relief in this matter by waiving the provisions of the section referred to, as has been done in the case of citizens who return to this country after an absence of two or more years' employment on war work in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Some ex-internees are disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit because no contribution was paid for them during at least one whole insurance year.  I have no power to waive this disqualification, which is statutory.  It is not proposed to introduce legislation to amend the Unemployment Assistance Acts for the purpose of enabling periods of internment to be disregarded in applying this disqualification to persons who have been interned.  I should explain, however, that it is open to the persons concerned to apply for Unemployment Assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the County Manager for Donegal made an Order (No. 5837) on the 6th January, 1944, granting increased rates of salary for the nurses in the county and his Department has failed to sanction the proposals; and if in view of the fact that a subsequent meeting of the Donegal County Council unanimously resolved to ask him to reconsider his decision, and that the refusal to sanction the proposals has operated to prevent managers for certain other counties from proposing similar increases, he will now grant the necessary sanction.</P>

      <P>The County Manager for Donegal made an order on the 6th January last granting certain salaries and allowances to nurses employed by the County Council.  No reference was made in the order to the grant of rations and other emoluments which the nurses at present receive.</P>
      <P>If it was proposed to discontinue the grant of emoluments the revised terms of appointment were less favourable than those approved for similar posts in other areas.</P>
      <P>If the revised scales of remuneration were in addition to existing emoluments they would be in excess of the improved rates of remuneration which have recently been approved in other counties.  Correspondence with a view to clarification of the matter is proceeding with the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, surely the Department should have it that the county manager's proposals were intended to include the usual emoluments in view of the fact that <Col N="1182" /> the nurses at the present moment are getting the usual emoluments?</P>

      <P>The reply is in the affirmative. The position arising out of part-time employment of blind workers has been under examination with the approved agencies for the blind with a view to establishing instructional classes on each day, or part of a day, in the unemployed period so as to enable usual attendances of blind workers and full payment of allowances to be continued.  Proposals from the Richmond National Institution for <Col N="1184" /> the Blind have come to hand this week and are under examination.  No objection is being raised to the Corporation of Dublin paying the rate of augmentation of wages approved under their existing blind welfare scheme since December last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is a fact that a greatly increased acreage amounting to an extra 200,000 acres of spring wheat will need to be sown from now until the end of the sowing period in order to reach the safety margin; if he is aware that his Department's report on farm conditions in March has stated that it seems likely that the acreage under winter wheat will not differ greatly from last year's acreage; and if, in view of the seriousness of this position, he will make a statement as to what progress is being made and is likely to be made towards filling the extra 200,000 acres required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's report on agricultural conditions in March <Col N="1185" /> stated that the final acreage under winter wheat would not differ greatly from last year's acreage.  It also referred to the area sown with spring wheat by the end of March as being considerably greater than at the corresponding date in 1943.  There has been a marked tendency on the part of farmers in the past two seasons to sow spring wheat rather than a winter variety; the very fine weather this spring enabled preparation for sowing in March and April to be made under favourable conditions and the reports of the tillage inspectors indicate that farmers generally are complying with the wheat-growing requirements of this year's tillage Order.  Farmers are being continuously urged to sow as much wheat as they can during the coming weeks, and if they respond to the appeals there is a good prospect that the country's wheat requirements for the ensuing 12 months will be substantially met from this year's harvest.</P>

      <P>I have already given notice to the Chair of my proposal to move the adjournment of the House in accordance with Standing Order No. 29. I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the situation which has arisen as a result of the stoppage or curtailment of coal imports, and the arrangements proposed to be made by the Government to meet that situation.  I have already put that in the hands of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move that leave be given to move this motion at 6 p.m. this evening.  I do so for reasons that I will state briefly. The Dáil is on the verge of adjourning over the week-end.  At the beginning of next week it is proposed, as far as indications are given, to curtail the railway services in this country to the extent of two-thirds of the passenger services and one-third in respect of the goods services.  People are unaware of what is the actual situation with regard to coal which has brought about this drastic reduction.  There is great public confusion and greater public anxiety.  One need only advert to the stoppage of so much passenger traffic and particularly to the stoppage of so much goods traffic to realise the seriousness of the situation in this country, particularly in connection with the transport of agricultural <Col N="1188" /> goods, and the repercussions it may have.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there is further public confusion caused by the fact that in many quarters of this city it is held that there has been no curtailment, no drastic curtailment of coal whatever, notwithstanding which there are not merely statements with regard to the stoppage of transport in the way I have indicated, but there are stories of a terrifying nature with regard to proposals said to be contemplated by the Gas Company and other public utility services.  The public have no information. The company, apparently, is being controlled in this matter by the Government appointed nominee to the railway board, and possibly by departmental servants, and I consider, and I submit to the House that it would be proper that at least by 6 o'clock this House should adjourn to consider this matter of urgent public importance and to hear what is the exact information that the Government have, even at this moment, with regard to either the curtailment or the stoppage of these imports, and also to hear what, if any, arrangements the Government have made, or propose to make, to meet that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the Deputy's request for an alteration of the time that I am anxious to intervene. There is another aspect of the coal question that I propose to refer to.  I wish to refer to a most unhappy meeting which took place at Kingsbridge Station yesterday.  People were met, I am sorry to say, by the management in a spirit which showed no appreciation of what may be termed a national crisis.</P>

      <P>While fully realising the importance of this matter, I feel compelled to object to the motion being taken at 6 o'clock.  I am surprised at Deputy McGilligan butting-in on a motion which has been on the Order Paper for a very long time, a motion to annul an Emergency Powers Order.  Government permission has been granted for the consideration of that motion.  I have been for the past three weeks pressing for its consideration. I do not see why the Deputy could not introduce his motion at 7.30 p.m., and have a late sitting to deal with it if he so wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main items for discussion to-day are four Estimates, none of which is urgent.  They could be dealt with a month hence.  The most paramount problem at the moment is the dislocation of the transport services. I urge the Taoiseach to approach this matter in a statesmanlike way, and to realise that the Estimates are in no way immediate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the Chair and I am appealing to the Taoiseach.  The Army Estimate has already been discussed in considerable detail at the Defence Conference.  This Government knows that it has got probably more co-operation in a time of crisis than any other Government in the world.  A discussion of the transport services is a matter of vital importance. Certain Ministers may not know it, but Deputies certainly know that there is perfect public bewilderment as to what the transport services <Col N="1190" /> next week will be and what the position of communications from the transport point of view next week will be.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to rise above the punctillio of debate and procedure and recognise that this is an important matter.  Let us leave the Estimates over until next week.  If the Government afford facilities for the discussion of this most important matter of transport to-day I feel sure they will get all the co-operation they want in discussing the Estimates next week and any other matters at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that it is quite manifest that there is sufficient public uncertainty and anxiety to justify this matter being disposed of as effectively as it may be by the Legislature&mdash;and that is by open discussion? It is unnecessary, I think, to reassure the Executive that at this moment of acute difficulty they need anticipate no carping criticism, and there will be no artificial difficulties constructed to add to those with which they are already confronted.</P>
      <P>May I say that I think Deputy Donnellan is under a misapprehension? Deputy McGilligan's proposal in no way cuts across his desire to discuss the wool motion to which he referred.  The Government is going to give time for that, and whatever time is given to the consideration of Deputy McGilligan's motion, presumably the Government will give Deputy Donnellan time in accordance with their undertaking to discuss his motion of limited, albeit definite, importance. I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he would arrange to take Deputy McGilligan's motion at 6 o'clock this evening, an order to sit not later than midnight might be made and a reasonable time could be given to the Minister for Supplies to conclude.  All that could be provided for.  That would meet the wishes of the House and the bulk of Deputies will, I feel sure, leave the discussion to the leaders of the several Parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What everybody wants is not so much to air his views as to afford the Government an opportunity of making a calm, dispassionate statement which <Col N="1191" /> will allay public bewilderment rather than create a feeling of dismay.  We are all prepared for a period of dismay and difficulty.  What encumbers the public mind is bewilderment and uncertainty, and the purpose of Deputy McGilligan's motion is to remove that bewilderment and uncertainty and ensure that no section of the community will take a grave step because they do not fully understand the position.  Deputy O'Sullivan has mentioned the possibility of serious misunderstanding arising.  I suggest there is no possibility of any break-up in the community's resolution to stick together in a time of difficulty except through misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>We are adjourning to-night.  No opportunity will be given between this and next Monday, when the cuts come into operation, of having any kind of frank and open discussion which will remove misunderstanding&mdash;not to pretend that there are no difficulties ahead.  I ask that Deputy McGilligan's motion should be accepted, with the two provisos (1) that Deputy Donnellan should be given time to ventilate his particular difficulty, and (2) that, instead of adjourning at 10.30 we should adjourn at midnight or later, so that ample time will be given to authoritative members of the House to explain all the difficulties, and ample time given to the Minister to consider the representations made and to make the fullest reply that the facts at his disposal would permit him to make at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is rather unfortunate that I was elsewhere this morning when I heard over the phone that this motion was to be made, and that I did not have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister immediately responsible, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is at the moment engaged in the Seanad. Therefore, I am in a certain amount of difficulty in replying.  I understand and appreciate the basis of the remarks made, but I am not quite sure whether we have to make a decision just now. I should like to have an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and see <Col N="1192" /> whether it would be possible to arrange to have an early discussion&mdash;this would ordinarily come up at 9 o'clock&mdash; whether it would be possible to have it come up at an earlier hour.  We might also have to come to some arrangement with the Deputy who has the other motion which was to come on at 6 o'clock.  I do not know whether it would be possible to postpone an absolute decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One is that the House is to sit on two days a week for the hours set forth by the Parliamentary Secretary, and the second is that there should be a limitation of time on speeches made by Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, and Deputies of all Parties, temporarily, until the financial business before the House is disposed of.  Now, the first thing that I want to say to all Deputies in this House is to beg of them not to be misled by the illusory undertaking that this proposal for limitations on the rights and privileges of Deputies is to be of a purely temporary nature.  I never heard, in 11 years of Parliamentary experience in this House, any proposal by Parliamentary Secretaries for encroachment on the rights of <Col N="1199" /> Deputies of this House that was not introduced under a guarantee that it was purely temporary and would never be resorted to again, and, in every single case of that character, I have heard the consent of the House to such a proposal being used as a precedent, one, two or three years later, for a repetition and even an extension of the original encroachment.</P>
      <P>Now, bear in mind what we are asked to surrender.  There is only one place left to an elected representative of this country in which he may speak his mind freely&mdash;safe from the assault of the vested interests, safe from police interference, safe in the assurance that his words will go on the record whether the Minister for Coordination of Defensive Measures wants them to go on the record or not. If we consent now to give to the Ceann Comhairle or anybody else the right to say to a Deputy: &ldquo;You must sit down; you will not be heard any longer,&rdquo; I warn you that a day may yet come in which the fundamental liberty of some citizen or group of citizens may be at stake in this country, and where the only instrument left for the defence of that liberty is the right of a Deputy to fight on in this House until the Executive makes up its mind that the game of oppression is not worth the candle. If we make the concession that we are asked to make now, we may find ourselves confronted with the fact that the limitation of our right to speak will be such that the Executive can say: &ldquo;Talk all you can; we can wait and deal with you when you are finished speaking.&rdquo;  How can Deputies who claim to represent a people with a history such as ours walk open-eyed into this trap?  Have none of you ever heard of Joe Biggar?  Have none of you ever heard of Charles Stewart Parnell?  Have none of you ever heard of the instrument that was used to protect our people in those days, when the only thing that was left to our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to make this the occasion of opening up old sores, but I do say that a native Government of this country did to the farmers of this country a far greater injury than any that a foreign Government ever inflicted on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, wherever they come from, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs intervenes to say that the weapon which was potent in the hands of the representatives of our people in those days was requisite because it was used in a foreign Parliament.  I want to warn the members of this House that such weapons are equally potent in a country where the Executive of the Parliament is indifferent to the interests of the people of the country, and that these are the only instruments or weapons which the people have left by which to hold up that Executive and by which to enforce their rights so as to make it possible for them to live.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would seem to suggest that to draw an analogy between the situation that existed in those days in connection with a foreign Parliament and anything that might arise in this House is to misrepresent the facts.  It was not the question of its being a foreign Parliament that justified the use of those weapons.  It was because there was a Government in office which sought to oppress our people, and the potent weapon to prevent it was the right to speak in Parliament.  Have we any guarantee, have we any right to expect from our past experience, that there never will be on the Front Benches of the Government a Government which some minority in this House believes is oppressing, cruelly oppressing, a minority in this country, and are we to strip ourselves now of the instrument which our fathers demonstrated to us was absolutely vital if those who represented minorities were to be free to do their job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;How <Col N="1201" /> can you expect Taoiseach de Valera so to conduct himself as to warrant the use of such weapons against him?&rdquo; I am not talking of the Government of to-day; I am thinking not only of to-day, but of to-morrow, and of the years ahead, when those who come after us may require the very weapons, which we threaten now to throw away, to protect the interests of minorities who may then stand bitterly in need of protection.  There are minorities in this House&mdash;labour minorities and agricultural minorities&mdash;who may require the use of these weapons of free speech to-day.  Either of these two might constitute the Government in the morning and against whom then these weapons would be requisite to some other section of the community for the protection of their legitimate rights.</P>
    <P>I will be answered: &ldquo;No one is asked to throw anything permanently away at present,&rdquo; and told that all we are asked to do is something to facilitate the transaction of business in conditions of acute emergency.  If that were true, if it ever could be true, we could argue the expediency of this case, but I know from bitter experience that that plea is never valid. Once compromise the principle that a Deputy should be free to speak as he thinks best&mdash;not as the Ceann Comhairle thinks best; not as the Taoiseach thinks best; but as he thinks best&mdash;and I tell you to-day that you may as well shut up Parliament.  Parliamentary institutions in this country are dead, and a tyranny more loathsome than the tyranny of an individual dictator is on its way, that is, the unrestricted tyranny of a majority, the most cursed form of tyranny under which any people could conceivably live.</P>
    <P>I am fighting in this moment for the preservation of the essential liberty of our own people.  I am fighting against the slanderers of our institutions who describe this House as a talking shop; I am vindicating now against all those who have said during the last 20 years that in this House nothing happens but fellows getting up and talking to hear themselves.  I am trying to demonstrate that that right to talk is the very keystone of the <Col N="1202" /> arch of freedom in this country.  Take it out and the whole thing will ultimately crumble about your ears.  Only the fools who do not understand the essentials of liberty talk about Parliaments being talking shops.  Every tyranny in Europe was established by gentlemen who described the democratic parliaments of their respective countries as talking shops.  The Duma in Petrograd was torn down as a talking shop; the Reichstag in Germany was not rebuilt because it was a talking shop; every free Parliament in the world was torn down because it was a talking shop; and I want Deputies to realise that, if we go on record as saying that we ourselves believe ourselves to be a talking shop, which, in the hour of emergency, ought to be stopped talking, as an unnecessary luxury in time of crisis, we are making an end of Parliament in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not care what crisis or how grave the situation&mdash;there is no consideration for which I would surrender Parliamentary rights and Parliamentary institutions in this country. If we have to surrender these, then the greatest disaster of all has come upon us, and any other disaster would be preferable to it.  I do not charge the Government of this State with a dark conspiracy to put this thing over on us.  I am addressing my words as much to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as to the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party, Fine Gael or any other section of the House.  It is because I think we are in danger of doing inadvertently that for which we shall curse ourselves afterwards for doing that I press the House so strongly to reject this proposal.</P>
    <P>To-day, when we were considering the question of how the transport matter might be best disposed of this evening, I suggested that I was prepared to give an example by abstaining from my undoubted right to intervene in the discussion, and by leaving it to a selected few, because I thought the occasion one on which we rather wanted information from the Minister than to make suggestions to him.  Deputy Donnellan at once asked: &ldquo;Is Deputy Dillon proposing <Col N="1203" /> to restrict debate to certain individuals?&rdquo; No, and there is the distinction I want to make.  Any individual Deputy can impose upon himself a self-denying ordinance to refrain from speaking, but it is quite a different thing if any Deputy, group of Deputies or majority of Deputies claim the right to prevent the humblest member of the House from speaking his mind.</P>
    <P>Some of us may get impatient with Deputy Flanagan, but he may get impatient with us.  I may get weary of listening to Deputy Cafferky, but he may get weary of listening to me, and if I claim or any group claims the right to silence him, some time the day will dawn when he will claim the right to silence me.  If we abuse our rights, sooner or later the Irish people will deal with us, but, in the meantime, we have to bear with the Dillons, the Flanagans, the O Ceallaighs, and the de Valeras, God help us, until the Irish people eliminate them.  But so long as the Irish people send them here, they have a right to complete freedom of speech which no representation should induce this House to limit or take from them.  If they misuse it, the people will see that they do not come back.  What we may consider misuse to-day, posterity may bless them for, on the ground that what to us was no more than nuisance, in its ultimate effect produced some blessing for the community which, without their action, would never have been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say this: the indictment of every person who wants to destroy representative institutions in a democratic country is the description that the Legislature is a talking shop.  Is that not so?  Is that not the universal cry?  Are we going on record at this stage as saying that, in our heart of hearts, we agree with that estimate of Dáil Eireann&mdash;that there is too much talk here, too much worthless waste of time by Deputies talking to hear themselves talk?  I have been as bored as any Deputy listening to my colleagues, and I suppose I have done my share of boring, but I want to say that although taking <Col N="1204" /> the individual phrases spoken by Deputies, many of them may have been nugatory, looking back over 12 years' of experience, there has not been a word said in this House which I regret permission having been given to let it be said.  The most verbose, the most irrelevant, the most explosive Deputy who has got up and talked and talked, until he was tired talking, has at least sat down feeling that, in the Ceann Comhairle, he had somebody who would insist on his being heard, whether those listening wanted to hear him or not.</P>
    <P>It may have taken longer in the case of one Deputy than another to carry conviction to his mind that Parliament was not such a bad place after all, that it was not such a bad thing to have some place to come to where where you could speak your mind, no matter what your neighbours thought, and where there was an uncontrollable authority constantly sitting in the Chair to protect your interests, no matter how much you were despised by the high and mighty who looked down upon you.</P>
    <P>That right is the most sacred right our people have&mdash;the right to send a simple man or a sophisticated man into this House, in the certainty that he will have the same right of speech as the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else.  Compromise it, circumscribe it, or reduce it and you have set your feet on the slippery slope which will end with the destruction of Parliament.  You have then vindicated every traducer of representative institutions who has described parliament as &ldquo;a talking shop.&rdquo;  I say that the right of Deputies to debate is no luxury, it is the keystone of the arch of our liberty.  However grave the crisis, I will not be party to circumscribing that right.  I say that, however deep my own personal feelings may be against what any other Deputy may say, or the length of time he takes in saying it, I recognise in his right to bore me, in his right to flounder through the rules of this House, seeking guidance from the Chair as he goes, in his right to <Col N="1205" /> indulge in every irrelevancy that the Chair will permit, a monument to the freedom of our people; and I realise that the day on which you take from the humblest and simplest Deputy this right you strike, not at me, but at freedom in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is queer that, on what appears to be a motion of the utmost simplicity, such immense issues should arise.  I do implore of Dáil Eireann to realise that this is no simple matter of administration or of disposing of business expeditiously.  If a false step is made to-day, you are opening the dykes through which the avalanche ultimately will come.  If a false step is made to-day, our action will be quoted by everyone who wants to see this Parliament destroyed, as a vindication of the thesis that this is &ldquo;a talking shop&rdquo; where there is too much talk, and that everybody in this House realises that, when really serious business falls to be done, the talking ought to be stopped. I reject that contention; I say that the right of every Deputy to speak and the speeches they have made are all woven into the fabric of our people's freedom.  I will fight for every thread of it, by every Parliamentary weapon that I can employ, by every resource that I can think of, because I am convinced that we are fighting now, not for the right to speak in Dáil Eireann but for the right of the Irish people to live under democratic institutions and have a Parliament of their own.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal coming from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, agreed on unanimously by that body, on which, as I say, and still believe, were represented by all Parties in the House except Deputy Everett's.  This comes to the House in the form of a report.  It is for the House to decide on that.  What limitation is that on our rights or on our sovereignty?  The committee comes back here to the House to get the approval of the House.  I put it to the House that, in those circumstances, there was no need at all for the fury or for the opposition. This matter is being kept a matter for the House and not for the Government.  Whether it is this motion to-day for the temporary business during the emergency, or whether it is a similar thing that may come on next week or the week after, it will always be for the House itself to decide.  If the House does not approve of it at any particular time, either now or in the future, the Dáil can reject such a proposition, on an individual amendment.</P>
      <P>Let us not could the issue.  Let us realise that it is the House which is deciding and nobody else.  When we agree on that, I cannot see where the fury of Deputy Dillon comes from, nor what he had to wax so angry about, as an infringement of the rights of Parliament or anything else.</P>

The guarantee in regard to that was given not by the Government, not by the Fine Gael Party or by the Labour Party, but by the Committee set up by this House.  This curtailment is to apply to the debates on the Estimates only.  The principal speaker on an Estimate need not necessarily be the leader of a Party, and how can it be said there is any curtailment if he gets 30 minutes?  Any other Deputy will get 20 minutes.  I cannot understand Deputy Dillon's point that the effect of this proposal will be to prevent Deputies from expressing their views.  I think the man who is not able to make the points that he wants to make in 20 minutes could not do so in 20 hours.  I heard the statement made here that there was something in the nature of a secret agreement.  That is not so.  All Parties were represented at the meeting: Labour, Fine Gael, the Government and the Farmers' Party. We could not see any other way out of the position that was before us.  The case was made that Deputies would have to be allowed home for the weekend. Our Party was opposed to that. We would prefer to remain here for a fortnight and then go home for a fortnight. That arrangement would suit us better than this proposal.  Other people present said that what we wanted would not do at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> In view of the present train arrangements there are only two days on which the House can meet, and a certain amount of work has to be done.  If the time allowed for Deputies' speeches were not limited the House would never get through the Estimates, and what that would mean is that we would be here during August and September. We would be here practically the whole year round.  That is the kind of thing that would turn Parliament into a farce.  At present, when a long-winded speaker gets up what do we see happen?  The House clears out.  I do not mean to be personal to any member of the House, in saying that.  As I have said, we agreed to this curtailment of speeches as a temporary measure and for the Estimates only, because we believe it is the only hope of getting business done.  We are here on the Farmers' Benches.  You have farmers on the Fianna Fáil Benches and on the Fine Gael Benches, even though it is my view that they do not represent farmers, but still it should be the object of all of us to be at home for the saving of the harvest.  In my view, we would be rendering a bigger service to the country in saving the harvest than in making long-winded speeches in this House.</P>

      <P>I regret I was not present in the House when Deputy Dillon was speaking.  I wish to join with him in protesting in the strongest possible manner against the curtailment of Deputies' speeches.  We were trying for a long time to get a native Irish Government established in the country, and no sooner had we got it than this Government of ours&mdash;this House&mdash;introduces legislation to prevent the elected representatives of the people from expressing their views.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is the House that must take the action if Deputies speeches are to be curtailed.  As an Independent member, attached to none of the big political Parties, I cannot see any reason why Deputies should not be given all the time they <Col N="1210" /> wish to express their views on any particular subject.  This new Dáil was elected last June.  It must be admitted that we have in it a greater mixture of opinion than was to be found in any previous Dáil.  It must be appreciated, too, that new Deputies must be given every opportunity to express their views.  Deputy Donnellan's remarks surprised me.  How can we say that this is a democratic institution if we do anything to prevent Deputies from expressing their views?  I think Deputies should be given as long as they wish to speak.  I support Deputy Dillon a 100 per cent. in the protest he has made.  I am sorry that this occasion should have arisen&mdash;that a Standing Order should be introduced to limit the time of a Deputy in expressing his views.  I know that members of the Government are delighted at the opportunity which this motion gives them and that they will support it, because they have heard more of the truth in this Dáil than in any previous Dáil elected by the Irish people.  That is why steps are being taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about this.  If I were a member of that Committee I would oppose such a proposal.  I do not know whether it was an unanimous one or not.</P>

If there is a division on this I intend to support Deputy Dillon because I am convinced that he made a very able case for the point of view that Deputies should not be curtailed in the time they take to express their views.  Every member of the House, no matter what constituency he comes from or what creed or class he represents in this House, should be given all the time he wants to express his views.</P>

      <P>The majority of the members in this House represent rural constituencies. What do we see happening here week after week and night after night?  The gentlemen coming from the law courts at 5 o'clock and making two hours' speeches, taking up all the time until 9 o'clock when it is time to go home.  Owing to the curtailment of transport we can only come here two days a week.  So far as I know, Deputies who represent rural constituencies have no intention of being stuck here during August and September when the harvest has to be saved.  It is more important than to be here listening to Deputy Dillon talking about the moon, or Deputy McGilligan talking about the stars, or having a few fools here in their special benches to keep the ball going for others until they can come away from the law courts at 5 o'clock.</P>

I should have thought that the Parliamentary Secretary, when moving on behalf of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, would have told us what Deputy Donnellan hinted at but did not say&mdash;that there is a case for the motion.

If Deputy Kennedy does not believe that, he can inquire and then he might be satisfied.  I understand the Government made a proposal as to the curtailment of the time to be allotted to Estimates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by other members of the Committee that that is the situation.  Apparently, some members do not know what they were discussing.  The proposal is that instead of limiting the number of hours we should limit the time allowed to speakers.  Nobody who cared to listen to him to-day could have misunderstood Deputy Dillon.  He is not alleging any secret agreement.  He made what I thought was a moving appeal to people, that they should not focus their attention on the necessities of this emergency period, but that they should take heed of the danger he indicated to the House arising out of these proposals.  It was pointed out that this was the thin end of the wedge; that once the House abandoned the right of every member, subject to the rules of debate and relevancy&mdash;once that right was curtailed, the path was then marked out, the track blazed and that would develop into a rule of procedure of the <Col N="1214" /> House on all occasions.  That was the case, and it was a very good case.</P>
      <P>So far as I understand the work of a Parliamentary institution, it has several functions.  It controls, or attempts to control, administration; it deals with legislation, and ventilates grievances.  The way in which grievances are ventilated is by way of motion or by way of Parliamentary question.  Deputies discuss administration on the Estimates and, when there is new legislation, it is discussed in the House.  There are some who may be anxious about the time that is spent. The great point is that the chief business of the House on which time may be lost is the Committee Stage of a piece of legislation, when members are entitled to speak as often as they like.  As a rule they may speak about three times, but that rule has been broken far more often than it has been observed.  It is not sought to limit that time.  Why?  Because there is hardly any legislation to come before the House.</P>
      <P>The stranglehold is tightening.  It makes for administrative ease to have curtailment all round.  That is what has happened.  Let Deputies get their minds back to the House that existed in September, 1939, and let them remember the conditions in which we allowed a censorship to operate.  Think how flagrantly the pledges about censorship given on that occasion have been broken.  Public debate is useful in itself, but it lacks a great deal of utility if publication through the Press is not given to what is said here.  We were guaranteed that there would be no limitation in respect of speeches made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that has not been carried out.  We know the newspapers have to submit to certain restrictions because of lack of space, but we know quite well that the proceedings here are not getting anything like the publicity they were accustomed to get.  There is a growing tendency also to restrict questions, to restrict the old liberality with regard to questions, and I sense also a much more accomplished use of evasion in answering questions.  We must remember that if it comes to the other way in which grievances are ventilated, <Col N="1215" /> the way of the private motion, we have submitted to a distinct curtailment there, too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, distinctly so. Motions are unlimited, but the time for them is limited.  So far as that end of the Parliamentary system is concerned, we have accepted distinct limitations.  So far as legislative business is concerned, what has happened is a very definite breach of the undertakings given us at the beginning of the war, in 1939.  We have here legislation known as Emergency Powers legislation and, under that, Orders are introduced.  There was an understanding in 1939 that ordinary legislation in no way touched by the emergency would be dealt with in the normal way through the House, but that is not the situation.  Multitudinous matters are now done by Emergency Powers Orders, and we have the further device adopted that whereas any ordinary Order can be debated here by means of a resolution to rescind, if the Order is one of the delegated type then there is no discussion possible on it at any time.  That is a very serious curtailment of the rights of the House.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the question of administration and, in the matter of administration generally touched through the Estimates, here again I can see the grip tightening on the House.  When that grip is going to be tightened on us, at least the House is worthy of this consideration, that the case for it should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the case?  The case, as I understand it, is that, on account of lack of transport facilities the members of the House are not going to have the same freedom of movement from county constituencies to Dublin as they had previously.  From information which I have, I believe there is no reason for this curtailment of train services that has been announced.  We have not heard the case for it yet.  If Deputies are to be restricted, we have offered, and I understand it is to be accepted, that we should meet from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. without a break. In the old days, when the House met <Col N="1216" /> originally and sat for longer periods than has recently been the habit, there was a specific adjournment for tea.  It is now proposed that we should sit from 10 a.m. till 9 p.m.  That in itself will greatly curtail debate.  Everybody knows that it is not in human nature to stand up to these long hours, certainly not to get up the same enthusiasm for long speeches.  That may be what is desired.  It is to be effected at least in that way.  In any event, I understand that a calculation has been made that exactly the same number of hours of Parliamentary time under the two-day system will be given as we used to have under the 3½-day arrangement. If that is the situation, what is the necessity for this limitation?</P>
    <P>Can a case be made that the Government have not got facilities with regard to getting through the business? The re-action to that will be&mdash;think of the agricultural debate.  I think of that debate with pleasure.  It was a long debate.  By what amount of time would that debate have been shortened if this rule had been in operation? There were a great many speakers in that debate, but very few took longer than 20 minutes or half an hour.  Has any calculation been made with regard to the agricultural debate, as to the amount of time that would be saved if this rule were in operation?  It is amazing to me that more people do not speak on agriculture.  It is one of the subjects with which most Deputies are intimately familiar.  There is a growing crisis in agriculture and people were impressed by that.  If the conditions deteriorate next year in the same way as this year, there will be a longer debate on agriculture, because the situation will be much worse.</P>
    <P>Where is the case for this?  Somebody must have made a calculation as to the amount of time to be saved.  I want to have that told to the House. I want to see if there is no alternative way of meeting the difficulty.  One of the ways adopted in another institution like this elsewhere is that selected Estimates are put down for detailed discussion in a particular year and other Estimates are not, so that in a three- or five-year period all the Estimates are subjected to detailed discussion, say, twice.  No Government has <Col N="1217" /> got such facilities from a deliberative assembly as the Government of this country has got.  I do not know of any occasion on which a request has been made, backed by a reasonable statement, that for some reason or another of an emergency type the Government required a particular period free, that we have not given them their freedom.  If that is the situation, there is no reason for this curtailment.</P>
    <P>I agree with every word that Deputy Dillon said, although I cannot equal his eloquence in the matter, when he asked people to remember that the way in which all these closure systems all over the world were established was by asking, first of all, the deliberative assembly.  We still pride ourselves on the fact that we are run by a Parliamentary institution and the root of a Parliamentary institution is that you are governed by reason and not by force. The only way in which you can get reason to operate is by the clash of argument and argument and the only way to get that is to give those sent here to represent the country full freedom, inside the limits of relevancy, to discuss the matters that arise.  I see no case whatever for this motion and I will oppose it as strongly as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a rather extraordinary performance on the part of a responsible member of the principal Opposition Party.  The speech which we have listened to has been directed ostensibly to the Government, but in reality represents an attack upon a permanent Committee of this House.  Irrespective of what the rights of private Deputies may be, there is this fact which is unchallengeable, that the House has a right to order its own business; the House has the right to make rules for the conduct of public business.  There are many duties and responsibilities attaching to this House.  For the purpose of some duties, the House has delegated its functions to several Standing Committees&mdash;the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Committee of Selection and the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;and, because these committees are held to be acting for and on behalf of the House and every <Col N="1218" /> member in the House, whether an Independent member or a member of an organised Party, it has been the rule since I have been a member of this House to accept without question, discussion, debate or division the recommendations of these committees.</P>
      <P>Now the principal committee might be held by some to be the Committee of Public Accounts.  But, certainly, closely ranking with it is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, because it is that Committee which, in general, has determined and laid down the rules under which the conduct of business in this House will proceed. These rules are embodied in the Standing Orders which govern our procedure and there is a proviso that these Orders may be amended or altered from time to time in order to suit the circumstances of the times. They have in fact often been altered to suit the exigencies of business in the House.</P>
      <P>What is being done?  The Committee, on which the Party of which Deputy McGilligan purports to be a member is represented, has met and considered what rules it is necessary to lay down in order that the work of the Dáil may be done in an orderly and proper manner within the limitations which are necessarily imposed on us by the difficulties with which the Dáil and the country as a whole are now confronted. On that Committee, as I have said, there sit representatives of Deputy McGilligan's Party.  Therefore, if Deputy McGilligan's speech has any significance whatever, it is in fact an attack upon those whom he, and other members of his Party, chose to represent them on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I do not know what are the rules which govern the principal Opposition Party, but I do suggest that, as a matter of ordinary Party loyalty and common fairness to one's colleague, when a Party selects a representative to act on behalf of that Party on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges every member of that Party should at least agree in supporting the decisions to which his colleague and representative <Col N="1219" /> was a party.  I think that any other principle would reduce to a nullity the Party bond&mdash;and the Party bond is a very essential instrument in the Government of the country.  This House is based on Party; our democracy is based on Party, that is to say, the organisation of men for a common purpose.  If we are to have the situation that, when a representative of a Party commits himself to a decision which may be temporarily unpalatable to another member, the member who dislikes it can get up and knife the man who sat on the committee and arrived at a decision, we damage the instrument of our co-ordinated action.  That is what is being done by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to go back on this question as to whether we should have the arguments for and on behalf of the proposal now before the House.  The place where these arguments were put forward, the place where they were considered, and the place in which the decision based upon them was arrived at was the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The only matter that is before the House now is the recommendation of the Committee.  I submit that, as all the Parties in the House are represented on that Committee, and as I believe the Independents also are represented on the Committee, the House as a whole is bound by the recommendations of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the unchallenged precedent. Never before, in my recollection, was any recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges challenged in this House.  The assumption and the convention of the House is that it is bound by the decisions of these permanent committees of the House, which are set up by the House to facilitate it in conducting its business. The only thing, I submit, therefore, that Deputies, and particularly members of a Party in the House, can do, when they are dissatisfied with the recommendations of a <Col N="1220" /> committee of this sort is to withdraw their representatives from that committee and in that way indicate that those colleagues of theirs representing them on that committee no longer have their confidence.</P>
    <P>So far as we in the Government are concerned in this matter, our only desire is this: that in the circumstances of the time the House, as a whole, and every Deputy in the House, should have an opportunity of participating in the public business within, as I have said before, the limitations that are imposed by the difficulties with which the Government, the Dáil, and the country as a whole, are being confronted now.  That must necessarily impose some limitation upon debate here.  Personally, if I may say so, I probably dislike these limitations more than anybody else here, because I think that probably no Deputy in the House will be more hurt by such limitations than I, because&mdash;and I have complained very strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary about the proposed limitation&mdash;I cannot get into my stride, in a debate, inside of a quarter of an hour at least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I think that if this matter is looked upon in a normal perspective it will not appear to be so serious as some Deputies seem to imagine, judging by their speeches on this motion.  I am not concerned so much with the matters with which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has to deal.  If I have any learnings at all in that regard, it would be towards finding a normal solution of our difficulties.  That would appear to be Deputy McGilligan's idea also, although I could not help feeling that his eloquence and oratory were worthy of a better cause.  Notwithstanding all that has been said to-day, I do not think that there is anything very serious in connection with this matter.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been concerned for some time with the question of what is best to do from the point of view of regulating the hours of sittings in this House, having regard to transport difficulties. The members of the Committee have been concerned because of the curtailment of train services from the country, and of transport services in town at night, and a number of members of the Committee, including a representative of Deputy McGilligan's own Party, has been in favour of finishing the sittings at 9 o'clock at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I break no confidence when I say that the overriding obsession of a representative of Deputy McGilligan's Party was that the House ought to finish at 9 o'clock at night because it was not fair to expect Deputies to trek home after 9.30.  That is a very understandable point of view, and the Deputy concerned spoke, not merely for his own Party, but for members of Clann na Talmhan, the Fianna Fáil Party, and all other Parties in this House.  The question of Parties did not enter into this matter in the slightest.  It was merely a matter of the practicability of the arrangements that might be made.  When we came to discuss the matter in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges one proposal that was made&mdash;I think it was a conglomerate proposal, so to speak, and did not emanate from one particular source <Col N="1222" /> alone&mdash;was that there should be a limitation of the debates on particular Estimates.  For instance, it was suggested&mdash;I have not the suggested timetable with me now, and this occurs to me from memory&mdash;that the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Justice ought to take three hours, but the debate on that Estimate went on during all of Tuesday and Wednesday, and so the three hours' arrangement went by the board.  I think it was also suggested that the debate on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs might take four hours, but whether it will be possible to keep that debate within the limit of four hours I do not know.  Apart from that, however, there was strong objection by all Parties, I think, to any arrangement whereby the House would be tied down to discuss a particular Estimate within a specified time, because it was felt that if you allowed only three or four hours, as the case may be, for a particular Estimate, one or two Deputies, who are noted for making marathon speeches, might get in because they happen to occupy front bench positions and that, as a result of their marathon speeches, members on the back benches might be cut out.  All the members of the Committee were opposed to a limitation on the duration of the debates on a particular Estimate; the whole thing was thrown into the melting-pot again, and we had another deliberation.  Finally, it was decided that, having regard to all the circumstances, the best possible arrangement would be one whereby the House would sit at 10 o'clock in the morning and conclude at 9 o'clock at night, for two days of the week.  It was recognised that that, in itself, might not be sufficient and that you would have to accompany it with a reasonable limitation of speeches, and, accordingly, consideration was given to the question of what ought to be the outside limitation on speeches.  Finally, agreement was reached, and it was the unanimous decision that the Leader of a Party, or the person designated as the chief speaker for a Party, should be given 30 minutes, and that each other Deputy who might want to speak should be given 20 minutes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Now, I am as jealous as any Deputy in this House of the rights of a member of the House to say what he wishes to say.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan that in a deliberative Assembly of this kind real progress is measured, not by the votes recorded in a Division, but by the impact of reason on reason, by the clash of mind upon mind, and by resolving the difficulties, and endeavouring to see the various points of view.  I and other members on the Committee were anxious to preserve the rights of Deputies to say what they desired to say in this House on Estimates and Bills.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, of the limitation of speeches or debates was considered by the Committee.  We felt that there ought to be no limitation whatever on the discussion of Bills, and that the limitation&mdash;if, in fact, there were to be any&mdash;should be confined solely to the Estimates, and then only to the Estimates for this year&mdash;the arrangement being to give the scheme a trial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon&mdash;inadvertently, I think &mdash;said that the House was consenting to an arrangement to deprive Deputies of their right to speak.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges were doing no such thing, and the House is not being asked to do any such thing.  If there had been an arrangement for an all-over limitation for discussion on a particular Estimate, it might be true to say that, because a Deputy might be squeezed out when zero hour arrived and a guillotine motion had to be put, but that is not the case in the present instance.  The proposal now is that the chief speaker of a Party should get 30 minutes, and each additional speaker 20 minutes.  Is that really curtailing discussion on an Estimate?  If we have a live House, if we have a really alert House, and if people are going to do the work for which they were sent here, that need not result in a contraction of speeches on Estimates.  It can result, in fact, in an extension of speeches on Estimates, I think it will probably save time, because, as Deputy McGilligan knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not imagine that we are impeccable in all matters. We have our weaknesses and our frailties like everybody else.  Look at the Division Lists in the months of July and August and see the attendances during those months.  Look at the Division Lists on a Tuesday evening when the House is sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  Look at the panic to try to avoid a Division on Friday because Deputies have gone away. These are the realities of life here, and any person who does not take cognisance of them is simply burying his head in the sand.</P>
      <P>There is no question of preventing Deputies from speaking.  Every Deputy has the right to speak for 20 minutes. If he has a very special case or a very particular knowledge of the subject, his Party can say: &ldquo;You can be the chief speaker&rdquo;, in which case he gets 30 minutes.  The Fine Gael Party has a substantial membership, and other Parties have a sufficient membership to put whatever case is to be put with regard to the administration of a particular Department.  I have not at the moment got the relative strength of the different Parties, but assuming that there are 70 non-Government Deputies in the House, and that we give each of the 70 the right to speak for 20 minutes, then, if there is reason for delaying an Estimate, if there is reason for putting a concentrated spotlight on an Estimate, the debate on that Estimate can run for a period of not less than 24 hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Conceivably, that can happen, but what we have to do in the House of which we have experience, as Deputy Dillon has, is not to conceive just the possibilities but to measure the probabilities.  The whole trouble in the House is that a large bunch of Deputies cannot be got to speak at all.  Quite a considerable number of Deputies never come into the House at all and quite a considerable number will not even ask a question, much less make a speech.  Is that not the truth?</P>
      <P>I should like to answer Deputy Dillon's point as to a small group which want to put a special case.  I will take Deputy Anthony as typical of that small group, because he represented not merely himself in the matter but, as I think he said, he spoke for the Independents, or for the bulk of the Independents&mdash;I do not know if Deputy Dillon came within their scope. Deputy Anthony, representative of himself particularly, and of the Independent group as well, was prepared to agree to the proposal of 30 minutes and 20 minutes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point in a moment, if the Deputy will be patient.  I did not interrupt his Niagara of eloquence.  The whole purpose of the arrangement was to endeavour, bearing in mind transport difficulties, and bearing in mind the fact that they may get worse, to get through a reasonable number of Estimates, to permit of an early summer adjournment and not to keep the House here with the type of wearying discussions which every member who attends the House knows takes place in July and August, and, at the same time, to provide for a reasonable discussion of the Estimates by extending to speakers a reasonable period in which to make their contributions. Deputy McGilligan says that the House has already consented to a limitation of the time for discussion of Private Members' motions.  That is true, but again I think it was an unanimous decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, so far as my recollection serves me.</P>

      <P>So long as there was no time limit on discussion of Private Members' motions, we had a situation in which such a discussion was opened in October, and every Deputy was entitled to speak as long as he liked. Deputy McGilligan will recollect that the proposers of Private Members' <Col N="1227" /> motions spoke for two and three hours and concluded over a similar period. The effect of all that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When Private Members' motions were being discussed without a time limit it often happened that the debates ran for a period of two months, and the idea of reducing the period of the debate to three hours was to enable us to get a net decision on the points raised in the course of the debate.  If the fact of limiting the discussions on Private Members' motions had any effect, it had the effect of making it possible for the House to discuss in normal and even abnormal circumstances a greater number of Private Members' motions than would be discussable if there were no limitation of the time allotted to such motions.</P>
      <P>I want to make this suggestion: In actual practice I think no real difficulty whatever will be found in regard to the implementation of the arrangement, but I do not think anybody feels so heated about the matter as to regard the decision arrived at as irrevocable.</P>

      <P>The whole attitude of <Col N="1228" /> the Committee was to try to get something that would work.  Human minds do not always fashion things which will work, even though they think they do. I do not suggest that this is any occasion for heated argument, or that people should be charged with throttling the right to speak, or individual liberty.  I make this suggestion to the Government, and I think they might very well adopt it, because I do not think it makes any alteration in the arrangement proposed: let us try the scheme out and, if it will not work, there will be such a din that nobody will want to limit speakers.  I am convinced it will work.  The question of loss of prestige or dignity does not arise.  It is merely a matter of what is the practical thing to do.  If we give this a trial for a month, it would be shown that it will work unless people deliberately set out to wreck it.  If it will not work, there is no use in trying to force it on the House, but I believe it will work, and if the House passes the motion on the suggestion that it might be reviewed after a reasonable period of experience, then we could go back to some other arrangement.  I think that from the point of view of the Estimates, it will work, and, seeing that no question of dignity or confidence is involved in the matter and that the viewpoint expressed in the resolution is the viewpoint of all Parties, I suggest to the Government they might allow the motion to be passed, on the understanding that it can be reviewed later if there is any open rebellion of a justifiable character against the arrangement.</P>

If Deputy Norton's thesis is correct, that the thing will work, I suggest that the leaders voluntarily undertake on behalf of their Parties to get their members to adhere to it.  If we could do that, no damage would be done to anybody and we would have something real, while the principle&mdash;the sacred principle&mdash;I <Col N="1229" /> am trying to defend would be left intact.

It is not enough for that business, but the emergency arose and we are all governed by that to some extent.  We are all affected by the transport difficulties and have to take the emergency into consideration.  None of us would agree to these limitations of time in the ordinary way.  We only meet until 9 o'clock at present&mdash;though, for the last day or two, we have met until 10.30 &mdash;and we would not agree to that limitation but for the emergency.  The Government does not ask that the time for the discussion of the Estimates be restricted, but there is an emergency and I would remind Deputy Norton the Estimates are very important and that there is a certain urgency, owing to the Constitution, about getting the Estimates through in a certain limited time.</P>

      <P>This question rather divides itself into two parts.  On one of them, we had a very hysterical outburst from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I wondered very much why he grew so hysterical.  It did not seem to me that there was any great cause for hysteria in the thing at all.</P>
      <P>Now what has happened?  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have brought a suggestion before the House.  No doubt the House appointed that Committee and is very anxious to give the fullest care and consideration to everything that they say.  As has been pointed out it is very rarely, if ever, that the House differs from its own committees, but I have never heard before that the House is tied hand and foot to them.  I had never heard before that the House had delegated all its powers to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and that if, in the opinion of the House, the Committee made an unwise suggestion it should not be rejected by the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government says that would be a breach of faith: that we appoint delegates, not plenipotentiaries, and that we treat them badly and knife them in the back if we happen to think that they have made an error of judgment.  Surely the Minister must see how grossly he overstated his case, and how harmful, if anything, he must have been to his own case. We consider that there is a big issue here, that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges looked at it from one angle, and only one.  They looked at it to decide whether there could or could not be an effective saving of time, and, therefore, they brought in this suggestion in order that there might be a saving of time.  I do not believe that the big issue, the restriction upon the freedom of speech, the issue upon which this House is now principally concerned, was fully debated or considered by the Committee at all. Deputy Norton was the only person who made a case for this suggestion, and I listened to him very attentively for more than 20 minutes.</P>

    <Col N="1234" />

      <P>Much more. I came to the conclusion, having listened to him, that he was establishing beyond all doubt that we were going to spend a great deal more time on the Estimate if this suggestion were adopted.  It would lead to this, to that and to the other; more people would speak, and so there would be no saving of time.  That was the impression that I gathered from the Deputy's speech, whatever he set himself out to prove.  I take the view that this is a very real restriction on the liberty of speech.  I do not think it should be hastily done or accepted now.  The Tánaiste has made the case that it has already been limited.  That just bears out Deputy Dillon's argument.  There has been one limitation, therefore that limitation justifies another limitation. Private Members' business is limited to three hours.  There we have the justification to limit discussion on the Estimates.  You limit discussion on the Estimates, and that will be a justification for limiting discussion on everything else.  I think it would be a wise thing if this motion were withdrawn, and if this matter went before the Committee again to see if they could not devise some other method of saving time which would not, in the considered views of a number, at any rate, of members of this House, be an infringement upon the liberty of speech and the privileges of members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Committee met three times on this matter. It met last week when there was a proposal to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, to stay over the week-end, and meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Before any decision was come to at any meeting of the Committee, except the last one, the members adjourned and submitted the proposals emanating from the various members of the Committee to the Parties.  From an examination of the time spent by the Dáil in debate in pre-war years over a period of years it was found that, on the average, 287 <Col N="1235" /> hours were spent from Easter to August in debates on the Budget, the Estimates and whatever legislation was taken.  Under the scheme discussed last week to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and on the following Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and then adjourn for 12 days, you would get for debate in that time 249 hours.  Since we are a bit candid about this matter, it is disclosing no secrets to say that the proposal on yesterday to sit from 10 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock at night, came from the Fine Gael representatives.  It was unanimously agreed to by the whole Committee.  That is the proposal before the House.  With regard to the curtailment of speeches, it was felt by the proposer that there are certain marathon speakers here who monopolise all the time of the House.  Deputy Norton has said that certain Deputies do not speak.  No, because they do not get a chance.  The back bencher does not get a chance.  We all know five or six members on certain benches, and their average time, when they get up to speak, is from two to 2½ hours.  They monopolise the time of the House and get their names in the papers for talking rubbish&mdash;half the time.  They have all the eloquence of all the Eloquent Dempseys in Ireland put together. The back bencher does his work for his constituency better than they do it, but he never gets a chance to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other parts of a Deputy's business besides speaking. If a Deputy has to go down to phone a Department when the Dáil is sitting, or to write letters to constituents in the Library, he may not be <Col N="1236" /> in the House at the particular time when he would get an opportunity of speaking.  He may not have the means to do this work that Deputy Dillon has.  Deputy Dillon is an independent, wealthy Deputy and he can employ a staff to do his work.  He can spend hours here waiting for his turn to speak, but other Deputies cannot do so.</P>
      <P>When we were dealing with this proposal we were thinking of the back bencher and his chance of being able to make a speech, particularly during the emergency, when time is curtailed. The curtailment of time is there apart from this proposal, inasmuch as the Dáil rises at 9 p.m. instead of 10.30 p.m.  In an average week of four days there are six hours gone on account of the emergency, on account of the trams and buses and the need to facilitate the staff.  It is because of these considerations that this proposal was put down and carried unanimously.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Tánaiste when he says we are following a bad precedent. We are not, because the door is left open and 138 Deputies can speak on an Estimate, each Deputy having 20 minutes in which to speak if he so desires.  You are not curtailing any Deputy's right to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to clear this matter up, I suggest that we should sit for five days one week, remain in the city over the week-end and sit for three days the following week, and then go home on Thursday, so as to be able to avail of the transport facilities that day.  If we were to start every morning at 10.30, I think the amount of time that has been decided upon to give Deputies an opportunity of expressing their views would be quite sufficient.  There are some people here who come in during the evening, because they are living in the city, and they make speeches.  Some of us who are not conversant with Parliamentary procedure naturally give way to those Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, as Deputy Spring suggested, that we should remain in the city over the week-end.  That would give an opportunity to other people <Col N="1237" /> who may have to do business in the country to travel, and their business may be just as important as the business some Deputies have to do.  I think that would be a very practicable thing. We could sit for eight days at a time, remaining here over the week-end. We would not be interfering with Parliamentary procedure as regards ordinary legislation, because this proposal, I take it, applies only to the consideration of Estimates.  My idea is that if we sit for eight days we could then remain at home for a fortnight. That will enable other people to travel and we will not be putting the taxpayer to the expense of travelling to and from Dublin every week in order to attend meetings of the Dáil.  If some Deputies think it too expensive to have to remain here during the week-end, perhaps the Government might give them whatever it might cost them to travel to the city and that might enable them to cover their expenses here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any necessity for some of the heat that was engendered in this debate. The matter appears to me to be quite simple.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges was brought together by reason of the sudden emergency in relation to transport.  I have not heard that there was any other reason for their meeting.  It was considered necessary to make provision for that contingency.  The railway trains will run only two days in the week and it was necessary to make provision so that the business of the House would be conducted with the least inconvenience to Deputies and with the object of giving a chance to Ministers to carry out State business in a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Committee had confined itself to that solely, and brought forward any proposition dealing purely with that matter, I am sure the House would have given all the facilities required.  There has never been an occasion when the Government has been in a difficulty, when there was need to get some piece of legislation through, that the House has not met them.  There is not a single instance I know of in which the House did not <Col N="1238" /> meet the Government in every possible way.  If the Committee had confined themselves to that particular problem, the House would have met the situation without any controversy; but the Committee did not.  They solved the problem for which they were set up, but they brought in a second recommendation which anybody might have known would be received with consternation by some members of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a lengthy speech&mdash;I usually do not speak at any great length.  I must say that I agree with everything Deputy Dillon said. I agree also with Deputy McGilligan's argument.  I have not heard a speech in favour of the motion.  I have not heard an argument made by any Deputy that the problem has not been met; that we have not, by the recommendations made, given the Government as much time as they would have in ordinary circumstances.  If the proposal of the Committee is accepted&mdash; I believe it is&mdash;to meet on Tuesdays and wednesdays, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; we are giving the House 22 hours a week for Parliamentary work. I have been 17 years in the House and I would ask Deputies to go through the Debates over that period and take the average time spent here and I guarantee it will not work out at 22 hours a week.  That is what the House is asked to agree to.</P>
    <P>I do not like criticising any committee. I think that usually the House agrees to the decisions of committees, but in this instance I believe the Committee has run away with itself and has attempted to solve something which the House did not want it to solve.  We are prepared to meet the House by giving as much time as they would have had every week if the transport problem had not arisen at all.  But we are not going to take advantage of the transport problem, serious as it is, to give the Government more time than they ever would have had, or to limit the rights of Deputies to an extent that nobody ever thought they would be limited.  Unless there is a greater emergency than exists, or than anyone can envisage at the moment, I would not be a party to <Col N="1239" /> restricting the rights of Deputies in this House, rights that Deputy Dillon so forcibly advocated.  I might be prepared voluntarily to limit any rights that I have in this House.  I do not think that I have ever been one of the two-hour speakers and I do not suppose I ever will.  If I were capable of speaking for two hours or three hours, and even if I talked trash most of the time, if the people thought it right to elect me, than I have the right and the privilege of talking trash for three hours.  That is the position as it appears to me.</P>
    <P>No case has been made for the drastic proposal for cutting out the right of Deputies to make the best case they can for the people they represent, and to speak in this House, as Deputy Dillon said, without any fear of being misrepresented anywhere or of being interfered with by any authority inside or outside the House.  That is a right that I think every Deputy should be anxious to protect.  This matter ought not to engender heat.  But I say that the House ought to consider that the problem which faced the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was the problem of providing for the situation caused by the breakdown in the transport system, and the proposal of the railway company to run trains on only two days in the week-namely, Mondays and Thursdays, which will necessitate Deputies going home on Thursdays, thereby knocking out the Thursday work in this House.  To meet that situation, the Committee proposed that we should sit from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays&mdash;11 hours per day, or 22 hours per week.  On the whole, I think that is a greater average than we have had during my 17 years' experience in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I might probably be classed as one of the speakers who hardly ever exceed 20 minutes when speaking in this House.  We should remember the hours which we spent on Estimates from 1923 to the present time.  To-day we have a proposal to spend two days each week, or about 22 hours per week, on Estimates.  In days gone by, we sat on Wednesday, <Col N="1240" /> Thursday and part of Friday, which would represent about 17½ hours. With these 17½ hours each week we disposed of all the Estimates, and we had not to sit, as a rule, very far into the summer.  Sometimes we ran as far as July, but we very seldom ran into August.  I was a member of this Committee when the recommendation was made with regard to the time for Private Members' motions.  But Private Members' motions and the motions which we have to deal with during the next few weeks are totally different.  Private Members' motions are not of very much interest to the great majority of the House.  But the Estimates' which we are about to enter on now I should say will constitute the principal part of the whole session.  I was surprised to hear the leader of the Farmers' Party wanting to curtail the discussion on the Estimates.  We must realise that in 1924 the Estimates for Public Services amounted to about £24,000,000; to-day they amount to £51,000,000.  Surely, if we are to go on increasing the Estimates from year to year we will want not only to get the time to which we have been accustomed, but even more time, because unless something is done by the criticism of Deputies to reduce the Estimates, our Estimates will not be £51,000,000, but very much more. Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for four years while in opposition and, I think, one year as a member of the Government Party.  My recollection is that at no time was any recommendation of that Committee rejected by the House.  It was my duty for a few months to present the reports of the Committee to the House, and they were always accepted.  If what is happening now is to continue, the purpose for which the Committee was set up will not be served; that is to arrange the best way of proceeding with our business in the House.  My recollections of that Committee are very pleasant.  I always found there a spirit of accommodation.  There was <Col N="1241" /> no Party attitude adopted, or very rarely anyway.  We always tried to meet the exigencies of the moment, whatever they might be.  We see the result now of what appears to be a break-down in that procedure which has obtained from the setting up of this institution.  The Committee does not appear to me to be as representative of the House as it used to be, otherwise I cannot understand why its unanimous recommendation has not been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would be inclined to suggest if, for instance, the Fine Gael Party is not satisfied with the manner in which their representatives have carried on on the Committee, or if other Parties are not satisfied, is that they might ask for a postponement of this and reconsider the whole thing and save the House all this trouble. If we do not do it in this Committee and try to seek a <i>modus vivendi</i>, as has been the practice since the establishment of this House, and arrive at some agreed settlement, then we will have to do it in the House and there will be no finality to it.  I fear that we will keep on at this until 10 o'clock to-night, and that we will not reach any agreement, whereas, if we were sitting on a committee, nobody would be taking notes, and I might think that I had a better arrangement than one, say, proposed by Deputy Norton.  We have done that several times.  Deputy Norton, or whoever represented Labour would say: &ldquo;There is something in that&rdquo;, and in a short time we would try to secure general agreement. I think the method of dealing with it was that if the Party did not agree they had a remedy.  They could haul their representative up and say to him: &ldquo;What way are you behaving on the Committee?  Did you not know that Deputy So-and-so wanted this and Deputy So-and-so wanted that?&rdquo; That is the way things worked.  If it transpires that there is a new.  Labour Party and they are not represented on the Committee, why should they not be represented?  What I am asking the House to do is to try to continue the practice which has worked so well since the House was established. If we do not, every time we try to make an arrangement we will <Col N="1242" /> have every Deputy getting up and giving his view and there will be no finality.</P>
    <P>This is not a Government proposal. The Parliamentary Secretary is looked upon as the person who presents the report of that Committee and always has been.  It was always regarded as a formal matter, because the arrangement has been come to at the Committee. I warn Deputies of the danger of departing from a well-established practice which has worked admirably. That is what struck me when I came in.  I came in more to listen than anything else and I saw four or five Deputies wanting to speak.  This discussion can go on interminably.  We will get nowhere if we continue it here.  We should try to settle it in a committee so that the rights of every Party and, if possible of every individual will be safeguarded.  I see the difficulty in regard to Independent members.  We always had that difficulty. As a general rule, whatever the representatives of the independent group decided upon was generally accepted by the other members, and I take it that if a particular representative of the Independent Party, who did speak for them, did not carry his weight, so to speak, they would get somebody else.  If we cannot arrive at some such arrangement as that, there will be nothing but futility and chaos, as Deputy Donnellan has described it, and the result will be that we will be endeavouring to run the business of the nation in a manner of which we ought to be ashamed, instead of running it is a business like manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking, simply, as an old member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I think that there is a sufficient number of old members of the Committee in this House to remember how I, myself, and some other members of our Party used to do most of the talking in the days when we were in Opposition.  I think it will be remembered that we often spent hours discussing on various matters, but if Deputy Duggan, the then Parliamentary Secretary, brought in a proposal <Col N="1243" /> here which had been agreed to by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and proposed that since it had been agreed to by the Committee it should be accepted by the House, I think it will be remembered that it was unheard of for any member of the House, even of Deputy Duggan's own Party, to get up here and try to open a case that had been already decided upon by the members of the Party concerned. In that connection, it appeared to me that Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and some other Deputies on the opposite side did not seem to have agreed with what had been accepted by the members of the Fine Gael Party who were on that Committee.  I shall not go so far as my colleague went, in speaking of stabbing people in the back, and so on, but it does appear to me, from what has transpired here to-day, that the members of the Fine Gael Party did not thresh out this matter sufficiently among themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if that is so, it is too bad, and it would appear that when you find members of an Opposition Party disagreeing with the leaders of that Party, they must not have been able to agree on some plan which would be acceptable to the members of the Party generally.  I have a suggestion to make.  Perhaps I am not in order in making it, but I want to find some solution of this difficulty, and my suggestion is that some attempt should be made to get all the Parties in the House to reconsider this matter, because I think that we should certainly curtail this debate to-night in view of the length of time it has taken already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a proposal; it is merely a suggestion.  Deputy Fionán Lynch made what I considered to be a very strong speech on behalf of the motion because it had come as a unanimous decision of the Committee to recommend this, but then we had Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and, I think, Deputy Bennett, disagreeing with that.  It struck me accordingly that the motion cannot have been considered properly by the members of that Party in general.  At any rate it looks like that to me, and I think we should try to arrive at some agreement between all the Parties, whereby this matter should be definitely decided by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, where all the details could be arranged, instead of going into them in this House, where it is practically impossible to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister, and I would suggest this matter should go back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to-night because I think that some members of the Party here were not aware of the decision that had been come to. My own attitude would be to support any finding of a committee which was unanimous, even though I might not agree with that finding, but it seems to me to be extremely foolish to be wasting the time of the House in order to find out some method of saving time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this proposal.  As one who has been here for 22 years, I can say this is the first time that I have ever known a member of such a Committee to come in here and ask the members of this House to give away whatever little rights we still possess.  I am surprised that the members of that Committee agreed unanimously to deprive the members of this House of their rights.  In effect, what you are asking us to do now is to vote away the right and privileges which we possess here.  An appeal was made by Deputies McGilligan and Dillon to withdraw this motion and to consult the leaders of all Parties upon it.  Now, I am quite satisfied that if you consult all the Parties, and the <Col N="1245" /> members of all the Parties, you will find that they are quite prepared to facilitate the Government, voluntarily, by every means in their power, to secure that the Estimates will be passed in a proper time and that no unnecessary speeches will be made in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton and other Deputies tried to make a case here to-day, but the case that they tried to make was, in effect, to justify the attitude that has been taken up.  Deputy Norton pointed out that although this meant an interference with our rights, it was only to be of a temporary nature. Deputy Donnellan also fell into the trap of thinking that by agreeing to this, the Estimates would be passed sooner and that that would enable men to carry out very important work in their own native districts.  That is quite understandable, I agree, but here we are in these days, after 22 years of fighting in this House to maintain and uphold the rights of the representatives of the people here, being asked by the Minister for Justice, in his usual friendly way, to pass this because it will only be of a temporary nature.  What chance, however, will we have afterwards of rescinding this motion?  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has given his word, but we know very well that once this thing is made a rule of the House it will be very hard to alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of the few who opposed the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.  I was told at that time, and was given a promise, although I was not speaking on behalf on anybody in particular, that the rights of individuals would not be interfered with, but, unfortunately, we have seen the way in which individual rights have been interfered with and are being interfered with at the present time. That is why I and the people associated with me are determined to oppose this infringement on our rights by every means in our power.  If necessary, the members of my Party will use their position in this House to occupy as much time as we can in speaking on the various subjects that may be raised here rather than allow the privileges and rights of the members of this House to be interfered <Col N="1246" /> with by a voluntary motion of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was interrupted by the clock last night, I was dealing with the preparations which we had made for the emergency, and I claimed that, as we had spent £100,000 on stores which have carried us through over four and a half years, we had shown a great deal of foresight.  We could not spend more than the £100,000 in respect of a future of which we were not certain, but the fact that we did spend £100,000 indicates that we acted in a very reasonable manner.  I was then going on to deal with the question of the automatic exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The automatic exchanges have worked satisfactorily during the past year but the load on them is increasing and, in normal times, considerable extensions would be undertaken.  Equipment difficulties render any steps in this direction altogether impracticable at the moment.  Notwithstanding the very formidable difficulties in the way of providing new subscribers' circuits, every effort is made and will continue to be made to meet applications for new installations for which there is genuine and special justification.</P>
    <P>The total number of subscribers' circuits at the end of 1943 was 31,416, an increase of 1,123 on the previous year. The number of automatic telephones in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas is 28,338, an increase of 926. There are now 838 exchanges and 1,512 call offices, including 155 street kiosks.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service continues to benefit from emergency traffic, and the loss on the service, which was approximately £103,917 at the end of March, 1943, has now dropped to about £83,300.  But the improvement, although welcome, is only temporary, and it is hardly open to doubt that, when emergency conditions have come to an end, the normal tendency of the telegraphs to decline, owing to the growing development of the telephones, will again manifest itself.  The suspension of the cross-Channel telephone service has resulted in a diversion of a certain amount of telephone traffic to the telegraphs, but the dimensions are not considerable.</P>
    <P>The heavy pressure experienced since the outbreak of the emergency in the stores branch which, as Deputies are aware, is the central purchasing agency for Government Departments, for the Army, Gárda Síochána, and so on, in regard to uniform, clothing, etc., continued during 1943 and there is no hope of any material diminution so long as emergency conditions obtain. The value of contracts placed during the year amounted to £1,377,639 and, although this shows a falling off of approximately 15 per cent on the figures for the previous year, it represented nevertheless about treble the pre-war contract expenditure.  The falling off was due mainly to the difficulty of procuring <Col N="1250" /> supplies from Great Britain, there being increased reluctance on the part of British manufacturers to accept orders for stores which are subject to export licensing restrictions, unless there were reasonably good prospects that licences would eventually be issued by the British authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Every effort was made by the utilisation of Irish resources to a maximum extent and by inquiries on the Continent and in the United States to offset, as far as practicable, the progressive worsening in the general supply position, but while some small supplies of articles urgently needed were obtained from Portugal and Sweden, the efforts to procure supplies from foreign countries were generally unsuccessful. Close and continuous contact is, of course, maintained with the Department of Supplies with a view to ensuring that no opportunity of meeting essential requirements of the Government services shall be lost.  Of the total expenditure of £1,377,639 on the purchase of stores last year, only £95,000, or 7 per cent was spent outside the State.</P>
    <P>As an example of the special care and attention which are being devoted in the stores branch to the supply position, I may mention that a reexamination of several years assumulation of scrap was undertaken last year with a view to the recovery of useful materials.  The results were particularly satisfactory so far as wire, cable, mixed metals and pedal cycles were concerned.  In normal circumstances, the value of the recoveries would not pay the cost of segregating, classifying and repairing, but in existing conditions these operations are now quite profitable.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Post Office factory, which was destroyed by fire in November, 1942, I am glad to say that practically all the new plant and equipment required for the resumption of normal activities have come to hand, and it is hoped that the necessary structural alterations will be completed within the next few months. The resumption of the full operations of the factory will, of course, depend on the availability of the necessary raw <Col N="1251" /> materials.  Meanwhile, a not inconsiderable amount of manufacturing and repair work is being carried out with the services of about 50 per cent. of the normal factory staff.  We have actually managed to provide employment, either in the factory or elsewhere, for practically the whole of the regular male staff, the service of only four men having been dispensed with, and these will be taken on again when work is available for them.</P>
    <P>As regards buildings, the outstanding work of the year was the new trunk telephone exchange in Exchequer Street, to which reference has already been made.  The congestion in the public office of the General Post Office concerning which representations have been made by Deputies has been satisfactorily relieved by the opening of an auxiliary office in Prince's Street, in which payment of telegraph money orders and various classes of allowances has been concentrated.  This extra accommodation will be particularly advantageous in connection with the payment of children's allowances when the scheme relating to the latter comes into operation in August next. To facilitate the public in regard to the business transacted at the various counters in the General Post Office, we are arranging for the erection in each of the entrance porches of large notices in suitable frames, giving full particulars of the business carried on at each counter.  It is expected that these notice will shortly be in position.</P>
    <P>Proposals for improving the accommodation at the Waterford Post Office are at present in hand.  Major building schemes, for some of which plans have been approved, cannot, of course, be proceeded with until emergency conditions come to an end, owing to difficulties in regard to materials.</P>
    <P>The position of the Savings Bank continues to be satisfactory.  The number of depositors increased by 44,200 during last year.  The ordinary deposits for the year amounted to £6,606,700 and the withdrawals to £2,927,700.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The deposits were £1,568,200, and the withdrawals £647,190 more than in the preceding year.  The balance remaining invested at the end of 1943 amounted to £20,875,700, an increase of £4,132,800, In addition to the ordinary deposits, a sum of £809,800 was deposited by way of investment in respect of money received by the Minister for Finance for the credit of Trustee Savings Banks under Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1940.  Of this amount £20,000 was withdrawn by the banks during the year. The total amount invested by the Trustee Banks, inclusive of interest, from 21st November, 1940, to 31st December, 1943, amounted to £2,151,200.</P>
      <P>In connection with the question of savings, I wish to add that, having regard to present economic and financial conditions, the Minister for Finance has considered it advisable that the facilities for saving through Government and other channels should be brought more forcibly to the notice of the public, and he has requested the Post Office to undertake a publicity campaign in relation to the Savings Bank and Savings Certificates, forms of thrift particularly suitable for the small investor.  The campaign has already commenced, and will extend over a period of about two months. Provision for the expenditure involved is made under sub-head O (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be grateful if Deputies would take an interest in the campaign and avail themselves of any opportunities that may offer of bringing it specially to the notice of their constituents.  The main object of the scheme is to divert <Col N="1253" /> to savings&mdash;especially in the case of the small potential investor&mdash;moneys which are being freely spent in a manner tending to raise the general level of prices and to lead to inflation.  Saving through the Saving Bank or Savings Certificates has the attraction of absolute security of the amounts invested, with favourable rates of interest.  On Savings Bank deposits the rate of interest is 2½ per cent. per annum, and deposits from 1/- to £500 are accepted at practically all post offices.  Savings Certificates at 16/- each become 20/- in eight years, and 23/- in 12 years, and any person may hold 350 such certificates. There are facilities, too, for saving in smaller sums by means of postage and savings stamps.  An added advantage is that there are no tedious formalities, and that the money will be repaid without delay whenever required.  I will happy to supply any Deputy who is interested in the matter with a booklet containing full particulars of the facilities afforded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion in the name of Deputy Blowick and in my own name:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (Fleece Wool and Skin Wool) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1944, made by the Minister for Supplies on the 3rd day of February, 1944, should be revoked.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, in respect of the price fixed under this Order and the method adopted, the Government took up a most extraordinary attitude.  If the Government think that such is not the case, I suggest that the Minister should go down the country, speak to any of <Col N="1254" /> the wool producers and ascertain what his opinion is.  He will find that the wool producers resent the attitude adopted very much.  I had occasion to go to Dublin in connection with this matter on two occasions before the price was fixed.  I have to say that I was treated much as if I were a fool. I was told to go to the Department of Supplies at Kildare Street.  There I was informed that it was not a matter for them but for the Department of Supplies at Ballsbridge.  When I went there, I was told that it was not a matter for the Department of Supplies at all and that I should go back to the Department of Agriculture.  When I went there, they were surprised that they should be asked anything at all about the matter.  On the second occasion I came along, I tried to get in touch with both the Minister concerned&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies.  They were not in town.  I made it my business to get in touch with their private secretaries and tell them what I thought, as a wool producer, of the fixing of this price.  I have a letter from the Minister for Supplies, dated 5th February, in which he says: &ldquo;The interests of producers have been safeguarded by the attendance at all discussions relating to producers' prices of farmers with wide experience of sheep raising and fully competent to represent the point of view of producers of wool of all kinds.&rdquo;  That is surprising when one considers that these two men&mdash;not that I wish to make little of them or of the counties they represent&mdash;came from Dublin and Wexford and were supposed to be representative of the wool producers of the country.  My own constituency is the constituency that is most affected by this matter.  We, in Galway, and the people of portion of Roscommon, produce one-third of the total wool clip of the Twenty-Six Counties. Not alone that but we produce the best wool in Europe.  I am afraid that the Ceann Comhairle is coming to the conclusion that I am irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information that my county got of the price-fixing <Col N="1255" /> idea in connection with wool was a broad hint some months before it took place and a message on the radio on a Friday night to see the daily papers on Saturday morning to find out what the price of wool would be.  Did the Minister ever before deal in that way with producers in deciding the price of a commodity?  If he did, I have not heard of it and it is a most extraordinary method.  I believe that the Departments sent me from post to pillar because they did not want to let us know about the matter.  My opinion is that they were afraid to say what the price was.  We, wool producers, have been treated in a most cold-blooded way.  We are highly efficient producers and, were it not for a certain patriotic sense of responsibility, we would not submit to some of these things.  The Emergency Powers Act is being used to swoop down on us and take away one-third of the most important part of the income of the people of rural Ireland.  The important thing to the small tenant farmer is the price he gets for his wool, as it is the only portion of his income for which he has not to slave hard.  It is a terrible state of affairs when an Emergency Powers Order for this purpose can be made overnight, without consulting us or giving us the least consideration.</P>
      <P>Let no one attempt to say that one-third of our income is not taken away by this Order.  I will prove that it is.  To a question I asked the Minister on the 22nd February, 1944, the reply was that the price of our wool in the year 1943 was 36d.  I wish to tell the Minister that was not the case: the price of our wool in 1943 was 3/6, 3/8 and up to 3/9 per lb.  The average price in County Galway and parts of Roscommon for the year 1943 was 3/6½, so I take it that one-third of our income was taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to have to say that, when a little prosperity comes the way of the tenant farmer&mdash;which happens only during a terrible war&mdash;it is swooped down on and taken away.  The idea, apparently, is to keep us always in a backwater and there is the policy of the emigrant ship behind it.  Not very <Col N="1256" /> long ago, when the price of wool was ridiculously low, what help did we get? As a matter of fact, a ban was imposed then on the export of wool, when wool could be exported and the producers could have at least a little income.  We did not object to the ban, but when a little comes our way now, we see what happens.</P>
    <P>Even comparing the Minister's own prices, it will be seen that he puts down 36d. for washed fine bred wool.  In his own figures, in some cases there is a reduction of 10d., in other cases a reduction of 6d. and 5d.  He has washed Downs at 36d.  I wonder would he compare that with the 30d. that he has decided on, in his Order, for fine bred wool?  Would he tell us what is the great difference between those two classes?  In Galway and parts of Roscommon, the finest bred wool in Europe is produced.  It costs a lot to do it and it has taken a great Sheep Breeders' Society to build up the production of that class of wool.  I would ask the Minister to explain why there is such a vast difference in his fixed prices, from 36d. down to 30d., between the two classes of wool.</P>
    <P>Of course, you generally hear the cry about the poor and the price of the manufactured article.  If the price of our wool in Galway last year went to 3/9 per lb., it was not the farmer or the wool producer who was responsible, but the manufacturer and the combine which put the price up, and the competition which made them pay the price.  It has paid the manufacturer and the combine to purchase wool at that price.  Now, that is clipped by one-third and our raw material is to go to the combine at one-third less than last year.</P>
    <P>We are told that very little wool goes into most articles, but I say that there are certain articles which are 80 per cent. and upwards wool.  I would like to know whether the price of those articles will be reduced accordingly. The reports of the combines last year show that they were able to pay big dividends, after paying up to 3/9 for wool.  What dividends will they be able to pay this year, when the price of the raw material is reduced by one- <Col N="1257" /> third?  I suppose they will be much higher.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying that it is better to give people 2/6 a lb. &ldquo;as a fixed price&rdquo; than to let them get 3/9. It is a good thing to give them a standard price, but I wonder on what year the Minister based his figure of 30d. Did he go back to the years when wool had to be sold at a sacrifice?  Unless the Minister annuls this Order completely, it means that the Government is proving to the wool producers in rural Ireland that they are thinking of the buyers.  The buyers do not count much in this.  People will say that the producers can hold over the wool and make money, but that is not the case. In my county the people who sell their wool at an average in August do just as well as if they held it until Christmas.</P>
    <P>I expect that I will get 15 or 20 minutes to reply to the debate on this motion.  I have made these points and, in conclusion, appeal to the Minister and the Government to annual the Order and give these producers their little opportunity, instead of swooping down on them now, when they have a chance to earn a little money other than in the real sweat of their brows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion proposed by Deputy Donnellan. I speak also on behalf of a wool producing county, producing wool second only in quality to that of Galway.  I speak for the sturdy farmers of the Wicklow hills who, undoubtedly, exert themselves day in and day out, from one end of the year to the other, in the raising of their sheep and the production of wool.  The work entailed carries heavy risks and heavy expenses, which have enormously increased in recent years.  Perhaps in this respect I am speaking particularly for Wicklow.  There we have had cheap grazing lands, on the Wicklow hills, encroached upon by the Forestry Department for plantation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also the fact that sheep production in Wicklow is dependent on the sheep being changed to the lowlands during the winter months in order to maintain them in health.  As a result of the increased tillage, grass in the <Col N="1258" /> lowlands is absolutely unobtainable except at a very high price.  We have also to bear in mind the fact that up to last year sheep rearing was a very unprofitable occupation.  The income which farmers in the mountain districts derived from it was very low.  As a result of the operation of the law of supply and demand, the price of wool last year did undoubtedly increase. In Wicklow it was a common thing to get 2/8, 2/9 and 2/10 per lb. for Cheviot wool.  Under this Order, the maximum price fixed for best Cheviot wool is 2/3½d. per lb.  I want to know why the small farmers, the people in the poor districts, should be called upon to make a contribution&mdash;to make this sacrifice&mdash;this year without any apparent justification. It must be remembered that this is not a fixed price.  If it were, a stronger case perhaps might be made for it, inasmuch as the fixed price would protect farmers in certain eventualities. Suppose, for example, manufacturers were unable to operate their mills on account of shortages of other raw materials, and that, as a result, a demand did not prevail for wool during the coming season, this price-fixing Order would give the farmer no protection. It is designed simply to prevent the farmer from getting as good a price as he got last year if the law of supply and demand allows him.  It does not protect him from being forced to accept a much lower price if the law of supply and demand imposes a much lower price upon him.  Therefore, it is a weapon that, so to speak, is directed solely against the producer, and offers him no compensating advantages.  If, as I say, it was a fixed price, and if there was a guarantee given by the Minister that, when in later years wool prices were lowered, farmers would be protected from these reduced prices, there might be less opposition to this Order.  No such assurance, however, is being given.  All that we have in this Order is direct action taken by the Minister to prevent the farmer from getting as good a price as he got last year for his wool without any compensating advantage.</P>
    <P>We must remember that as well as the other increased costs which have fallen on sheep breeders during the <Col N="1259" /> present emergency, we have in addition to this Order an effort being made by the Department of Agriculture to tighten up the regulations in regard to the branding of sheep and the sale of wool which has been branded.  I am not dealing with that Order now.  I am pointing out that the effect of it will be to add considerably to the farmer's costs of production, and to the difficulties in which he will be involved in the marketing of his wool. For that reason there is an urgent need for the annulment of this Order.  If, however, such an Order is necessary, let the price be considerably increased; let it be not less than the price which was paid last year.  I think that is a reasonable demand.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances, the nature of the soils on which sheep are reared and the economic conditions of the people engaged in production, will see the justice of our claim.  I have vivid experiences of the conditions under which the people in the Wicklow hills engaged in sheep breeding labour.  I have vivid recollections of farmers who risked their lives, and lost their lives, trying to protect their flocks during the blizzard of 1933.  At that time farmers spent days out on the mountains in the snow and in the blizzard in search of their sheep.  The Minister must realise that the people engaged in wool production are a most deserving class of community, and under no circumstances should an injustice be inflicted on them such as is implied in this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  I do not want to minimise the difficulties which the Minister has to contend with in his capacity as Minister for Supplies in dealing with the multifarious problems of his Department, such as price control, distribution and the rest.  The one outstanding characteristic in the method which the Minister has adopted for the dealing with price fixation and distribution is this: that he has not thought fit to consult the people primarily concerned, and in particular the primary producers in the country.  That complaint <Col N="1260" /> has to be made not only in regard to the Minister's Department but also to the Department of Agriculture. These Departments fix prices in a very arbitrary fashion without any respect whatever for the people primarily concerned.  While that is the attitude of these Department we have, on the other hand, appeals being made in these very difficult times to the patriotic sentiments of the people to produce the necessary quotas of food and other essentials for the community.  Surely such methods should not be adopted. The producer at least is entitled to be recognised by those holding responsible positions and should be consulted on matters such as we are discussing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan has some sort of a letter which suggests that the Minister, before making this Order consulted two farmers.  What right had they to speak on behalf of a very big percentage of the people?  Surely there were organisations which could speak in a representative capacity that the Minister might have consulted. The two individuals referred to could not claim to speak with any authority for anybody except themselves. I am glad of the way in which the Clann na Talmhan Party has approached this matter.  It has approached it in a very reasonable way. I also propose to do the same.  I think that the price paid for wool last year was not unreasonable in the circumstances. It was not exorbitant.  Prices for washed fine wool, including Galway, Roscommon and Down Crosses, ranged about 3/4 and 3/5 per lb.  The fixed price under the Order, as Deputy Donnellan has pointed out, is 2/6, which represents a reduction in the price that the farmer obtained last year for his wool of from 10d. to 11d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification whatever for a reduction of that sort, especially when you relate that to the very high price of wool that obtain, and take the quantity of wool that goes to produce yarn.  It is like the price of barley in relation to stout.  The price of the raw material is not the big consideration, and yet the people the Minister thought fit to attack and <Col N="1261" /> economise on, if economies were necessary, are the unfortunate men who are getting the least out of the aggregate sum the community has to pay for clothes.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can possibly defend his attitude in that respect. I object to this mainly on the principle that the producer should have been consulted; there should have been some consultation with people in a representative capacity, the people entitled to speak on behalf of a very considerable section of the agricultural community.  This is not the only time the Minister failed in that respect.  The price of Cheviot wool is fixed at 2/3.  Washed deep-red Lincoln and Leicester wool is 2/-. There is not so much of that wool in the country at the present time.  For the cross-bred and Scotch in Kerry and other counties the price is 1/9. There is a considerable amount of Cheviot in this country and that is making 9d. or 10d. more than last year.  When it comes to unwashed wool, the method of handling it is a departure from the traditional method. Where he got his advice on that, I would like to know.  I never before heard of determining the price on the basis of a cut per fleece&mdash;2 lb. per fleece.  Surely that is not a fair approach?  There is a wide variety in the weights of fleeces.  In the deep wools, the Lincoln wools, you can have a fleece up to 14 lbs. and, for a sheep that produces a smaller quantity, you can have it down to 5 lbs or 6 lbs. Taking 2 lbs off a Lincoln fleece may not be relatively too bad, but it ought not to be done on the basis of the fleece.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies.  Some have very heavy fleeces.  You can get down to 4 or 5 lbs. off a Lincoln wether.  The Minister's method of dealing with unwashed or greasy wool is simply to ignore the weight of the fleece and drop 2 lbs. a fleece whether it is heavy or light wool.  It is not the traditional method of dealing with it.  Why set up new methods now?  Why should not the traditional method be adopted <Col N="1262" /> Why should you put the price on an altogether different basis?  The countryman is very conservative in these matters.  I suggest that it was done in the merchants' interest all the time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan suggested that there will be a difficulty from the point of view of the wool producer under the Order made by the Department about branding sheep and branding wool.  It is in the producer's interest to get away from tar, because it is injurious to wool and we should support that because it is eventually in the producer's interest to get away from stained wool.  You can get methods of branding wool without injuring it or reducing its value.  It is true that sheep produced in this country are produced by hill farmers who have not the facilities on the mountain sides to bring the sheep to a marketable condition. They are forced by our methods of economy to go to the low lands and buy grass on the 11 months' system at relatively higher prices than in prewar years because of the compulsory tillage Order and the competition for whatever grass is offered.  Consequently, the cost of production is much higher.</P>
      <P>I suggest that last year's price was not an exorbitant price in the circumstances, but at least the Minister should have fixed, if it was necessary to fix, a price around last year's level. Deputy Cogan has pointed out that it is not a fixed price, but a maximum price, and there is nothing to safeguard the producer in the event of a collapse of emergency conditions or a further deterioration in our economic conditions.  The Minister was solely concerned with fixing a ceiling there and was not worried about the interests of the producer in the most backward districts.  The Minister ought to concern himself with the interests of the people in the remote districts and it ought to be the policy of Parliament to rehabilitate the agricultural community during the period when the food producer ought to be strong, during war time when the price of food is at a premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inevitable that history will repeat itself no matter what the economist may plan or what may be done to minimise the aftermath of the war.  It <Col N="1263" /> is almost a certainly that there will be a period of difficulty and stringency, financial difficulty for the producer, and because we are almost predominantly agricultural it is not a wise policy to curtail people situated as those people are by clipping a few shillings off them.  The price makes little or no difference to the finished article, because the raw material is the smallest cost and there is plenty of room for a revision of prices between the purchase of the raw material and the time the suit goes on the back of the individual.  If there are any economies necessary, I suggest the Minister should not start with the raw material because that is the smallest end.  I join in the appeal made to revoke this Order.  I suggest that it should be revoked.  I have pleasure in supporting the terms of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming like Deputy Donnellan, from one of the largest wool-producing counties, if not the largest, I had great sympathy with the motion until I heard Deputy Donnellan state here emphatically that he was all out to have the Order revoked completely and entirely.  I am not in agreement with that, because I have experience over a number of years, just as well as Deputy Donnellan, of how the poor farmers have been humbugged, because of their circumstances, in regard to the buying of wool.  The small farmer requires cash in the month of July and in early August and wool is the one source to which he has to turn to get it.  Generally, at that time, the system in operation was that a price would be fixed by local dealers at the end of June. A number of small farmers would turn in with their wool and then, in about three weeks, wool was reduced in price by a penny or twopence per pound. The result was that the other small farmers rushed in haste to hand over their wool.  Then, as the time went on, the price went up again.  The same thing happened last year.  The price last year ranged from 2/- to 3/8 per lb.  The person who had the real grievance last year was the man who, because of his circumstances, wanted cash and had not storage for the wool, <Col N="1264" /> sold his wool at 2/- or 2/6, while within a week or a fortnight after his well-to-do neighbour, who could afford to hold it, got 3/6 or 3/8.</P>
      <P>That is why I am in full agreement with the Order controlling the price of wool.  I believe it is high time to stabilise wool prices in this country, and I hope it is not for the emergency period only.  I hope it will continue, because wool is the one product of the farmers that there always has been a gamble and uncertainty about and the farmers generally, particularly the smaller farmers, have always come out the greatest losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that Deputy Donnellan put down his motion with a view to bringing to the Minister's notice the difference in the price fixed for washed Down and Galway fine wool.  It is to that part of the Order that I take exception. The price fixed this year for washed Down is 3/- per lb. and for Galway fine wool 2/6 per lb.  I wonder who advised the Minister on that.  There is a very small quantity of Down wool in this country, so far as I know.  But there is certainly a very large quantity of Galway fine wool.  I do not know what expert advised the Minister.  But I know that in 1938 and 1939 the Beet Growers' Association, in conjunction with the Wicklow Sheep Breeders' Association and the I.A.O.S. made an attempt to stabilise the price of wool in this country by buying it on grade from the farmers.  In order to do that, they got in touch with the Scottish Wool Growers' Association, who very kindly at that time sent their experts over here.  Meetings were held in various centres in the country and the men who came over advised the farmers as to what they should do to have their wool in proper condition.  As it was not possible to set up hurriedly here a proper store so as to have it dealt with by an Irish association or organisation, it was decided that the Scottish wool growers' representatives would buy at certain centres, and they bought purely on grade.  I have it from one of the experts that the Galway first-grade fine wool is second to none anywhere except Merino.  That is why I think there should not be a difference of 6d. in the lb. between Galway fine wool and Down <Col N="1265" /> wool.  That is one thing I am greatly worried about.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Donnellan on the 22nd February last, the Minister stated that his reason for controlling the price of wool was to enable him to control the price of cloth. That was a reasonable reply.  I hope that the price of cloth is related, and very closely related, to the price of the raw product, because if you go to any draper's establishment for a suit of clothes and you find fault with the price, the first thing the draper will say to you is: &ldquo;Look at the price you get for wool.  You get 3/6 per lb.  We could not give you the suit any cheaper.&rdquo;  If the Minister, as I am sure he will, keeps his eye on the raw material from the time it leaves the producer until it goes to the consumer and sees that it will go to the consumer at a reasonable price, I do not think that we can find any great fault with the Order, except the fault I am speaking of&mdash;the difference in the price fixed for Galway fine wool and Down wool.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out at the outset, I am sure it will be admitted that the smaller farmers are the people who mostly require cash in July.  When the price is fixed at a level of 2/6 all round there will be a great rush at that time by all concerned to bring their wool to the local merchant.  It is quite possible that he will not have sufficient storage accommodation for it and perhaps the people from whom the wool will be taken will not be the people most in need of money.  Whatever price is fixed &mdash;and I would be glad if the Minister would bring up the price for Galway wool to within at least 1d. per lb. of the price for Down wool&mdash;there should be a kind of small sliding scale over, say, three periods.</P>
    <P>If the price is to be 2/6&mdash;if the Minister insists upon that&mdash;he might think it advisable to give a halfpenny more per lb. for the wool in August and September and a further halfpenny for the month of October and November. In that way a big rush would not be made on the merchants and the people who could afford to hold over their wool and who have storage accommodation for it would do so.  That would likely tend to ensure that the smaller farmers, who are always in the habit <Col N="1266" /> of selling their wool in the early parts of the season, would be afforded an opportunity of disposing of their products.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Hughes both questioned the representation of farmers at the discussions that took place before this Order was made.  I think Deputy Donnellan meant, and I am sure Deputy Hughes meant, that there could be no adequate representation of wool producers unless they were involved in it.  I am sure all reasonable Deputies will appreciate that it would not be possible to bring into consultation all the people who could claim to speak with authority upon wool production. It was desired to have representatives of producers, and, to secure that that desire would be implemented, the Department of Agriculture were invited to send to these discussions their own experts and to nominate representative farmers to participate in the discussions.</P>
      <P>Now, it is quite possible that some people would think better representatives could have been secured than the persons nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, and, no matter whom he nominated, I am quite certain that that view would still be held.  There was, however, no alternative to taking the people who were so nominated, unless we contemplated a sort of general meeting of all wool producers in all counties.  The people whom the Minister for Agriculture nominated were fully competent to speak upon all aspects of the wool business and their advice was supplemented by the advice of the technical experts of the Department of Agriculture.  Deputy Hughes, of course, assumed that we consulted nobody.  Deputy Hughes always assumes that.  He seems to have got an <i>idee fixe</i> on that subject.  In fact, there was full and adequate consultation with all the interests concerned, including the producers in so far as it was possible to secure representatives of producers' interests in the circumstances in which there are a very large number of unorganised individual producers in all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> It is not true, either, to say that the wool producers of Galway, or any other part of the country, heard of this matter for the first time when there was an announcement on the wireless.  Full publicity was given to the fact that the Government intended to fix the price of wool at least six months before the Order was made. Not merely was the matter fully reported in the daily Press, but there was even at the time a considerable amount of controversy and correspondence concerning the advisability or otherwise of fixing wool prices, and every possible step was taken to ensure that everybody would know that such intention existed and that the discussions leading to the framing of the Order were taking place.  So much for the preliminaries to the making of the Order.</P>
    <P>I gather from the speech made by Deputy Donnellan and, I think, the speech made by Deputy Cogan, that they object to the Order at all, that they want this Order abolished and no control of wool prices.  We have had frequent discussions here and frequent protests by members of the Dáil concerning the increase in the cost of clothing.  The Government has attempted to restrict the increase in the cost of clothing not merely by regulating the margins of traders, wholesalers and retailers and the profits of manufacturers but by controlling the price of the raw materials of clothing manufactures, and a necessary final step to any effective measures for the control of clothing prices must be the control of wool prices.  I would be exceedingly surprised if, in this Dáil, the Government was attacked when it fixed the price of some product sold by farmers on the ground that it fixed the price too high, but in relation to this matter, I think the Government is much more open to attack on that ground than on any other.  We fixed the price of wool&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at a higher level than prevails at the moment in any country in the world.  The maximum price fixed for this Galway fine wool is <Col N="1268" /> almost double the price fixed by the British Government for corresponding wool in Great Britain.  There is no country in the world in which these prices prevail, and, not merely is that so, but the maximum price fixed for wool represents an increase over the 1939 price proportionately greater than the increase in price of any other agricultural commodity produced in this country.  I can imagine people criticising us for having fixed the price too high, because, having fixed these prices, as we did,. at these levels, there must necessarily be a reaction on the price of clothing.  We hope that, as a result of the restriction on speculation in wool which this Order will bring about, clothing prices will be reduced, but, clearly, if we were to confine the price of wool here to, say, the price in Great Britain, or to a price which would have the same relation to the 1939 price as the prices of other agricultural products, then the price of clothing could be more restricted still.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, an attractive thing to the producers of wool that the price of their product should have soared as it did, and soared it has since the begining of the war.  It did not soar solely because of the operation of the law of supply and demand, as Deputy Cogan stated.  At least, there were other factors operating.  In normal times, the great bulk of the wool crop here was exported.  It was exported through the medium of a limited number of specialist firms who bought the wool from the dealers or producers, graded it and marketed it abroad as opportunity offered.  With the curtailment of supplies of wool from abroad and the fear of scarcity, not merely did the wool merchants and people who purchased wool for granding and the wool dealers who had immediate contact with the producers begin to buy wool as it offered, but the woollen manufacturers also went into the market to purchase wool, and intense competition developed between them to get supplies of wool.  It was that intense competition to get supplies at any price that had the effect of forcing up the price of the various grades as rapidly as was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, a third group of persons <Col N="1269" /> appeared in the market&mdash;a third group which will always appear in such a market, where prices are rising rapidly and fears of scarcity are general &mdash;a class of speculators, people who bought wool merely to hold it against rising prices and creating an artificial scarcity to ensure that the price would rise.  The term &ldquo;profiteer&rdquo; was invented in the last war to describe that type of person, the person who discharged no economic function, but who intervened in the process of distribution for the purpose of buying and selling at a profit to himself.  The term nowdays is used generally to describe all persons who take excessive profits, but the original meaning of the term was precisely the type of speculator who was intervening in the wool market in this country in recent years.  It is necessary to secure that there should be some relation between the price paid for wool and the value of the wool, some relation between the price paid for wool and the value of the articles made from it, and, to eliminate these temporary forces that are forcing up the price, to secure that there exists a type of control which will ensure a fair deal as between the producers of wool and those who have to buy it as a raw material.</P>
    <P>I do not think we were unfair to the producers of wool in the price we fixed.  None of those we consulted considered that we were unfair.  The prices were fixed at the opening prices of last year.  In last year, it is true that the price went much higher in the course of the season, but nevertheless even the opening prices of last year were substantially higher than the average prices in any preceding year. In the case of the Galway wool, washed fine-bred wool, the opening price in 1940 was 14d. per lb.; in 1941, 16d. per lb.; and in 1942, 18d. per lb. In 1943, it jumped to 30d. per lb., and it was at 30d. per lb. that we fixed the price this year.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of being fashionable or not, but of the machinery which is capable of spinning it.  I know that the impression is held that as a result of the reduction in the price this year as compared with last year certain people will benefit at the expense of the producers of wool, but that is not so.  The price charged by the manufacturers is related to the price of wool charged by the producers, and they are not permitted to benefit in increased profits from the conditions existing this year.  I should like to remove that impression from the mind of any Deputy in this House, because it is undoubtedly undesirable that an impression should be created that some other intermediate class&mdash; some class or group between the producers and the consumers of wool&mdash; could benefit by the increase in prices.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that certain other factors may operate in the meantime, such as the price of coal, and so on.  It is quite obvious, however, that if there is a big reduction in the price of wool as between last year and this year, it is bound to have an effect on the price of woollen garments. As a matter of fact, there is a substantial amount of wool in the hands of merchants at the moment, which is now being sold at a loss because it also is subject to this Order. In fact, it is not importable that the market for wool will be much less this year by reason of the substantial carryover in the hands of the merchants from last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Beegan suggested something in the nature of a sliding scale, but I think that the Deputy will realise that once we go into this thing at all it would be impossible to do that, because if you are to have control it must be continued right through from the producer to the buyer for manufacturing purposes, and therefore it is clearly impossible to have the same grade of wool sold at different prices at different times of the year, since the wool will all be sold eventually at the same price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that what I said was that the wool should be sold at a certain price at certain times&mdash;that there should be some control in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand that, but it is not possible to achieve that without taking the risk that the benefit of such control would be <Col N="1272" /> secured, not by the producer or the ultimate consumer of the woollen goods, but by the dealers in wool or the registered wool merchants.  The only persons who are entitled to buy wool are the recognised dealers or wool merchants.  The recognised dealers are those who purchased wool last year, and the recognised wool merchants are those who are capable of grading of wool in accordance with international standards.  If they sell or purchase wool outside the controlled price, then they commit an offence, and that also applies to the producer or the dealer.</P>
      <P>A question was also raised as to the difference in price between Downs and the Galway fine wool.  As Deputy Beegan remarked, the production of Down wool is not large in this country, but I was asked to fix a higher price for that type of wool as against the other types, in order to encourage its production.  According to the experts, it is the best type of wool, and accordingly I am informed that the Department of Agriculture is desirous of encouraging its production. The production of that type of wool, however, will be very small, and it was solely for that reason that I assented to the suggestion of the Minister for Agriculture that a higher price should be fixed for it.  Accordingly, a higher price for Downs was fixed in order to carry on what I understand is the policy of the Department of Agriculture. It is not a question of differentiation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there are any other specific matters to which I should refer, but I should like the House to understand that I regard the fixation of wool prices as an essential part of the whole scheme for controlling the costs of woollen garments or woollen materials, generally.  In fact, during the recent general election campaign, a very prominent spokesman of the Fine Gael Party made it his principal point of attack on the Government Party that they did not fix wool prices and that, to that extent, the whole scheme of controlling prices was ineffective. I hoped to secure more reasonable prices by controlling or regulating <Col N="1273" /> the speculative element in wool buying and confirming the trade to recognised merchants acting on a quota basis.  In so far as undue competition had forced prices up, if we had succeeded in eliminating that type of competition, we might have succeeded in our objective of lowering prices, but we might also have increased the danger by going too far in that direction and putting a power in the hands of merchants which would be unfair to the producers.  In these circumstances we felt that to achieve our aims, and also from the point of view of dealing fairly with the producers of wool, the only thing to be done was to give effect to the Order. With regard to Deputy Donnellan's suggestion that the Order should be revoked, I think it is in the interests of everybody, and particularly of the producers of wool, that the Order should be maintained.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has failed completely to justify the making of this Emergency Powers Order.  He has given no reason whatever.  In my opinion he has not justified the fixing of the price of wool, high grade wool at least.  He has not even given an assurance that the price of clothing will be cut down in return for the cutting of the price of wool.  In my opinion he has made a rather dictatorial use of the emergency powers to slash at the wool producers without making any attempt to justify his action.  I was waiting for him to give some good grounds but he did not give them.  I am in agreement with Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Hughes that he made this Order without consulting the producers in a proper way.  Surely the wool producers should be consulted in such a big matter as this.  He stated that two experts were consulted in the matter.  The production of wool last year amounted to 11,000,000 pounds practically, and it must have covered a vast number of flock owners.  I think they were entitled to a more representative consultation.  Most farmers regard this as a deliberate slashing of their income without any sound justification on the part of the Government. If the Minister could show why he imposed such a terrific cut in the price of raw wool the farmers just as they have responded to every other call made upon them would not have taken it badly.  Most of them have come to the conclusion that no matter what takes place the only way in which they are regarded is that their income is to be reduced at every twist and turn.  It is rather discouraging seeing that they have been called upon to produce food and fuel for the nation that this wool Order should come upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will the result of it be?  I myself got 3/9 a lb. for wool last year. The price I will get for the same quality this year is 2/6.  Yet we all know a suit of clothes costs anything from £8 to £10.  Well, if this motion is not agreed to here, if the Order is not revoked, it will be interesting to <Col N="1275" /> see if the price of clothing will come down.  In my opinion farmers are prepared to accept a reduced price for their wool provided they see a proper case put up for reducing it.  Such a case has not been put up by the Minister. He was more than disappointing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan's reason for not falling in line with the motion was that there is a reduction in the price of wool after the opening of the market every year.  I have never experienced that and I have been selling wool for a number of years.  On the contrary there was a rise in price last year following the opening.  My experience is that there may be a fall in the price about the month of October when, as the Minister says, speculators may come along and upset the market. When the Minister did fix a maximum price I can't see why he did not fix a minimum price as well.  That is, a price below which it would be illegal to buy or sell wool.  In 1930-31 the total production of wool was 14,750,000 lbs.  Last year, 1942-43, it had fallen to just short of 11,000,000 lbs.  First and foremost that shows that the wool trade has not increased greatly.  It shows definitely that the policy of the present Government towards the sheep and wool trade is detrimental.  The effect of this present Order, in my opinion, will do for sheep and wool what the Minister for Agriculture has succeeded in doing for the pig trade. I ask every Deputy in the House to vote in favour of the motion.  I suppose last year the total income from wool to the farmers would be something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000.  The reduction in price will mean a loss of between £300,000 and £400,000.  There is no justification for this Order seeing that the price of finished woollen goods will not be one bit cheaper.  If there is a reduction in the price of the finished woollen article perhaps wool producers would be prepared to accept a reduced price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that Deputy Beegan was not in the House when I was introducing this motion because I imagine if he was he would not have repeated some of the things I stated myself.  First, he said he was surprised that I had put down a motion to annul, and that if I had put down a motion to amend he would have agreed with it.  Deputy Beegan is longer in the House than I am.  He knows that you cannot put down motions to amend Emergency Powers Orders.  The Deputy raised one point that I raised, and that was the vast difference there is between the price of fine Galway washed wool and Down wool.  The Minister failed to give a reply.  He failed because he could not tell us that the Down wool was more valuable than the Galway wool.  The Minister just told us that it was some game to help the production of that class of wool by the Department.  If you are going to turn down a first-class article, and give a better price for a second-class one in order to help something else, I say that that is very bad example.  I have no doubt why this Down wool is given a better price per lb. than the better-class wool.  It is because the so-called representatives of the wool producers, a Dublin man and a Wexford man, who are pedigree sheep breeders, wanted to do something to help their class.  The Minister repeated the statement that there were representatives of wool producers&mdash;a pedigree breeder from Dublin and a pedigree breeder from Wexford&mdash;two counties that count very little in the production of wool.  They worked this game with the assistance of the so-called experts and the wool buyers. That was the so-called advisory committee that they had.  They did it to suit the Down wool.  That is the reason the price is higher for Down wool than for the better-class fine wool of Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Deputy Beegan made the alarming statement that the price of the fine wool started at 2/-.  I am glad to say that his own Minister corrected him and stated that it started at 2/6.  There is something in the idea of grading. There is no doubt about that.  As the Minister said, the question is: &ldquo;How can we deal with an unorganised body&rdquo;?  That is the whole trouble. If these people were an organised body they would not allow you to deal with them as you did.  There was an announcement on Friday night, and 90 per cent. of the wool producers were told to read the result in the next day's newspapers.  I would withdraw this motion if the Minister would give a guarantee that the manufactured articles from wool would be reduced in price correspondingly.  He would not give that guarantee.  As he would not do so I will put the motion to a division.  There is no good in telling us that we will have to depend on the charity of the manufacturers.  We are not going to depend on it because we know we are not going to get anything out of it.  I say in all sincerity that the Minister should promise that he will make an Order reducing correspondingly the price of manufactured articles.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is a desire on behalf of Deputies to have information concerning the situation which has arisen in relation to coal supplies and the arrangements which are being made to deal with that situation.  I think that it is necessary to remind the House, in the first instance, that we, in this country, have been operating for a considerable time upon very curtailed supplies of coal. Since the end of 1940, the supplies of coal available to us, both in quantity and quality, have been barely sufficient to maintain essential services and industries using coal as fuel.  During last year, we received from all sources a quantity of coal which was slightly under 40 per cent. of our normal consumption. Even that figure would give a false picture of the situation because the coal which we had available to us was so poor in quality that it represented, in practice, a still smaller fraction of our normal requirements.  By various measures of control which have been operating for some time past, the available supplies of coal have been confined to essential users, to persons engaged in the operation of essential industries, to the production of electricity and gas and to the maintenance of transport services.  It is necessary to understand that fact so that Deputies will appreciate why any further curtailments of our supplies must necessarily involve a curtailment of essential services.  The essential services had already been limited in their operation to an extent which caused considerable economic dislocation and occasional hardship to some <Col N="1282" /> people and a further curtailment now must mean an expansion of the area of dislocation and of the area of hardship. There is no avoiding that.  There is no possible device by which we can, with a smaller quantity of coal, maintain the essential services in full operation. Therefore, the arrangements which the Government have been making to adjust our situation to the reduced supply of coal are all necessarily designed to effect a contraction of services regarded heretofore as essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;essential&rdquo; is an elastic one.  We have become accustomed during the course of the past few years to do without commodities and facilities which we would have regarded as essential, or almost essential, before the war, but many of the things which, even in recent months, we have regarded as essential must now be eliminated.  There is no avoiding that. Inasmuch as we must contemplate a very substantial diminution in our supplies of fuel in coming months, the aim of the Government has been to make such arrangements as would ensure that the best possible use would be made of the available supplies, that economy in their use would be enforced in all directions and that distribution amongst the essential users would take place in such manner as to cause the least hardship and the least economic dislocation.  Hardship and economic dislocation cannot be avoided but, by wise management of the available supplies, we may be able to minimise it.  The House will also understand that whatever arrangements are now made to restrict the use of coal and other fuels must necessarily be tentative.  No reliable estimate of available supplies can be made in respect of any protracted period ahead.  We have particulars of the stocks available to us now &mdash; the stocks of coal in the hands of the Government organisation which was set up to handle certain aspects of our fuel problem, in the hands of the major coal users such as the Electricity Supply Board, the gas companies and railway companies and certain other industrial users.  We can add to the known supplies of coal certain reserve stocks of timber and some supplies of <Col N="1283" /> turf which can be made available for industrial use.  It is, occasionally, possible to substitute coal by pitch or coke breeze or alternative fuels of one kind and another, although the quantities of such alternative fuels which can be procured are necessarily limited. It is in relation to that general picture that I want to inform the Dáil of the measures which are being brought into operation, again emphasising that these are tentative measures, that it is not possible to state precisely whether or not they will be adequate to deal with the situation, whether it will be possible to modify them at some future date or whether still further restrictions may not be necessary.  On the basis of the tentative estimates which had been prepared as to the situation in the immediate future, decisions have been made and these decisions are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The purpose for which the largest quantities of coal is required is the maintenance of railway transport.  It will perhaps help Deputies to appreciate the dimensions of the problem created in connection with railway transport when I say that, even on the basis of the restricted services which the Great Southern Railways have announced will come into operation from Monday next, a weekly consumption of coal amounting to 4,000 tons is involved. In deciding upon the dimensions of the reduction, we had to take into account, not merely the requirements of the immediate future, but also the requirements of the period later in the year when the demands upon the rail traffic reach their peak.</P>
    <P>If we could determine with certainty the quantity of coal which would be available to us to the end of the year, we would still have to enforce reductions in rail transport facilities at the present time, to a greater extent than the average weekly coal supply would suggest, because from the average weekly supply now available would have to be taken some proportion, for the purpose of accumulating stocks to meet the much greater transport needs which develop in the months of September, October and November. It is in those months that demands <Col N="1284" /> for transport facilities are at their highest, and when the public interest most urgently requires that those demands should, if possible, be met in full.  If, by limiting services at the present time, we can make possible the provision of greater transport facilities to move grain, beet and turf in those months, then it is clearly desirable that we should accept now whatever limitations are necessary, in order to provide ourselves with that guarantee.  Our difficulty is that we cannot be certain, even by imposing very severe restrictions now, that we will be able to face the peak traffic load and cope with it.  It is, however, a reasonable course to adopt &mdash; as I am sure the House will agree &mdash; to put aside as much as possible of the supplies at present available to meet the requirements of that period.</P>
    <P>Arrangements which have been made for the reduction of transport on the Great Southern Railways system have been worked out in consultation with the officers of that company.  The reduction in coal consumption which they have been asked to effect involves a substantial reduction in the transport facilities they can provide.  In fact, the reduction in transport facilities must represent a higher proportion of the existing facilities than the reduction in consumption of coal is of the supplies previously utilised by them.  That is because there are certain overheads &mdash; if I may so use that term &mdash; which must be provided in any case. The total quantity of coal consumed by the Great Southern Railways or any railway company in the shunting and marshalling of trains represents a very high part of its total consumption &mdash; amounting, I think, almost to one-third &mdash; and no great diminution in that consumption is possible, even if the number of trains used for the transportation of passengers and ordinary merchandise is substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The arrangements which we have tentatively provided for contemplate the provision of a main line service for passengers on two days in the week with a reduced daily service upon suburban lines.  There will be a reduction of the ordinary goods trains, by <Col N="1285" /> limiting them to operating on four days in the week, which represents a diminution of 40 per cent. in number of passengers and 20 per cent. in the amount of traffic which they carry.</P>
    <P>A substantial proportion of the goods traffic of the company is, however, carried not in those scheduled goods trains but in special trains.  All the single-commodity trains are special trains, the transportation of turf is done by specials, the transportation of live stock is, in the main, done by special trains and, in the appropriate season, beet and grain are, in the main, moved by special trains also.  It is not contemplated that a corresponding reduction in the special goods train service will be made as in the ordinary goods train service.  We are endeavouring to secure that full facilities will be afforded for the transportation of turf and, while some reduction in the number of cattle specials will undoubtedly be necessary, nevertheless every effort will be made to ensure that that service will be kept going. The &ldquo;perishables&rdquo; trains which run upon southern lines will be continued and will operate daily, although in future they will not take passengers.</P>
    <P>A number of branch lines will be closed and road services will be substituted. An announcement appeared in this morning's papers of a number of new road services, to be instituted to provide facilities for the towns previously served by those branch lines. In the case of the Portlaoighise-Mountmellick branch, it is estimated that the existing bus service will be sufficient and it is expected that the same will prove true of the Goold's Cross-Cashel branch.  In respect to the Fermoy-Mitchelstown and Banteer-Newmarket branches, existing bus services will be diverted to provide the facilities required.  On the Woodenbridge-Shillelagh run, a new bus service will be provided.  On the Schull-Skibbereen branch, it is estimated that the existing service will prove sufficient. On the Dublin-Tullow route, a new bus service will be provided.  In respect to the Waterford-Macmine service, the situation will be met by the provision of a bus service to Enniscorthy, connecting with the main line <Col N="1286" /> trains.  The various measures which have been taken to reduce the train facilities available are, of course, only the first step in coping with the transport problem resulting from the diminution of fuel supplies.  The second step must, I think, take the form of a re-organisation of production in various industries in order to reduce the amount of transport that will be necessary.  Heretofore, the regulation of output of various industries was not related to transport requirements, but it will be possible, in some cases, to effect a re-organisation of production in such a manner as to reduce the demands which these industries will make upon transport facilities.</P>
    <P>That may involve changes of one kind or another.  The suggestion has been made, for example, that the wheat supplies of the country should be milled where they are available. At present we have a national flour.  A similar grist is used in all mills, and that grist contains the same proportion of native wheat as of imported wheat.  That involves considerable transportation of grain, bringing the imported wheat to the inland mills and the native wheat to the city mills.  If it should be practicable to bring about an alteration in the proportions of imported and native wheat, according to the transport situation, then some saving of transport will be involved. I mention that as an indication not of a decision already made but as the type of reorganisation of production which we have in mind and which may effect an economy in transport which would ease the situation.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the Great Northern Railway Company.  I cannot say what the situation will be there.  The quantity of coal supplied from our resources to the Great Northern Railway Company is relatively very small, and a corresponding reduction in the quantity of that coal would not necessarily occasion any similar changes in the facilities provided by that company.</P>
    <P>The next most important users of coal are the gas companies.  Up to now the gas companies have been <Col N="1287" /> using also approximately 4,000 tons per week.  That is a substantial quantity of coal, but if it was represented by gas-producing coal of the kind normally used by gas companies, it would make possible the production of gas considerably in excess of the production now taking place.  In fact, that coal is very frequently unsuitable for the production of gas, and many difficulties have been experienced by gas companies in using it.  The position is likely to arise that we will have to enforce upon all the gas companies of the country the same limitation in supply as is at present operating in Dublin.  I hope that it will be possible to maintain the existing Dublin supply unchanged.  I base that hope upon the expectation that the measures to which I referred yesterday will, when brought into operation, effectively prevent the use of gas in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; hours. No less than 17 per cent. of the total quantity of gas now produced in Dublin is being used in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; hours. It is quite clear that if by some more rigid enforcement of the regulations we could prevent that consumption of gas, then the existing supply could still be maintained even if the quantity of coal to the gas company was reduced or if there was a further deterioration in its quality.</P>
    <P>I am aware, as all Deputies are aware, of the hardship which the curtailment of the gas supply occasions in many households.  I should point out, however, that the reduction of the consumption of gas in Dublin has, in the main, not been effected at the expense of the slot machine users.  They have, of course, been affected in so far as they can only obtain supplies during certain hours, but, in respect of the quantity of gas which they use, they, have not been affected to anything like the same extent as other gas users.</P>
    <P>If a calculation is made upon the basis of the calorific value of gas, the reduction in consumption by the slot machine users has been 7.5 per cent. The reduction in consumption by people with quarterly meters has been 30 per cent., and the reduction by industrial users has been 72 per cent.  If <Col N="1288" /> the calculation is made upon the basis of the number of cubic feet of gas used &mdash; Deputies know that the calorific value of gas has been reduced on more than one occasion since 1941 &mdash; then the slot machine users have, in fact, used more gas in 1943 than in the corresponding period of 1941, while the ordinary consumers and industrial consumers have used substantially less. That situation has resulted from the existing method of controlling the output of gas which I am anxious to preserve rather than attempt a rationing scheme upon a unit basis.  A rationing scheme on a unit basis, which would take into full account the varied needs of individual families, would be difficult to devise.  Some families require gas for cooking purposes more urgently than others and it would be difficult, without very detailed examination of the circumstances of individual households, to adopt a unit rationing scheme which would work fairly.  I prefer, therefore, to effect gas rationing by means of a curtailment of the hours of supply, because it does provide a service during those hours to those who require gas for cooking.  I hope to maintain it although, as I said yesterday, its maintenance will depend very largely on the success of our efforts to prevent the continued use of gas in the &ldquo;off&rdquo;-hours.  Other gas companies may consider it best to adopt some different mode of control in relation to the circumstances of their undertakings, but all of them will, in view of the reduced coal supplies, have to reduce their output in a manner comparable with the reduction in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Electricity Supply Board, the situation is doubly unfortunate because Deputies will remember that the Board found it necessary in March last to re-impose the rationing of electricity by reason of the abnormally dry months which had preceded that announcement.  In normal times a diminution in the output from the water-power scheme would be supplemented by an increased output from the steam stations, but it was not possible to authorise a bigger consumption of coal, and, consequently, rationing was introduced by the Electricity Supply Board by reason of the difficulty <Col N="1289" /> of maintaining a supply resulting from the drought.  Now we have got to reduce the consumption of coal to the Electricity Supply Board, and that will involve further restrictions upon the use of electricity.  An announcement of these further restrictions will be made by the Electricity Supply Board on Saturday next.</P>
    <P>These restrictions will involve a 15 per cent. cut in the use of electrical power by industries.  We will provide that certain industries designated by me as Minister for Supplies will continue to receive full supplies, subject to whatever economies can be brought into operation.  But the industries that will continue to receive full supplies will be specially notified to that effect by the Electricity Supply Board. Unless an industrial undertaking is notified formally that it is in that category, it will be necessary for it to effect a reduction in its consumption of electricity by 15 per cent. compared with its 1941 consumption.</P>
    <P>The use of electricity for space heating by electricity consumers will be prohibited altogether between May 1st and August 31st.  That prohibition will cover the use of electric fires, heaters, radiators, tubular heaters and all forms of space heating, directly or indirectly, by electricity.  The use of electricity for traction purposes will be reduced by one-third compared with the 1943 consumption.  This will involve a further diminution in tram services.  The use of electricity for cooking purposes will also be restricted by 15 per cent.  In the case of all other users of electricity, except public lighting, which will be restricted by 25 per cent., a 50 per cent. cut in consumption will be imposed.  These further cuts in electricity consumption will operate from May 1st.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that 50 per cent. of the present consumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>50 per cent. of the 1941 consumption.  There are essential industries that must be kept going &mdash; flour milling and baking are obvious examples &mdash; and in so far as they require supplies of coal or electricity, those supplies must be given.  It may <Col N="1290" /> be possible, by various devices, to reduce their consumption of coal or electricity without diminishing their output.  We contemplate the possibility of milling flour less finely than has been the practice heretofore.  By imposing restrictions upon the fineness of the flour, it will be possible to effect a considerable reduction in fuel consumption.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the sugar company must be provided with fuel.  Normally the sugar company proceeds until the beginning of the campaign season to accumulate very large stocks of coal. We will have to ensure that they will have enough coal to produce sugar.  A substantial quantity of the coal they use is required for the purpose of pulp drying.  It may not be possible to provide coal for that purpose, but, in so far as sugar production is concerned, the aim will be to give the company permission to accumulate, in the months between now and October, the quantity which will enable it to produce our sugar requirements.</P>
      <P>There are certain other essential industries which will be reduced by 10 per cent.  These are industries which are regarded as of special importance and it is desirable to keep them at the maximum possible production, even if it does involve a more drastic cut upon other industrial users.  I have in mind dairies producing butter, dryers of grain, seed wheat and barley assemblers, wholemeal millers, oatmeal millers and people in similar categories.  Other industrial users of coal will be reduced by 25 per cent. &mdash; that is, a 25 per cent. cut on the supplies heretofore available to them.</P>
      <P>We aim also to secure as far as possible the complete elimination of the use of coal for industrial purposes in the turf areas.  There are large numbers of industrial firms in the turf areas which have already turned over completely to the use of turf, and we think all could, with some effort, effect a similar change.  We hope to realise a substantial saving in the use of coal by these means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel section of the Department of Supplies has skilled officers available to advise industrialists as to the measures they might adopt to effect <Col N="1291" /> economy in the use of fuel, and particularly a transfer from coal to turf, without a diminution in productive efficiency, and the services of these officers will be available to all industrialists who will avail of them.  These officers are, of their own initiative, contacting the users of coal at the present time for the purpose of examining their methods of using coal, advising them as to economies that can be secured, and generally estimating whether they are making the best use of the supplies they are getting, so as to guide the Department in future allocations of coal to these firms.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, no doubt, will suggest that we must make a special effort to increase production from our own coal mines.  Our coal mines have been producing on a scale higher than was normal pre-war and they would, no doubt, have progressed much further in the matter of increasing output but for certain obvious difficulties.  The first and most important of these difficulties is the lack of supply of skilled labour.  Only skilled workers are effective below ground.  It could even be said that nobody could safely be allowed to operate below ground who had not a certain knowledge of mining.  We have, after consultation with the trade unions concerned, modified in some respect our safety regulations so as to permit of persons being employed in coal mining below ground after a shorter period of training than would be enforced in normal times.  But there is a definite limitation upon the output capacity of the mines by reason of the scarcity of skilled workers. There is also a limitation resulting from the inability to get additional supplies of mining equipment.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, something may be done. I do not want to say any more on that matter at the moment, because conferences have been proceeding to-day with the proprietors of these mines and other interested parties with a view to examining that whole question, and I hope that as a result of the conferences practical measures will emerge which will result in a still further increase in coal output.  I do not want the <Col N="1292" /> House to imagine that there is possible any increase in the output of coal from the Irish mines which would effect more than a very slight change in our circumstances.  The total output of all the Irish mines, working to the fullest capacity, would probably not exceed 4,000 tons a week and, as I already mentioned, that is the consumption of the Great Southern Railways Company alone upon the basis of the reduced services that will operate from Monday next.  Certain experiments are also being carried out as to the practicability of using Irish coal for purposes that it was not considered suitable for previously.  We will have to make the best of the available supplies, and the technical knowledge available to us is being mobilised to deal with that particular aspect of the problem: how that coal, having certain characteristics and considered unsuitable for various purposes in the past, can now be utilised for these purposes.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on the part of coal producers in certain areas, and I should like to mention particularly the Sligo area, to do a spot of black-marketing in coal at night time.  There are a number of small mines operating in that area, I mean small in relation to the normal coal mine, upon all of which it is not possible to keep a very effective check.  While a number of detections have been made and prosecutions instituted for the sale of coal to persons who had not got permits to purchase it, I am fairly satisfied that there are sales of that kind taking place which we have not detected.  I should like to ask the co-operation of the people of Sligo and the public authorities in Sligo in ensuring suppression of that traffic.</P>
    <P>We are proposing to reserve for essential industrial purposes the reserve stocks of timber and turf bricquettes accumulated over the past three or four years.  These stocks were held to deal with such a situation as this, and we are taking them into account in reckoning our fuel resources; taking them into account, of course, with a proper appreciation of their value as fuel in relation to coal. With the co-operation of coal users, <Col N="1293" /> with an acceptance on the part of the public of those restrictions upon essential services and industries which have become necessary, we can possibly maintain conditions here on a tolerable basis in the hope that the situation will change and that some modification of these restrictions, if not their entire removal, may become possible later in the year.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, as Deputies will readily appreciate, it is not possible to look any distance ahead with the certainty that you will see the circumstances that will then exist.  The possibility of a serious contraction of our coal supplies, arising from causes that are within the knowledge of Deputies, was foreseen.  In consequence of that anticipation, a special effort was made this year to secure an increased production of turf.  Not merely was a publicity drive undertaken but, by improved methods of organisation in various parts of the country, the production of turf was got under way earlier and more smoothly and in a more substantial measure than in previous years.  Although turf cannot be substituted for coal in a satisfactory manner for many industrial purposes, and although the total production of turf that we could hope to accomplish would still fall far short of our total fuel requirements, nevertheless, every ton of turf produced over and above the quantity produced last year will help to minimise our difficulties and will certainly help to make more secure the domestic fuel upon which the welfare of many households will depend. I should like, therefore, in conclusion to impress on Deputies the importance of taking full advantage of every opportunity that offers to them of urging the greatest possible production of turf. Even though there may be some difficulty in transporting all the turf produced to the areas where it is most urgently required, nevertheless, it will be much safer to have it produced, because it can then be moved as occasion offers and will, in any event, be an asset to the country which can be utilised for the minimisation of hardship at some time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred <Col N="1294" /> to the essential services in this country, and one of the services that I would class as essential at the moment is the service of Government itself.  We are still in the region of Government by the consent of those who have to be governed, and it was the wish of members of this Party that that consent should be obtained by the Government taking the people of the country more and more into their confidence, if they wanted to get the confidence of the people in what they were doing.  To that end, this Party made several efforts in the last few days to get such a statement made as has been made to-night.  I want to get on record just what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in these benches found their constituents anxious about what had happened.  Inside a week, the country had been plunged into what seemed to be an extremely deep crisis, and yet people could not understand the reason for it.  We thought that one of the ways in which the matter could be explained to the people would be through the House here, and through a statement from the Minister.  Last Saturday, therefore, an approach was made to the Government by a member of this Party to see if a statement would be made at the opening of the House this week.  The answer that came back appeared to be favourable. I say, &ldquo;appeared to be favourable&rdquo; because the person who spoke was not speaking after consultation with his chiefs, and it was recognised that it was possible that only his own view was being given.  On Tuesday, a further approach was made and it was then realised that a statement was not going to be made.  The result was that notice was given yesterday that after questions the matter would be raised openly in this House by Deputy O'Higgins and that took place.  I do not think I do the Minister any wrong in saying that his attitude was: &ldquo;Deputies are free to ask me any question they like about this and I will answer as well as I can, but I will make no statement.&rdquo;  The result was that a motion was put down for the adjournment of the House to-day to discuss this matter of urgent public importance. It was recognised by the Chair as being the type of motion that <Col N="1295" /> falls within the Standing Orders and, in the end, we have got the statement that the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>What people are anxious to know is, not so much what the Minister detailed here to-night, namely, those peculiar divisions of effort in the country which this crisis, if it is a crisis, is going to develop, but what is the cause of the crisis and, in particular, what caused it to come so suddenly.  They would be very anxious to get, although they recognise that they cannot get full details at a moment like this, such information as would enable them to form their own judgment on just how serious and grave the crisis is.  Judged by that standard, of course, the Minister's statement is wholly and entirely unsatisfactory &mdash; at least it would be in ordinary circumstances.  But I think everybody here is reasonable and recognises that the exigencies of the situation do possibly impede the Minister in saying to the House what he would normally know the House would expect him to say.  However, what the Minister has said is sufficient to indicate that, leaving all thought of what might have happened aside at the moment, there is a situation of extreme gravity in the country.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to over-emphasise the matter; neither would I like to minimise it.  There is a middle line that can be walked, and I could walk it more easily if I had certain information, which I am sure the Minister has, but which I know he is entitled to withhold.  There is a situation of difficulty and, as the Minister said, there is going to be graver difficulty almost immediately.  These difficulties are going to réact very seriously upon the lives of the masses of the people in the country.  They are the people whom we represent and whom we govern.  People in this country are so made that they can very easily be led where they can only with difficulty be driven, and an appeal to them will often succeed where any attempt at coercion will only meet with refusal. I suggest to the Minister that if he does not find it possible, and he may not, to answer precise questions in the <Col N="1296" /> House, he could answer these questions elsewhere.  I should have thought that the Minister could have given the House estimates with regard to certain obvious matters, and that Deputies then could have let their minds play about these estimates, could have come to certain conclusions of their own, and would then be the medium for giving an explanation of some kind of satisfactory nature to those who will be affected by these restrictions.  But that has not happened.</P>
    <P>There are, however, big sections of the community who will be put in a position of extreme difficulty following on what the Minister has said. At this moment, people are rather tired of having it explained to them that there is a residue of wisdom in a very limited number of people in this country and that what the majority of the people have to do is to take it or leave it.  Deputy M. O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, said to-day that there was a meeting of an unfortunate type yesterday in connection with certain services in the country.  I suggest that there are responsible people who represent workers in that particular area, and that it would be well worth while, in confidence, to give these people, not orders as to what is to be done, but some intimation of just how the situation affects them objectively, and to ask them, on that objective statement of facts, to co-operate with those who propose to put certain restrictions upon them.</P>
    <P>Two other public utility services have been mentioned, electricity and gas.  Has the Minister taken those who are at the head of, and responsible for, these undertakings into his confidence?  Has he told them what the situation is, detailing it with certain facts and figures?  I think everybody will agree that it is the task of the Minister, or of the Government, at any rate, to make, so to speak, the major division in connection with this matter, to say that out of a certain amount of coal at the disposal of the Government within a certain period a division along certain lines will be made: roughly the type of division the Minister spoke of, that is, <Col N="1297" /> something for transport, something for electricity, something for gas, something for certain necessary industry and something for certain other not so essential industries.</P>
    <P>Having made that division, I suggest that it would be proper for the Minister to get these people in to himself, to give them his statement&mdash;and it can be done in confidence and the confidence will be respected&mdash;as to what is the material at his disposal, what is generally his major division of that material and then to let them follow out the reaction of that division on their particular units of work. In that way, it might be possible to get people agreeable to submit to certain matters, which at the moment the Government will find it almost impossible to enforce upon them.</P>
    <P>If this were an ordinary debate, I should have prefaced any remarks I make on the matter by a series of question.  I take it that the Minister, having had the various reports that came from this side and possibly from other sides of the House, having considered the whole matter and having decided to make the statement he has made, is giving us the fullest possible information he thinks it reasonable for him to give.  If that is so, however unreasonable it may appear to us&mdash;and I must confess that I find it not very satisfactory&mdash;I suppose we must accept it, but whatever be the unsatisfactory nature of it to us, it may at least be alleviated by doing what I have suggested.  I ask the Minister to try to get people's confidence by giving them his, instead of merely dishing out orders, or making representations to various people immediately under him who will then dish out orders which simply have to be obeyed.</P>
    <P>One point of detail intrigued me. The Minister said that while he appealed to people to do what they could to see that turf development would proceed apace, he felt that there was not much prospect of an alleviation of our difficulties from the use of native coal.  I do not know whether he means that it has been exploited to the full, but he used the phrase that <Col N="1298" /> even if all of whatever we have in the way of mines in the country were exploited to the full, we never could rise above a production of some 4,000 tons per week.  Why is that limitation imposed? How does it arise?  Is it a question of labour&mdash;I do not imagine it can be&mdash;and if not, where is the bottle-neck as a result of which there arises this conclusion that the most, that ever could be obtained is 4,000 tons per week?</P>
    <P>In that connection, I wonder has the Minister had offers made to him by outside bodies to engage in the business of developing whatever native coal resources there are, if they are given certain alleviations with regard to taxation. Whatever may have been the reason for refusing such offers in ordinary times, surely even finance will bend to a crisis like this and adopt unusual methods in the unusual period in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>It may after this, but it will then possibly be too late. However, that is only a matter of detail.  The Minister, I hope, will let the governing authorities of the Electricity Supply Board and these other public utility societies know not merely what he said here to-night, which was only a description of the areas over which these restrictions have to be imposed, but why they have to be imposed.  I may be entirely misled. People who have come to me may be optimistic beyond anything that is reasonable, but I find in the public mind this confusion, that none of them appears to be convinced of the necessity for the drastic reductions in services which are being made.  It is surely possible to make these people realise what the situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought some approach to that could have been made here, that the curtain could have been lifted at least a little and that we, peeping beneath the curtain, could have explained our viewpoint, taken whatever was given to us and made that alive through the country.  But that is not to be so.  I suggest again that the Minister can make that revelation behind doors to those who then would have the task of indicating that they are satisfied. In connection with railway matters, there are people who will be affected. The trouble about electricity and gas is that there is nobody&mdash;apart from people who represent staff organisations or groups of employees&mdash;except Deputies to represent through the country those of the ordinary people who will suffer by these restrictions, and I hope that before this debate ends the Minister will find it possible to give us something, because so far he has given us nothing, upon which we can found an explanation to the people <Col N="1300" /> who are harassing us with their inquiries as to why exactly these cuts are being made, and whether there is a real necessity for the imposition of these cuts in such a rigorous way at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As was briefly alluded to this afternoon, there is another aspect of this position which is causing anxiety.  While it arises out of the position of the coal supply, it must nevertheless be placed in a special category.  I refer to the position of the staffs arising out of the present situation.  Now, one might expect that at a time like this and in a situation of this particular type the management of the company&mdash;as has happened, I know, in connection with several other industrial concerns, and which I am glad to say is the general tendency in later years when difficulties of this kind arise&mdash;would have brought in the trade union representatives concerned with the particular staffs involved, with a view to having a full and frank discussion of the whole case, so that representations could be made on behalf of these staffs.  The general result, so far as I know, of such full and frank discussions is co-operation between the employees and employers in special cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear, however, that the Great Southern Railways Company decided to take the first step in that direction by calling to the Kingsbridge yesterday a meeting of some 36 trade union representatives, representing the staffs as a whole, as there are about 14,000 men affected by this.  Yet, contrary to the general expectation of all those who attended that meeting, after a certain amount of loose parleying, they were bluntly confronted with the fact that a certain set of specific things would operate as a result of the present situation, and that among these were the suspension of what is known as the guaranteed week&mdash;a very important matter so far as the set-up of railwaymen is concerned&mdash;a reduction of the six-day week in the shops to 4½ days per week, and a further reduction in the case of other members of the staff.  In addition to that, however, <Col N="1301" /> these workers were also to lose their bonuses.  Now, these bonuses operate over a number of grades, and I think that Deputies will best understand the position when I say that the average figure operating over all the grades is 14/- a week.  As an indication of the mentality of the people approaching that situation, their trouble apparently was one of coal supplies, or so we are led to believe, and they immediately asked their employees to sacrifice the bonus in order to meet the special situation arising out of the present emergency.  The management of the company were immediately requested to give an indication, under two or three headings, of what this might mean.  One heading was to give some idea of the number of grades or groups of men who would be affected by these new conditions.  Another was to give the probable period over which this might operate.  And the third was that these proposals might be put in writing.  The manager of the company bluntly refused to put anything into writing.  I understand that the representatives of the staffs kept their heads as best they could in a most unexampled situation and that when, after an adjournment, they renewed their very reasonable request that a set of proposals of that kind might be presented to them in writing, the request was again refused and it was indicated to them that if they did not care to accept that position, then, in the last analysis, there was another resort open to the company, which was to serve each member of the staff with a week's notice and to employ as many of them as the company desired on a day-to-day basis.  I believe that in the long experience of representatives of trades unions who have appeared there from time to time for many years past they have never had an experience of this character before.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, it would appear to me that the Deputy is now moving into a sphere which has nothing to do with the matter that is now before the House. I saw the statement in the newspapers to which the Deputy refers, but that was merely to the effect that no statement would be issued.  That was my <Col N="1302" /> reading of it.  I do not know if any member of the House has any further information on that than I have, but I suggest that there is nobody here who is in a position to reply on behalf of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring before the House the gravity of the situation that may arise as a result of proposals of that character which, as I say, are unprecedented.  I think that that will be appreciated when I say that the over-all wage is 50/- a week for operating men, and they are now to lose one-third of their weekly employment by the loss of their two days and of their standard rate.  I do not want to confuse the House, but I wish to point out that the position of these men is not like that of civil servants. There is no cost-of-living basis, and as a result of this reduction, they will now lose one-third of their standard rate of 50/- a week, amounting to 16/- a week and, in addition to that, they will also lose 14/- a week, which means that the average railway workman will have to maintain himself and his family on a basic rate of 30/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that these proposals are extremely drastic, and the railwaymen will most certainly say that in all the circumstances they are not warranted. I do suggest that if the proper procedure had been adopted at the meeting yesterday, the men would have <Col N="1303" /> been quite prepared to co-operate with the company in seeing what was best to be done.  The management of the company know full well&mdash;just as well as I do&mdash;that the railwaymen's unions are led by, perhaps, the most intelligent set of trade union officials in this country, that they are reasonable men and that, over and above all, they have the confidence of all the members of their unions who have, on previous occasions, when a crisis of this character arose before, shown a full appreciation of the position when it was put before them.  I have no doubt that if the present position were put to them in a proper way they would approach this matter also in a reasonable manner and would consult the members of their unions, but first of all the men must be satisfied of the nature of the causes which have brought this about.  I think it will be acknowledged that, perhaps, no other section of the community can lay claim to a greater share of credit for their preparedness at certain times of political stress in this country to share the burden of the community from a national point of view and, as I say, while they will be prepared to make these sacrifices again, if they are necessary, just the same as any other section of the community, they will be prompted, very naturally, to ask on this occasion whether all the sacrifices to be borne are to be on the side of the railwaymen, engaged, as they are, in an industry which serves the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, in view of the information that is available to me and to my colleagues, that the position arising out of the unhappy meeting yesterday at Kingsbridge, to which I have referred, has left a most embittered impression so far as the leaders are concerned, and before that situation gets worse I ask the Minister, in the interests of transport as a whole and, in particular, may I say, on this occasion, in the interests of the men concerned, to take this situation immediately under his control and away from that unhappy and embittered atmosphere, which surrounded yesterday's meeting, to which I have <Col N="1304" /> referred, and to which, I may say, so far as the trade union leaders are concerned, they are not prepared to return. I do urge the Minister to take that course and to take it promptly. If he does he will create that confidence which is necessary at the moment both among the working railway men and, may I say, amongst the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement what has been said by the Lord Mayor.  It would be necessary for the Minister to develop further what he said in regard to the proceedings yesterday. One of the things one would expect to hear from the Minister would be something along the lines the trade unions were inclined to look for yesterday from the manager of the company.  We only ask now that it has been found necessary so drastically to curtail the railway services whether or not the cut is justified. When you are with people who have given their lives to the railway industry and were inclined to talk intelligently one would want to know the reason that brought about the cut. We are all aware that in the past years we have had as grave a crisis as we have to face now.  And we know that the branch lines were kept going on turf and kept going very well.  It may be that turf is no longer available to the railways for transport purposes but we ought to be told that.  Turf and timber were quite competent to keep the short-distance branch lines running in the past crisis and they should be able to keep the branch lines going now.  If, as is said by the Minister, they have foreseen this coming shortage of fuel there is a very poor reflection of that vision of theirs in the fact that the speed of trains has been maintained in recent times at pre-war speeds and inspectors have been going down the lines and chasing after the goods train drivers to see that they got the last inch and the last ounce out of the engines.  The locomotive men who love their engines and know them like pet animals tell us if they had been given a longer time to make the run they could have saved, probably, 25 per cent. of the fuel.  I, as one who was on the deputation that was present with the <Col N="1305" /> manager of the company, was at one with the other members in asking some of these reasonable questions and in asking the management to see whether it could make a reduction in the speed rather than the closing down of the branch lines and complete dislocation of the services.  We approached this, not alone from the point of view of the men but from the point of view of the citizens generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked then and we are asking now what inquiries have been made by the Minister from the heads of the railway company to satisfy him that there is a need which justifies the drastic slashing of the railway services which is proposed and how is the shortage of fuel related to the reduction, of the services. We cannot speak of what the amounts are.  The Minister must know what the reduction of fuel will amount to and what would be the relation between the reduction of the amount of fuel and the reduction of the services, ignoring the fact that we are no longer burning timber.  We did burn timber very successfully during the crisis which we went through and since then we have learned to knit the dust together with pitch, and if my information is correct there is an abundance of pitch available at Inchicore that would be sufficient to tie up this stuff which could be used very effectively. There is a good store of it there.  All these matters ought to be reasonably inquired into and some information given from reliable sources as to whether or not this reduction of the services 66? per cent. in the case of passenger traffic and 33? per cent. in the case of goods is necessary, and arises from lack of imported fuel, and if everything is being done as it should be done in order that the country would not be precipitated into this crisis.  We are told we are going to have supplementary bus services.  Is that a very happy augury or are we so sure that the petrol will be available?  We are given to understand it is equally difficult to secure the petrol and now are we going to start replacing one service with another service that is equally dependent on outside fuel?  If yesterday's proceedings are anything to go on there were 18 unions <Col N="1306" /> represented which were offering to give full co-operation to the railway company.  They were making a very reasonable request that they should be told the magnitude of the crisis and asked that they should be given the proposals of the company in writing so that they could take them to their unions and all the unions could speak with one voice, and one union would not be bringing back a different version to another.  The attitude of the manager was that he would put nothing in writing.  If you have not the intelligence to understand our proposals you are getting nothing in writing. I can tell the House that that has created a feeling of great bitterness and resentment.  The trade unions are already prepared to co-operate and I repeat the appeal of the Lord Mayor that the Minister would interest himself in the matter, before he drifts into a much more serious situation than only having two trains a week.  Because it is quite possible that we will not have a one-day service if the strained relations continue as they have been following yesterday's meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Deputies in asking the Minister to take industrial users more into his confidence.  It probably is correct to say that to expand the Minister's statement in the House would not be possible.  But surely it should be possible through employers' organisations to inform coal users as to what the position is likely to be in the future.  It is very difficult for an industrialist to reorganise his operations to a situation upon which he has no information whatsoever.  All that we know is that, after a few days of this month, our supplies will stop and then after another few days there will be a review. We were told that we would get the full allowance for this month but, as for the future, until the Minister's statement to-night we had no indication whatever.  Yet we had to dig into such little stocks as we had been allowed to get together and, in the case of one little plant of which I am aware, they had not sufficient fuel to start out next week.  It does not seem to me to be fair of the Department <Col N="1307" /> to expect industrialists to co-operate as they are anxious to co-operate on a basis of that kind. The statement of the Minister is of some assistance, but I hope as soon as possibly may be he will give in confidence, if necessary, such further information as may enable them to organise their business according to the amount of fuel which may be available.  I hope that in any future crises that may arise the Minister will feel that he can rely on full co-operation from industrialists and that he, in his turn, will co-operate with them in providing them with all necessary information.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of fuel there is one class of consumers whose case I should like to bring before the Minister, and that is hospitals.  I am intimately connected with one particular hospital where the position is very serious. The hospital works on steam.  It does not work on electricity, and the authorities there have had to close down the furnaces for several days in the week.  That has meant that vegetables which were normally put in steam presses cannot be prepared. Cooking was carried on in heat storage cookers, but only one out of three is now working.  It cannot take vegetables so that the whole system in that hospital has been very seriously disorganised. The laundry which it ran, as most hospitals do run their own laundries, has had to close down.  The ordinary commercial laundries are not in a position to take on washing from hospitals.  I would ask the Minister therefore specially to consider the position of hospitals and to state at the earliest possible moment what priority they are likely to be granted. I am sure that the Minister will not leave these hospitals in the position in which many of them find themselves now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other question to which I should like to refer.  The Taoiseach some time ago referred to the use that commercial people in Dublin ought to make of the bogs and suggested that they should organise their own tarf <Col N="1308" /> production.  That on the face of it is an excellent idea, but it seems to be almost impossible to arrange for such production.  I would ask the Minister for Supplies to give commercial people more information on that subject. The crux of the situation seems to be that it is impossible to get local labour.  I understand that Dublin in the main is expected to draw its turf supplies from remote western areas so that there is no question of any firm getting any assistance from, or making any use of, its own staff.  I should like the Minister to deal with these two points particularly.</P>

      <P>This Party, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, asked for a statement on this matter from the Government when the House met on Tuesday, and we have at last got that statement.  We desired to secure that statement for the purpose of clarifying the position as we felt that the public are entitled to know what is the exact position.  We felt that some people were very concerned about the situation and that if it were possible to allay their feelings in any way something should be done with that object. On the other hand, quite a large section of the community, we thought, failed to realise the extreme gravity of the situation that the country was facing, and it was well that a clear statement about the situation would be made here in the Dáil so that people would understand what they had to face in the future.  I think that the seriousness of the situation has been brought home to us in a very pathetic way by the statement made here to-night by Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Certainly, one felt that the approach that has been made to the matter so far as certain individuals are concerned was not all that it should be.  The Minister has tried to deny responsibility but certainly the spirit that one would expect in the situation that has to be faced was completely lacking in so far as that interview, so very vividly described by the Deputy, was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I expected to hear from the Minister was what effect the present crisis was likely to have on <Col N="1309" /> production and employment generally. We heard no statement from the Minister in that respect.  The Minister gave no information regarding the future so far as other essential supplies were concerned or whether there was any danger of any deterioration in these supplies.  It appears to me that the Minister and the Government feel that they can rely on the steady inflow of whatever oil and kerosene supplies are available, because we appear to be switching over to buses and putting more buses on the road.  I should like to point out to the Minister that in so far as food production is concerned, we are relying to a very great extent on kerosene and production from the tractor&mdash;I believe very much more than the average person in the country realises or appreciates.  I heard it stated in the debate on the Vote for Agriculture that even if supplies of kerosene were to disappear, if a determined effort were made to organise our agricultural resources, we could still carry on.  I do not think that people who talk in that strain fully realise our position.  I want to say that even if we were to get into a situation like that, if kerosene were completely to disappear as fuel for power on the farm, if it were possible to save the harvest by turning out all the people in the cities and towns to work in the fields, we must still realise that 75 per cent. of our threshing operations are now done with kerosene and that the old steam engine to a very great extent has gone to the scrap heap and cannot be brought back.  The wisdom of relying on future supplies of fuel of that sort and the wisdom of switching over to petrol is a matter calling for serious consideration because whatever imports in the way of petrol and kerosene are likely to arrive in future I understand will be on a tonnage basis, and if the amount of petrol and increased it can only be at the cost of kerosene.  I should like the Minister definitely to bear that in mind and, if necessary, build up some stocks.</P>
    <P>I think in this crisis also, and it is a matter we have adverted to time and time again, the economic aspect of the problem is far more important even than defence.  The real danger that <Col N="1310" /> threatens this country is economic rather than military, and the wisdom of getting in big reserves of petrol and keeping iron rations of coal available for the Army is a matter that should concern this House and the Government.  It might be wiser, in present circumstances, if military lorries and petrol supplies utilised by the Army were made available for production and transport generally. The Minister assured us that, while there would be a drastic reduction in passenger services, the freight trains would not be reduced to the same extent, but some reduction in the cattle-trade service would be necessary. The transport of live stock is a very serious matter.  The Minister may not be aware of the situation which had developed before this crisis occured.  The bottom had practically fallen out of the live-stock trade so far as store cattle were concerned. That was in anticipation of the second front.  A number of cattle dealers were reluctant to purchase cattle in substantial numbers because they were of opinion that, the moment the second front opened, the whole rolling stock of Great Britain would be at the service of the Army and that, for a month, or six weeks, or, perhaps, two months, little or no rolling stock would be available for the transportation of store cattle.  I am one of those who subscribe to that opinion.  That has reacted on the price of store cattle.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it is the intention of the railway company to provide a special train or trains for the big fairs but to reduce the number of wagons.  Where 150 wagons were normally available, that number may be reduced to 100 or 80 wagons. That may have a disastrous effect on the live-stock trade and it may seriously affect the whole economy of the country.  It may place farmers in a position in which they cannot cash their live-stock and, as a corollary, they may not be able to meet their obligations as regards rates and so forth.  If a position of that kind were to develop, it would be very serious. So far as travelling facilities for cattle traders are concerned, if they find it difficult to get around from one fair <Col N="1311" /> to another and if the element of competition disappears, that will react unfavourably on the live-stock industry. I think that the Minister should seriously contemplate the attachment of a passenger coach to the special trains going to fairs.  When wagons are being sent down from kingsbridge to the fair in the country, on the previous night or evening, a passenger coach should be attached to them so as to enable cattle dealers to travel from thecity to the fairs.  If thee is any limitation on the number of wagons for individual dealers.  I am merely calling the attention of the Ministr to the practical aspects of this whole proble and to the likely result of the limitation of the number of wagons available at fairs.  I do not say that the Minister can eliminate all these evils but he should attempt to reduce them to the Minimum.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the necessity for building up stock of fuel for the peak moths of September, October and November for the transportation of grain, truf and later, beet. That is very wise precuation.  He assuered us that the company would be accumulating stock of coal for the sugar-beet campaign period.  The four factrories operate very largely on anthracite. For that reason, the same amount of heat is not required as would be required for drying of pulp. The Minister has stated that it may be necessary to cut out the drying of pulp. Before the Minister made that statement, I thought that there was a possibility of that.  If that be so, it will have very serious reactions on the agricultural industry and, particularly, on dairying. Pulp, in its wet, raw state will not stand storage for any length of time.  In the beet areas, little or no roots are grown.  The agricultural community there rely on the pulp which they get back from the beet delivered to the factories.  This pulp is a very valuable product so fr as the feeding of live stock is concerned.  If we are simply going to produce suger at the factories and throw the pulp out in the <Col N="1312" /> nearest field or bog, it would be far better if we did not grow beet at all. I put down a question to the Minister last week relating to that matter. If the sugar factories cannot operate effectively and send back this byproduct for live-stock purposes, it would be far better for us, as a community, drastically to cut our sugar consumption and permit the people normally engaged in the production of the raw material for sugar to produce some other feeding crop so as to maintain our live-stock industry.   I. have referred to the necessity for utilising to the fullest extent whatever raw material is available for propulsion, particularly in respect of transport.</P>
    <P>I think that quite a number of economies could be effected.  There must be a tremendous switch-over and we must make better use of petrol and other fuels. Quite a lot of petrol is being used, even at present, fey Government inspectors for supervising work.   Superintendents of the Gárda are operating their cars still. Coming down to some of the industries mentioned by the Minister, the bakers are still permitted to operate petrol-driven vans which are seriously overlapping all over the country. That is one matter in respect of which I think the people could service themselves by collecting their own bread. I do not know that it is wise to continue to operate bread-vans on petrol in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Every economy that can be made in that direction ought to be made. Reference has been made to the production arid development of more coal here.   One particular company was organised quite recently to derolop a coal deposit in Carlow.   The Minister for Finance was questioned by Deputy McGilligan on that. The company had to face enormous difficulties and got little or no help from he Government or the Department. They were not looking for capital and lad the financial resources to carry in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They got just a normal ation of petrol for the month and ere not able to get sufficient supplies <Col N="1313" /> of petrol to keep the engine going to pump our the water, which was hampering operations.  Surely, the wisdom of providing a supply of petrol to keep ofwater out of the mines is obvious, if we are likely to get any coal out of the mines.  The company has risked its own capital in the developement of a miue and looked for no State assistance, good, bad or indifferent.  All they wanted was this petrol and one or two other things.  Representations were made by the company, and by me personaly on its behalf, to the Department, but there seemed to be no sympathy whatever so far as the Department was concerned.  In matters of that sort, surely every effort should be made, nothwithstanding the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties of rationing, to the various industries and to transport generally, the small supplies of petrol avilable.  At the same time, in developing a mine that is to to productive of valuable coal and authractive, every effort should be made to provide the necessary supply of petrol to keep an engine going which is keeping the water pumped out.  If there is failure to keep the water pumped up, that is the end of the effort and the mine must be shut down.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give some further information to the House as to what the position in rgard to kerosene and petrol supplies will be, particularly in regard to kerosene for food production.  I assure the Minister and the Taoiseach that, if there is any failure in that respect, I would be afraid to contemplate the situation which will develop in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the discussion to-night and the suggestions from different sides of the House will do a certain amount of good.  There is one point which no Deputy has touched so far.  We know well the cause of the shortage.  We know that there is no use in blaming the railway company, which is doing its best; neither is there any use in blaming the Department of supplies.  There is, however, one suggestion I would offer to the Minister.  To certain extent, <Col N="1314" /> I do no think we in this country shoudl be terribly worried about the situation.  When anything unusual at all crops up, there is often a tendency in this House to view it with alarm.  I often ask myself if it does good to view such things with alarm.</P>
      <P>The suggestion I put to the Minister is that he is in a very sound position. He could almost tell some people who are more or less responsible for our difficulties: &ldquo;We are of a certain advantage to you.&rdquo;  He is in a great position to hammer a good bargin. That is the line on which this could be appriached and that is the suggestion I make from this side of the House.  There is no use in going bagging and there is no suggestion that we should do that.  There is an element of worry, and people say there is need for us to beg.  I want the Minister to take different view and to tell people that, if they place us in an awkward position by adopting a certain attitude tothis country, we may be able to make the position just as bad for them in another direction. If certain things that we need are curtailed unnecessarily from us by other people, we may ne able to curtail things that they need.</P>
      <P>I know quite well that, as regard trying to save supplies of coal for the beet factories and also supplied of kerosene, suggesions have been forthcoming from all parts of the House and I expect the Minister will take them into consideration.  I ask the Minister to take my suggestion seriously.  As far as he is concerned, we in this country have a trump card left in our hands.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Hughes, regarding the carriage of passengers on trucks going out for cattle, perhaps the Minister would consider allowing hackney cars a mileage of 100 miles instead of the present 500 miles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other speakers in telling the Ministr that there is considerable <Col N="1315" /> amount of anxiety and uneasiness amongst the citizens regarding the uncertain position in which we find ourselves, owing to the restrictions which have developed in the past few weeks. A good deal of that anxiety is due to the absence of a statement, such as we have had here this evening.</P>
      <P>I think every member of this House fully appreciates the responsibility lying on the Minister and the Government and the great task they have in trying to carry on during the present emergency.   The railway position, which has been reviewed here by Deputy 0'Sullivain and others, is a very serious one. I can quite appreciate the Minister's point of view, when he says that no member of the Government has direct responsibility; but surely when a crisis is threatened as at present, the responsibility must be on the Government and on the Minister to take action to try to prevent the position being worsened.</P>
      <P>In the usual way, in regard to industrial disputes, the Minister does not act until both sides come together and ask for his intervention.  The House could suggest to the Minister that, having regard to what took place last night, when representatives of the various trade unions were brought together and the position was outlined to them verbally, it is a very reasonable request that these proposals or suggestions should be put -to them in writing. It is usual in the case of a man getting notice and ought to be the case when a nimber of men are being restricted in the way suggested. I think a refusal would be very discourteous, having regard to the danger of precipitating a very serious position, which is now threatened.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to make some move to-morrow to have the position explained to the men affected, and, if possible, have some alternative put up to the present proposals. Can the Minister say if the milk supply to the City of Dublin will be affected by the restricted railway service?</P>

      <P>If it appears that the Minister has said all that he thinks it is prudent to say in the exising situation and if Deputies have made such contributions as they thought could be helpful, inasmuch as the principle channel for information to the people of the country is the Press, would it not be wise for the Minister to summon the editors of the four principal dailes to a press conference with himself, to speak to them perfectly frankly and openly, seeking their co-operation in getting communicated to the people at large the position as it is and as it is necessary for them to understand it, in the confidence that the camaraderie of the Press in the special circumstances in which we find ourselves will be content to take a leaf from the four dailies in the knowledge that they enjoy the Minister's full confidence and understand what is best in the public interest to polish for the present in any case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for intervening in this debate is due to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a statement which affects a town in which I am the chairman of the local public authority.  He referred to the closing of the branch line between Portlaoghise-Mountmellick, and said that the existing bus service there was considered sufficient. I want to tell the Minister that there was never a bus service between these towns.  I would like him to make the Deputies representing Laoighis-Offaly may understand what he means.  My honest opinion is that the GReat Southern Railways Company have for some years past been conidering the closing down of a number of branch lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that this is a restricted motion dealing with a particular matter, and that he cannot go into the general question of railway management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to railway management, but wanted to a make a suggestion to the Minister.  The pas- <Col N="1317" /> senger service between Portlaoighise-Mountmellick was never very good, but the service for the carriage of goods and live stock was exceptionally good. The times are difficult and the people there are prepared to bear their share of the difficulties.  The request that I make on their behalf is for a goods train service in the district.  I pointed out to the Minister before that this branch line was to be closed down some years ago.  I am of opinion that the railway company are just taking advantage of the emergency to dispense with the services of a number of their employees.  They are using the fuel situation as a cloak for that purpose. At Question Time to-day the Minister was not prepared to disclose to the House, or to me, the amount of Irish coal that is being used by the railway company concerned.  I wonder would the Minister be prepared to give the information to a Deputy in confidence. If he were, the Deputy might be able to get information for the Minister which would be helpful to him in the discharge of his duties as Minister &mdash; information that might throw some light on the rail services in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these branch railway lines run through bogs.  Surely it should be possible to operate a train service with fuel from the bog.  About 18 months ago the passenger train service between Portlaoighise-Mountmellick was run on turf and timber. The company concerned is using the weapon to-day that there is no coal, and that, therefore, they cannot provide a train service.  I am of opinion that they could by using fuel from the bogs.  The plea of no coal should not be accepted for the closing down of the branch line that I am interested in.  If it is a question of providing fuel locally for the maintenance of a rail service, then we will see that it is provided.  Therefore, the company should leave us at least two or three trains a week.  What excuse can they have for not doing so if we provide the fuel?  I think that the Minister should make strong representations to the company to maintain rail services in areas where turf fuel is available. The Minister is familiar with the conditions <Col N="1318" /> that prevail in Mountmellick. Some two years ago he showed a sympathetic consideration for that town in view of the fact that an important local industry was being closed down.  We have a bacon factory there that will be seriously affected by this proposal, and also, of course, the employees. The train from Portlaoighise to Mountmellick runs through the centre of a bog.  It would be a strange thing if there was not enough fuel there to maintain a train service.</P>
    <P>The Minister appealed to Deputies to help in the fuel drive.  We all realise the necessity for the production of more turf.  Would the Minister make representations to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, especially where the work is being carried out by the county councils, to see that the conditions in the bogs are improved and that those employed on turf production get a decent living wage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Daniel McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages paid have a very grave effect on turf production. I might also mention that the area I come from is one of the best beet-growing districts in the country.  How is the beet going to be handled if there is no railway service?  The buses could not take it, or deal with the traffic from the bacon factory either.  We want a goods train service between Portlaoighise and Mountmellick to get in goods for the traders of the town. We are not concerned at all about the passenger service.  From the information at my disposal, which I shall disclose at a later date, I am satisfied that the company concerned are only using this emergency as a means for closing down the branch lines, which will never be reopened, and of getting rid of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the middle of Deputy Flanagan's peroration he did suggest one thing of value, and that was that if it is possible at any time, where branch lines have been closed down, to restore at least a skeleton service, that should be done.  Everybody knows that <Col N="1319" /> on those branch lines, to a great extent, the passenger service had more or less died out.  I am speaking now of normal times, when people did not bother very much about the branch lines because they had other facilities from the point of view of being conveyed from place to place.  But certainly a great amount of the goods traffic was carried over those branch lines and, if it is at all possible, the Minister should use his influence with the railways company to see that those branch lines are kept going for the transport of goods.</P>
      <P>As regards one or two of the branch lines he mentioned, I would like him to give more details with regard to the diversion of bus services he mentioned. If he indicated the intentions of the railways company with reference to the diversion of bus services, he would allay a lot of uneasiness.  In one case, if the buses have to be diverted to meet the existing situation, the nearest bus would be 14 miles away, and that would be the Cork-Limerick bus.  That must mean the opening of a new service.  The other service any way near the Banteer-Newmarket line is the Cork-Killarney bus.  I am merely suggesting that the details of the proposed services should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was tempted to intervene when the Minister made an interjection during Deputy M. O'Sullivan's speech.  The Minister suggested that he had no responsibility in the matter to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred.  Having no information about the position of the railways company or their dealings with the trade unions I must say that the case made by Deputy O'Sullivan seemed very reasonable.  It was presented in a very earnest manner and it impressed me.  Whether the Minister has or has not responsibility, it is perfectly obvious the request made to him by Deputy O'Sullivan, to take on himself immediately the responsibility of dealing with that matter, was a very reasonable one and the Minister should accede to it.  I could see underlying Deputy O'Sullivan's speech his fear that things might develop in a rather serious manner.  Even if the Minister has no legal responsibility, he has at <Col N="1320" /> least this responsibility, that anything that will in the slightest way embarrass the transport situation and that could be avoided by action on his part, should be so avoided.  He should without any further delay take such action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the possibility of utilising our petrol in a better manner.  He referred to bread vans and I suggest that where such vans are allowed for essential services, it is utterly ridiculous to have them travelling 40 or 50 miles from a town or city to supply bread in an area where already there are bakeries quite capable of supplying that particular area.  I suggest that the areas in which those vans operate should be restricted. A particular area should be supplied with bread from particular towns and villages.  A bread van ought not to be allowed to travel 40 or 50 miles to a district, where possibly it would meet another bread van which had travelled the same distance from another direction.</P>
    <P>I have one case in mind where such a ridiculous position exists.  A contract was entered into by a local authority for the supply of bread to a hospital. That bread came from a bakery 18 miles away.  The van travelled there twice a week.  I suggest there was a waste of petrol in that case, with a van travelling 36 miles twice a week to bring bread that could easily be supplied locally.  Local authorities ought to be compelled to get their bread supplies in an area where they could be brought by a boy on a bicycle.</P>
    <P>On the question of the development of our native coal resources, the Minister is not very optimistic.  Apparently the fact that he has not sufficient skilled labour is one of the reasons for not having increased production.  I do not think the Minister is quite honest in his dealings over our native coal resources.  Five years ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked in the House to examine the possibilities of the North Cork and Limerick coalfields.  Apparently a survey had been made some years ago. The reply I got from the Department <Col N="1321" /> was that their experts had investigated the position and they were satisfied that it was not a practical proposition to attempt to reopen those mines. Deputy Anthony and, I am sure, Deputy Looney, know the mines to which I am referring.  They are old shafts.</P>
    <P>It may have been perfectly true that it was not a practical proposition to reopen them, but an extraordinary thing happened.  A local friendly and provident society was formed between the county council elections of 1942 and the General Election of 1943 and very great interest was taken in the mines by the local Fianna Fáil Deputy, who is now an ex-Deputy. Before the 1943 General Election a sum of £200 was given for the purpose of prospecting down there, and the company was allowed to dig up fields and make things like drains along them.  That was not worth doing six years ago, but apparently it was worth doing last year.  The Department may since have discovered that there was some value in the coalfields.  I should like to know did the spending of the £200 indicate to them that there is a possibility of doing anything there?</P>
    <P>As regards labour, there may not be much skilled labour, but the material is there to be trained.  There are some middle-aged men there who have experience of working mines, because they went to England and Wales in the last war and worked in mines there and they can be regarded as trained men.  I do not know if there is a possibility of getting coal out of that area, but I am aware that the local people are finding the outcrops very useful. The type of stuff they can get can be made very useful.  I had some of it dug out myself and I may say that for household purposes it is a very satisfactory type of fuel to use.  It makes a very good fire.  I do not want to sound unduly optimistic, and I do not want to encourage the Minister to be too optimistic about it.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are members of a Cork local authority will have to admit that the Cork County Council have had to close down work on bogs because they cannot get labour.  There are two <Col N="1322" /> reasons.  One is that there is a scarcity of farm and turf labour.  The other is that the local authority is not able to compete in the matter of wages with the private producer.  What have the local authorities to contend with this year?  A sleansman will get from a private producer 12/- a day, his food and a pint&mdash;if I might put it that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, by the day.  The local authority cannot compete and it means that the most skilled sleansman will go to work for the farmers, people in towns or the owners of lorries who have gone into the private end of turf production.  The county council are in the position that they will find themselves without the best skilled men and there will be a great falling off, to my mind, in the production of turf by the local authorities in County Cork.</P>
      <P>I also think that the Taoiseach, on the information he received during his visit to Killarney in connection with the more food and more fuel meeting some time ago, must be satisfied that the deputy surveyors in Kerry are of the same opinion, that for the same reasons they will not be able to produce in Kerry the amount of turf they are expected to produce by the State. That is one great difficulty.  I have examined it very closely for the past month and I am satisfied that one of the most serious situations we are faced with, apart from the question of coal, is a danger of a great shortage of turf in the coming season.  We are not expanding our turf production for these reasons, and I think the Minister ought not to be optimistic and ought to take every possible step to encourage the production of turf.  It looks to be a great year for turf, so far as the weather is concerned, but the season is getting later and later, and I am sure that Deputies and the local authorities in Cork can bear me out in what I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> I suggest to Deputies like Deputy Flanagan that there is not an area in this country or a Deputy who could not make a case for a particular district that some type of production would give them a special claim in connection with transport facilities. Deputy Donnellan could argue for Galway on beet as well as Deputy Flanagan can for Mountmellick.  I could argue on other items.  It is obvious that, if we are to deal with this thing from a broad point of view, there is no good in looking for special facilities for certain districts, because it cannot be done.  It will be up to the Minister, as he suggested, to see that production in industry is divided.  To my mind, it might not be a bad idea if production in agriculture were divided up into areas so that the growing of wheat next year, if the emergency lasts so long, should be concentrated in the areas where the land is rich and could produce wheat and the farmers in these areas compelled to grow all the wheat possible.</P>
    <P>I would also, in conclusion, say to the Minister that I assume he has not any more information to give than he gave us originally.  But I put this point to the Minister, and I think every Deputy will agree with me that this is our difficulty.  People will ask us to-morrow or the day after: &ldquo;Why is there this curtailment of the services?&rdquo; Our answer to that will be: &ldquo;You have seen the Minister's explanation and that is all we know.&rdquo; We will then be asked: &ldquo;If such-and-such was the position two months ago, what is the position to-day?&rdquo; Am I entitled to say that the Minister would prefer, and that it is in the public interest at the moment, not to give detailed figures of imports or of production or anything else like that; that I would be justified in saying that the Minister felt he would not be justified in giving detailed figures of imports? If that is the position, that satisfies me, but the difficulty we will be in allaying public uneasiness is that people will expect us to know all the details even though the Minister may be entitled to withhold them.  I am satisfied with what the Minister says, <Col N="1324" /> that he has no more information to give.  But I should like to get from him the statement that he would prefer not to go into details and figures of the real position as it would appear, say, for three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he has the right to ruin this country, if we are to judge by the way he is dealing with this question during this crisis.  Even last night at a late hour I came to him to ask him to see if he could not conciliate the two sides.  Is that true or not?  But let us go back.  We were invited there by a verbal and also by <Col N="1325" /> a written message to go and meet the manager.  Who was the manager we met?  The works manager.  But the man behind the scenes, where was he? Where was this gentleman who has manipulated the transport arrangements of this country with a view to stock exchange speculation?  He was not available.  Anyway the man we met was the technical man with whom for 30 years we have had good relations. He made a statement, but he did not think he should be asked the question: &ldquo;Will you put your statement in writing so that we, as representing the unions, can go back to our members and explain the matter.&rdquo; We argued for three hours with him. I ask Deputies was that a reasonable submission, that instead of having an oral statement from a man who was speaking about a matter dealing with the life of this country industrially and commercially we should ask the man that question?  Surely it was a right and proper question, because we wanted to go to our own men, either in mass meeting or local meeting or in group meeting or individually, and explain the need for the change.  We could not get anything after several hours' deliberation, only a verbal statement.  We asked him to retire while we went into a huddle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We chose a man to speak for us who represents one of the most important sections of industry in this country&mdash; Mr. O'Farrell&mdash;and, to my surprise, instead of being treated as a representative man he was treated almost as if he were of no account.  Everybody knows that Mr. O'Farrell has a different temperament from mine&mdash; altogether different.  But even Mr. O'Farrell was roused by the way he was treated.  Surely a man representing a great company, with some 11,000 employees, has a right to approach a question like that in a decent and courteous manner.  The lie was given, the same as the Minister gave to me to-night, to a man who was speaking authoritatively.  He only said: &ldquo;We would be glad if you would reduce to writing the submission of your company; we will take it back with promptitude and will bring you an answer as soon as possible as to how far we can associate <Col N="1326" /> ourselves with you in this crisis.&rdquo;  But no, we were to agree to break down conditions that have been recognised for a long time without going out and discussing the matter.  We were to give an undertaking to go to the unions, to men who have got responsible positions, and say: &ldquo;Your conditions are no longer to be your conditions of to-day; you will have to do as we tell you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We spoke to that gentleman kindly, knowing him intimately as we did. But, all the time, he had another gentleman beside him who was telling him what to say.  I thought the matter was very serious, knowing how difficult it is to achieve anything when a certain attitude is taken by people, as it is hard to control them.  Therefore, in the interests of the company, I came here late last night, and went up to the Ministerial Bench and asked the Minister would he use his good offices to bring both parties together immediately. Since that time I have been trying to adjust myself to certain happenings which are taking place every hour.  We were told that there is a 25 per cent. reduction in fuel supplies&mdash; not coal supplies, because coal is a variable quantity.  We asked was it a matter of bituminous coal; was it a question of slush, a question of timber or a question of turf.  We had a practical driver there to give to Mr. Bredon, the manager, the details of running from one point to another, the amount of steam necessary and the amount of fuel required.  We had the men who run the railways before him and we asked why, if there was a decrease of 25 per cent. in supplies of fuel, the services for passengers were being reduced by 66 per cent. and, for freight, by 33? per cent.  We asked what was the logic of that and what they wanted of us.  We were told: &ldquo;We want you to give up the guaranteed week; we want the conciliation grades to go upon four days and we want the shopmen to go upon four and a half days.  We also want you to give up your bonus.&rdquo;  Is that not a nice proposition for 17,000 men to face? And when we come and ask the Government to take an immediate stand <Col N="1327" /> so as to help us to adjust our relations with this company, we are met with the statement that we are liars, but there is a place to which we can take this matter where we will not be told we are lying, but where everybody will be behind us and say that what we state is the truth.  It is time the truth was told.</P>
    <P>With regard to fuel supplies, I was foolish enough to write recently to the Minister about a hold-up on the canal. I notice in the official records that the Minister, in reply to a question, said that 29 Government barges had been constructed, the average cost of which was £1,042 and that 13 barges were not at the moment in use.  I merely say that I will take anybody up to the Grand Canal at James's Street Harbour and, if there are not 17 boats tied up there, I will eat the boats.  I told the Minister the exact position, that boats go down to Turraun with a captain and crew of two, spending 14 days on the passage and the captain gets £4 10s. 0d. while the Grand Canal Company gets £6 5s. 0d. in tolls for the trip.  The locks have to be opened 14 times.  The man who delivers the cargo, who works from 5 o'clock in the morning until late at night for the whole of the ten days, with three days' lying up and a day turning around and making for Turraun again, gets £4 10s. 0d. as against the £6 odd which this kindly, generous company, this philanthropic concern, gets.  Worse than that, the man who does three trips from Carbury in County Kildare, a 30-mile journey by water, gets £4 10s. 0d. as captain, the other man getting £3 per week for working a 16-hour day, while the Grand Canal Company gets £18 in tolls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come to the matter of coal.  I say that the landings of coal in the past month are normal and I challenge contradiction of that statement.  I believe, however, that they could be above normal, if only we had a sense of our responsibilities. I suggest that the Minister should take some of the important men in the trade into consultation&mdash;men in Fuel Importers, Limited, such as Carroll, Mackenzie or some of the others&mdash;and ask them what can be done, outside the ordinary Government activity, to get certain supplies of coal.  I know that two years ago during a crisis coal was available in Scottish ports almost free for shipment, no permit being required, but no bottoms could be got.  In other words, no steamers or sailing ships could be got, but they could have been got if only&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a detail of administration of two years ago and has already been debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the immediate past.  I say that the landings of the past week have been normal, and I challenge contradiction by anybody&mdash;civil servant, executive, or anybody else.  I further say that, if that is true, then there must also be a certain amount of coal in reserve in certain places which can be got at.  It may not be available in large quantities.  Six thousand tons of fuel per week are required to keep the Great Southern Railways working, and, if as stated by officials of the Government, two tons of turf are equal to <Col N="1329" /> one ton of coal, which is not true, as a greater quantity of turf is required, it means that 8,000 tons in all are required under the present arrangement. I say that there are 6,000 tons of pressed fuel in Dublin, which is a good fuel for firing and getting up steam, which could be released.  It is lying now in reserve.  There is also bituminous coal in this city, to the extent of at least 1,000 tons and there is slush, which can be made into ovoids, to the amount of 2,800 tons.  There is also the fact, which cannot be disputed, that turf and timber could be used on the railway branch lines to fire the boilers, and that the speed of the trains could be slowed down to 30 or 25 miles an hour, a speed which does not require the same power as a speed of 50 or 60 miles an hour.  It might involve a longer time in getting to Cork, which sometimes might be a blessing, or longer to get to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>A journey of six hours, instead of four hours, would not make very much difference.  I say there is sufficient fuel at present to keep working normally and, in the meantime, we could look at what our reserves are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose the Chair will challenge me when I say that coke might be classified as coal.  I suggested the other day that there was available open-hearth coke, from which gas can be made.  I suggest that that be taken over, and in return for handling over that coke, we get the ordinary coke from the present system of gas production.  Gas cannot be made out of the coke produced in the gas works, but it can be produced from open-hearth coke, and I suggest that that coke be taken under control. It merely means the exchange of a white dog for a black monkey but, as a result, we have more gas.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he proposed to put his foot down and to stop black-marketing in the supply of gas. It should have been done at least four years ago.  With regard to the train services, I suggest to the Minister that the open and determined attempt on the part of the Great Southern Railways <Col N="1330" /> management to disrupt the services of the railways by a challenge to the men who run the railways is a matter to which the Government should put a stop at once.</P>
    <P>Why not, as an emergency measure, take over the Great Southern Railways Company and, in fact, all the transport services in the Twenty-Six Counties? Some time, I suppose, we will be able to take over these services for the 32 Counties, but, in the meantime, we have Twenty-Six Counties, so why not let the Government take over these utility undertakings, such as gas, railways, general transport, and so on?  I can assure the Government that there are plenty of men who will do the work well when they know they are working for the nation, but if they feel that they are only working for grafters, speculators and profiteers, they will demand their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>My friend on the left here referred to fuel, but what has happened?  An advertisement appeared in the newspapers a few days ago asking for skilled labour to win turf.  Of course, a sleansman might be called a skilled worker, or men engaged in a particular type of work on the bog, but surely in the case of a barrow-man, any ordinary labourer could do that work.  The point is that you have something like 20,000 able-bodied men in Dublin looking for work, and yet you have an advertisement inserted in the papers asking men to come up from Mayo to cut turf on the banks at Glencree.  I spoke to some of these men and asked them why they came up here to do work that could be done by plenty of men who are now unemployed in Dublin, as I was informed that there was plenty of work down there in their own county for these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If these men were to go back to Mayo it may be suggested that they will be occupying seats on the trains which might be required for other people, but the fact is that they are occupying seats on the buses in Dublin every day to within two miles of the bog-face.  I do not want to see these men walking the roads of their own county, but there is work for them to do there.  What is the reason for bringing them up here when we have so many idle men ourselves? Sleansmen are offered £3 a week, and barrow-men £2 a week.  Let the Government offer sleansmen £3 a week and barrow-men £2 a week for working in their own area, and then we will go out in Dublin and cut our own turf. We want to organise this matter in our own way in the interests of the city.  I say that these matters to which I have applied myself are matters of deep concern not only to the members of this House but to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties, and if there is going to be a crisis, then let us all face up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice spoke last night of the magnificent rally of the L.S.F. and other such organisations, and said that they were a credit to the nation and had done all that was needed.  Is it to be thought that the <Col N="1332" /> citizens of this country, in general, will not be willing and glad to do all that they can in this emergency? There are three ships laid up in Dun Laoghaire Harbour because of the stupidity of certain individuals who get up and say that they will do what they like with their own ships&mdash;our ships&mdash;and yet we have men stating here that this is a democracy and that they are giving full and ample awards to the men who go down to the sea in ships.  Why be such hypocrites?  These men are faced with as many dangers and as great hardships as any other seamen are faced with, and yet, when they ask for the right to live, some pettifogging gentleman says: &ldquo;No, you will have to do what we say; these are our ships and we will do what we like with them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intervene very much in this debate, but I have been requested by clergymen and other citizens in the Ballaghaderreen area, and other people interested in the County Roscommon area, to see if anything could be done to prevent the closing down of the Ballaghaderreen-Kilfree line.  The people there fully realise the seriousness of the present position.  They realise that it is impossible for the <Col N="1333" /> Minister and the company concerned to meet each and every demand that is made on them and, in view of the serious situation resulting from the shortage of coal, we should be slow to ask them to do something unreasonable. We say, on our part, that we will make every effort to secure sufficient turf in the district, and we will give the railway company an assurance that sufficient turf will be produced and made available locally for at least a limited service.  I think everybody will realise the serious situation that would result from the closing down of this line.  Ballaghaderreen has been noted for its very fine fairs and for its very fine business, and while I might admit that the passenger traffic there has not been a paying proposition for some years, I think that, undoubtedly, the amount of goods traffic going into Ballaghaderreen has been a very big asset to the railway company as long as I can remember.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the matter that I should like to deal with is the loss of employment that would be caused to a number of railway officials if this line is closed down.  A great many of these people have taken up residences there with their families, and it would be a great hardship on them if there should be any change.  A great many aspects of the situation have already been dealt with and I do not wish to delay the House further than to urge as strongly as I can upon the Minister the desirability of keeping even a partial service on this line.  I can assure the Minister and the railway company that the traders of Ballaghaderreen and the farmers surrounding it will do everything possible to secure that sufficient turf is provided for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One point to which nobody has adverted in the course of the discussion is the question of priorities in connection with passenger traffic.  I am sure that numerous Deputies have been approached by people who want to know what possibility there is of securing priority and whether certain kinds of business will get priority.  I think the Minister ought to make an authoritative statement <Col N="1334" /> on that matter.  It may be that the company have not yet decided what classes of people are to receive priority in travelling by bus or train, or in what order priority is to be given, but the situation at the moment is that whoever books first gets first preference.  It could happen that numerous selfish people, if they might be so described, who would be going on holidays or travelling for amusement, might be able to get accommodation while, at the same time, a large number of people who found it necessary to travel on essential business could not secure travelling facilities. It is hardly necessary to enumerate the various classes for whom accommodation should be provided, but I am sure the Minister appreciates that certain sections should receive first consideration.  I do not know what system the railway company is going to adopt and this is hardly the place to deal with the matter in detail as one suggestion might be as good as another.  At the present time, however, numerous people are in a state of frustration of mind as to the situation.  The Minister admitted yesterday that if a man travels from one portion of the country next week there is no guarantee that he will be able to get back at the time he wants.  It may be that the grave situation existing at present precludes any definite assurance being given in the matter, but it should be possible for people who have to travel on essential business to get back again when that business is concluded, otherwise serious dislocations of one kind or another may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the statements on the railway situation which we have heard here tonight, accepting what Deputy O'Sullivan has said and accepting, on the other hand, the Minister's reply, it is manifest to everyone that if a situation is developing or is likely to develop in which there will be acute disagreement and a certain amount of passion aroused between the workers and the management of the railway company, the result for the general community will be unfortunate.  I am sure the company and employees must realise that they are only a section <Col N="1335" /> of the community, that this is a national problem and that the sooner it is settled in an amicable fashion the better it will be for themselves and the country.</P>

There was a discussion to-day on the report that came to the House from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and it was decided to refer the matter to a committee of the Leaders of all Parties in the House.  That committee has since met and I should like to read out its findings:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It was agreed that a time limit of 30 minutes for the leading speaker of each Party and 20 minutes for others be agreed to between Parties up to the end of May.</P>
      <P>(2)  It was also decided to sit on Tuesdays and Wednesdays of each week from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. up to the end of May.</P>
      <P>(3)  Both decisions to be reconsidered by the Party Leaders at the end of May.</P>
      <P>I propose this voluntary agreement for the acceptance of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to have been agreement amongst most of the <Col N="1338" /> Deputies who spoke that this discussion on our fuel problems was useful. I hope that time will justify that conclusion. I am very doubtful if it is going to prove as useful as some Deputies suggested.  I think it is necessary that we should deal with realities and realities only in such matters. Them eluctance of many Deputies to face realities and their apparent willingness to delude themselves as to the facts is going to be a new problem for this House in dealing with the conditions that will undoubtedly emerge for our consideration in the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that all the misstatements made in the course of the debate were due to lack of knowledge or that every speaker had concern only for helping the country over its difficulties.  However, to confine ourselves to the immediate problem with which the original notice of motion dealt, I want Deputies to appreciate that the restrictions which have been imposed upon the use of coal for transport, gas production, electricity production, industrial production, or any other purpose have been occasioned by the realities of the situation&mdash;realities out of which Deputies can neither talk themselves nor shout themselves.  I do not think that the advent of these exceptional fuel difficulties came, as was suggested, as a surprise or a shock to the people.  Not merely has the possibility of rapid accentuation of our fuel difficulties existed at all times for a few years past, not merely has that been emphasised by Government spokesmen on all suitable occasions during that period but, as recently as the 1st March, I went specially to the Dublin Broadcasting Station to talk about fuel and to draw public attention to the fact that our available supplies of coal were barely sufficient for the maintenance of our essential services and industries.  I pointed out that the possibility of curtailment could not be ignored and that this was bound to mean serious inroads upon the supply of essential services and goods which could be made available for our people.  I do not think that there was any attempt to keep the <Col N="1339" /> public from knowing the facts of the situation in so far as a reliable statement of the facts could be given.</P>
    <P>Nobody here&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;&mdash;can say what the fuel position will be in the future.  We know what it was in recent weeks. We know the supplies that are available now, but nobody can plan a fuel utilisation programme for many months ahead.  Yet, if we are to meet the requirements of essential services and industries, we must attempt to do that without definite knowledge of the quantity of fuel that will be available. The public were told of the possibility of the advent of new fuel difficulties. They were told when these fuel difficulties did emerge.  They were told what measures had been taken to secure the conservation of coal and other fuels.  They were given ample advice as to how they should co-operate in any such scheme of conservation and, at all stages since this matter developed through the Press and by other means, the public were as fully informed as they could be of what the situation was and what measures to deal with it were being taken.  Deputy Dillon says that I should have met the editors of the newspapers.  I met the political correspondents of the newspapers and discussed the position fully with them and I must say that we have got from the newspapers a great deal of cooperation in bringing the facts to the notice of the public.  I do not know what purpose there is in suggesting that attempts have been made to withhold from the public information that it should have.  So far as I am aware, there was no such attempt.  On the contrary, our whole aim in recent weeks has been to get the maximum of publicity for the situation and to have its gravity appreciated, so that the public would understand what they have to face.  I fully appreciate that it is only by taking the public into one's confidence in these matters that one can get them to stand up to whatever inconveniences and hardships are involved.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to do to get <Col N="1340" /> Deputy Hughes down to earth.  He tells us of the hardships that will arise if coal cannot be given for this, paraffin for that, and petrol for something else.  We all know of the hardships that will be involved if supplies of these commodities cannot be made available for different purposes, but complaining about these matters will not make supplies available.  We have got to deal with realities.  If we cannot get kerosene for agricultural purposes, we must try to do without kerosene. All the available kerosene in our hands now, or which may become available in a month or two, will be reserved for agricultural use.  But if we got no more kerosene, we cannot do anything more about it, and Deputy Hughes' telling us of the difficulties which will be created is not going to help us to get supplies any more than the problems of the farmers in the beet growing areas who will be unable to get dried pulp if we cannot give the sugar factories coal to dry the pulp can be solved by deploring the situation in the manner which Deputy Hughes did.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the desire of Deputies for reliable information.  I myself should like to have reliable information. Deputy Hughes complained that I did not give statistics of the extent to which employment and production will be affected by the curtailment of supplies.  I should love to have statistics&mdash;reliable statistics&mdash;as to the extent to which employment and production will be affected by the curtailment of supplies.  But I have not got them.  It would be impossible for anybody to have them.  I doubt if anyone could say more than that employment and production will be adversely affected by the curtailment of our coal supplies.  We shall make the coal supplies at our disposal available to industries in proportion to their essentiality. We shall encourage managers to make the best use of that coal; to supplement it where possible with other fuels or to do without fuel, if possible.  We shall give the best expert advice available to those concerned to assist them in getting over the difficulties which the short supply <Col N="1341" /> of fuel will cause, but to what extent they will succeed in getting over those difficulties by our advice or with our co-operation nobody can say.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of railway services will, of course, affect all commercial interests.  I should like to assure the House that there would be no curtailment of railway services if it could be avoided.  References were made here to a conference which was, apparently, held yesterday between the management of the Great Southern Railways Company and the unions representing its employees.  I pointed out when the first reference to that matter was made that the details of management of the Great Southern Railways Company, the precise method by which it conducts negotiations with representatives of its employees or the agreements which it makes with the representatives of its employees are not a Government responsibility and that nobody here can be held accountable for them.  We know from a statement which appeared in the Press that a conference was held and that it was agreed, according to the announcement, that no statement should be published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To my knowledge, the first breach of that undertaking was not made by the railway company. I do not know what purpose either Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Larkin thinks he is serving by making <i>ex parte</i> statements as to the course of events at that conference, which statements cannot be contradicted or amplified or corrected by anybody here, because the company is not represented here and no ordinary Deputy can have information as to what did happen at that conference or to what extent the account of what is supposed to have occurred is accurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely concerned with securing that we realise what we are doing and where we are going. Several Deputies suggested that, if there is likely to be bad feeling between the company and its employees, it is my duty, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to intervene. I have often intervened in trade disputes for the purpose of negotiating a settlement, at the request of the parties concerned; but if conferences held for that purpose are to be subjected to <i>ex parte</i> speeches in this House subsequently, intervention of that kind will be of very little value. In these matters, the Dáil should confine itself to its own business and it is no part of its business to interfere in the details of management of the Great Southern Railways or in the course of negotiations, affecting the employment of its workers, between its management and the trade unions concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the present position is in that matter I do not know.  If a situation should arise where my intervention would appear to be of value, then my intervention will be given.  It will not be given very gladly, because I know how time-absorbing these conferences can be and I personally, on account of my other duties at present, cannot give the time which I often had to give, in more peaceful circumstances, to the settlement of trade disputes.  I would like to make it quite clear that such intervention cannot be of value&mdash; and, not being of value, will not be given&mdash;if there is always the possibility that statements made at private gatherings of that kind and made for the purpose of effecting a settlement&mdash; suggestions thrown out to see how far they may be accepted or rejected&mdash;can subsequently be the subject of political orations in the Dáil or outside. Deputies who are also officials of trade unions will have to keep their functions, if not distinetly separate, at any rate, in such separate compartments <Col N="1343" /> that they will not necessarily overlap to the detriment of either one or the other.</P>
    <P>There were, however, statements made by Deputy Keyes and some of the statements made by Deputy Larkin, which appeared to suggest that the curtailment of rail services is unnecessary, that there is either fuel enough to maintain a full railway service or that there is a possibility of adopting some technical device or managerial arrangement which would prevent a curtailment of the services. That is not true.  I do not know what purpose it is hoped to serve by making those statements but, if future discussions between the trade unions concerned and the company are to take place in an atmosphere in which there is doubt as to the necessity for the curtailment of railway services, the discussions cannot possibly be fruitful.</P>
    <P>We have asked the Great Southern Railway to effect a reduction of 25 per cent. in the usage of coal over a period of time, but we have warned the company that the peak traffic load will come upon them later in the year and that they must endeavour to provide now, not merely for a reduction of services represented by a reduction of 25 per cent. in coal usage, but an even greater reduction of services, so that they can expand those services again in the autumn, when peak traffic needs have to be met.  Furthermore, a 25 per cent. reduction in coal usage necessitates more than a 25 per cent. reduction in actual mileage run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Toujours la politesse.</i> The fact I want appreciated by those who have spoken in the matter and those outside who may be directly concerned&mdash;railway workers, users or managers&mdash;is that there is no avoidance of the reduction of transport facilities which the Government has asked the company to effect.  We could stop gas production and give the gas coal to the railway company; we could stop electricity production and give the electricity coal to the railway company; but we cannot continue to provide the present supply of electricity and gas, unless we curtail the transport services.  The aim and duty of the Government is to distribute the supplies between the various essential services, so as to provide as much as possible of each essential need.  If we are to do that, there must be a reduction in railway traffic.</P>
      <P>I stated that, where facilities were withdrawn from particular towns or districts, they would be replaced by road transport services.  I want to make it quite clear that there will be no increase in the petrol allocation of the Great Southern Railways.  The new road services, or expanded road services, required to replace the withdrawn railway services will have to be provided for by economies in other portions of the company's road transport system.  We cannot increase the petrol allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked what the <Col N="1345" /> prospect was in relation to petrol.  I do not know.  We are proceeding at the moment to allocate petrol for various purposes on the assumption that we will get the same quantity as we got last year.  Whether that assumption will prove to be correct or not, nobody can say.  As I am dealing with Deputy Hughes, may I say that, in the course of the inquiries which it was possible for me to make since he spoke, I have found that no application was received up to 12 o'clock today for oil from a coal mining company in Carlow for pumping purposes and which was refused?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked why there is a limitation on the production of native coal and Deputy Linehan had some observations to make in that regard also.  The production of coal is not something which can be undertaken without a great deal of preparatory work.  Normally, the Government requires that nobody shall be employed in coal production underground who has not had very considerable experience of that work&mdash;a period of training which fits him to work underground without risk to himself or risk to other people working there. An unskilled miner can produce a fall of rock which could have fatal consequences. We have only a limited number of skilled miners.  There would be no useful purpose served by doing as Deputy Linehan suggests&mdash;opening up new workings.  It would merely put upon unproductive work skilled miners who should be employed on existing workings and who certainly would produce far more coal in existing workings than they could produce in new mines.</P>
    <P>Normally, it takes two or three years to get a coal mine into production.  It certainly would take longer to get it into full production.  We have a number of established mines operating for a number of years, where there is machinery, equipment and skilled management, and it is into those mines we should divert any skilled workers available.  It is true that workers are tending to drift out of those mines at the moment and tending to drift into <Col N="1346" /> smaller workings, because they can have a less strenuous time and, perhaps, make more money in those smaller workings.  Every worker who leaves one of the well-organised and old-established mines for one of the new and smaller workings means a diminution, to some extent, in the coal output.  However, we have not powers here to direct men into particular employment and we do not contemplate taking those powers, under present circumstances.  Consequently, we have tried to deal with that situation by persuasion, by adjustment and by organisation.  The coal-mining managements of the country, with the assistance of their workers, have succeeded already in effecting a substantial increase in their monthly output.  We hope it may be possible for them to do more, but if there is to be such an increase it will come through increased activity in the existing workings rather than by the development of new mines.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan inquired whether we had consultations with the directors of the Electricity Supply Board and other coal users as to the supplies that would be available to them, and as to the arrangements that they could make in regard to the use of these supplies.  I may say that there has been almost daily consultation with the directors of the Electricity Supply Board, with the officers of the railway company and with other large scale coal users as to the quantities of coal that could be allocated to them, and as to the economies they should enforce in order to get the best possible results from that coal.  There has been no consultation yet with the management of the Dublin gas company.  We did not contemplate, and do not now contemplate, a diminution in the supply of coal to that company or any alteration in its present position.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that railway services could be run on turf. It is quite true that they could, but most of our railway engines are not designed to make the best use of turf. Nevertheless, they could be operated <Col N="1347" /> with turf, but it is a completely false idea that we are likely to have a surplus of turf and could divert it to railway use.  That is not so.  In fact, the railway company some time ago proposed to purchase a very substantial quantity of turf to constitute a reserve stock for themselves.  We had to stop them from doing it because what they were proposing to purchase was turf that was required for the national pool to provide the domestic turf ration.  I think that the best effort that we can make this year will still leave us with a deficiency of turf, and there is as much need to ensure that there is economy in the use of turf as in the use of coal.  We cannot have precisely the same regulation in regard to turf that we can in the case of coal. Nevertheless, we must ensure that all available turf&mdash;turf that is surplus to the immediate needs of producers in the turf areas&mdash;will come into the national supply and will be allocated from that supply to the purposes that we consider most suitable.  We cannot just contemplate a very substantial proportion of that supply of turf being diverted to railway use, or to any other industrial use, without knowing precisely the consequences which it will have upon the total supply in the national pool.</P>

      <P>I do know that the Great Southern Railways Company speeded up trains and got rid of the late running of trains which, at one time, was so much commented upon. They effected economies in the use of fuel simultaneously with an improvement in the train service.  It may be that they could effect more economies if they slowed down trains, but they did effect substantial economies in fuel usage simultaneously with an improvement in the regular train service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by some Deputies that the company had taken advantage of the present situation to close down branch lines and that these will never be reopened.  The company cannot, in normal circumstances, cease to operate a service on any part of its system without the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The cessation of services upon various branch lines announced this week is temporary only and arises out of emergency conditions.  If, at some future date, there is any proposal to abandon those lines, or to close them permanently, that proposal will have <Col N="1349" /> to be dealt with under the appropriate legislation, and the necessary authority secured from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the closing of them is only temporary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the best guarantee I can give.  When the Deputy is as long in politics as I have been, he will be chary about giving guarantees.  Deputy Cosgrave asked about priorities for passenger traffic. I think it would be practically impossible to work any system for differentiating between the classes of passengers on the available passenger trains. Not merely would any such priority system involve making inquiries into the business of individuals, which would be resented, but it would, in fact, prove to be wasteful of the transport facilities available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you not have some system of various kinds of tickets for different classes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the tickets were not used?  Suppose you decided that commercial travellers were to get 50 tickets to travel by train on a Monday morning from Dublin.  That means that you must keep 50 seats for them, but if only 30 turned up there is so much waste of the facilities available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that I <Col N="1350" /> have reached a final decision on the matter, but it seems to me that any such system would involve an inquiry into the reason why a person was making a journey.  That would mean that some civil servant or railway official would come to you and ask: &ldquo;Why are you going to Cork?&rdquo; Naturally, he would not take your word.  He would seek to prove that the statement made was correct.  That would mean an investigation, which is undesirable, or else that the passenger traffic be limited to a certain class of persons.  In practice, the company must work on the principle of first come first served.  It is bound by law to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the number of first-class carriages will be very great.  The company must carry the passengers that offer themselves for transportation in the order in which they offer themselves.  That is a legal obligation on the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not contemplate any system of the reservation of seats for Deputies who travel by bus.  We are not going to institute a system of controlling traffic on buses merely to convenience Deputies.  There will be a system of controlling traffic on trains and they can avail of that system. <Col N="1351" /> Any attempt to regulate traffic on buses by means of any priority arrangements, and the issue of special permits, would lead to chaos.  I do not think we could attempt that unless the bus traffic had to be very substantially reduced below what it is at the moment.</P>
