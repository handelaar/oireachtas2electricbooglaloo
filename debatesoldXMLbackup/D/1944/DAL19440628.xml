      <P>This is not a Vote that varies much from year to year. The increase of £1,779 in this year's Vote arises automatically from normal salary increments, emergency bonus and adjustments in exchange compensation. In estimating the total net cost of this service to the Exchequer, regard must be had on the one hand to the cost of allied services and on the other to the estimated receipts from passport and consular fees, as well as to the amount of the Vote itself.  Details of these are given in Part II of the Vote.  Bringing these into the account, the estimated total net cost of this service in the present financial year works out at £5,457 less than last year, due mainly to an estimated increase of some £6,000 in the extra Exchequer receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Department of External Affairs continues, of course, to be concerned very closely with the circumstances of the emergency and the problems which it creates both for us in this country and for our citizens living abroad.  Usually when we think and talk of our people living abroad, we have in mind principally countries like the United States, Australia and New Zealand in which large numbers of our people have established themselves and found permanent homes.  We are, perhaps, apt to forget sometimes how many of our people are to be found in other parts <Col N="1331" /> of the world, in many different countries of Europe, in the missionary areas of Africa, and in many parts of the Far East and the Pacific.</P>
    <P>This is one of the facts that is constantly brought home to us in the work of this Department.  There are over 2,050 of our citizens whom we know of, living in the different countries of Europe.  Most of these are resident in the larger countries, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and so on, but we have also had requests for assistance of various kinds from our citizens in countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, Finland, Yugoslavia, Roumania and other parts of Europe.  Indeed, there is scarcely any country of the Continent in which at least some of our citizens are not to be found.  The same is true of the Far East.  There are several Irish religious communities in the Philippine Islands. Many Deputies will have read a recently published account of the Irish Jesuit Mission during the fighting in Hongkong.  The Maynooth Mission has houses in Burma, Korea and many parts of China.  There are Irish religious communities at Peking and Hankow and another at Rabaul in New Guinea.  Some of these places are much in the news these days.  We would like those of our people who are living in them to know that we think of them, and of the sufferings which they share with the populations among whom they live.  It is, of course, one of our primary duties as a State to protect the interests and help to lighten the sufferings of our citizens living abroad so far as we can do so, and I need hardly say that it is the constant concern of the Department of External Affairs to do whatever is possible in this regard within the means at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I gave the Dáil some account of this work in speaking on this Vote in previous years.  We have an arrangement for giving our citizens abroad news of their families in this country and of giving their families news of them, when, owing to the absence of other means of communication, they are unable to keep in direct touch. Over 1,635 inquiries of this kind were <Col N="1332" /> dealt with during last year.  When our citizens living abroad are unable to maintain themselves and cannot obtain funds from their bank accounts or relatives in this country owing to the absence of communications, the Department assists by collecting the necessary monies here and ensuring their transmission. Over £12,000 passed through the Department for this purpose last year and the amount transmitted to Irish citizens abroad since the beginning of the war is now about £50,000. Where Irish citizens abroad wish to return home, the Department does what it can to arrange the journey, taking the necessary official steps to obtain the requisite exit permits, visas, travel reservation and so on.  Travel is always a difficult matter under war conditions and never more so than now. Last year, however, 97 Irish citizens were able to return home from the Continent.</P>
    <P>Some of them had been in internment, but were released by the authorities concerned on condition that their return home would be arranged.  In any country at war, foreigners easily become an object of suspicion, and there have been cases in which Irish citizens living in foreign countries have been interned, and have even received more serious sentences on charges of different kinds.  The protection of our citizens in matters of this kind is, of course, an important task of the local representative.  He must act to see that the person concerned has a proper legal defence, that he is tried before a proper tribunal and that his interests are protected in other ways.  Frequently, the representative concerned intervenes officially after trial, to secure a mitigation of the sentence or the exercise of clemency.  I am glad to say that the representations of this kind that have been made, have, on the whole, been met fairly and, in many cases, have been completely successful.  Similarly, as regards Irish property.  Here and there in the war areas or areas under military occupation in Europe, particularly in France and Italy, there are Irish-owned building properties, principally the houses of Irish religious communities, but also house property owned by individual Irish citizens. <Col N="1333" /> Wherever necessary, the natural character of such property is attested by the local Irish representative by means of a certificate posted on the outside of the building after due investigation of the Irish ownership. Property certified as Irish in this way has been exempted from requisitioning, billeting and other similar military measures, and, generally speaking, its neutral character has been satisfactorily respected.</P>
    <P>The representatives abroad have also, of course, their ordinary diplomatic and consular functions.  I saw the suggestion made somewhere recently that our offices abroad would be more useful if they were consulates instead of legations and in a position to discharge consular duties.  That implies a misunderstanding of the position.  All our legations abroad have consular as well as diplomatic functions and afford precisely the same services to our citizens as would be available at a consulate.  There is no distinction drawn between the staffs of the diplomatic and consular branches of our foreign service and, in that regard, I think, we are in line with the trend of development in other States.  To take an example, all officers of the Department serving abroad, whether in a legation or a consulate, have been given by statute the powers of notaries public and commissioners of oaths. This is a usual consular power and I think that it has proved in practice very useful to Irish citizens living abroad who have to execute legal documents for use in this country or complete claims for military service pensions, or transact other business of a like nature.  As Deputies already know, work of this kind in relation to the estates of deceased persons of Irish ancestry is an important task of our offices in the United States.  The amount paid to Irish beneficiaries from such estates during last year was over 766,000 dollars.</P>
    <P>All this work which I have described depends greatly, of course, on the zeal and devotion of the officers of the Department serving abroad; and the conditions of difficulty, discomfort and, sometimes, even personal danger under which many of them have to live <Col N="1334" /> and work nowadays is a fact to be remembered.  I am personally ever conscious of it, and I am certain that the members of the Dáil will feel, with me, proud of the manner in which our officers abroad are discharging their duty in a most difficult situation.  During the year, we lost our legation in Berlin with practically all its contents. Our two legations in Rome suffered minor damage at different times during air raids on that city.  The staff of the High Commissioner's Office in London also had to work under similar conditions at various times.  It is difficult to give anything like an adequate picture of the daily work of these officers abroad because of its great variety and because it differs from place to place according to local conditions. To take one example: in countries at war there are usually elaborate and intricate official formalities to be complied with as regards such matters as rationing, employment, change of residence, hospital treatment, compensation for war damage and so on.  Exacting as those may be for the natives of the country concerned, they are doubly so for foreigners in that country.  Our legations abroad are always available to help our citizens in matters of this kind.  Indeed, the annual reports of the various officers abroad show that there is hardly an hour of the working day in which there is not somebody in the waiting room looking for protection or advice or assistance in solving some difficulty or other.  The Dáil may be assured, I think, that the offices we have abroad have been a help and support to all our citizens within their reach.  Indeed, whenever I receive letters from Irish citizens in difficulties in countries in which we have no representative, my regret is that our foreign representation is so restricted and that we have no representatives on the spot to help them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the work of the Department and our representatives abroad is the action taken at the request of the Department of Supplies to facilitate imports from overseas.  The conduct of overseas trade under war conditions is no easy matter.  Even if you have the shipping space, you have to find your way through a mass of <Col N="1335" /> official regulations, export permits, navicerts, transit licences, blockade permits and other official requirements before you can get your goods across the seas and landed at an Irish port. In spite of all the difficulties, we have imported goods during the year from countries as far away from one another as Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa, Argentine, Brazil, Portuguese West Africa and Uruguay, as well as from countries like Britain, the United States, Canada, Spain and Portugal. Wherever necessary, the services of the offices abroad have been at the disposal of the Department of Supplies in connection with the obtaining of export licences, blockade permits and other facilities in connection with these shipments.  As an example, an arrangement has just been made under which the French authorities in North Africa will make available up to 20,000 tons of phosphate rock for export to this country during the present year.</P>
    <P>Another activity of the Department which has, I think, been of some benefit to traders is the collection of outstanding commercial debts by the officers abroad in cases where, owing to exchange restrictions or the interruption of communications, the creditors in this country were unable to collect these debts themselves through the ordinary channels.  Over £3,500 was recovered for Irish firms in this way within the last 12 months and about £12,000 has been collected since the beginning of the war.  I may say, in this connection, that an arrangement has at last been concluded with the Government of Spain for the liquidation of the Irish commercial debts frozen in that country since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.</P>

      <P>In view of the proposal that has been made, we do not wish to discuss the Vote for External Affairs separately from the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate, I am asking the Dáil to approve the payment of £2,800 to provide for the cases of a number of Irish citizens now resident <Col N="1336" /> in this country who were formerly employees and pensioners of the Shanghai Municipal Council but are unable at present to obtain payment of their pensions owing to the circumstances of the war in the Far East.  The Shanghai Municipal Council was, as Deputies probably know, the governing authority of the international settlement at Shanghai.  It was an international body, composed of citizens of the three great Powers with extensive interests and treaty rights in the Shanghai area&mdash;the United States, Great Britain and Japan.  The council had its own permanent staff and a number of our citizens have, in the past, been employed in its various departments as engineers, inspectors of taxes, officers of the police force and so on.</P>
      <P>Employees of the council were permanent officials with pension rights, and payment of their pensions was secured by a pension trust fund held in a bank in Shanghai.  The investments of the fund, however, were held in local currency debentures, and any exchange compensation required in respect of the payment of pensions to former employees of the council living outside Shanghai, was ordinarily provided by the council itself out of its ordinary revenues.  Since the outbreak of war in the Far East, transfers of pension payments to former employees living in this and other countries have been totally suspended, with the result that the pensioners living in this country, some eight in number, found themselves in somewhat difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same problem arose in other countries, particularly Great Britain, because many of the pensioners of the council are British subjects. The British authorities met the difficulty by agreeing to make advances to their pensioners, subject to an undertaking to repay as soon as the transfer of funds from China becomes possible again.  We are proposing to take similar action in the case of the Irish pensioners.  What we are proposing to do is to advance the amount of their pensions to each of the persons concerned, subject to an undertaking in each case to refund the amount of the advances as soon as the payment of <Col N="1337" /> their pensions in the ordinary way, with arrears, is resumed.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the ultimate payment of these pensions is secured by a substantial fund held in trust in Shanghai.  There is one point I should mention in that connection.  Under a series of treaties concluded between the Chinese Government and other Powers last year, foreign extra-territorial rights in China, including the Shanghai Municipal Council, were abolished and the Chinese Government undertook in taking over control of the official assets of the International Settlements to assume and discharge all their official obligations and to recognise all legitimate rights there.  No such treaty was concluded in our case, simply because we have never claimed, and do not claim, any extra-territorial rights for our citizens in China and, therefore, an abolition treaty was neither necessary nor appropriate in our case. I hope and expect, however, that in any settlement that may be made as a result of the abolition treaties, Irish citizens, in respect of whom extra-territorial rights have never been claimed, will receive treatment at least as favourable as that secured by the treaties to citizens of countries which had extra-territorial rights and abrogated them and that, therefore, notwithstanding the treaties to which I have referred, the security afforded by the pension trust fund in respect of pensions payable to Irish citizens will not be impaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as the Leader of the Opposition does not propose to discuss this Estimate, there are some matters to which I wish to refer.  First, it gives me pleasure to pay my tribute of gratitude to the Department of External Affairs, of which the Taoiseach is head, for the help they have given in any case where I have asked their assistance on behalf of persons who applied to me, and for their unfailing courtesy in meeting, to the very best of their ability, any problems or difficulties that I have put to them.  Secondly, in regard to the Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Taoiseach, I congratulate him on taking a businesslike and sensible view <Col N="1338" /> of the particular dilemma which was provided for in the confines of that Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Estimate as a whole, we hear a lot, arising out of other Estimates submitted to this House, about post-war planning.  I wonder does this country ever intend to do post-war planning in respect of foreign affairs.  I do not imagine there are many people left in this world labouring under the illusion that small nations can manage their affairs in a vacuum.  All that we do, or can hope to do, in this country is materially conditioned by the state of the world in which we live.  During the past 12 months interesting and significant events have taken place throughout the world.  Portugal was approached by the British Government, nominally in pursuance of an old treaty, to give special facilities in the Azores for the successful prosecution of the war, and Portugal afforded those facilities on their territory to Great Britain.  Spain was approached with a view to suspending or reducing her exports of tungsten to the Axis nations and, after some negotiation, she consented to do so.  Turkey was approached to suspend the export of chrome to the Axis nations and, after some negotiation, she not only agreed to do so, but to sell all her chrome to the Allies.  Sweden was approached to suspend or reduce shipments of ball-bearings to the Axis nations and, after some negotiation, she consented to do so.  Now the foreign policy of this country, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the United States of America, was crystallised in words quoted by the Taoiseach some months ago and they were as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No wish that I can express can measure the depth of my esteem for you or my desire for your welfare and glory.  And farewell the many dear friends I have made and the tens of thousands who, for the reason that I was the representative of a noble nation and a storied, appealing cause, gave me honours they denied to princes&mdash;you will not need to be assured that Ireland will not forget and that Ireland will not be ungrateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I think, pretty adequately crystallises the general feeling of our <Col N="1339" /> people in regard to the United States of America.  I rarely find myself prepared to subscribe to statements made by the Taoiseach, but in that case I do not think I would exaggerate when I say that, in using those words, he spoke for almost every citizen of this country.  It was a source of profound regret to me when the United States of America addressed an appeal to us to exclude the German Minister and the Japanese Consul, in order to contribute to the security of the United States of America, that we found ourselves constrained, unlike Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Sweden, to refuse. But out of that refusal at least one immensely important fact emerges to which the minds of our people should certainly be directed, because it provides a comparison between the attitude adopted by the Axis Powers in circumstances of that character and the attitude adopted by the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>When the Axis Powers wanted to exclude the representatives of the United Nations from Holland they addressed no note to them; they made no inquiry.  They blasted Rotterdam out of its foundations; they invaded that country and they put the foreign diplomatic representatives out of that country by force and violence and in the process they destroyed the Dutch Army, they enslaved the Dutch nation and they even claimed the right to conscript the Dutch people.  When the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America desired a similar accommodation in this country they addressed a Note asking us to give them that which they wanted and, after due reflection, our Government decided that they did not choose to give the United States of America that accommodation or that concession. There was no question of using violence against us.  There was no question of using force.  There were no threats employed.  There were no sanctions invoked.  On the contrary, the United States of America said at once: &ldquo;If you decline to give us that which we have asked for, we do not challenge your right to refuse.  We acknowledge <Col N="1340" /> that you are a Sovereign State fully entitled to give or withhold anything and everything that is within your gift.&rdquo;  Rightly, in my judgment, they felt entitled as a Sovereign Government and, as they believed, an old friend, to ask us frankly for something in our gift which they felt was of very great value to them, if we were in a position to give it to them, but the moment we indicated our reluctance to give what they asked, the moment we indicated that we were not prepared to interpret the words &ldquo;Ireland will not forget and Ireland will not be ungrateful&rdquo; as a kind of anticipatory undertaking to assist America if and when she should require our help, the United States of America instantly acknowledged our rights and studiously declined to invoke anything resembling force against us&mdash;and this although they had at their disposal approximately 1,000,000 men with armaments and resources sufficient to overwhelm the best that we could put in the field in 48 hours.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard in the face of these facts to believe that anyone in this country is truly neutral as between the Axis Powers on the one hand and the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America on the other hand.  If Ireland has to choose, after this war, between a world in which the rule of the road shall be that unless a small nation acceded to every demand of its powerful neighbour it would be steam-rolled, as Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Yugoslavia, Poland and Greece were steam-rolled, and a world run on the lines that a powerful nation asked a small nation what they wanted but, if they were refused, recognised the right of that small nation to run its own affairs in its own way, it is difficult for me to believe that any rational man in this country is indifferent as to the issue of this war and as to which philosophy will prevail in the post-war world.  I am not indifferent; I am not and never have been neutral as between the United Nations and the Axis and it is a constant source of shame to me that our people who have so long been the champions of liberty in the world should now be represented before the <Col N="1341" /> world as knowing no difference, being quite unprepared to take sides in a conflict between Germany on the one side and the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America on the other.</P>
    <P>I look back with satisfaction on the fact that since this business first presented itself to Irish minds I have constantly repudiated the doctrine of neutrality and have constantly kept before our people their obligation in honour at least to make their attitude clearly known as between Germany on the one hand and the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Nations on the other.  However, I want to say this, and I say it for all to hear, that although the position of neutrality taken up by our Government is well calculated to create misunderstanding abroad, the fact is, whatever the people in America might imagine to be the case from superficial appearances, that 99 per cent. of our people in this country are pro-American and that those who use the attitude adopted officially by our Government to represent to the United States of America a cold indifference on the part of our people misrepresent our people.  The truth is that, whatever the present difficulties and stresses may be if there should eventuate any hard feeling after this war, it will come exclusively from the American side because, so far as our people are concerned, in their hearts, they are as warmly drawn to the American people as they have ever been.  I do not disguise that it has been one of my great solicitudes during these years lest a misunderstanding should develop between the ordinary people on both sides of the Atlantic, in our country and in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>A great many people here forget that in America the Irish-Americans represent only a very small fraction of the community.  Out of 120,000,000 perhaps there are 10,000,000 who have any connection with Ireland however remote.  It is vital to the interests of our people that we should retain the sympathy and understanding of that 110,000,000 who know nothing of Ireland but what they read and hear.  It <Col N="1342" /> is mainly in their ranks that misunderstanding might be planted and might grow.  It is going to put a very great test on their understanding that, in this time, people whom they looked upon as their dependable friends have not come up to their expectations of what friends would be prepared to do. For that reason I feel that every step that can be taken should be taken to persuade them that, whatever strategic circumstances have forced upon our Government the attitude which they have in fact adopted, the spiritual affinity between our people, the deep friendship and understanding which have characterised our relations for so long are no less strong and deeply felt amongst the masses of our people than they ever were.</P>
    <P>I want to put this categorical question to the Taoiseach because it is fundamental to the whole question of post-war planning.  Are we in the Commonwealth or are we not?  The British Government says we are.  I want to know what the Taoiseach intends the foreign policy of his Government to be.  It is his duty to tell the country what is his foreign policy in regard to that matter and whither it is proposed to lead the nation. Heretofore it has been suggested <i>in terrorem</i> that any declaration of that kind might bring disastrous consequences upon the nation.  It is now manifest to the most obscurantist citizen of this State that, so far as our two powerful neighbours are concerned &mdash;Great Britain and the United States &mdash;they recognise our freedom to do what we please and they abrogate any claim to interfere by force with us. We are absolutely free in this country to do exactly what we think is in the best interests of the country.  In that situation, and in the knowledge that action suited to the general policy of whatever Government is in office may be called for at the very moment when the war comes to an end, I want to know from the Taoiseach are we in the Commonwealth or are we not?  I am in favour of retaining our membership of the Commonwealth and using it for three ends: (1) to secure the unity of the Irish nation and the abolition of the Border; (2) in order to make the influence of a predominantly Catholic <Col N="1343" /> nation effective in the counsels of the nations of the world; and (3) in order to ensure for our people an opportunity of securing employment on equal terms throughout the territories of the Commonwealth of Nations to which we at present belong.</P>
    <P>In regard to partition, I am convinced that unless a <i>modus vivendi</i> is discovered for our permanent membership of the Commonwealth, however that Commonwealth may develop post-war, there is no prospect of getting rid of the Border in our time.  I want to get rid of the Border not only because that is the natural ambition of every Irish nationalist in Ireland and outside it, but because, if the Border continues, there is going to develop upon it social problems incomparably graver than any we have yet had to contend with.  Nobody who is not familiar with the conditions obtaining on the Border at present can realise the perils which are developing there.  There is growing up a system of smuggling to and fro across the Border which is corrupting our public services north and south of the Border. I venture to say that the corruption is worse north of the Border than it is south.  It is corrupting all our people and it is particularly corrupting the children who are being habitually used as messengers for the purpose of defeating the vigilance of the preventive officers on both sides of the Border.  The deplorable fact is that no section of the community is making any attempt to stand up against these abuses.  Men, lay and clerical&mdash;it may as well be said openly&mdash;to whom we ought to look as bulwarks against the development of such traffic, are themselves taking part in it, and we have arrived at the point where certain smugglers are carrying across lorryloads of goods, are being waylaid by hi-jackers, are arming themselves against them, and hi-jackers are arming themselves to overcome the force used against them.</P>
    <P>I have seen a closely analogous situation developing in Chicago when Dion O'Bannion and Al Capone were rising. When that situation began, respectable <Col N="1344" /> citizens of Chicago laughed at the thing.  It was then a question of getting a bottle of whiskey, and respectable men were inclined to say: &ldquo;If we cannot get it any other way, we have to get it this way.&rdquo;  I lived in Chicago to see the day when no man could go into the Cicero district of Chicago unless he knew he had the tacit consent of Al Capone, in which the whole municipal services of that great city broke down and were dominated by the gangster element, and, until the Federal Government intervened, the stranglehold of that gentleman on that city of 2,000,000 people was virtually absolute.  No honest man dare walk the streets, or at least he did so in considerable trepidation and, if you were murdered in the city by an agent of Al Capone, no respectable citizen would see your body lying in the gutter.  They would pass you by and leave you rather than run the risk of the vengeance of the gangster element which controlled the city at the time.</P>
    <P>Many people in this House may think I exaggerate, but I warn you to-day that, if the Border continues where it is for another decade, we shall see develop there a situation closely analogous to the Chicago situation before the Federal Government of the United States intervened to put an end to it.  There is already developing in certain areas on the Border a situation in which respectable people go in fear of their lives lest they come into conflict with some of the smuggling gangs and, in my opinion, this situation is developing steadily.  I have been advised by many of my own supporters not to dwell upon that subject, because the horrifying fact is that respectable men, whom ordinarily one would be proud to claim as one's friends, are themselves engaged in it.  There seems to be a complete suspension of all moral sense in regard to that matter along the Border on both sides, north and south. That is one of the very potent reasons why I believe it is urgent and vital to the life of this country that we should get rid of the Border.</P>
    <P>Another reason is this.  So long as this war is on, the Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1345" /> very properly has locked up at the Curragh Camp all the gentlemen who claim the right to use violence towards their neighbours but, when the war is over, I do not suppose we can keep them in perpetuity.  So long as the Border is there, any blackguard in this country who wants to draw a gun on some neighbour or policeman, instead of being regarded as a danger to the community, as another murderer deserving of execution, is going to gather a cloak of respectability around himself and say that he did it in order to abolish the Border.  So long as they have the right to say that in this part of the country, the effective enforcement of the law in normal times will be extremely difficult.  Are not these facts that I expound, the truth?  If they are the truth, is it not vitally urgent to get rid of the Border, and if it is vitally urgent to get rid of the Border, can we get rid of it on the basis of bringing the Six Counties of Northern Ireland out of the Commonwealth with us?  If we cannot, and if we mean business about getting rid of the Border, are we prepared, having examined the constitution of the Commonwealth and recognised that it interferes in no particular with the absolute sovereignty of the Irish people within the Irish nation, to work with it and in it and, thereby, take a practical step towards the abolition of the Border?  Is it or is it not true that an island of 3,000,000, with no material resources of any kind, can carry but little weight in the councils of the nations of the world? Is it or is it not true that, if that nation is admitted to participation on terms of absolute equality with the other nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, she can wield in that Commonwealth considerable influence? Is there anybody in this House who denies that we went into the Commonwealth of Nations, or the Empire as it was then known, in 1923, and that within ten years we so metamorphosized its whole constitution that the Taoiseach himself, on coming into office, discovered that he had Constitutional powers at his disposal, by virtue of the metamorphosis effected in the Commonwealth of Nations by our statesmen, which enabled him to <Col N="1346" /> do by Act of Parliament all the things to achieve which he had been prepared to fight a civil war unsuccessfully?</P>
    <P>If our influence within the Commonwealth, on its very self, was so vast, is it unreasonable to anticipate that in the post-war world, were we cordial participants in its activities, our influence would continue to be felt and that that influence would continue to be a Catholic influence: that the philosophy underlying the politics of the Catholic State would find effective expression not only within the limits of that Commonwealth but, through it, on the world at large?  Can it be doubted that as a member of the Commonwealth we can be more effective and influential in the councils of the world than we can ever hope to be as a separate State of 26 counties.</P>
    <P>Lastly&mdash;and though this is purely mundane it is a matter of very real significance for our people&mdash;the National University of Ireland and T.C.D. are turning out approximately twice as many professional graduates as this country can absorb.  These graduates have got to get employment somewhere if they are to live, or else we have got to close the doors of the universities on all the professions, just as, mind you, we had to do in the case of the training colleges in respect of national teachers.  We could not export our national teachers and, therefore, the only thing we could do, when we had too many of them, was to close down the training colleges and prevent any more from being trained.  If we have not opportunities for doctors, engineers, and other professional classes, educated in our universities, in the Commonwealth of Nations, then the only remedy is to close down these faculties until the surplus is absorbed, over the next ten or 20 years, in the service of our own country, and that means that large professions will be, virtually, for ever closed to the masses of our people.  I want for our people the right and opportunity to earn their living throughout the Commonwealth. It is a very precious asset to our people, which has been of immense advantage to them in the past, and which should be of immense advantage to them in the future.  Now, the ludicrous <Col N="1347" /> thing is that a considerable body of our people, knowing that in their hearts, are prepared in public to repudiate such a desire and say that it is a shameful and un-national aspiration. I glory in the right of our people to enjoy the benefits of that Commonwealth, which they have played no small part in building up physically and constitutionally.  I want to belong to it, not only for the advantages it confers on us, but for the security it gives us that our soverignty, independence and unity, once established, can be maintained not only to-day and to-morrow, but for all time, so long as that Commonwealth exists.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Taoiseach, what is his policy in this matter.  Are not the people entitled to know whether at the end of this war the Twenty-Six Counties of this country are to cut themselves away from the Commonwealth and declare their independence as a republic?  Are not the people entitled to know whether it is the Taoiseach's policy to incorporate the Six Counties of Northern Ireland in an Irish republic, cut off and distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations, or is it his ambition to incorporate the Six Counties of Northern Ireland in a united Ireland based on Document No. 2?  Is it his intention, wrapped in the raiment of Republicanism, to walk with his head erect into the British Empire?  Surely, that is not a secret which may be properly buried in the Taoiseach's heart?  Surely, the Irish people have a right to be told where his Government proposes to march in regard to that matter?  I made it quite clear what my views are on that subject, and I want to know, as an elected representative of the people, whither the Government are trying to lead this nation, so that those of us who agree with them may collaborate with them, and that those of us who disagree with them may challenge their decision in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not our intention to take part in this debate, and I do not propose to detain the House very long.  I only wish to make a few <Col N="1348" /> remarks in connection with certain statements that have been made by Deputy Dillon.  One thing that the Deputy said was this: &ldquo;We do not forget.&rdquo;  No doubt, we do not forget, but when Deputy Dillon makes such statements as he has just made.  I feel that he himself forgets.  After all, I do not see any reason why, at the present time, we should do anything or say anything that would give an opportunity to any of the belligerent Powers to interfere with our positon of neutrality. Deputy Dillon says that he is not neutral.  Of course, he may not be, but within the last 12 months we have had two general elections, and that issue was not put up before the people by any candidate standing, I think, for any Party in this country, or by the Independents.  Deputy Dillon has pointed out that we here are the representatives of the people.  Following that, I would say that we are here as the representatives of the people, pledged to carry out the wishes of the people, mind you, whether we like it or not, and I think that many of the statements that have been made by Deputy Dillon&mdash;and I am not saying this in any sense of disrespect to him&mdash; are not for the best interests of our country or the people whom we were elected to represent.  The one thing about Deputy Dillon's statement which has impelled me to speak is his statement in regard to membership of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Now, at this very critical period in the history of Europe, and of our country, why should we make any reference to that matter, one way or the other?  I do not want to be misrepresented in connection with this matter, but I want to make it clear that other countries captured the British market in their day, and yet they did not shout, either inside or outside the Commonwealth. As far as my personal view is concerned, I think we must all realise that England and the Commonwealth of Nations are our best customers, just as we are the best customers of England.  We want to live on friendly terms with her, as I suppose she wants to live on friendly terms with us.  I do not think it well that there should be any discussion on that whatsoever at the moment.  Surely there will be <Col N="1349" /> plenty of time later on to discuss these matters.</P>
      <P>The one thing which the Deputy mentioned in which I am interested was the question of the Border.  The Deputy tells us about the terrible corruption that exists there.  He may be right in that; I do not know anything about it, living as I do in the West of Ireland, but his statement reminds me of an article I read in a foreign journal not so long ago from the pen of a certain journalist who visited this country.  He began by telling us how he crossed the Border and about the racketeering which was carried on there.  I was prepared to believe some of these statements, but when he proceeded to describe his experiences in Dublin, which he subsequently visited, and made certain statements which I knew to be wrong, I found that I could not place any reliance on the statements that he made in regard to the Border either.  As regards the abolition of the Border, my opinion is that it was the determination of the people in this portion of the country, the people from 1916 to 1921, which brought us to the happy position which we have to-day in the Twenty-Six Counties, and I believe that it is the determination and the unity of our people here combined with the determination and unity of our friends in Northern Ireland that will eventually win for us the abolition of the Border.  I do not believe that any friendship with belligerent nations can do that.  Some of us remember the conditions which prevailed in 1914-1918, and we know that the very same grand promises were held out to us in those days.  We were told that the war from 1914-18 was being fought in the interests of small nations.  The great statesmen of those days tried to persuade us that they were fighting our cause, and they would almost convince one that they are doing the same thing to-day.  I think we should be delighted to find ourselves in the happy position which we occupy at the moment, that our children are not being sent out to foreign lands to sacrifice their lives for nothing, as they did in those days, I regret to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all Departments, the Department of External Affairs has some very <Col N="1350" /> difficult questions to handle.  It has a very hard job to do and it is doing it very well.  Of course, Deputy Dillon says that 99 per cent. of our people are pro-American.  I believe that 99 per cent. of our people are pro-Irish, and I hope the day will come when, in the Twenty-Six Counties, 100 per cent. of them will be pro-Irish and that, in co-operation with those across the Border who are pro-Irish, they will abolish the Border.  It is my honest opinion that in that way we can abolish the Border.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Dillon made some statements in regard to the people in the Curragh Camp.  Very often hard things have to be done but I hope that we shall soon find ourselves all together and that those people will realise, as Deputy Dillon has said&mdash;I agree with him in that statement&mdash;that their idea of going out with the gun is not the best.  I hope the day will soon come when we shall be with those people and they shall be with us in one united effort to do away with the Border.  Deputy Dillon says the people of this country are not indifferent. I must confess, even though I am speaking for myself, that to a certain extent over all Ireland there is a certain amount of indifference as far as taking sides in the war is concerned. There is, in fact, full indifference on that question, and that should be the way.  I shall not detain the House any longer.  Anything I have said I can assure the House is not due to any hard feelings.  On my part, I am just expressing the views of the people whom I represent and people all over the country whom I know.  As far as the Commonwealth is concerned we want to live, I repeat, on friendly terms with England as our best customer as we are her best customer. There is no need for us to placard our Imperialism, our love for England or our love for Germany, our hatred for England or our hatred for Germany either.  I think we should try to work together here and to remember with gratitude the efforts of the people who put us in our present position which is so much better than the position which we occupied in 1914-18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a speech on this Estimate as <Col N="1351" /> this Party does not desire to speak on it but I just want to ask the Taoiseach a question.  Before doing so I should like to pay my tribute to the work of the Department of External Affairs. I do not think there is any Department of State which carries out its work more efficiently or more courteously.  I can speak from personal knowledge of that.  Many people, in fact everybody I know who has had occasion to get in touch with the Department, have testified to the kindness and courtesy with which they were treated.  I think that in a Department which deals with the outside world that is a very satisfactory position.  Deputy Dillon made a very interesting speech this morning and I should like to make just one remark in connection with it, that speaking personally I have felt there were moral issues involved in this present war.  I think that all of us have realised thoroughly what these moral issues are and it has been a disappointment to me personally that this country did not officially make its feelings known as regards these moral issues and that the Government did not show how the Irish people really feel on the issues involved.  That is all I wish to say on that matter.  The question which I wish to ask the Taoiseach has reference to the travel ban.  I have received a number of letters from people on the other side in connection with this matter.  There are many people over there, some of whom are in the Forces, to whom this travel ban is causing a good deal of hardship.  I know that the Government here is not in a position to answer this question absolutely.  It is a unilateral matter but if the Taoiseach could give any information on the subject it would be very gratefully received by many people who are anxious to be allowed to come to see their relatives on this side and whose relatives are anxious to see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked some questions, and his asking them suggested to me that he is a very innocent man.  He ought to know, as a Deputy of this House, what the nature of our present relationships with the <Col N="1352" /> States of the British Commonwealth is.  There are defined in two documents &mdash;namely, the Constitution which gives certain powers in the executive domain and the External Relations Act.  There has been no suggestion by this Government that we propose to change these in any way.  I do not propose to try to give any special definition of the character of these relationships, and I certainly do not think the present is the time to start discussing these matters without any advantage whatever to be gained.</P>
      <P>With regard to Partition, nobody can be in the slightest doubt as to what our attitude towards Partition is. Within the framework of the existing relationship, Partition can be ended, if the people have the will to end it. If the idea is that we should go back to the position from which we have emerged in order to secure that, then, I for one do not stand for it, and that is not the policy of this Government. I said in the Seanad on the previous occasion that there were sacrifices which we were not prepared to make, even for unity.  The people of this island have a right to the unity of their territory, and they have in addition a right to be independent and to determine their relationships with other countries.  One of these is not to be sacrified for the other.  In that particular speech in the Seanad, I pointed out that there were things which, as an independent nation, as a people entitled to independence, we were determined to pursue.  Very often, we are told, when we ask the people to make efforts to restore the Irish language, that by doing so we are going to hinder the coming together of the two parts of the country. Again, we say we have the right, if the majority of the people want it, to have the Irish language, as well as the unity of the country, and we are not going to sacrifice the one, in the hope&mdash; because it is only a hope&mdash;that we can get the other by doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often been said that the division between the two parts of this country is due to religious differences. Is it to be suggested that if we are to bring about the unity of the country, the majority here who hold one belief <Col N="1353" /> are to surrender that belief and adopt that of the people on the other side? There are certain things which we hold and we mean not to sacrifice a single one of them.  That may mean that it will take longer to achieve the unity of the country.  In my opinion, it will not. The whole question of Partition in the past has been a constant surrender so far as the views of our side are concerned, in order to attain that object, and it has not attained that object. The course suggested by Deputy Dillon is that we should go in exactly the same direction with the same results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke at the beginning of his speech about our future policy. He used a phrase at the beginning&mdash; that we cannot do certain things &ldquo;<i>in vacuo</i>&rdquo;.  I forget what exactly are the things <i>in vacuo</i> which he wants, but he wants us at this particular time, with the position of the world as it is, to give exact definitions.  We can have our own views and keep them to ourselves. When the time comes to express those views as public policy, when it will be possible for us and the people to whom we are speaking to see exactly what the conditions are, that will be the time at which we can state publicly and definitely what our policy is going to be.  We have to wait and see what the ultimate conditions will be.</P>
    <P>So far as our general attitude is concerned, we have indicated more than once that, so far as Government policy in concerned, we are quite prepared to play our part in any world organisation of States in which the sovereign character of these States is admitted and acknowledged and association will be one of free will.  We are prepared to play our part in preserving peace in the future and in trying to bring about better conditions for human beings in every country.  We have shown that that has been our attitude and that we are prepared to live up to it, in our attitude towards the League of Nations.  It cannot be said that, so far as our public expressions with regard to what ought to be done are concerned, we have played any part in bringing about the present disasters which have overtaken the <Col N="1354" /> world.  I do not say that what we suggested might not have been impossible in view of the problems which other nations had to deal with, but I do know that representatives of this country, whenever there was an opportunity of doing so, tried to get the States of the world to realise that they were drifting towards another world war.  I well remember asking whether the horrors of another world war were necessary to teach us that certain things should be done to maintain peace.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talks about our attitude to the United States of America. Anything I said with reference to gratitude was true, and Deputy Dillon is not doing a service to this country in trying to misrepresent our attitude. On a previous occasion in the Dáil, I gave a pretty extensive account of the nature of my mission to the United States in former years.  I did not go there as the representative of this country to ask the United States to go to war for us.  I would not have had the &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; to do so.  I asked that recognition should be given by the United States to the declaration of our people that they wanted an independent State, an independent republic. I asked for recognition of that republic.  I did not get that.  That was asking very much less.  If the United States, a powerful State, had considered that it was in its interest to give us that recognition, it was in its power to do so.  I have no doubt whatever that it would have offended Britain at the time, but it was a country sufficiently powerful to be able to do what it considered right without the danger of being destroyed.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Dillon suggest that there are people in America who have had greater cheek than I had when I went to the United States and that they were going to ask us, a small country with relatively small defences, to put itself in the position in which it might be destroyed, or at any rate in which it was forsaking the attitude which it had calmly and deliberately decided on at the beginning of this war?  We declared our neutrality then, and again I would say that Deputy <Col N="1355" /> Dillon, when talking about neutrality, ought not to be so very careful to say that it is the policy of the Government. He knows very well it is a policy which was accepted by the vast majority of Deputies, the representatives of the people&mdash;that, as was said by Deputy Donnellan, it is a policy which was accepted and approved by the people as a whole and testified to in two general elections.</P>
    <P>The policy of neutrality of the State is no indication as to what the individual members of that State may think. Individual members in this community of ours here will have different views with regard to this war, its merits and so on.  As far as the individual citizen is concerned, there is no question of indifference implied in the neutrality of this State.  The neutrality of the State was adopted in the interests of the community as a whole as a definite national policy under the present circumstances. As I say, it connotes nothing as to the feelings of individual citizens with regard to the States at war.  Anybody can interest himself in giving guesses as to what the percentage is on one side or the other.  I have my own views on that matter, but it is not for me to give expression to those views, because my official duty is to say and to maintain that as a State we have adopted and are pursuing a policy of neutrality.  To state that that policy denotes, in regard to every individual in the country or to the mass of the people, an indifference, is clearly a misrepresentation of the facts.  There are things which Deputy Dillon's remarks suggested to me to say to him, but I refrain from saying them.  They have been said in this House already, and, if he is ashamed, as he says, of the attitude of our people on this particular matter, I must say that most of us are more ashamed of a person who expresses views such as he has and does not himself personally act in accordance with them.</P>

    <P>This Vote makes provision for our contribution to the League of Nations on the same lines as in previous years. There has been no change in the position or work of the League since this Vote was last before the Dáil.  The political work of the League is at a complete standstill, but its principal technical services&mdash;those dealing with international health problems, economic and financial relations, statistics, the traffic in dangerous drugs, and so on&mdash; have been maintained, on the whole, fairly well, considering the circumstances. This Vote covers, of course, only our contribution to the League of Nations proper.  Our contribution to the International Labour Office is borne on the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  I have already explained to the Dáil in previous years the basis on which we continue to contribute to the League, notwithstanding the very restricted scope to which its activity has been reduced.  In order to terminate membership of the League, two years' notice is required under Article I of the Covenant.  On the grounds which I have indicated when introducing this Vote in recent years, we have felt that it would not be good policy for a small nation like ours to take the positive step of abandoning the League during these difficult years, and, as long as we remain formally a member of the League, we must, of course, honourably discharge the financial obligations of membership.  What precisely the future of the present League may be, nobody can say with certainty.  No doubt, in all countries there is a growing realisation of the necessity for some form of international organisation to ensure very much the same objectives as were placed before the present League of Nations in the League Covenant; but, while the general intention may be clear, no definite idea seems yet to have emerged as to the precise form which the international organisation of the future should take, or as to the extent, if any, to which it will utilise the structure of the present League of Nations. <Col N="1358" /> It may well be that the present League will disappear, and some entirely new organisation be set up to take its place. In this regard, I do not think that anyone could forecast the future with any fair degree of probability at the present stage.  We must await the march of events, in the hope that whatever international organisation is set up will provide a framework within which all nations, great and small, will play a due part in building a just and stable international order.  When such an organisation, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all States, comes into being, there need be no doubt that this country will, as in the past, be ready to take its full share in the task awaiting it.  In the meantime, I think our present attitude towards the existing League of Nations is the best one to follow in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I entirely subscribe to the theory that we should continue to be a member of and to support the League of Nations.  At the present time in the world, when it is quite clear that definite principles have to be hammered out, in full and open discussion, as to the kind of co-operation that will be arranged in international matters of various kinds, it is most desirable that the League of Nations, with the spirit in which it was founded, should continue to exist.  It is most desirable that we should take and keep our place in any international organisation where those principles are to be discussed.</P>

The point that I want to put to him is this: That you have very poor parents in Dublin, some of them on poor law relief, and if they are to be asked to send 30/- to the industrial school for the purchase of the railway tickets to enable the children to travel home, they will not be able to find it.

If she does not provide the 30/- out of the sum she receives in poor law relief, she cannot see her children.  I am satisfied with what the Minister has said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for salaries and expenses in connection with unemployment <Col N="1363" /> insurance and employment exchanges (including contributions to the Unemployment Fund), unemployment assistance, the special register of agricultural and turf workers, and insurance against intermittent unemployment for certain services in connection with food allowances (9 Edw. 7, c. 7); 10 and 11 Geo. 5, c. 30; 11 Geo. 5, c. 1; 11 and 12 Geo. 5, c. 15; 12 Geo. 5, c. 7; No. 17 of 1923; Nos. 26 and 59 of 1924; No. 21 of 1926; No. 33 of 1930; Nos. 44 and 46 of 1933; No. 38 of 1935; No. 2 of 1938; No. 28 of 1939; No. 4 of 1940; No. 3 of 1941; No. 7 of 1942; and No. 20 of 1943) and for expenses in connection with the provision of labour for harvest work.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that anxiety has been expressed from some districts concerning the possibility of a shortage of local labour for the saving of the harvest.  For the purpose of endeavouring to provide for the requirements of farmers in districts where the shortage of local labour for harvest work may arise, we propose to introduce a scheme designed to arrange for the temporary supply of labour for harvest work to these districts from the congested areas of north-west, west and south-west where men, who are not required for harvest work in their own districts, may be available.  The possibility of transferring labour for temporary agricultural employment from one district to another depends upon the provision of travelling expenses, the prospect of employment at remunerative rates and the availability of local lodging accommodation.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide these facilities for workers travelling for harvest work from State funds.  It was for the purpose of enabling those funds to be provided that this Supplementary Estimate was required.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that men who are transferred for employment from congested areas to districts where there may be a shortage of local labour for agricultural work will be paid, out of State funds, free rail or bus fares from their homes to the places where they are going to take employment; <Col N="1364" /> that, in addition, they will be given an expenses allowance of 5/- for the journey; that while they are employed at the harvest work they will receive from State funds a board and lodging allowance of 4/- per day; and that, subject to their completion of their contract of employment, they will also be given free rail or bus travel to their homes, plus an allowance for out-of-pocket expenses of 5/-.  It is proposed that farmers who employ these temporary workers under this scheme for harvest work, must guarantee to them a minimum rate of wages of 1/2 per hour worked, and 1/6 per hour worked in excess of 54 hours a week.  They must also make arrangements to provide them with suitable board and lodging, for which the workers concerned will pay a moderate charge. They are, as I have mentioned, being allowed 4/- per day from State funds, for the purpose of helping to defray their board and lodging expenses.</P>
    <P>A scheme of this kind, which is largely experimental and the full effects of which it is impossible to foresee, depends for its success upon the fullest co-operation of the farmers and the workers.  It is contemplated that farmers who require men under the scheme for their harvest work, over and above the workers that are available to them locally, should notify their requirements as early as possible, so that arrangements may be made to approach the men, residing in the congested districts, who may be willing to undertake the work.</P>
    <P>Forms of application for workers under the scheme will be available, on application, from the tillage inspector or tillage supervisor, from the employment exchanges or branch employment offices and at post offices.  It is contemplated that a farmer who requires labour under the scheme would state on an application form the number of men he will require, in addition to those obtainable locally, and the periods for which he will require them. He must undertake, when completing the form, to employ the number of workers specified by him who are sent to him under the scheme.  He must undertake also to pay at least the minimum <Col N="1365" /> rate of wages prescribed and must guarantee that suitable board and lodging will be available at a moderate charge.</P>
    <P>When the needs of the farmers for men, in the areas where local labour is scarce, are thus made known, arrangements will be made to allocate to them men from those areas which broadly correspond with the congested districts of the west, north-west and south-west, whose services are not required for harvest work in their own districts.</P>
    <P>Men from those areas will be asked to co-operate in the scheme by notifying their desire to participate to the nearest local offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  On receipt of notification from men willing to make themselves available for employment under the scheme, a register of such men will be formed and from that register the requirements of the farmers needing help will be supplied. It is intended that every possible step will be taken to ensure that only good harvest workers will be sent to employment under the scheme; but it will, of course, be appreciated that the local officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce may have difficulty in determining the suitability of workers and that no guarantee can be given in the matter.</P>
    <P>The success of the scheme will depend on the publicity given to it, as well as on the co-operation of the farmers and workers concerned.  If this Estimate is passed, arrangements will be made to publicise the scheme as early as possible, for the purpose of bringing to the farmers of the districts in which a shortage of local labour is anticipated the possibility of securing workers under this scheme and for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the workers in congested districts the facilities that are available in connection with employment of this kind.  It is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the number of workers who may be dealt with under the scheme, and the estimate has been based on the assumption that 2,000 workers will be employed under it and will, therefore, <Col N="1366" /> require to be recouped their travelling expenses and to receive also the proposed contribution to their board and lodging expenses.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Parties in the House will appreciate the desirability of taking every practicable measure to ensure that no difficulties will arise in saving the harvest by reason of a scarcity of labour, and that we can rely upon their co-operation in endeavouring to ensure that this scheme for the transfer of labour from congested areas for harvest work will be given every chance of success.  I again emphasise that the success of the scheme depends on the willing co-operation of both farmers and men concerned.  It is particularly important that farmers should not lightly fill in application forms for labour, without appreciating that, when they sign the form, they are entering into a contract to employ the number of workers which they specify, at the rate of wages which I have outlined&mdash;1/2 per hour for a 54 hour week, and 1/6 per hour for overtime.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility, of course, that difficulties may arise in individual localities.  The intention is that those difficulties, should they arise, will be met as well as they can be met by the tillage inspectors, who are being retained in the service of the Department of Agriculture for a longer period than would otherwise be necessary, in order to supervise the administration of this scheme.</P>

I suggest that the Minister ought not to make October 31st a hard and fast rule, because if we were unfortunate enough to run into bad weather, harvesting operations in certain districts would not end then, but might go on until the end of November.  That could happen.  I would not like the Minister's hands to be tied to a particular date.  Deputy Allen and other Deputies will agree that October 31st is somewhat early.  Having regard to the great acreage of cereals this year, and the limited amount of machinery available for cutting and threshing, particularly in what is known as the main tillage counties, the work of farmers will extend beyond October 31st.  The Minister has fixed the scheme on an hourly basis and, comparatively speaking, is ensuring that the men will get decent remuneration. One difficulty, which I dare say has occurred to the Minister and his advisers, is that at that particular time of the year, except in the case of large farmers, they would not require additional <Col N="1368" /> help for long periods.  I am afraid that difficulty is going to arise, but it probably will be met by the help of the tillage inspectors, many of whom have now a good grasp of their work and know the districts in which they operate.  Another difficulty will be the gap between finishing with one farmer and taking up work with another.  If a man gets a week or a fortnight's work on one farm, and if there is a lag of two or three days before going to another farm, that is going to react on the man.  Another difficulty concerns lodging.  I did not understand from the Minister's statement that it covered points where a farmer would provide board and lodging.  That is the most desirable thing that could happen.  In that event what would happen to the 4/- a day allowance given to the worker?  As far as possible it should be urged on farmers, in their own interests, to make a supreme effort to provide board and lodging as it will be impossible to provide board and lodging elsewhere.  In many cases men will be far removed from provincial towns, and even when close to towns, it is not easy for agricultural workers to get board and lodgings now.  This scheme is not only desirable but essential, but the points I referred to are ones to which the Minister might give further attention.  It would be well to extend the date beyond October 31st and to do everything possible to prevent a lag or waste of time between the transfer from one farm to another.</P>

      <P>One point that may create difficulty is that the ordinary farmer will find it difficult to ascertain in advance at what particular time he will require additional labour.  It will be very hard for him to state in advance when the corn will be ripe and ready for harvesting and on what week he will require labour.  The average farmer may find it difficult to guarantee the wages provided in the scheme for the period beyond that during which he requires the labour.  I wonder if there is any solution of that difficulty.  I welcome this proposal as a very desirable experiment.  It may not work as satisfactorily as the Minister <Col N="1369" /> hopes, but it has the goodwill and the approval of all who have considered the position.  The Minister can be assured that all sides will co-operate to make it a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be desirable to extend the date to November or later because the harvest may not be all gathered in and in certain areas farmers may find a difficulty in getting labour for threshing.  I wonder if beet pulling or potato lifting comes under the definition of &ldquo;harvesting&rdquo;. If so, work could be carried on until a later date than the one mentioned. There are snags in the scheme. As the Minister pointed out, such a scheme cannot work without the goodwill of farmers and workers.  That is the key to the problem.  I see many difficulties arising if there is not co-operation. If farmers need labour they should not merely employ men on dry days and leave them idle on wet days. This scheme cannot work without goodwill on both sides.  The type of farmers who need extra labour are not the ordinary tillage farmers who employ men all the year round.  They are non-tillage farmers and many of them have no facilities for boarding and lodging workers.  These workers should be advised to bring bicycles to the farms as they may have to travel three or four miles to and from work.  Otherwise, the scheme is a good one and deserves the co-operation of all Parties as well as farmers and workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the period in which the scheme will operate there will be no insuperable difficulty in having it extended if it should appear necessary that an extension was desirable.  The Minister for Agriculture was of opinion that the period to October 31 would suffice.  It will be appreciated that it is merely intended to provide under this scheme labour over and above local labour available to meet the peak need as it were of the harvest season.  If, however, because of weather conditions or other circumstances, there is a necessity to extend the scheme, the matter can be considered.  The organisation of the supply of labour to meet the needs of a group of farmers in a locality will <Col N="1370" /> be one of the main functions of the tillage inspectors, who will be in charge of the actual administration of the scheme.  They will endeavour to ensure that there will be no gap in the movements of workers, and that, as the labour needs of one farmer are met, the workers concerned will move to meet the needs of another farmer.  There may be difficulty in ensuring perfect arrangements in every district.  That will be a matter which will have the personal attention of the inspectors.</P>
      <P>It will, of course, be open to a farmer, and I agree with Deputy Morrissey that it is desirable, to provide the board and lodging for the workers concerned in their own buildings.  It is not intended, however, that they should provide the board and lodging free of charge.  The 4/- per day is a State contribution towards the cost of the worker's board and lodging, and if the farmer provides the board and lodging for the worker then the farmer can make whatever reasonable charge is appropriate for the service.  The worker is being put in the position that he will have his board and lodging provided more or less free by the State, and that the whole of the amount that he earns for his work will be available for him.  Difficulties will undoubtedly arise in some areas in providing suitable lodging accommodation, and that is one of the problems which have to be faced in connection with any scheme of this kind.  So far as the scheme is concerned, the obligation is put upon the farmer who is employing the labourer to ensure that there is suitable lodging available, but we can undertake to give to the farmers the active co-operation of the tillage inspectors in helping them to locate suitable houses in which lodging can be procured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that farmers may have difficulty in determining the exact date upon which their labour needs will exceed the local labour supply, but in circumstances such as we have to deal with here they will have to make the best estimate they can, and if it does mean that they have men in their employment a day or a few days earlier than they would require them, because of the fact that they have to be drawn <Col N="1371" /> from long distances, that is only a small part of the problem which they have to face.  It is to help these farmers to face the problem of saving their crops when they know there is not sufficient local labour available that the scheme is required.</P>
    <P>All forms of agricultural work come under the scheme.  It is a matter for the farmer to decide whether he wants a worker under the scheme.  He knows what he contracts to do if he takes a worker under the scheme.  He must provide board and lodging for him and pay the minimum rates prescribed in the scheme.  It is assumed that farmers, therefore, will avail of workers under the scheme only to the extent that local labour is not available; but for any agricultural purpose for which he may require labour he is entitled to get workers under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate I desire to raise a number of matters which affect the Minister's Department and the administration of the Department as it affects the Civil Service generally.  In November last in this House I raised the question of the general treatment by the Government of serving civil servants in the matter of their remuneration.  The Minister knows that in July, 1940, he stabilised the cost-of-living bonus which was paid under an agreement, whereby the bonus was increased or decreased in accordance with the rise or fall in the cost-of-living index figure. Although civil servants were treated with exceptional harshness inasmuch as their cost-of-living bonus, to which they had a moral and, up to then, a legal right, was stabilised in July, 1940, the Government felt it was not necessary to take similar or complementary steps in respect of outside workers until May, 1941.  I think the attitude of the Government in stabilising the cost-of-living bonus was particularly unfair, that it amounted to a repudiation of an agreement by which the Government was morally and legally bound, and that it amounted to a repudiation of an agreement under which Governments in office for the preceding 17 years had exacted every possible advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> I think it was particularly harsh that the Government should have singled out civil servants, and especially lower paid civil servants, for the stabilisation of their bonus in July, 1940, whereas in respect of outside workers the Government did not take any action until July, 1941.  I do not, of course, agree with the principle of the stabilisation of wages or bonus.  I think the position should be as in other countries&mdash;a system of negotiation between organisations representing the workers, on the one hand, and organisations representing the employers, on the other hand.  Where that method of arranging wages has been observed, a very much better economic position has been maintained and a better approximation of wages to living costs has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>I have pleaded with the Minister on many occasions that he should recognise that the stabilisation of the cost of living bonus in July, 1940, notwithstanding the paltry increases since granted to the staff by way of an emergency bonus, has left the generality of civil servants, and particularly the lower paid Post Office workers, in a very serious financial plight.  Many of the lower paid Post Office workers are unable to purchase the necessaries of life.  Their low rates of wages are incapable of providing them with a decent standard of living.  Many of these workers are in debt.  If the Minister were to take statements on oath from Post Office officials, he would discover that practically all of them owe money, because it is impossible for them to make ends meet on the notoriously low wage standards which are such a feature of the Post Office Department.  That is a situation with which the Minister can scarcely feel pleased, but it represents the cold economic truth so far as the Post Office staffs are concerned.</P>
    <P>Whatever case the Minister might have for the stabilisation of the cost of living bonus in respect of higher paid civil servants&mdash;and I doubt if he has any&mdash;he certainly ought not to treat the lower paid grades in the manner in which they have been treated. These officers have suffered very <Col N="1376" /> severely through the stabilisation of the bonus and their rates of wages are inadequate to provide them with a reasonable standard of living.  The speeches which the Minister made here on the subject indicate that no matter how he may try to keep a brave face in justification of the Government's action, he knows in his heart that large numbers of lowly paid civil servants are suffering hardships which no set of circumstances at present operating here can justify.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Minister again to examine this matter sympathetically. Large numbers of lowly paid officials, postmen, post office clerks, telephonists, engineering workers and part-time postmen throughout the country, are suffering acute hardships because of the stabilisation of the bonus.  I think, so far as the lower paid grades are concerned&mdash;those whose wages are not capable of providing them with a reasonable standard of living, not capable even of providing them with the barest necessaries of life&mdash;the Minister ought to examine their cases sympathetically and make some modification of the bonus regulations so as to provide these people with a greater emergency bonus than that which operates to-day.  It is most unfair that these persons should be included in the application of the stabilisation order.  The Minister should consider this subject retrospectively with the object of adjusting the unfair discrimination that has been made against lower paid civil servants, especially the lowly paid workers who serve in the Post Office and whose wage standards successive Ministers for Finance have been compelled to admit are unreasonably low.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the position of officers who retired on pension in recent years.  Many of the officers now on pension were employed in grades where the maximum basic wage was low.  On retirement their pensions were correspondingly low.  A good number of these officers retired when the cost-of-living index figure, taking July, 1914, as the base, was 50 or 55 or perhaps a little higher.  They retired in 1932 or 1934 and the index figure at that time swung between 50 <Col N="1377" /> and 65.  The index figure to-day is 190. The officers who retired in 1934 and later years have been compelled to live on a scale of pension appropriate to a cost-of-living index figure of from 50 to 65.  There was no increase granted to them and they have been compelled to suffer all the hardships of a rapidly rising index figure following a rapidly mounting cost of living.  Is it reasonable, having retired an officer on a pension appropriate to an index figure of 50 or 65, to expect that officer, after 40 years' service, to be able to live on that pension in circumstances when the cost-of-living index figure has increased to 190?  I am sure the Minister realises that it is most unreasonable to expect an officer to meet the hardships consequent on a rapid rise in the cost of living on a fixed pension based on a low index figure and, unfortunately, based on a low salary.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being compelled to recognise, in respect of serving officers in the Civil Service, and the Government are being compelled to recognise, in respect of workers in private industry, that the granting of an emergency bonus was necessary in order to tide the workers over hardships which are inseparable from a rapid rise in the cost of living.  If it is necessary to grant increases to serving officers in order to meet the difficulties arising out of a rapid increase in the cost of living, surely it is necessary to grant an increase to lowly-paid pensioners whose standard of income is lower than that of the serving officer and whose plight is all the more acute because of the fact that many of these officers retired when the index figure was substantially lower than it is to-day.  The fact that emergency bonuses have been granted to serving civil servants and outside workers generally is a clear indication that the Government recognise that hardship, due to a substantial rise in the cost of living, must be met by increases in the form of emergency bonuses.  But the retired officer is as subject to the increased cost of living as serving officers and workers in outside industries for whom the Government are authorising bonuses from time to time.</P>
    <P>I put it, therefore, to the Minister that the least the Government can do <Col N="1378" /> is to recognise the plight of those pensioners who retired on low pensions and who are suffering acute hardships because of the rapid rise in the cost of living.  I would ask the Minister to examine that matter personally and sympathetically and, if he does, I feel convinced that, in his conscience, he must come to the conclusion that an increase in those pensions is justified in order to enable the pensioners to meet the rapid increase in the cost of living.  Of course, the Minister may say that it is not possible to do that. He may say that there is some legislative or technical difficulty which prevents this being done.  Here, we have an increase in the cost of living, ascertained by the Department of Industry and Commerce to be approximately 70 per cent. over the level for 1939.  In Great Britain, the cost of living has risen by only 30 per cent. since 1939, but the British Government have recently been compelled to recognise the equity of granting increases to pensioners, and legislation to provide for an increase in pensions to retired officers in Britain has already been introduced if it has not, at this stage, been actually passed.  If the British and Northern Ireland Governments recognise the necessity for granting increases in pensions in areas where the cost-of-living index figure has increased by only 30 per cent., how much stronger is the case for an increase of pensions in the case of a country where the cost of living has increased not by 30 per cent., but by a minimum of 70 per cent., according to the Government's own figures?  If the Minister for Finance as a citizen recognises the equity of the case which I am pleading now, he should not wholly divest himself of his citizen feelings and human responsibilities as Minister for Finance.  The claim for an increase in the pensions of retired officers is one which is reinforced by every canon of justice.  The claim is unanswerable.  From the standpoint of its justice, the Minister requires no justification either to the Government or to the country for providing increases in the pensions of those officers who retired on low pension scales.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> There is one other matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  That is the question of the provision of pensions for officers in the Post Office who are not now pensionable. As the Minister knows, the Post Office Department employs a very large number of part-time officers. These are not temporary officers but are employed in a permanent part-time capacity.  They are described as auxiliary postmen.  Other classes are known as unestablished classes. Although employed in a permanent capacity, these-officers receive no pension whatever on retirement.  I think that the State should recognise that faithful service should be rewarded by a pension in old age.  The Government should introduce the necessary legislation to provide pensions for those permanent part-time officers and those permanent unestablished officers. Unfortunately, those grades are not pensionable to-day, with the result that, after serving the State and the community for 40 or 45 years, they are condemned to retire at 65 or 70 years of age without any pension whatever, although they may have served from the time they were 20 years of age.</P>
    <P>It is true that a fragmentary gratuity may be granted to some of them but it is always very small, representing no more than a few months pay in some cases and a few weeks pay in other cases.  Some of them receive nothing at all.  That gratuity makes no provision for the sustenance of the officer in the years which follow his retirement. The Dublin United Transport Company recently felt that it was necessary and equitable to provide a scheme of pensions for its workers.  The railway company have now announced the introduction of a scheme of pensions for railway workers.  If the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways Company can provide pensions for their employees, why cannot the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the State, provide a scheme of pensions for employees who served the State for 40 or 45 years?  Surely, if a private company feels its conscience stricken to the extent that it provides pensions for its <Col N="1380" /> retired employees, the State should have no less feeling as regards the provision of pensions for those who served the community for so long a period. Yet, we find the State quite satisfied to allow those persons to retire in penury, in circumstances which compel them to appeal to charitable organisations for sustenance.  The State is, apparently, quite complacent as to its responsibilities under conditions of that kind. I suggest to the Minister that, if he had a private employee who had served him for 40 years and was them compelled to retire because of ill-health or old age, he would feel in conscience bound to make provision for that employee's future, and would feel that he had a moral responsibility towards that person to provide a pension to sustain him in old age.  If the Minister had that feeling, as I am sure he would, in respect of an employee who had served him personally over a long period, he should have no less generous feelings as Minister for Finance towards employees of the State.  The State ought to be a model employer but, from the standpoint of providing pensions for those who are not now pensionable, the State is anything but a model employer. Private employers such as the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways Company have made provision for pensions for their employees but the heart of the State remains stony to demands for provision of pensions for those employees who have served it for the best part of their lives.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance, as I have appealed to him on previous occasions, personally to examine this matter.  I feel that there is an unanswerable case for the provision of pensions for those who served the State over long periods and were compelled to retire either through ill health or old age.  It is generally recognised in private industry that faithful service ought to carry a reward, and an increasing number of firms are making the necessary provision for pensions for their employees. The State ought not to lag behind in a matter of this kind and I strongly urge the Minister to examine this matter carefully.  If he is willing to consider the matter on representations. <Col N="1381" /> being made as to the hardships of officers who retired without pensions at 65 or 70 years of age, I shall be only too happy to present him with an abundance of evidence to convince him that the introduction of legislation to provide pensions ought not to be any longer delayed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Old age is sad enough but it is made extremely sadder by privation.&rdquo;  That is an extract from a letter from a pensioned school teacher who retired in 1940 on a pension based on pre-war conditions as to salary. This teacher says: &ldquo;This is an appeal to you to use your influence in the Dáil on behalf of the pensioned teachers.  Some of us are very badly hit, especially those of us with dependents. Through the high rents and abnormal cost of living, many of us cannot make ends meet, no matter how we try.  As for clothes, no new ones any more for us.&rdquo;  The letter goes on to ask me to approach the Minister on behalf of those teachers who have given 30 or 40 years' service and who are in receipt of miserable pensions based upon their pre-war salary.  I implore the Minister to give some consideration to that class of persons who, with their inadequate pensions, are trying to live up to the standard expected of them when they were in the service.  In many cases now they have to apply to the board of assistance for relief.  I shall hand the letter over to the Minister or send it to his Department, as it is one of the latest complaints I have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also raised more than once the position of retired postmen who, in many cases, are in receipt of 14/-, 15/- or 16/- per week pension which, at present prices, is just sufficient to give them dry bread and who have to depend on their sons or daughters or other relatives to maintain them.  I join in the appeal made to the Minister to give consideration to their case. Then there is the case of retired employees of local authorities.  The Minister has power to allow local authorities to give an increase to men who retired on small pensions or allowances. I do not know if there are any such cases before his Department for consideration at present, but I hope <Col N="1382" /> he will do something for those men who were forced to retire under the age limit during the past few years and make the increase retrospective. Their pensions are based upon the inadequate wage which they had up to the time of the outbreak of hostilities and now, with the increased cost of living, they and others in the same position find themselves depending upon friends.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask if it is the Minister's intention to do something for the unestablished civil servants in Leinster House, Government Buildings, the Stationery Office and other-Government Departments, who have very little chance of promotion.  We had the experience of one of them on the staff of this House dying rather unexpectedly a few weeks ago, a fine strong man who was admired by all of us who knew him.  I understand that that man had only been established a year or two before.  I am not aware what that establishment entitled him to, but I believe that six months' or a year's wages are due to his widow. The widow of an unestablished man, at any rate, would not be in the same position as the widow of an established man.  I would ask the Minister to try to do something for these persons. We are always appealing to outside employers to give of their best and, if we have men in the Government service who do not enjoy privileges in regard to holidays, gratuities or pensions, their cases should be looked into. I understand that there are men with 20 years' service in Government Buildings who have not yet been established. I believe it is only necessary to draw the Minister's attention to the matter so that, if they get a recommendation from their superior officer, they will get the same privileges as the others.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if it is true that in the Museum at present officials are working long hours owing to shortage of staff.  In that Department there are men working as hard as any labourer.  I am not quite sure, but I believe that in that Department there are men who have not been established, and that they are not getting the treatment that I believe the Minister would like to give them.  I suggets <Col N="1383" /> that an inquiry should be sent to the heads of the Departments to find out what the conditions of the lowly-paid workers or the junior civil servants are.  I believe the Minister would find that many persons are suffering hardships which should be relieved by his Department.  There may be cases of other persons in other Departments whom we do not come in contact with every day.  I think the Board of Works is controlled by the Minister's Department. At any rate, he finds the money for it.  I understand that in that Department they have a habit of subletting their contracts.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the appeal made on behalf of the unestablished staffs.  Anybody who has contact with the public services knows that there are men who have been working in the Government service for years and who are being deprived of the bonuses and other extras that might come their way because they are not established.  Everybody can understand people serving a reasonable apprenticeship, but keeping them for a great number of years without giving them a chance of promotion certainly creates a grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find it pleasant to have to stand up and defend any of the things of which Deputy Norton has complained.  But, taking <Col N="1384" /> all the aspects of the stabilisation of civil servants' cost-of-living bonus into consideration, examining it, purely objectively, trying to examine it even with some feelings of sympathy for the worker, I think it can be fully justified in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>There is no use in going over the question of the high cost of living at present.  Nobody can deny that the cost of living has gone up very much over what it was pre-war.  Some part of that high cost of living has been caused by increases, which the Dáil and the Government have agreed to, in the cost of public services, the increase of wages to workers and officials, and so on.  That cannot be denied, and it cannot be denied either that it has helped to raise the cost of living and to create some of the inflation which exists in the country at present.  We cannot deny that, and if we give out more money, by way of emergency bonus or by way of increased pensions, to former officials of the State&mdash;moneys which are given out without any corresponding increase in production&mdash;we are simply adding to the cost of living and also to the inflation that undoubtedly exists.  It would mean that we would be giving out money with one hand to servants of the State&mdash;and let us admit at once that many of them, such as those in receipt of pensions, served the community loyally and well for many years and are now suffering hardships; we can take that for granted&mdash;but we would be taking it away from them with the other hand. If we give them increased benefits now, such as an increase in the emergency bonus, without being able to provide for increased production, we will not be helping them, because the cost of living is bound to go up as a result of such increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the unfortunate position. The more money we allow to be put into circulation under present conditions, without being able to ensure increased production, the higher the cost of living must go, and therefore what we are giving out with the one hand, we are taking away with the other hand.  That is the position, and, therefore, <Col N="1385" /> if we were to give this proposed relief, we would not be improving the conditions of these lowly-paid workers even one bit.  I know that it is very difficult to get such workers, who want a few extra shillings a week for their families, to see things from that point of view, but, nevertheless, that is the position.  I have had to meet the clamour, to a certain extent, during the last couple of years in this regard, and agreed to pay emergency bonuses in regard to certain classes of people. I argued the case with the Government, as I am arguing it now here, and I pointed out the difficulties of the situation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the organised workers of the State&mdash;the highly-paid workers, in fact, as well as the lowly-paid workers of the State&mdash;did clamour for the payment of emergency bonuses, and we met them to some extent, but I do not think that they are really any better off as a result of getting that emergency bonus, and although I realise the hardships that many civil servants are suffering, especially in the case of the more lowly-paid members of that service, I do not think they are any better off.  In fact, I have read of and seen cases put up by these civil servants&mdash;the higher-paid civil servants, as well as the more lowly-paid civil servants, and especially those with large families&mdash;showing the sacrifices that they had to make as a result of the increased cost of living.  Let us admit that they are making sacrifices and are hard hit, but I do not think they would be better off if they were given another 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. increase in emergency bonus from this to the end of the emergency period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am afraid not, knowing the facts as I do.  I have had all these things examined.  My personal desire, both as Minister for Finance and as an individual, would be to meet these people so far as I could but my position as Minister and also as a private individual, imposes upon me the duty of closely examining the financial effect of any such increase, and I cannot see that there would be any justice either to the people who are themselves concerned or to the State in meeting them in that way.  If I could lower the cost of living, I should like to do so.  If I could meet these people in that way, I should be only too happy to do so, but I cannot do it.  I know that, as time goes on, I shall be pressed again in the House here, by the representatives of organisations of State workers, and even by members of the Government, as I have been before, to meet the clamour of State employees in regard to this matter.  It is not, however, a question merely of saving money.  That is not what prevents me from giving this increase.  We are paying this year, roughly, £1,000,000 by way of emergency bonus to certain classes of State employees.  Now, £1,000,000 is a large sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, that is what we are doing by paying out this emergency bonus: feeding the dog, as the Deputy says, with its own tail, but that is not a very healthy position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but still you are saving it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we save, roughly, about £1,500,000 at present, and that is a very considerable sum; but while I should be prepared to ask the Government to increase the bonus, <Col N="1387" /> if I thought that that would help the situation, I honestly am not convinced that State employees would be any better off.  I am certain that the community, generally, would not be better off because, if the cost of living has to be offset by these increased bonuses, then that will affect the whole community and not civil servants alone.  There is one thing that I should like to say, even though it is a repetition, with regard to civil servants, and that is that we must bear in mind that, as compared with other classes of the community, they are in a very secure position.  Even the most lowly-paid members amongst them have security of employment.  They are permanent employees who know that, at the end of the week or the month, as the case may be, their cheques will arrive&mdash;small as they may be&mdash;and they can budget accordingly.  Now, the present emergency has caused wholesale unemployment amongst industrial and commercial employees.  There is no security for them.  In many cases, they have had to leave this country; they have had to go abroad, to leave their families for many years in order to provide for them, and God knows how many years it may be before some of them will be able to come back again&mdash;those of them who have been lucky enough to get employment abroad.  Apart from this security of employment, the civil servant, in the majority of cases, at any rate, has his pension to look forward to.  These workers to whom I refer, and who are more numerous than civil servants or State workers who are in permanent employment and have secure positions, have no pension to look forward to in a great many cases.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I repeat it is not pleasant to have to meet civil servants in these circumstances.  I met them in greater numbers during the election campaign than I would normally meet them.  A great many civil servants live in my own constituency.  I met numbers of them individually; I visited the homes of some of them; I heard their cases, and I talked to them as I am talking to this House now and put up the <Col N="1388" /> same arguments.  Many of them, I am happy to say, though not all of them, saw the reasonableness of my arguments, and realised that the State and the community were going through very difficult times and that perhaps they were not as badly off as many others in the community.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now of those I met in my own constituency but I am sure that that is true of civil servants all over the country, that they realise their position though they naturally would like to see it somewhat bettered. It is true, of course, as Deputy Norton pointed out, that an exceptional hardship was borne by civil servants from the fact that their bonus was stabilised roughly a year earlier than were the wages of other workers. I tried to get the wages of other workers stabilised at the same time but I did not succeed.  There was a variety of reasons why that was not accomplished.  I am afraid, however, that civil servants will have to bear that exceptional hardship described by Deputy Norton and be satisfied that they are not as badly off as some other classes in the community.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, many of the lowly-paid pensioners are in a bad position.  I am having the position with regard to many classes of these pensioners examined at the present time.  The matter has been under consideration for some time and while I am still definitely of the opinion that any further payment of emergency bonuses is not going to be helpful to the community as a whole, I would rather see something given to these poorly-paid pensioners&mdash;teachers and others&mdash;than that they should be forced to appeal to the local authorities for home help. I am told that some of them have had to do that.  All I can say at the moment is that I am having the question examined.</P>
    <P>In almost all Departments of State, there are unestablished officers.  They are to be found in all classes.  Some of the highest servants of the State are unestablished, officers who came in here in the days when the British Government controlled the Services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the young <Col N="1389" /> officers who have come into the Service since this State was established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also numbers who came in as unestablished officers since the State was founded. They are to be found almost in every Department&mdash;professional men, doctors, engineers, lawyers, as well as ordinary workers in various State Departments&mdash;the Post Office, Board of Works, Agriculture, Forestry, etc. There are thousands of them and I cannot take out any one class and establish them leaving the others unestablished. If this question of unestablished officers is to be dealt with at all, it must be dealt with in a wholesale way.  Our pension bill at present is a high one and represents a heavy liability.  Before the war, the Minister for Finance, my predecessor, started an actuarial investigation to ascertain what our annual bill for pensions, the annual liability for all servants of the State who are entitled to pension, actually was.  We are not sure exactly what our pension liability is at present but it is going to be a very big figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we come to any decision as to establishing any large numbers of officers now unestablished in the State services, we ought to know what our present liability for pensions is and what our future liability will be if we do alter the system of having unestablished officers in the State service. We have not been able to complete the actuarial investigation.  The war interrupted it.  Unfortunately the man who was told off to do that work had to be taken from it and given other important work to do.  I hope that before long we shall be able to get that investigation restarted.  It will take some time but when it is completed, we shall have a true picture of what our pension liability is and what the liability might be in altered circumstances if we decide to establish unestablished officers.  Then it will be for the Minister for Finance and the Government, and later on the Dáil, to decide whether they will undertake the heavy liability that would be imposed on the State as a whole if the thousands&mdash;and there are thousands&mdash; of officers at present unestablished in <Col N="1390" /> the various Department were established and made pensionable.</P>

      <P>I am not certain. I know the officer in question is doing other important work at present. There is hardly a week in the year that <Col N="1391" /> I have not this question of unestablished officers of one kind or another brought to my notice.  In the last week or two I have had the case of men who gave very valuable service in what would be regarded as very important and responsible positions in one Department brought to my notice. Several of them are now about to retire.  They have served the State, as Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton said, for 20, 25 or 30 years, and they go out now without any pension. Some of them have given 20 or 30 years' service, of which the first 15 years was unestablished service and does not count for pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are all sorts of anomalies in the present Civil Service.  There are all sorts of conditions of employment and some day or another we shall have to have a clean sweep and try to put them all on one basis or another, but the position of many of these people with long years of service differs in a variety of ways.  Some of them after ten years' service were entitled to be established in some Department and some after 15 years' service, while some have no claim to establishment after giving service as good as the service of anybody else in another Department. These anomalies were not invented by this Government or previous Governments. They were contractual obligations taken on as the individuals were taken into the service of the new State, but there are, as Deputy Byrne reminds us, in our own service men who entered the service of the State after its establishment as unestablished officers who are not entitled to pensions under the law as it stands.  In some cases&mdash;maybe not in all&mdash;they get an <i>ex gratia</i> allowance when they die or leave the service, but the general tendency of the world, and the general tendency even here at home, seems to be in the direction of more security for the worker who has given loyal service for a number of years.  The example referred to already of the action recently taken in this city shows the tendency of large employment in general, and naturally notice must be taken of the tendency and the action of these larger employments and of the <Col N="1392" /> general pressure which even in this House will be in the direction of the adoption of methods of the kind to meet workers' demands as the years go on.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners conduct open examinations, and in due course it is possible to purchase, through the Government Publications Office, a copy of the papers set and a copy of the results.  These papers and results are purchased, not only by candidates who have competed in the examinations, but often by potential candidates as well, so that they may <Col N="1394" /> look at the syllabus and papers set, and generally study the marking for the examinations.  A number of limited examinations is held by the Civil Service Commissioners.  These examinations being limited, the papers and results are not published.  The reason may be that there is not sufficient public interest to justify publication, and one can readily understand that point of view, but there is one aspect of the holding of these examinations to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>Every candidate who competes in an examination not only likes to get his own marks in the different subjects, so that he can attend to those subjects which are a source of weakness, but to know how he stands in relation to the rest of the competitors, and to see what the standard of marking in a particular subject is.  Let us assume that in a particular examination there is a maximum mark of 300 for Irish, and a candidate in the examination who gets his marks discovers that he has got 150 marks in Irish.  That gives him the information that he has got half marks in Irish.  A 50 per cent. mark may be good if the highest mark in Irish is 60 per cent., but he does not know whether the highest mark is 51 per cent. or 99 per cent., because he does not know the results of the examination generally.</P>
      <P>Is there any real difficulty in giving a candidate who sits for a limited examination a copy of the results, so as to enable him not merely to know his own marks, but to ascertain the general standard of marking?  Merely to give a candidate his own results gives him no indication at all as to how he did in the examination in relation to other candidates.  He knows his own marks, but he does not know the highest mark in a particular subject, and does not know what standard he has reached.  Unless he can get the marks of the highest candidate and the other competitors, he cannot know generally how he has done.  It cannot be a very difficult job to produce the marks of 100 competitors in an examination.</P>

      <P>I can say that it was available until recently.  Maybe that was through error and, as a matter of fact, it is the recent correction of the error which induces me to raise the matter now.  I suggest that the matter should be put on a satisfactory basis and that every candidate in a limited examination ought to get not only his own results but the results of the whole examination.  My main concern is in seeing that a candidate may know not only his own marks but the standard of marking in the examination and be able to look after whatever weaknesses are revealed in a particular subject.  I do not think there is any insuperable difficulty in the matter, and I feel that studious people who want to compete in examinations in order to improve themselves are entitled to any encouragement the State can give them.</P>

Since the inception of this Act in 1924&mdash;I am taking the whole period from the enactment of the first Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act to date&mdash; guarantees were given in 98 cases, involving 113 separate guarantees.  There were 43 firms which received 51 separate guarantees and repaid them in full.  In 25 cases, receivers were appointed. On the Second Reading, I said 24, but that was the figure up to 31st March; one additional receiver was appointed since that date.  In the remaining cases, involving 60 guarantees, the companies are still operating. The total amount of loans guaranteed up to 31st March was £1,160,440.  The total amount of the loans which were repaid in full was £411,271.  The total issues from the Central Fund were £390,722, and the amount subsequently recovered and paid into the Central Fund against that expenditure was £77,835.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>We indicated this morning that, in order to facilitate the House in adjourning to-day, the general matters that we intended to discuss would be raised on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department. The position already disclosed here, in regard to certain sections of the population who are suffering very much as a result of present circumstances, only drives home the necessity for a clear view of our present position and a clear outlook on what we are going to do with the country and its resources for the benefit of all our people in the immediate future.  At this stage of the last war we, in this country, were all united in an effective way with a clear out look on both our political and economic needs.  At that time we were making it very clear to the world as a whole that we stood for certain things in the matter of life and civilisation, and that for the purpose of working these out in our own way we required to be completely free and sovereign in our own country, no longer dominated by any Power from outside.  We fully understood one another from one end of the country to the other.  While we had some difficult times in front of us, following the last war, nevertheless, the outlook of the country generally, and the way in which its spiritual and material strength was braced by a realisation of what it was trying to do and what its national objective was, brought us safely through all our difficulties. When we look back over the position in which we were at, shall I say, the present phase of the last war, we must indeed marvel at the extent to which we have advanced since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now find ourselves, with the exception of the Partition of this country, complete masters of all our resources and destinies, so that internally we can be masters of these things. We find that we have fully developed Parliamentary institutions which are completely fitted to the wishes and desires of our people.  We have an Army, a police force and a Civil Service: we have all the machinery that a <Col N="1401" /> people could possibly wish to have to enable them to develop the resources of their country, to make use of their advantages and opportunities, to see that the people had reasonably decent and effective lives, and to show that the spirit of the people was being developed through a civilisation that was reflected in their lives.  We have all these things now, and yet I do not think that our people were ever more dissipated or confused as to what they are expected to do, either individually or collectively, with their lives.  We are adjourning to-day.  One may say, that, when we meet again in a couple of months' time, we will be not only at the threshold, but will have gone across the threshold, of a new period in our own history and in world history. We are crossing that threshold not only without plans of any kind, but without any principles established in our minds to guide us in the development of the matters I speak of.</P>
    <P>We were asked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day to get and read the recent British statement on &ldquo;Employment Policy&rdquo; which brings to focus a lot of the thought, memoranda and planning that in Great Britain they have been thinking and writing about for the last two or three years of the war. That has been described in Great Britain as a revolutionary approach to economic policy.  It is really the first authoritative document dealing with that subject.  The Minister, while calling our attention to it, also called our attention to the enormous amount of work and study that has been done in a systematic way by other countries, even in the stress of war, in that way, with the object of laying down the solid ground along which the efforts of their people can be organised, and of seeing that the resources of their countries are made available for every class and group in their communities so that there may be a worthy and dignified civilisation in their countries, and so that they may make use of the resources which the Lord has given them to enable them to live decent and pretty comfortable lives. We see the headings to which thought has been given in such a systematic way in Great Britain.  I take Great <Col N="1402" /> Britain particularly, because we have more information about it and it is easier to get information about it. The document that we have been invited by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Supplies to read is a British document, which is certainly in advance of anything prepared in other countries and perhaps, more realistic than anything we have been able to lay our hands on so far.</P>
    <P>We see the ground covered in Great Britain by work and thought and it is brought home to us that the first thing they are realising is that the future of the people rests on education. In this document on &ldquo;Employment Policy&rdquo; it is made clear that, not only is production in the future to be the safeguard of their people and provide them with employment, but that, in order to be continuous and stable, it must be efficient production.  Not only business people, educationists and trade unionists, but every section of the people in Great Britain has been concentrated on thinking of what is required in education, so that their people may be effective producers on the one hand and good citizens on the other hand. In every direction, it is accepted that the basis of their economic, their spiritual and their defensive strength in the future is to be education.</P>
    <P>There are many publications of one kind or another that indicate how far they are prepared to go.  The recent legislation that has been passed in Great Britain shows that they intend to increase the number of their teachers by one-third, to raise the school-leaving age and to raise the status of the teacher; so that, by increasing the number and status of teachers and by co-ordinating the various branches of education in every possible way, their citizens will be prepared for to-morrow.  At no point in the education of the young will a stop be allowed in the educational process which might cause waste of intelligence or waste of human material?</P>
    <P>Before the recent legislative proposals were brought in, a document was issued from the Nuffield College, signed by some 40 prominent people, from all walks of life, including a very <Col N="1403" /> considerable number of industrialists. There are some points I wish to quote, to indicate how thoroughly the matter has been approached.  Paragraph 11 of the recommendations says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That all normal children who are expected to leave school at the statutory age should follow up to that age a broadly non-vocational course, and that the learning of any specific trade should be postponed until a satisfactory groundwork of general education has been laid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 14 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a system of compulsory part-time education between the school-leaving age and 18 should be introduced immediately after the war and should be extended as rapidly as possible to the point at which the working time of young persons will be divided with approximate equality between education and employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in general, it is undesirable for trade apprenticeships to begin before 16 or for those entering upon them to leave school before that age, and that accordingly scholarships and maintenance allowances should be made available for this purpose, pending a general raising of the leaving age to 16.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 19 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That apprenticeship should rest on a foundation of all-round workshop training combined with specialized trade education, and that all employers taking apprentices should arrange for half their work-time up to 18 to be devoted to education, including vocational education, and should give every possible facility for those over 18 to attend higher courses and prepare for vocational examinations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In various ways, it has been brought home to all the people there that the Government bases its hopes and plans, for industrial and other development, on thoroughly sound education, and that nothing has been left undone by the Government, even under present difficulties, to lay secure and effective foundations for that purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> According to our national tradition, we, too, put education as the basis of our material prosperity and the safeguard of our spiritual outlook in the world of to-day.  It has been the tradition of our people in the past to glorify and idealise education in its broadest possible way, and to fix it with a spiritual as well as a material ideal, so as to link our education with our daily work.  No one will say that our people as a whole are inspired with any kind of educational idea that is developed or propagated from on top.  Over the greater part of the country, children are leaving school at 14&mdash;in the City of Dublin, five or six thousand boys leave the primary schools every year&mdash;with very little hope of getting employment.  The period between the time the young person leaves school and the time that young person finds employment is really destructive of any kind of discipline or education obtained during the school period.  In such circumstances we are trying to restore, particularly through our schools, the Irish language&mdash;a work which, in the first place, is difficult, and secondly is without any kind of helpful gesture from on top.</P>
    <P>That is one way in which, unfortunately, we are facing the future.  We cannot walk into the new world and the new period before our country in that state of affairs.  The Government must, in the immediate future, do something to give the country a lead, by a White Paper, or a general statement of our educational position, and of the educational plan and programme before our people, with some idea as to the destinies we want to work out for ourselves in the new world.</P>
    <P>The population in our schools in the rural areas is going down.  The schools here in the city are so crowded that, in certain parts&mdash;as I have complained before&mdash;there are infant classes of 80, 90 and 100 children, all under one teacher, in circumstances in which there can be no real disciplining of the children, not to speak of any education for them.  Our training colleges are being shut down, and, generally, there is a most chaotic state <Col N="1405" /> of mind and fact at the head of our whole educational system.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to that as a state of affairs that cannot continue, and that we must all brace ourselves to put into proper perspective.  It is not sufficient for the Government to say that they are waiting for ideas on the subject.  Individual groups see an aspect of the problem from one point of view or another, but individual Deputies are cut away from any opportunity of reviewing our whole educational requirements in a systematic way.  The whole machinery of the Department of Education and of the Government should be taking the lead in presenting such facts and ideas as they have so that these might be added to by criticism of a constructive or destructive kind, either by the publication of Government plans on one hand and the criticism of Parliament on the other hand, so that a national mind could be formed and a national decision taken on our problems.  That is one of the outstanding ways in which, at a very critical moment in our history, both materially and spiritually, the Government has failed.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of questions that have been thoroughly examined in Great Britain concerns health, as related to the well-being of their people and their capacity for doing national work.  We had a discussion here recently on the incidence of T.B. and the Minister for Local Government indicated that he was doing an enormous amount about it.  Not only is there the urgent requirement of dealing with people who have, unfortunately in increasing numbers, been stricken with tuberculosis, but there is the whole preventive side of the disease to be dealt with.  Any medical practitioner, whether he is dealing with the eyes, the nose, the throat, or any other specialised side of disease, will say that the foundation and root of many diseases, and of the physical weaknesses of our people, arise from malnutrition. We have come to the stage now in which we should thoroughly face up to the question of what is a proper standard of nutrition for our people.  When I was Minister for Local Government I endeavoured to have that question faced up to by the <Col N="1406" /> Department.  At that time it was possible to get a leaflet which had been issued by the Department of Agriculture telling how a pig should be fed when it was three or four weeks old. If one Department thought it worth while to issue such a leaflet the Department of Public Health ought to be able to get out a leaflet about the health of human beings.  I was given information as to where the responsibility lay but there were other things to be dealt with then and the matter was left aside.  From what we have had an opportunity of learning of the position I think we require a serious and systematic examination of the nutritional requirements of ordinary people, so that when we have to deal with public assistance, poverty, and the sustenance of people in a proper way, whether by relief or by wages, we will have a national standard of what nutritional requirements should be. Not only would the nation avoid the serious loss that results from illnesses and physical weakness, but it would be one way of keeping in our people a progressive and healthy outlook, both on their own work and on the national public work.</P>
    <P>On the question of treating tuberculosis in time, we will, please God, soon reach a time when we can say that none of the emergency services that we have organised are likely to be required.  We have organised in various places in some of the larger residential houses temporary hospitals for use as emergency depots for A.R.P. and other purposes.  They are being kept idle for the reception of casualties resulting from military and other operations.  I think in September next we shall be able to say that these places are no longer required for such purposes, and that if there is an urgent tuberculosis problem to be dealt with some of the arrangements made for dealing with casualties arising from feared military contingencies might be turned over to a problem that is just as urgent as any military problem.  We have the education problem, the general problem of health, as well as the employment of our people, to face. If we only look at the first two pages of the statement on the unemployment problem that the Minister asked us to <Col N="1407" /> look at, we find that many questions arise.  We find them discussed systematically and decisions taken on them.  I know of no way in which,in our position, systematic discussion could be originated and be most effectively kept to the point other than by the Government addressing themselves to these questions and making an official statement of some kind, preferably in a White Paper, as to the general lines upon which they consider they should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Under the heading, &ldquo;The International and Industrial Background&rdquo;, the British pamphlet on employment policy states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A country dependent on exports &mdash;and relying largely, as we do, on the export of manufactured goods of high quality&mdash;needs prosperity in its overseas markets.  This cannot be achieved without effective collaboration among the nations.  It is therefore an essential part of the Government's employment policy to co-operate actively with other nations in the first place for the reestablishment of general economic stability after the shocks of the war, and next for the progressive expansion of trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Vote for External Affairs the Taoiseach's statement to-day that this country was prepared to collaborate in every possible way with every other country in discussions, and in taking decisions on matters of mutual international interest, is quite satisfactory, but it is also one upon which we require a certain amount of information.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of the pamphlet says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government are considering, with the Governments of others of the United Nations, how these general agreements regarding the common ends of international economic policy can best be carried out in practice.  For this purpose they are working in close consultation with the Governments of the Dominions and of India.  The early renewal of the economic strength of the British Commonwealth of Nations and the economic development of our <Col N="1408" /> Colonial dependencies are among the substantial contributions we can make to stability in the world's economic order.  The Government will also collaborate with other Governments in considering how effect may be given to the principles and recommendations recently put forward by the International Labour Organisation. Further reports on all these matters will be made to Parliament in due course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are free of the impact of the war. We are connected with Great Britain, United States, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the other countries of the British Commonwealth. We are members of the League of Nations and the International Labour Office, and we all know that a considerable amount of thought and discussion has been proceeding for the past couple of years on matters vitally affecting the improvement of the standard of living of people throughout the world, all leading up to the main idea enshrined in this British document regarding full employment. The time is coming when we should have some information about what our part has been in connection with these discussions.  When we read in these documents how important international trade is to the policy of full employment, and when we read that &ldquo;early renewal of the economic strength of the British Commonwealth of Nations is amongst the substantial contributions we can make to stability in the world's economic order,&rdquo; our minds naturally go back to the opportunities we had and that we lost for improving our international trade in the past.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of our future, it is most desirable that we should know what is being done at present to increase our economic strength by increasing our trade with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  After the Ottawa Conference in 1932, there was a considerable increase in the trade between Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Taking the value of the exports of the various Dominions to Great Britain between 1931 and 1937, we find that <Col N="1409" /> Australia increased the value of its exports to Great Britain by £26,000,000, or 57 per cent.; that Canada increased its exports by £55,000,000, or 169 per cent.; that South Africa increased its exports by £4,800,000, or 37 per cent.; that New Zealand increased its exports by £12,000,000, or 32 per cent., and India by £28,000,000, or 77 per cent.  At a number of Imperial Conferences up to 1931, having fixed in an unequivocal way the absolute sovereignty and independence of this country while a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we wanted at Ottawa to improve our economic position as a result of membership of the Commonwealth. The figures I have quoted give some idea of how other members of the Commonwealth were able to improve their economic strength as a result of their discussions there.  We have not taken advantage of that, but the future is before us with all its possibilities, and we can learn from the past.  We do know that there were discussions during the past year between other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and that they dealt with their future economic relations as between one another, and with the possibilities of improving their position by joint action.  We do not want to probe into what the Government did or omitted to do in connection with these things.  We want to face the future.  In doing that, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand look forward to increasing their strength by mutual co-operative action.  In fact, in recent months, they have been making agreements for the future.  We cannot step forward into the new era that will open up in September next, both for this Parliament and our people, without getting some idea of our plans for improving our economic strength by systematic trade relationships with those people with whom we were most associated in the past.</P>
    <P>Just as the writer on economic policy in Great Britain has pointed out that a country that is dependent on exports needs not only prosperity in its markets but also collaboration we, who are largely dependent for our prosperity on exports, must take <Col N="1410" /> account of the position.  That is not to say that we have not an internal economic problem of our own that could not be dealt with as a separate entity.  When we say that we want exports, that does not necessarily mean that we want exports because we require imports.  The economist may say that a country requires exports in order to pay for its imports but, just like other countries, we want exports for another purpose.  We want exports so as to give employment here. There are tremendous potentialities for the increase of agricultural production here.  We want export markets in order that we may have increased agricultural production.  It would follow from that that the cost of agricultural produce here would be cheapened for us.  If our farmers are organised to produce greater quantities of goods, by reason of the fact that they will have to sell them in a highly competitive market, such as Britain, their efficiency will be increased and they will aim at higher quality.  We never ran short of eggs, bacon or butter until we had none of these things to export.  We are particularly concerned with the future of our agricultural trade.  It will not do to face blindly into the new world without any consideration or any discussion in Parliament or amongst our people.  One thing the various countries are insistent upon&mdash;that speed in taking advantage of opportunities is necessary if those opportunities are not to be lost to other claimants.</P>
    <P>In page 26 of this document it is stated that the British Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;intend to establish on a permanent basis a small central staff qualified to measure and analyse economic trends and submit appreciations of them to the Ministers concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It particularly emphasises that speed is necessary.  Here is a further quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The success of the Government's policy will thus depend on the skill which is shown in putting general ideas into day-to-day practice.  It is therefore vital for them to obtain, more fully and much more quickly <Col N="1411" /> than they have in the past, exact quantitative information about current economic movements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we ran into this emergency in 1939, we put it to the Government that the economic circumstances were going to be serious for us and we asked the Government to do as the Australian Government was doing.  In Australia they set up Professor Copeland as an economic expert.  We asked them to set up a group of three people, such as those on the Banking Commission, to watch developments in this country and outside it, so that we might be in a position to take advantage here of the trend of events.  The Government's line was that they were watching all that.  If they have been watching all that, they have not helped us by statements in the House or by publications; they have not helped the people to understand the trend of things in the world which are of importance to our people and their economic life, nor have they shown in the policy they have put before us that they are clearly conscious that there are particular trends of vital economic importance to this country.  These are considerations which must be faced straight away.  We read in paragraph 5, page 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the Government will spare no effort to create, in collaboration with other Governments, conditions favourable to the expansion of our export trade, it is with industry that the responsibility and initiative must rest for making the most of their opportunities to recover their export markets and to find fresh outlets for their products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What the British Government say with regard to industry applies definitely here with regard to agriculture. Unless our farmers, on their own responsibility and their own initiative, organise and produce increased agricultural products, the Government will not do it.  The Government may create a set of circumstances that may off-set and obstruct the satisfactory doing of the farmer's work or the satisfactory sale of his products, but the Government cannot produce and <Col N="1412" /> cannot market, and what the farmers want immediately is assistance from the Government, an indication of their opportunities, and an assurance that the obstacles that may lie in their path in the immediate future in external markets will be brushed away as far as they can be, and that the greatest possible co-operation and goodwill will be established in these markets for our farmers or their representatives when they find their way there with goods to offer.</P>
    <P>And just as it applies to our agriculturists, it applies also to our industrialists. The idea seems either to have been created among the industrialists here, or definitely conveyed to them by the Government, that any trade agreements between industrialists here and the suppliers of the raw material outside has to be looked after by the Government.  You have the British Government, on the contrary, putting it up to industrialists that it requires their own developed sense of initiative and responsibility to face the future. It seems to me the Government here have put obstructions in the way of industrialists planning for their future.  At any rate, the Government are not opening out any vision to our industrialists as to the opportunities which lie in front of them, or as to the things they are prepared to do to help them, or the things that are expected of our industrialists in the future.  We want a very considerable development and an increase in our industry here if we are to provide our people with anything like full employment.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can face the future without clear ideas about the general use of money.  Some two years ago, on the 25th March, 1942, dealing with the subject of world trade after the war, a writer in the London <i>Times</i> referred to certain matters.  This is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a growing body of opinion in this country which holds that what is required is not merely a new financial technique but a drastic revision of all our old ideas of finance and economics.  According to this view mass and power production, vastly improved transport <Col N="1413" /> facilities, the establishment of great monopolistic combinations, and amalgamations have already destroyed the foundations of the old economic system.  These developments have made our economic thinking and our financial practice as much out of date as tanks and aeroplanes had made our military thinking, training and equipment.  The economic problems of peace can be tackled with any hope of success only if we revise our economic notions and our ways of doing and financing business as thoroughly as our early disasters in the war are forcing us to revise our military conceptions and practices.</P>
    <P>In war-time the only limits on production are those set by the available man-power and raw materials. It is financed by credits which, although they are issued by the banks in the form of loans, are really national credit owing their value not to any stocks of bullion held by the banks, but to the capacity of the country to provide the goods and services for which its currency constitutes a claim.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to quote a paragraph from the writings of Mr. Churchill in his book <i>World Crisis.</i>  This is what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In his <i>World Crisis</i> Mr. Churchill has described the situation at the end of the last war and the sudden change which occurred at 11 o'clock on November 11th, 1918:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;A requisition, for instance, for 500,000 houses would not have seemed more difficult to comply with than those we were already in process of executing for 100,000 aeroplanes, or 20,000 guns, or the medium artillery of the American Army, or 2,000,000 tons of projectiles. But a new set of conditions began to rule from 11 o'clock onwards. The money cost, which had never been considered by us to be a factor capable of limiting the supply of the armies, asserted a claim to priority from the moment the fighting stopped.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the quotation, but then the article goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" />&ldquo;This reversion to the traditional money criterion as a limit on production and employment for which the real resources of organisation, labour, and capital equipment were available in plenty was possibly the master blunder, from which have flown inevitable sequence all the frustrations and miseries of the past 20 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are to-day in the position that, unless we review our approach to finances, we are likely, in addition to other blunders of ignorance or negligence, to hang a terrible load of misery around our people through failing to use money in the way in which money ought to be used.  We could have men and women and material ready and food and clothing and houses and the other things that may be required.  The Government have shown no indication, in some of our discussions on finance, that their minds are travelling in any way with the minds of progressive thinkers in the world with relation to the proper handling of money.</P>
    <P>They must know that money has been used in a particular way in the war, and that confessions such as are made in the London <i>Times</i> as long ago as two years, can never be gone back on, and that unless we make up our minds that we are going to use money in a useful and effective way, we are going to be left with very great problems.  I have repeated the challenge to that type of thinking that we find amongst some of the old Irish speakers, when they say: &ldquo;Fuilingeann fuil fuil do'n ghorta, ach ní fhuilingeann fuil fuil á dhortadh,&rdquo; that is, that people are outraged when they see blood spilt, but they tolerate in the strangest possible way the wastage of life and the destruction of life that goes on where there is poverty, starvation and neglect of one kind or another. The problems that we have to deal with here for to-day, and the problems and misery that we have to avoid for to-morrow demand of us the exercise of the same energy, intelligence, vigour and co-operation with one another as other peoples have shown they are able to give in order to meet the disasters of war.  If we, looking <Col N="1415" /> back on the past, comparing our position at this phase of this war with our position at a similar phase in the last war, do not thank Providence for the advance we have made, for the dangers we have escaped and the opportunities that lie ahead, then we are going to have no position worth while in the new world, and our country which stood for something during and after the last war is going to stand for nothing in this war when we could be the one country in the world, I might say, that would be holding out a beacon light of hope, faith and courage to unfortunate people in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>In addressing myself to these matters on the Taoiseach's Estimate, I do so in order to emphasise that we are adjourning to-day for a couple of months, and that we will be facing a new world and a new era in our history and in world history when we return in September.  We must face it with the determination that we are going clearly to see the principles upon which our national life will be guided in future, and that we are going to put our plans down in black and white so that we will have a common thought and a common base-line of thought to which we can direct our discussions and our debates and so that our people in the country will have a chance of developing a common mind from the discussions that go on in Parliament, and having a common mind, that their energies will be stimulated and that they will be encouraged to go ahead with the work that does lie before us.  The Government must take up their responsibility in that matter in a clear and effective way.  They must take each one of these aspects of our national life and they must document them with State papers that will clearly show out the facts of our national life and the lines upon which they consider progress should be made so that parliamentary discussions will be informed by clear statements of fact, and that there will be a clear indication of line of policy from the Government. If we get that, then I do not think we need be afraid of any difficulties that may lie ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> At the end of the last war, bigger difficulties confronted us than we dreamt that we might be able to surmount. Providentially, we got through them, and providentially we find ourselves to-day completely untouched by war, with full power over our own business, with a Parliament where nothing from outside can interfere with our discussions.  In the circumstances we should be the last people in the world that would show not only lack of faith or lack of hope, but lack of activity.  If there is one thing that is absent to-day, disastrously so, it is activity on the part of the Government in doing the work that it should do if there were to be informed and successful discussions in Parliament and if there were to be information given, and, therefore, successful co-operation by our people throughout the country in dealing with those aspects and problems of national life the solution of which will provide full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to the Parliamentary Secretary that there were a few points I wished to raise on this Estimate.  A special matter is the price of milk.  I do not wish to repeat what I said nearly 12 months ago when the Taoiseach's Estimate was before the House, but many of the remarks I made on that occasion remain true.  It is my opinion that when this war is over, the main point in regard to outside markets will be, not so much the price of the goods but the availability of goods.  Therefore, what we must aim at is increased production.  There is no reason why we should not increase production in all branches of agriculture.  That should be the policy of the Government.  I wish specially to refer to the position as regards milk production in this country and to make it plain, as I have already stated, that our position as regards butter is going to be much worse in the coming winter than it has been.  We are going to have stricter rationing.  The reason for that is the cheese-paring policy of the Government towards the producers.  I do not come from a dairy county but I fully realise the importance of these matters.  We say definitely that that cheese-paring in regard to the 1½d. per gallon for milk has left the country in a terrible condition.  The consumers <Col N="1417" /> in the towns are charged 5¾d and 6d. per pint for milk, which is four times the price paid to the producer.  That calls for very serious consideration by the Government.  From the producer's point of view, he is in the position that he would almost consider becoming a middleman rather than remain a producer of this commodity.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister for Supplies said that when fixing the price of goods such as clothes, etc., the trade were consulted and their advice was always taken.  Is it not strange that in matters affecting agriculture the farmer is not consulted or, at least, if he is consulted, he is merely listened to?  Surely the farmer is not regarded as an enemy of the community? Prices are fixed for certain commodities and in many cases the article is sold at less than the fixed price.  The price fixed for such an important commodity as milk is absurd.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Government sometimes tells us the decline in milk production is due to the fact that proper dairy herds are not kept. But the Government must realise that it takes money to build up a proper dairy herd and, when people have not the money to do it, they cannot do it.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-day.</P>

White Brothers, 9 Wellington Quay, Dublin, under Emergency Powers (Manufacture of Textiles and Textile Articles) Order, 1942, and if he proposes to hold further inquiries into the matter with a view to the reissue of a permit to this firm so that they may carry out their business satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Licence No. 110 was issued on the 4th July, 1942, under the Emergency Powers (Manufacture of Textiles and Textile Articles) Order, 1942, to Messrs.  White Brothers, to enable them to carry on the business of manufacturing clothing at their factory at 9 Wellington Quay, Dublin.  On the 8th October, 1943, a letter was received from Messrs.  White Brothers intimating that they had now nothing to do with the factory and that the factory was being run by another party.  The premises were visited by an inspector of my Department who interviewed the other party referred to and drew to his attention the necessity of being licensed under the Order referred to above.  The party in question subsequently applied for a licence and represented, in support of his application, that he was taking over the business formerly carried on by Messrs.  White Brothers, at 9 Wellington Quay.</P>
      <P>Though I am not prepared, as a matter of general policy, to grant licences for textile manufacturing businesses newly set up in the course of the emergency and requiring raw materials which are in short supply, I have authorised the issue of licences to persons taking over established factories.  Accordingly, a licence was issued as applied for in respect of the clothing factory situated at 9 Wellington Quay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of this licence entailed the revocation and surrender of the licence held by the former proprietors, Messrs. White Brothers.  The new proprietors were requested to return the licence formerly issued to their predecessors. These requests were ignored.  An inspector of my Department recently visited the premises and interviewed a representative of the firm of White Brothers, who refused to surrender the <Col N="1421" /> document and in subsequent correspondence indicated that his firm had not disposed of the business to any other party but had merely rented a portion of their factory to such other party.</P>
    <P>The matter is being pursued and such action will be taken as the circumstances seem to require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there must be some attempt to secure a uniform treatment of all manufacturing firms.  The manufacturing users of electricity are at present working on 75 per cent. of their <Col N="1422" /> 1943 consumption.  If it were to be made the practice that allowance would be made for the exceptional circumstances of individual firms, such as the circumstances which arise in this case, where an increase in business has been secured by the firm, it would be impossible to maintain uniform treatment. I think the only prospect for the firm is that the situation should so improve as to permit of an all-round increase in electricity for manufacturing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state the number of proof gallons of whiskey exported by the Dublin Distillers Company in the last four months of 1939, and in 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943; and the circumstances under which an export licence was granted for any whiskey exported in the past two years in view of the present shortage here and the loss of duty to the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to publish particulars about the business of any individual concern.  Control over the export of whiskey was imposed on 15th November, 1941, for the <Col N="1423" /> purpose of restricting the expansion of such exports in the interests of the home trade.  The position in respect of whiskey stocks held in this country has never been such as would justify a complete prohibition of exports, and it is considered desirable that ordinary exporters should be facilitated to a reasonable extent in maintaining contact with their foreign customers.  The position with regard to supplies for the home trade is under periodic review and export quotas are varied from time to time so as to ensure that there are adequate quantities of whiskey available for home consumption. There is no reason why there should be any scarcity of whiskey for home consumption as ample stocks are held by distillers.  Recently, however, there has appeared a reluctance on the part of certain distillers to release stocks for home sales and this aspect of the matter is at present under active consideration.</P>

    <P>I am unable to understand the Deputy's reference to an export licence in this connection.

The Deputy, however, is a novice at this business of insinuation and, if he had further experience, he would at least take the elementary precaution of ascertaining what the facts were, and the facts are available to every Deputy.  The statement has been made previously in this House that certain individuals were induced to buy shares in the Dublin Distillers Company, Limited, on the basis of information that a licence would be given for the export of whiskey.  The fact is that, at the date upon which the company went into liquidation, no licence was required for the export of whiskey.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy of the reply given to his question of the 7th July last and would point out that the rent of houses let on a differential rent basis is fixed at one-sixth of the family income, modified to the benefit and advantage of the tenant in a number of ways.  For instance, in calculating the family income any emergency bonus or increase of wages not exceeding 8/- per week payable to the principal bread-winner is disregarded, and the income is also held to be reduced by 1/- per week in respect of each child under 16 years of age for whose support he is deemed to be responsible. The income of any other person resident in the house is reduced by 5/- per week, and after this the excess over 45/- of the amount so reduced is ignored in calculating the family income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the city manager, in lieu of the allowance hitherto made in respect of dependent children, proposes <Col N="1426" /> to omit altogether the increased income of tenants due to the operation of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944.</P>

      <P>I should perhaps preface my reply to this question by reminding the Deputy that the turbary in question forms part of the bog which on the 9th May he was pressing to have taken over by the county council for development, and the compulsory acquisition to which he now refers arose from the necessity for providing turbary for the townspeople of Mountmellick. It was because Mr. Woods, the owner, refused to agree with the residents that the bog should be made available that resort had to be made to compulsory powers.  In view of the necessity for increased fuel production the compulsory acquisition of the turbary by the county council became a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a county council require turbary they are empowered to proceed under Emergency Powers (No. 310) Order, 1944.  In acquiring turbary compulsorily the council make an order vesting the land in them on a specified date not earlier than seven days after the date on which they make the order. The council are required to give notice of the making of the order to the persons who appear to the council to have <Col N="1427" /> any interest in the land to which the order relates, so far as it is reasonably practicable to ascertain those persons. In the case referred to the notice of a vesting being made was sent to Mr. James Woods, Garrymore, Geashill, by registered letter on the 9th May, 1944.  The address was obtained from the rate book, which showed Mr. Woods as the rated occupier of the bog.  The letter was returned undelivered. I understand that it has since been ascertained that Mr. Woods resides at Barranaghs (or Borness), Mountmellick, and that a further notice is being sent to him at that address.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether it is the usual procedure to acquire a person's rights compulsorily before serving notice of the intention to acquire the rights?  I am afraid that the Minister has been misinformed in this case.  I understand that at no time did Mr. Woods agree to this thing.  He offered turbary, which was suitable, in a different area, which the county manager did not accept.  In view of these circumstances, I think that the Minister would be well advised to have further inquiries made into this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not authorise anything, but the Emergency Powers Order, that was made with the acquiescence of the House, gives power to the county manager on behalf of his county council to acquire turf banks so as to enable fuel to be provided for people in the area concerned.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that if a farmer is utilising his own turbary in the most effective way, and operating at a cheaper rate than the county council could ever <Col N="1428" /> hope to do, the county manager, before acquiring such turbary, should consult the owner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to my answer to the question, except to say that the reason for making this vesting Order was that the owner in this case refused to agree with the residents that the bog should be made available.  That is why recourse had to be made to compulsory Orders.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there is an increasing traffic in copies of birth certificates in connection with social services and employment; that the present certificate copy gives rise to very serious abuse as it contains information unnecessary for purposes for which it is required; that, in particular, illegitimate persons suffer pain and humiliation in having to disclose their disability to persons who have no right to the information, and often are handicapped thereby in obtaining business positions; that a much reduced form of certificate, confining itself to age and any other particular deemed necessary, is required; and whether he will consult with social organisations on this matter, and sympathetically examine the additional powers necessary for the Registrar-General to issue copy certificates of <Col N="1429" /> practical value, and at less administrative expense.</P>

      <P>An entry of birth contains only the minimum particulars necessary for the identification of the person to whom it relates.  Any abridgment of the entry or of a certified copy thereof would materially reduce its value as a document of record and in the case of persons bearing the same names and surnames it is obvious that an abridgment of the form of entry or an abridgment of the form of certified copy of an entry might give rise to serious abuses.  While I cannot therefore hold out hope of an amendment of the law of registration in the manner suggested by the Deputy, any representations which social welfare organisations may desire to submit will be very carefully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Messrs. <Col N="1434" /> Lunham Brothers (Cork) Limited have not found it economic for some time to continue in production owing to the general shortage of pigs and the high prices resulting from competition for the available supplies.  I discussed the position last January with a deputation which included Cork Parliamentary and labour representatives as well as representatives of the firm and another bacon curing establishment in Cork, and agreed to an arrangement between the two factories which had the effect of maintaining Messrs. Lunham Brothers' business on a limited scale. I understand that the firm has now terminated this arrangement and decided to close down completely.</P>
      <P>As long as the present scarcity of pigs lasts, the supplies available for bacon curing factories will not be anything like enough to keep in economic production all the large establishments which were set up when pigs were plentiful.  Nothing can be done to maintain all these factories in business short of subsiding them, and this I am not prepared to recommend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude my remarks on that one point.  As regards the price of milk, we are asking for an increase of ¼d. per pint.  The middleman gets from the consumer four times what the producer gets, and we would appeal to the Taoiseach to see that something is done to help us in this matter and that a fair price is given to the producer.  It is sometimes said that the consumer cannot bear any further increase, but surely something could be done to <Col N="1439" /> see that the middleman would bear the increase?  If something were done in that way, I believe we would be taking a big step towards remedying the present situation in regard to the scarcity of milk and butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate merely for the purpose of dealing with some statements made by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Donnellan, both of whom appealed for increased agricultural production after the war.  Are we to take it from the Fine Gael Party and the Farmers' Party that there should be increased agricultural production merely for export after the war, and that that should not be put forward now when we are trying to feed our own people at home?  I consider that whatever increase in agricultural production our farmers are capable of, should be carried out at the present moment in order to see that the people of this country are fed.  My interest, in so far as post-war planning for agriculture is concerned, would be to ensure that the market which is now the property of the Irish farmer would be preserved for him after the war and would from the basis of whatever agricultural economy we are to have in future.  I think that is far more important to the agricultural community than any decision that might be arrived at as regards markets abroad or anything else.  I had one small instances last week of what markets abroad meant in the export of early potatoes, when, because a boat left on Wednesday instead of Tuesday night, the price dropped from £19 15s. to £15 per ton.  That was a drop of £4 15s. per ton in one night on the market abroad, and that in the middle of a war.  It meant just the difference between profit and loss to the farmers who were foolish enough to grow for the export market.  One would think the Fine Gael Party would have learned enough lessons from 1924 to 1932 about that market to realise the falseness of the agricultural economy of depending on that market for the future of agriculture.  If we had butter to export to that market to-day, I wonder where Deputy Donnellan's <Col N="1440" /> 10½d. or 1/- per gallon for milk would be, and who would pay the difference between the price of that butter for export on that market and the 1/- per gallon which the farmers are demanding to-day for milk.  On the basis of the controlled price of butter in Britain to-day, the price of new milk at the creamery would not be 4d. per gallon.  It is time Fine Gael learned the value of the export market about which there is all the shouting, and where it leads.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Donnellan complaining about the 1½d. extra for milk, and he endeavoured to couple that with the necessity for rationing of butter.  He knows, and any man in agriculture knows, that our dairy industry here, so far as milk and butter production is concerned, was sacrificed to the export store-cattle trade for Britain for a number of years, and that the sole reason for the rationing of butter in this country to-day is that the cow to-day is milking only one-third of what she milked 20 years ago, owing to the policy of looking after the export, instead of the home, market.</P>

      <P>It would not be necessary to take much notice of what Deputy Corry has said if it were not for the fact that it appears to be the view of the Government Party, if not of the Government itself.  Deputy Corry knows quite well that nobody on this side or any other side has ever advocated that we should be solely dependent on the export market. Deputy Corry equally should know that neither agriculture nor industry can survive unless we have an export market.  Does Deputy Corry or any other farmer in the House think we can carry on agriculture in the way in which it was carried on for the last six years, that the present system can be continued indefinitely?  I do not think that any intelligent farmer believes that.  Every person in the House with any knowledge at all of rural conditions wants to see the home market developed as far as possible for our own farmers, but realises also that, side by side with that, we must have the highest possible surplus for export. If I were to take the line in relation to Deputy Corry and the Government <Col N="1441" /> which he takes in relation to Deputies on this side, I would say that he was preaching a policy of no exports, that we need not concern ourselves at all with exports, that we need not even think of the outside market and that the home market is the only market about which we need concern ourselves. Deputy Corry taunts Deputy Donnellan with regard to the situation if we were in a position to export butter or any other farm produce at the moment.  I wonder what our position will be post-war if we are to be completely dependent upon the home market and not to take any steps to see what market we can get for our exports.  The fact, of course, is that outside one or two industries, we have nothing to export from this country and are likely to have nothing for export, so far as we can see, but agricultural produce.  Deputy Corry talks about the yield of milk now being one-third of what it was 20 years ago.  I doubt if there is any other dairy farmer in the House who will subscribe to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps appropriate that the Taoiseach's Estimate should be considered now, immediately before the Recess.  Certain suggestions were put forward by Deputy Mulcahy which I considered to be thoughtful and reasonable, and which I think An Taoiseach would not be ill-advised to consider carefully during the couple of months which will elapse before the House reassembles.  I know that the fact that the House is not in session does not mean that An Taoiseach will be on holidays, any more than will any other Deputy, during the next couple of months.  He has much administrative work to do but at least he will be released for a while from the worry of attending the deliberations of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is fortunate inasmuch as, in assuming office here, he succeeded a head of a Government who set a high standard of administrative ability, of honesty, sincerity and hard work and a high standard of rectitude and dignity in the performance of his duties.  This is the first Dáil since the State was established of which Mr. Cosgrave is not a member and it is <Col N="1442" /> only right and proper that a tribute should be paid to the high standard he set for any head of the Government succeeding him.  I think it is not faint praise to say that the Taoiseach has endeavoured to live up to the standard set by Mr. Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Estimate should be the most serious debate in the House.  The matters which were submitted for consideration were, I think, fairly wide inasmuch as they affect the livelihoods and lives of every section of our people, and particularly of the poorer sections.  The cost of living is a question around which controversy will always rage.  There are people who say that the cost of living must be brought down so that the workers will be able to obtain a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.  There are others who suggest that the income of the workers should be brought up in order to achieve the same end.  I think, as between those two viewpoints, there is the fair and reasonable view that it is the function of the Government to see that there is a price level and also a level of income which will enable every man in this country who is endeavouring to work to obtain for himself and his family a decent standard of living.  That implies that the minimum wage which the lowest paid worker in this country receives should be sufficient to enable him, with the help of whatever social services exist in the way of family allowances and so on, to support his family in decency and comfort.  It also implies that those employed in the main industry of the country, agriculture, whether they are employed as weekly workers or are working on their own holdings, should have an income sufficient to provide them with a decent living.</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure that a decent standard of living shall not be beyond the means of our people, it is necessary first of all to ensure in the post-war period that all our people will be employed to the utmost of their capacity, and productively employed, because, unless production is brought up to the maximum, there can be no decent standard of living for our people.  This is a comparatively a poor country, as far <Col N="1443" /> as mineral and other resources are concerned, and it is only the energy and enterprise of our people that can ensure them a decent standard of living. Therefore, in planning for the post-war period, it must be the duty of the Government to see that every conceivable industry and branch of industry is developed to its fullest extent. Not only agriculture, which is our basic industry, but our fishery industries, our fuel production industries, our industries for the development of power resources such as electricity, and all other secondary industries, should be developed to the fullest extent.  In demanding a reduction in the cost of living, we must always have before our minds the necessity for ensuring that our people will be fully employed, and that our industries, both agricultural and others, are in the fullest state of production.</P>
    <P>After production, it is necessary to ensure that the people are given the power to purchase the goods produced. To increase our production of milk, of butter, and other essential foodstuffs, it is necessary to ensure that there is no section of our people who are not in a position to purchase those goods, and that again comes under the heading of our social services.  It is necessary to ensure social security for our people; to ensure that no section of our people shall be driven below the level which is necessary in order to maintain themselves and their families in a decent state of health and comfort. Between the purchaser and the consumer there is one entire system of distribution, and I believe that that system is altogether too expensive. That does not always imply that there is very extensive profiteering amongst our middlemen, although Deputy Dillon complained yesterday that he was allowed too high a margin of profit in the distribution of essential footwear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the high cost of distribution is due entirely to profiteering amongst those engaged in the distribution of goods, although there may be a considerable amount of profiteering.  It is due, in the main, to the fact that there are too many people trying to make a living in this country between the producer and the consumer.  There are far too many people engaged in the ordinary retail business, in the wholesale business and in between in the various trades and branches of trades, all endeavouring to secure something out of what the producer produces and out of what the consumer pays for his goods.  I think that condition of affairs will continue until the people, as a whole, make up their minds that there shall be no business in this country more profitable than production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great Britain, at one time, was described as a hell for the producer and a paradise for the distributor.  That description might have been applied to conditions here in pre-war days at any rate.  It is not a condition that should be allowed to obtain in the post-war period.  It is essential that the path between the producer and the consumer must be shortened to the minimum. To a great extent, that may be achieved either by co-operation between consumers or by co-operation between producers.  The main producers of our essential goods are those engaged on agricultural production. Each farm is a small unit, but, without co-operation, it is impossible for the agricultural producer to sell his goods at the least possible cost of distribution. While people blame farmers for not co-operating amongst themselves to ensure the cheapest system of distribution, it is rather strange that the people who do so have not advocated that consumers might also co-operate amongst themselves so as to be able to purchase their goods at the cheapest possible rate.  Co-operation is not a simple matter.  It is one that requires a lot of organisation and education.  It <Col N="1446" /> is not as simple as some people seem to think.  Nevertheless, it is the ideal towards which our people should aspire, having regard to the fact that other small nations, such as Denmark, with similar systems of economy, have made great progress in production by co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that finance tended to curb production in the period between the last war and the present war, and that the cost of money, and the restrictions imposed by those who control money, tend to keep workers out of work and the owners of productive property out of production.  The Deputy was quite right in suggesting that the system, by which the war effort in belligerent countries is being financed, should be allowed to operate in the post-war period in the development of countries such as this.  There is no section of the community more in urgent need of cheap credit facilities than the farming community.  Twenty years of acute agricultural depression have left farmers without any capital in their hands, and without any capital either in stored up fertility in the soil or in suitable farm buildings and equipment. Credit facilities for farmers must be provided as a first step towards ensuring an expansion in agricultural production, and at rates which agriculture can pay.  We know that during the last war farmers borrowed money from the banks.  It was made freely available to them at that time at a cost which agriculture could not bear and at interest rates which crushed agriculture out of existence.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, in the post-war period, that credit should be made available to agriculture at a low rate of interest.  Since credit can be made available to Governments engaged in war production at an almost nominal rate of interest, there is no reason why it should not be made available to agriculture at the same rate.  I have been urging this for many years. As a result of the economic war, and the depression which struck the agricultural industry at that time, there are many farmers who have been brought to complete ruin, men upon whose holdings rates, land annuities <Col N="1447" /> and other charges have accrued.  If the requests which I made for better credit facilities had been reasonably met by the Government, we would have none of the tragic incidents occurring, such as occurred in the County Dublin in the case of the Sheridan farm.  I think the first step towards the development of agriculture must be a realisation that the industry has suffered.  As a result of the economic conditions through which it has gone, the entire nation is now suffering, because agriculture is not in a position to produce as efficiently or as extensively as it otherwise might do.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the fact that now and for the past 20 years this country has been exporting the best of its young manhood and womanhood, and, in addition, exporting young men and women who have been educated at enormous expense in our universities. It is not easy to calculate what exactly it costs to educate a boy for a profession such as the medical profession. It is a terrible tragedy that men so educated out of the hard earnings of honest citizens should have to be exported to the ends of the earth to earn a living.  It is time to ensure that our entire system of education shall be directed not, as was suggested to-day, to enable our educated young men to find employment in various parts of the world, but rather to enable them to make a living within their own country.  There is, in engineering and in science, vast scope for development here and it is in such professions that our educated young men should be able to find a decent living in this country.  Our best brains should be educated for such professions, which will add to our national wealth and enable us to develop it fully.  It is also essential that the best brawn of our people be thoroughly trained, by technical education, to work our industries and agriculture to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I make one last appeal to An Taoiseach now to see that the proper system of education is provided, and that there is behind it a deeply ingrained <Col N="1448" /> idea to inspire our young people to look forward to building up this country in every sphere.  We must ensure that our young men and women leaving our schools and universities, full of zeal and enthusiasm for our national development, are given hope and confidence in our country's future. They must be given reason to believe that this country will remain independent and free, and not only that, but that it will grow stronger from year to year, physically, mentally and spiritually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of an important general Estimate of this kind, and particularly when it comes on the eve of a long adjournment of the Dáil, it is necessary to bring under the attention of the Government and the public some of the grievances and hardships under which people are suffering, and some of the inefficiencies of the Government.  There is a laboured, artificial attempt to take advantage of the mental vacuum&mdash;created through a rigid, ruthless, political censorship&mdash;and to rush into that mental vacuum merely the amount of information that is allowed to trickle out through a controlled and biassed publicity department, so as to give the people an entirely false presentation of the situation of the country nationally and internationally and of the factors that make for the country's immunity from war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well to face facts, whether they are agreeable or disagreeable. We have magnified our immunity from war, and our neutral position into a major Government achievement, and not only that, but an achievement due to one great man. That is done as if there were no other contributory factors, and as if one man, standing over a declaration of neutrality, were sufficient to keep the country neutral.  If that were sufficient all the invaded countries in Europe would still be neutral.  We have a policy of neutrality subscribed to by every Party in this House, endorsed by the people outside, and behind that declaration of policy we have a firm declaration to defend that neutrality. That is one of the contributory factors <Col N="1449" /> which kept us immune from war, but another factor was that one set of belligerents, which could have put in here, had no desire to do so, and the other set of belligerents were prevented from doing so, if they desired it, by the naval might and supremacy of the other.</P>
    <P>We are bringing up a generation blissfully unconscious of facts, in imbecile innocence, thinking that in a world war a declaration, plus a comparatively insignificant army, is sufficient to keep a country free from war.  That is not a healthy state of mind, as it is not true.  It is wrong training for the youth of this country.  There are many difficulties and mighty forces in this war, and it is the balancing of those forces and the weighing up of the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> that gives us a correct idea of our immunity from war.  I believe this war is not going to be the last one, and that that kind of mental upbringing is all wrong.</P>
    <P>That kind of propaganda is seeping through this country with a political objective and not with the object of keeping the country immune from war.  I believe that the implied ingratitude of these declarations is in itself provocatively dangerous, if we have friendly neighbours who happen to be involved in the war and from week to week we are implying that it is only our inherent might that is keeping them from invading our shores and violating our neutrality.  That is not in the interests of good neighbourliness nor is it in the interests of trade during the war or after the war.  We are reaching a point in this war where we must consider and evaluate not only our present position but our post-war position, in a crippled world scrambling for trade. We have to size up the claims we have built up to a share in post-war trade. We have to consider what factors may be contributing against our share.  We must consider how our behaviour, our public declarations, our propaganda, our speeches and our open expressions regarding favours received, may be enhancing or jeopardising our prospects of a fair and reasonable share of post-war trade.</P>
    <P>The war we have to face and to fight <Col N="1450" /> is not a military war or a military threat.  We left military threats behind us some years ago; and no matter how we may cash in politically on events from year to year, our major war is to keep our people in reasonable supply, to keep our workers in employment, to keep our industries going and to keep our people fed.  It is the duty of a Parliament, living in a country not at war, to size up the success or failure of the Government and see how its efforts are directed towards fighting that war, what provision was made in the past, what efforts are being made at present, and how the Government's plans are developing towards our prosperity in the future.  In coldly examining that situation, we should not be mentally or physically stampeded by any of the propaganda, that there is great danger around the corner; great military danger, or a hair's-breadth escape by the skin of our teeth.  Let us face up to the situation as it is, to see what we can do to better it, and if we cannot better it, to see how far we can ensure that it will not get worse.</P>
    <P>This war was signalled for two years before it came, and practically every country in the world, particularly every island country, devoted those two valuable years to the stocking of their larders, to the laying in of supplies, to the laying in of hoard upon hoard of commodities they required from overseas. During those two years we did not buy one pound weight or one pound worth more than we bought in any normal year.  The Neros were fiddling, and two valuable years were lost.  Even when war broke out, for a period of 12 months the seas were still comparatively wide open and supplies were reaching countries from the farthest ends of the earth.</P>
    <P>During that vital year the fiddling went on, the speechmaking went on, and not an extra ton of any overseas articles came into this country.  Then the seas, comparatively speaking, were closed, and the supermen began to make speeches as to how the miraculous efforts of the Government had managed to enable the people to subsist or to exist from one year to another.  Even the bare system of rationing which <Col N="1451" /> had been demanded from all sides of this House at the beginning of the emergency was scoffed at as entirely unnecessary.  Not only were we not getting increased supplies from outside, but we were watching, while the wealthy inside bought in enormous quantities of whatever supplies there were inside the country, and when the greedy appetite of the immensely wealthy was satisfied then we had a bare, ruthless and rigid system of rationing of what was left, so that the humble person was rationed on the goods value of the coupon weekly, plus nothing; while the wealthy person was rationed on the goods value of the coupon plus the vast stores that had been hoarded. Month after month, year after year we had Government inspectors and Government agents inquiring into every pound of grain produced by farmers, into every pound of sugar sold by a shopkeeper, into every hour of work and every penny of income that went into the house of an old age pensioner or of a person claiming unemployment assistance, but we had no survey of the vast stores accumulated in many homes up and down the country.  Week after week and month after month and year after year we had the same rigid level of rationing.</P>
    <P>We had the Government announcing at the beginning of the war that we had to go through with it, that it was going to be a period of sacrifice, whether we were in it or not, that the sacrifice would have to be equally borne, that no great profit would be made out of this war, that whatever the sufferings or whatever the hardships, let them be equally spread over all, and that steps would be taken immediately, so that unlike the last war profits would not mount and the cost of living would not soar.  The first step in implementing that policy was to see that wages did not rise.  We had a regulation introduced to a doubting Dáil that in order to prevent the cost of living rising, to give no pretext for increased profits, for inflated bank balances, or to wealthy people engaged in business the first step necessary was to peg down wages. Wages were pegged down, and the <Col N="1452" /> cost of living went up, prices went up, profits went up and the published reports of one company after another showed that on a greatly shrunken turnover of trade, profits doubled, or quadrupled.  The Government's attention was drawn to that absurd, brutal, heartless and cailous situation, in debate after debate, and year after year.  Within the last week we had the Minister for Supplies coming here speaking on behalf of the Government.  What was his line on the war?  What did he tell the Dáil and the people?  He told them that he had reached a point in the fifth year of the war when prices might have to be controlled.  Will An Taoiseach look back on the case made for the Standstill Order?  Will An Taoiseach look back on the speeches made from the Government front bench, that the Standstill Order was imperative in order to control prices?</P>
    <P>Now, five years after the hardship of that Order, we have a Government Minister standing up and saying that it might be necessary if the Dáil consented to control prices, but that in controlling prices we must face the fact that it may produce unemployment. Unemployment we have had. Unemployment we have; tragic, haemorrhagic emigration we have had; and in spite of that hæmorrhage we have vast queues of unemployed at home, and that long line of emigrants, not only because they are unemployed but because of the fantastically high cost of living at home.  But, in order to control the cost of living, the first step necessary was to peg down wages. In the same month we had a regulation pegging down wages.  What was the Government's decision with regard to Government contracts, with regard to local government contracts, or with regard to the contracts entered into by the State or by boards operating under the State?  These contracts were legal contracts.  There was a legal bond binding the contractor to carry out his contract at the price laid down.  Only by Government action and Government intervention could there be any departure from the figure laid down.  We had Government circulars.  What did these circulars say?  That these contractors <Col N="1453" /> must be guaranteed the same profit as they expected to enjoy before prices went up as a result of the war. I take no exception to that Order.  It was perfectly fair.  These men entered into contracts believing they would make so much out of them.  There was no war at the time they entered into the contracts and the cost of commodities was at a certain figure.  The cost of commodities rose and profit shrank. The Government released these contractors from their legal obligation so as to guarantee them the same profit as before.  I think that the Government did the right thing but, to the same Government, I put the question: what is the profit of the workman?  It is the difference between his wage and what it costs him to run his house.  The raw materials of the workman are the food that keeps him strong and healthy as a workman.  When the raw materials of that man's industry increased in price, was there any Government anxiety with regard to the sanctity of contracts?  Was there any Government anxiety to see that that man would be granted the same margin of profit as he got before the war?  Quite the opposite.  There was a Government Order to ensure that that man's profits would shrink or completely disappear, that he would pay the war cost of commodities but that he would get no more for the finished article or the completed job.  That is the Government view and the Government policy with regard to the humble, with regard to those who are powerless, and the other is the Government view and the Government policy with regard to those who are powerful, influential, and, perhaps, too heavily blessed with the material goods of this world.</P>
    <P>We are asked now, on the eve of a long adjournment of the Dáil, to give a vote of approval to that kind of heartless, unbalanced policy.  All through those years, we had, as I said at the beginning, an absolutely equal system of rationing, a system proper at the beginning, in the first phase, but a system that should have been looked into and worked out in detail before the end of five years of war.  We had a fuel rationing that had no relation to the number of occupants of a house, that had no relation to the number of <Col N="1454" /> rooms in a house, where the fuel ration was the same for one person living in two rooms as for 15 persons living in 12 rooms.  I ask An Taoiseach if, outside Bedlam, there was ever such a fantastic scheme for the rationing of the population.  It was not rationing by rooms nor by persons.  An individual living in one room got the same as a family of 15 or 16, with a number of invalids, living in eight or nine rooms.  The whole handling of the rationing system, whether you take fuel, petrol, tea or anything else, represents just the policy of the lazy man&mdash; the man who has a police force standing behind him, the man who is not working for the people, but who is giving orders to the people, the Department that is merely taking a rough and ready line and then saying: &ldquo;We want no investigation; we want no exceptions; we do not want the labour of looking into the justice of this scheme; it is equal for all.&rdquo; Could such a scheme be reasonably supported if it were &ldquo;equal for all&rdquo;?  If we put forward a nation-wide scheme that is equal for all, in its very make up is it not an unequal scheme and an unjust scheme?  Do we all start equal on the day the scheme is applied?  Some people have plenty; some people have nothing.  We apply an equal scheme and say: &ldquo;This is equal for all.&rdquo; The failure to follow up any rationing scheme to see if, in its incidence, it is fair and if it is, in fact, bringing about an equal distribution of the supplies available for all, is one of the cardinal crimes, amongst many, committed by this Government.</P>
    <P>The application of Government regulations to the ordinary individual has been as heartless as if this country were actually engaged in war.  With regard to provision in anticipation, that is better forgotten.  It was a case of the Government playing politics at home and abroad and grossly neglecting the serious work for which they were being paid.  That is a page in our history which is better passed over. One thing I say to the Government: &ldquo;Do not attempt, through propaganda, to take any pride or to attract any praise for the handling of the situation since the war began or as it exists at <Col N="1455" /> the moment.&rdquo; In spite of censorship, a little news regarding the outside world trickles into the home papers.</P>
    <P>We read, month after month, of different countries, other than Commonwealth countries, making then trade arrangements for post-war years, making trade arrangements with Great Britain, with America and with other countries on the basis of ten years' trade&mdash;so much imports, so much exports.  We cannot but be disturbed when we see those trade agreements being made in Great Britain for supplies of eggs, for supplies of bacon and for supplies of beef.  Is it out of order for a Deputy in an Irish Parliament to ask: Where do we figure in that picture?  Ministers from countries outside the Commonwealth are in England fighting their country's case and getting their share of the post-war trade.  Not only Ministers but the Premiers of other Commonwealth countries are there, and they are going home, one by one, with the &ldquo;swag&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Long-term arrangements for English trade in beef or in bacon with other countries were a thing which, in my view, was unheard of.  Where do we figure, and where are we represented? Are we going to be there merely to get what is left?  If there is anything doing in that direction to safeguard our trade post-war or to try to hold on to what we had pre-war, or even some of it, is there any objection to telling the Parliament and the people why that important business is much better done through civil servants than through Ministers?  Have we such a poor bunch at the moment that they cannot improve our prospects or cannot make a better bargain than is made by subordinates?  What is the reason we are unrepresented?  Why are we not getting a share?  Can An Taoiseach give us information as to what share will be left for us after the appetities of all these other countries are satisfied?</P>
    <P>I think there is something more to be considered in the work of government than just successful home politics, than merely successful political propaganda at home.  It is not doing <Col N="1456" /> the nation's work to attach the makeup of supermen to any group of plain, two-legged men who have broken down on their job so far.  Is it not much better to try to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, even at the eleventh hour? I want to say bluntly to An Taoiseach that there is scarcely a Department of State that in its administration is not being corruptly handled in the political sense.</P>
    <P>A question was submitted here last week by Deputy Hughes addressed to the Minister for Supplies in which he put the case of two Deputies or more making representations to the Department with regard to some trader who required some facilities, and he quoted the type of reply that goes to the different Deputies.  To the Fine Gael, or rather the Opposition, Deputy the reply will go: &ldquo;This case has been looked into and the Minister has agreed to grant...&rdquo; The reply that goes to the Government or the Fianna Fáil Deputy is: &ldquo;As a result of your representations, the Minister has agreed to grant...&rdquo; The Minister, in his reply, did not deny that.  He said that was &ldquo;because we are more intimate with the Fianna Fáil Deputies than with other Deputies and we reply more formally to other Deputies&rdquo;. Who are the &ldquo;we&rdquo;?  Civil servants, the Government Departments, the officers and the agents of Parliament? I do not believe there is a decent Deputy in this House who would stand for that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>We heard a reply given last week, an official reply from the Minister in the Front Bench, where four Deputies from a constituency had approached a Government Department on a matter of constituency interest.  The reply was to the effect that in spite of the representations of Deputy So-and-so, of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister was unable, etc.  There was no reference to the fact that the representations were made by four Deputies belonging to four different Parties.  I want to know whether the Taoiseach approves that kind of contemptible activity, either by Ministers or within Ministers' Departments.</P>
    <P>I have before me a letter which appears, over the name of a very prominent <Col N="1457" /> person, in a Cavan paper, and in the course of that letter the writer refers to an advertisement published the previous week&mdash;that would be the week of the 19th June.  The advertisement was in the following terms: &ldquo;Ballyhaise Fianna Fáil annual letting of Bow Meadow bog will take place on Monday night at... Banks not claimed and paid for will be let. &mdash;Secretary.&rdquo; Ballyhaise Fianna Fáil annual letting.  This particular Bow Meadow bog is portion of a State holding, State property.  I will give the letter to the Taoiseach.  I am aware that when I raise the matter here I may be told the Taoiseach has no previous information.  I merely want an assurance that if the substance of this letter is correct, and State property is being auctioned over the name of a Fianna Fáil club, whether in Cavan or any other constituency, that the most drastic action will be taken.  It is a thing that no decent person could feel comfortable standing over.</P>
    <P>Here is another symptom of the same disease: I spoke to a Deputy here to-day. He had just arrived from his constituency. He told me a Fianna Fáil Deputy arrived in the constituency last week, and, calling on ten people, he informed them that they were getting reapers and binders.  When this Deputy who spoke to me arrived in town, he got in touch with the Government Department concerned and he asked who would get binders in the constituency. He was told: &ldquo;No, information can be given; no decision has been taken.&rdquo; Now, either the first Deputy was falsely using his position as a member of the Government Party by giving false, unauthorised information, or alternatively he was giving authoritative information which he got in advance of any other Deputy from the same constituency.  I want that kind of thing looked into and denounced from within, not from outside, because the work of Parliament is the work and the interest of all Deputies, and in practice and in theory all Deputies, must be equal.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was a member of a Government Party sitting over there, I was acting as chairman of a committee, and, in what I thought was the public interest, I put in an application <Col N="1458" /> that the outline of proposed legislation might be given to us in advance so that we could put the case to the public and get the public view.  The reply we got was that no information could be given to any Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy unless it was simultaneously given to every other Deputy in the House.  The minute I got that reply I saw the soundness and the justice of it.  I wonder if that rule of decency and clean conduct still operates.  Every one of us can tell An Taoiseach that in our own constituencies our opposite numbers have advance information.  How they get it is a matter for investigation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is now starting a new period with an unchallenged majority, with his full Parliamentary life to go. Let us at least plead that that should be a clean one, free from even the charge or the suspicion of political corruption. If the Taoiseach wants a Parliamentary Committee in public or in private to supplement or justify the uneasiness and the suspicion and the belief that are in the minds of many of us, then such a committee would be more than amply fed with supporting evidence.</P>
    <P>That kind of nonsense, that kind of trickery and political injustice is not enhancing either the reputation of the Government or the good name of this State.  Neither is it tending to increase the amount of respect which people outside have or should have for Parliament itself.  Even the people that are benefiting by a little bit of advance information, even the people whose support is being procured by the implication that because it was a Government Deputy who intervened for them they got what they wanted, when they are giving support to that Deputy, do they not say: &ldquo;When you see a Government that can be pulled by political Party supporters rather than by other Deputies of equal standing, there is something corrupt about it&rdquo;?  Does not the Taoiseach know that that must be the view of anybody who believes that he has got a favour because one Deputy interests himself or gives a recommendation or speaks on his behalf?  I would ask the Deputies who are creating <Col N="1459" /> that impression in the country, are they doing any service to the Government or to Parliament or to the nation?  If I really believed that I was living in a State under a Parliament whose Government and Government Departments could be pulled by political influence in their judgement as between the claims of one citizen and another, I would say, from my heart, it would be better if such a country never secured its freedom.  A country that debases its freedom, debases and degrades its Parliament would be better if it were never free and never had a Parliament.</P>

      <P>It is very easy to reiterate high-sounding platitudes, to speak in general terms, to quote from books, to cast our minds and imagination over the kingdoms of the earth, but it is not quite so easy to indicate specific proposals as applied to our own country, which should have our first interest.  Deputy Mulcahy read for our edification what it is proposed to do in the matter of education and in other directions in another country but he put forward no suggestions or no ideas in regard to the development of Ireland.  That should be our first concern.  I shall try to fill some of the vacuums to which reference has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, agriculture is the basis of our national life, and a good balance between agriculture and industry holds out the best hope for the prosperity of our country.  In order to get that result, many things are required.  In the first place, it is necessary to have the co-operation of the people.  It is necessary that Government direction and Departmental administration should coincide with the general interests of the people.  The public services are the link between the people and the Government.  They are the most essential element in the performance of the functions of the State.  I think it would be well to examine that sphere of national activity.  In former years, before the development of transport and of specialised education, those who went into the Civil Service came from their <Col N="1460" /> home areas where specialist teachers prepared them for that career.  They were in contact with the economy of their farms and homes.</P>
    <P>In the present day candidates for the Civil Service leave their homes at an early age, and go into big towns and villages where large schools cater for them.  Consequently, they are cut adrift to a great extent from contacts which former candidates for the service had.  I would suggest then that, just as candidates for the teaching profession must go for two years to training colleges, and have the advantage of practising schools, just as the Gárda go to the Depot, just as tradesmen have to spend a certain number of years in apprenticeship to their trades, those who are recruited into the service to administer the Department of Agriculture, should come from the model farms throughout the country, that these farms should be extended, and that either before or after their examination those who have subsequently to administer the affairs of this Department, would have practical contact with the work they are to do.  That is only one aspect of it.  The same would apply, perhaps in a lesser degree, to industry, because industry is more a matter of statistics than agriculture.  These are some ideas in regard to educational development which occurred to me when Deputy Mulcahy was reading about what it was intended to do abroad.</P>
    <P>We have a wide field for activity at home.  What is the purpose of national freedom if it is not for the preservation of our native tradition, the development of our economy and the promotion of our ideals of life? Where is the necessity to seek other fields before we have developed our own country?  We have big undeveloped markets which schemes of employment will naturally extend by increasing the purchasing power of the community.  The development of the efficient grading and marketing of our produce will secure markets for our surplus commodities in future such as we have had in the past.  We are told all about the emigrants who have left this country, as if it were the first time in the history of the country that such <Col N="1461" /> a thing had happened.  But, if Deputy O'Higgins had cast his mind back a few years, he would recollect that, in the very early years of his régime, in one year alone 29,000 people left our shores in despair for America, because of the activities of his Government.</P>

      <P>We are told that no provision was made in anticipation of the present war; that we did not search the world for the commodities we require and get them in, while other nations for two years were preparing for that war and using their services towards that end.  At any rate, we have this satisfaction; that we took stock at home to see what could be done here and that the energies of our people were devoted to providing, so far as they could, for the feeding, clothing and housing of our own people.  I think Deputy O'Higgins is one of those who think that nothing good can come out of Nazareth.  He points out to us all the things we could have got by contact with other nations. But would he read the history of his country or take cognisance of the sacrifices of our people even in his own days?  Our people suffered through the long night of the Penal times, starved through the famine, bled in '98, and passed through the period or landlordism. To-day our people are unbought and unterrified.  In very recent times the people have given their verdict and that verdict is for the Fianna Fáil Government under the leadership of Eamon de Valera.</P>

      <P>The speaker who has just sat down was complaining about all the platitudes indulged by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Higgins, but since I came into this House I have never heard such a lot of platitudes as he has uttered.  His whole speech was made up of platitudes.  He has told us that we are a long-suffering people.  He referred Deputy O'Higgins to the recent history of this country.  What we complain about is that the people are still suffering, and suffering very <Col N="1462" /> much, under the Fianna Fáil Government. He told us that the public services are a link between the people and the Government.  Unfortunately, during the recent election and at other elections the public services and the social services have been bandied around as political propaganda and been used as vote-catching cries.  After listening to the propaganda indulged in by Fianna Fáil during the last and other elections, you would think that there was nobody else in this House except Fianna Fáil Deputies.  The Deputy also told us that the policy of Fianna Fáil was accepted by the people at the last election.  I join issue with him on that.  In practically all cases, the issue put before the people was that the only person who was able to keep the bombs from falling on the people of this country was Deputy de Valera, and a great many people were misled by propaganda of that kind. There was a whispering campaign to the effect that, if the Fianna Fáil Government were put out of office, the bombs would be down on top of us. Not alone that, but, after an extra 2/6 had been given to old age pensioners, canvassers during the election went around from door to door saying that, if the Fianna Fáil Party did not get back to power, the 2/6 would be withdrawn. It was propaganda of that kind that was responsible for the return of the Government.  I am satisfied that hundreds of people voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election, not because they agreed with their policy, but because of the propaganda used, especially the propaganda in connection with the dropping of bombs.</P>

      <P>The facts do not prove anything of the kind.  As a matter of fact, Fianna Fáil did not secure the votes of a majority of the people, although they have a majority in the House.  What I am really concerned about is the question of unemployment and wages, which we gave notice we would raise.  The unemployment position at present is no better than it was last year or the previous year.  Certainly there are not the same number of people registered at the labour exchanges, but that is due to the fact that people had to emigrate in order to earn a living.  What was responsible to a great extent for people emigrating was the policy of the Government when they brought in their infamous Order, No. 83, which pegged down wages.  I am surprised at the last speaker, who is a member of a profession that has protested against the pegging down of salaries and wages, refrained from dealing with that aspect of the question. He was more concerned with lauding the Government than with saying something which would be in the interests of the people whom he represents.</P>
      <P>In the first year of the war, the Minister for Finance, when he brought in a Supplementary Budget, informed the Dáil and the country that it was the intention of the Government to bring in an Order which would prevent wages, from being increased.  In the same breath, he announced that it was their intention to bring in some regulation which would prevent the cost of living being increased.  The Order to peg down the wages of the unfortunate working people was brought in, but I suggest that no serious attempt was made at any time to secure that the cost of living would be kept down. That wages Order was made in an indiscriminate fashion.  Neither the Department of Finance nor the Department of Industry and Commerce made any effort to find out what wages they were pegging down.  In a great many cases, men who were in receipt of £1 or 30/- per week had their wages pegged down in the same way as men who had £4, £5, and £6 per week.  I suggest that a Government which acted in such an indiscriminate fashion have not the interest of the working people at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> After a time, the Government brought in an Order to permit of trade unions seeking bonuses on behalf of their members.  At that stage, however, the cost of living had increased by 77 points.  That increase of 77 points was disregarded and the tribunals set up were only permitted to deal with the increased cost of living above that 77 point mark.  Although people had suffered hardship for a considerable time owing to that increased cost of living, the Order brought into operation was not to have retrospective effect.  I suggest that a Government which took action of that kind have not the interests of the people really at heart.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the treatment meted out to different Deputies.  I want to emphasise that. A couple of years ago I was asked by a parish priest in my constituency to seek an interview with the Minister for Education and ask that a new school should be built in his parish.  The Minister for Education granted the interview to me.  When going to the interview, I met a Fianna Fáil Deputy in the passage and asked him to come with me, and he did.  I put forward the case on behalf of the parish priest, but the Fianna Fáil Deputy never opened his mouth.  The Minister told me that he would see what could be done in the matter.  A fortnight afterwards, I got a letter, ten days old, marked &ldquo;For your information&rdquo;, addressed to this Deputy, who really had had nothing to do with the matter. That letter was sent in order that he should get any kudos arising out of the matter.  Up to the election of 1943 it was possible for a Deputy to go down to the Department of Supplies, make representations on behalf of one of his constituents, and discuss the matter with the particular official who had to do with the matter with which he was concerned, but immediately after the 1943 election that was all stopped.  You can go down now to the Department of Supplies and discuss the matter with the civil servant who has to do with it, and he merely listens to you, and you do not know what the position is.  You will get an answer, perhaps, two months afterwards&mdash;after <Col N="1465" /> a letter has been sent to the people on whose behalf you made representations &mdash;but good care will be taken to secure that nobody but a Fianna Fáil Deputy will get any letter in time to enable him to tell his constituent how he fared in so far as the representations made by the Deputy on his behalf were concerned.  I suggest that the reason that attitude was taken up by the Government in 1943 was that they discovered, when they went to the country, that Deputies representing other Parties were more active in their constituencies than were the Fianna Fáil Deputies in the same constituencies. I would ask An Taoiseach to see that there is no discrimination made against Deputies, no matter to what Party they belong, when representations are made by them on behalf of their constituents, and that Fianna Fáil Deputies should not be particularly favoured in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, Sir, that I shall have to say much the same as Deputy McCarthy said with regard to the speech that was made by the Leader of the Opposition.  There were many generalities in it, but it was very hard to come down and find anything definite or specific in regard to what it was advisable to do in the public interest.  There is a document in which the general principles of our social policy have been laid down, and that is the Constitution.  The purpose of putting these principles into Article 45 of the Constitution was to indicate in a general way the approach of this Government&mdash;which we believed would be the approach of our people&mdash; towards a number of these problems. The attitude in respect of a number of fundamental points has been clearly set out there.  If there is any question as to what is the basis of our social outlook on a number of matters, anybody will be able to deduce, them from some of the principles that are set out in that Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not think that the getting out of White Papers is going to help us very much.  At the end of the last war, I saw&mdash;and I am sure that I have a collection of them still&mdash;a number of pamphlets that were brought out by <Col N="1466" /> the British Government dealing with reconstruction and so on, but I do not think that, in practice, very much was done quite on the line of these pamphlets.  The investigation which has taken place is of a certain amount of value, but it is only the facts of the position as they will obtain at the end of the war that will really determine what line of action will be followed. Our general line, with regard to certain fundamental principles, as I have said, has been indicated in the directive Articles concerned with social policy in the Constitution; and from time to time here, as occasions presents itself, the Ministers of the various Departments indicate in what way that is going to be implemented in their own regard.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say, of course, that the Government is not thinking, and, to a certain extent, planning in detail for the post-war period, but, accepting the general lines which we have accepted already, there is no use in writing out papers which will indicate some more or less Utopian approach to the world we have got to face.  It is a very easy matter for anybody to sit down and let his imagination run freely, and build up the type of world in which he would like to live and in which he would like to see his fellowmen live, but what we have to try to do is to take the actual hard facts of the situation as they are, and see how we are going to make the best of them.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the question of prices that has been raised here. When the war came, everybody, of course, realised that a very serious problem would have to be dealt with. It was quite clear that the cost of commodities, if left uncontrolled, was going to rise, and that there would be an immediate movement on the part of those who had fixed earnings of any kind to try to compensate for that increase in the price of commodities by means of an increase in their incomes. If an increase in wages, salaries or fixed incomes were to have been granted, it was quite obvious that that increase would be reflected in increased prices of commodities and that, accordingly, you would have such increases in fixed remuneration or in <Col N="1467" /> wages or salaries, with the consequent increased prices,. chasing one another around, so to speak.  We tried to get some policy to deal with that situation. The first thing that we said should be done was to prevent any increase in wages, because it was obvious that if wages were increased it was inevitable that prices would also be increased or else industrial production would practically cease.</P>
    <P>The next question was to see to what extent prices could be controlled. There were certain factors which were uncontrollable, factors which were outside the possibility of being influenced by us effectively.  We had goods coming in from outside, and we had to make up our minds as to whether, if we were to get in the raw materials we required, we would be prepared to pay for them at the only price at which they could be purchased.  If we did not pay that price, the raw materials would be absent and our industries would gradually collapse.  We wished to keep these industries going partly because they supply our needs and partly also because, by their continuance, employment is provided.  We had to permit prices to go up in accordance with that particular factor, the factor I repeat, of the increased cost of raw materials.</P>
    <P>Then again there was the question of food prices.  There was a constant complaint by members of the Farmers' Party in the House that the price we were paying farmers for their produce was not sufficient.  We were threatended, time after time, that unless we gave a higher price we would not get the necessary food for our people.  Of course, it is open to Deputies on Opposition Benches to argue from both sides at once.  Sometimes one and the same Deputy will argue for both sides of the question, and if it is too awkward for him to do that, one member of the Party will argue from one side of the question to be followed by another Deputy of the same Party arguing from the opposite side in an effort to try to hit Government policy from <Col N="1468" /> both points of view.  The very people who say that we are not giving the farmers a sufficient price for their produce are those who attack us on the ground that we did not control prices sufficiently, and allowed the cost of living to go up.  We felt, taking it all in all, that the best thing to do&mdash;and we tried not to give more than seemed to be absolutely necessary&mdash;was to give to our farmers a price which would ensure the production of the particular type of goods we required.  That was an element in the cost of living and the cost of living has gone up accordingly. The Deputies who accuse us of allowing the cost of living to go up are precisely those Deputies who on other occasions will come along and say that we are not giving the farmer a sufficient remuneration for his work, and that agricultural production on that account is not what it might be. These are two main elements in the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>There is a third element.  Industry was not in many cases, owing to the shortage of materials or for other reasons, able to maintain the output that it had before the war.  The result of that normally would mean that there would be unemployment in industry. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his policy of the control of prices, took that factor into account, and strove, by allowing prices go up by a certain amount, to give industrialists such a remuneration on the diminished output as would enable them as far as possible to continue in employment the same number of employees as they had before.  It is quite clear that if there is a diminished output in any industry, and if it is to carry on as before, overhead charges remaining pretty well the same, you have to allow for some increase in the price of the finished product, so, although there was, and is, a definite examination from the point of view of control of prices, nevertheless you could not keep prices static.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as the war proceeded, the cost of raw materials kept going up.  The prices that we had to give the farmers kept going up because of the need there was for food, and the tendency, <Col N="1469" /> in the case of industry, was towards a diminished output.  The more output was diminished, if we were to maintain employment at anything like the pre-war standard, the more, of necessity, even when you pegged down wages and did not allow wages to come into account, did the cost of living go up.  Although we have not absolutely pegged down wages, our idea in attempting to peg down wages was to try to prevent that particular factor, which would have been the most efficient factor in sending up prices, from affecting prices.  It was the one factor which we could control and to the extent to which we were able to control it, we have kept prices down.</P>
    <P>To argue, however, that we have kept wages at the pre-war level is not quite true, because there has been a let-up in wages, and to the extent to which that let-up has been there, there has been an additional tendency to an increase in the cost of living.  Our view generally was, and is, that it is the wage-earner who would suffer most if we were to allow things to go on without any control whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to suggest that there has been no control of prices at all.  That is not true.  He spoke as if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had quite recently, for the first time, suggested the operation of a control of prices.  That is not true, as there has been a control of prices all the time.  Last year, when this debate took place I got a list&mdash;I have not it by me at the moment&mdash;of a very large number of industries of various kinds showing the profits of these firms and I was quite satisfied that in the case of the vast majority of these firms there was nothing like the gross profiteering that had been suggested. There were certain firms, a small number, of whom it could be said that their profits had considerably increased. Looking over the list, which contained a very large number of names, I was satisfied that only a relatively small section could be said to have increased their profits.  You could, of course, take out perhaps two or three from the list and say: &ldquo;These have got increased profits,&rdquo; but if they have, you <Col N="1470" /> may be perfectly certain that the Minister for Finance will get after them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce very recently indicated that the inflationary danger was of such a character that we might have to consider for the first time whether we should not put an absolute barrier to increases in prices and face the consequences, but the consequences, as he pointed out, are going to be very severe.  I doubt very much whether, if we have ultimately to make that choice, a majority of members of the Dáil with all the facts before them, would vote for that.  It is more than doubtful whether, considering the dangers that lie ahead, it would be the wisest policy to follow.  The matter has been carefully and fully examined but it is not right to suggest that now only, for the first time, has there been any thought about the control of prices.  The control of prices has been there all the time.  The effort has been to try to limit increases in prices to the extent that would enable employment to be given, raw materials to be purchased and the industry to go on. When, however, you are controlling in advance, you are not all the time certain of how things will develop, and, therefore, there has to be not merely a looking ahead to anticipate what is likely to happen and to take action on that basis, but there is also an opportunity of looking back.  There is an opportunity of looking back in regard to these industries in which there have been extra profits and of examining and adjusting the price levels accordingly.</P>
    <P>This matter was intended as one of the main subject for discussion and it is one of the most serious questions we have to consider.  We must, however, remember that there is no way out of this community suffering through the war situation.  Those who are producers of goods are able to compensate themselves, if they get extra prices, for the war situation, but those who have fixed remuneration cannot compensate themselves for the increased costs, and at first sight, anyhow, the people who are most likely to suffer are those on fixed remuneration, whether fixed <Col N="1471" /> wages or fixed allowances of any kind. These are the people who can see directly the cost of the burden of the war to them.  There is a burden of war on every community in the world at present, whether they be neutral States or States engaged in war, and the best any community can hope for is to try to distribute the burden in such a way that it will not crush their community or weigh unduly on any particular section.</P>
    <P>Every section of the community will say that they are bearing a greater share of the burden than is right.  I have been to a number of farmers' meetings and have heard constant complaints about the farmers' burdens having increased and so on.  I know that, on the whole, that cannot be true, because the figures are there to indicate that, while the cost of living has gone up 70 or 71 per cent., agricultural prices have gone up by something like 97 per cent.  That is a clear indication that, taking it all in all, the farmers have been able not only to compensate themselves for the increased cost of living but to improve their position relatively.  It is perhaps no harm that should be so, because we all have to admit that the farmers had to pass through a long period of very grave depression and were in very poor circumstances. Their capital had been pretty well exhausted, and it is also true that at present, to the extent to which they are not able to put back into the land the necessary manures and so on to restore the fertility of the soil, there is a wastage, so to speak, of their capital. However, it is not a wastage which cannot be made up once the war is over.  Speaking about the war, I think it a very foolish idea to get into one's head that the war situation will have finished in a couple of months.  Let us hope it will, but, whatever may be our hopes or wishes, we ought not to act on that basis, but on the basis that this situation may last for a considerable time yet, and that, even after it, we shall have a situation in which many of the features of the war will still continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to our co-operating with other nations in regard to planning, <Col N="1472" /> making trade arrangements and so on, it has to be remembered that there are very few neutral nations left in the world and that most of the arrangements which are being made are being made almost as a part of the whole war effort, as part of cooperation and co-ordination of the war effort.  The opportunity for doing some of the things other countries have done is not afforded to us at the moment. We are naturally ready to take advantage of any situation which may present itself, so that the matter of the surplus goods which we must export, and which it is desirable we should export, in order to provide the purchasing power for the goods we must import, should be kept constantly in mind.  We have it constantly in mind and naturally are anxious to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say to those who talk about the desirability of increased production all round.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who read something to the effect that the major effort would have to be made by industry itself.  I do not know if that was the way it was expressed, but that was the effect of it.  In the same way, while the Government can do much in the way of direction and certain types of help, it can only bring the horse to the water, so to speak.  Action must be taken by agriculture itself to increase production, or any Government efforts in that connection will fail.  Similarly in the case of industry. We want to get maximum production, but questions of hours, conditions of labour and such matters will arise and will have to be taken into account, and we get back to the question of what is our ideal in life.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will admit that, as human beings, we want to have some opportunities of reasonable leisure, to be used in the best way in which we can use it.  It does happen, in fact, that reasonable leisure does not run counter to increased production, because numerous tests have been made which prove that there is a limit to the powers of the human being, and that he can produce more under proper conditions, other things being the same, with reasonably short hours of <Col N="1473" /> work and reasonable recreatión than he can if he works for longer periods. We have, then, in looking for maximum production, to try to secure it without cutting across the other ideals which ought to be aimed at also.  Our aim, fundamentally, must be to try to enable every human being in the country to live the fullest life for which he was destined, or which he is capable of living.  That is the broadest way in which we can state the aim, but, again, it is only an aim, and it does not get you very far until you come down to the practical steps which have to be taken to realise it.  The Minister for Agriculture, in regard to agriculture, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in regard to his Department have indicated the steps which are being taken to try to get the facts of our present situation, so that the moment a clearer view can be got of the post-war position, the proper policy with regard to that situation can be worked out.  So far as it is possible to plan ahead, it is being done.</P>
    <P>The health question has been referred to, and I know that there is no Deputy who is keener on that matter than the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know whether the houses which are at present being held in reserve will be quite suitable, but if we do need places for the segregation or treatment of diseases, which should be segregated and dealt with in that way, these buildings, if they are suitable, can be used temporarily. Most of us have experience of the fact that you do not always get the best results from the adaptation of old buildings.  I am talking now without having, myself, examined that particular question, but I would say that, whilst they might be used temporarily, in the main they are not found suitable for permanent use as sanatoria and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke of our attitude to the fact that, providentially, we have passed through nearly five years of war without becoming involved.  I do not think there is any member of the House who has said more frequently than I have, that gratitude for that should go, in the first instance, to Almighty God, <Col N="1474" /> because no Government or no Power, considering our situation, would have been sufficient to itself in any way to save this country.  We have been in a most dangerous situation throughout this whole war.  Next to that, there was the fact of the unity and determination of our own people, and I think nobody will deny that I have, time after time, said that that was something which had been contributed to by the Opposition Parties and by all members just as much as by the Government or the Government Party.  I have said that during the election, and I have said it since the beginning.  I believe it to be true, and, as he suggested, it is quite right that we gain nothing by not facing the facts.</P>

      <P>It is also true to say that the Powers which are nearest, and had the easiest opportunity of attacking us, did not attack us.  The fact that they recognised our right, and that they did not use their strength against a small country, is to their credit and will remain to their credit. To the extent to which they deserve credit for that, I certainly will not be amongst those who would deny it in the slightest.  I do not need to be reminded from any side of the House that that is the position.  That is the truth.  With Deputy O'Higgins, to that extent, I agree fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Dáil will not be in session for a couple of months, and during that time each of us in his own particular way will have national work to do.  Our particular work from the Government point of view will be, in the first instance, to do the best we can to lighten the burdens that are here at the present moment and pressing heavily upon our people.  We are fully aware of the pressure in the cases where there is a real pressure, and we are quite willing to admit that people with small, fixed remuneration are the section who are at the moment most burdened.  The State is coming, as generously as it can, to the help of the very poor, and in many respects the persons who are earning small incomes are worse off and are more heavily <Col N="1475" /> hit even than the very poor.  The State is unable to come to their relief in the same way as in the case of the very poor&mdash;those who are almost destitute except for State aid.</P>
    <P>It is also true that a number of our people have had to leave this country and seek employment elsewhere. Some of them left this country without any fundamental need to do so.  I remember Deputy Cogan on one occasion&mdash;I think he was one of the first to mention it&mdash;telling us that he had come up on the train with a young man, an agricultural worker, if I am not wrong in my recollection, who had a fair wage at the time, but who was leaving this country for some reason that the Deputy could not understand. He tried to dissuade him from going, but still he was going.  A number of people have left this country unnecessarily, but it is also true that there is a large number who had to leave because the industries in which they were employed had ceased to operate. We are very sorry that that situation has arisen, and we are anxious to see them all back as quickly as it will be possible for them to come.  Our aim must be, as quickly as we can when conditions make it possible, to see that the industries in which they were occupied will be restored. Some of the larger programmes for the absorption of labour have been indicated, and I do not think I should deal with them at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to what he called &ldquo;political corruption&rdquo;.  I hate that word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;.  I think it is the most dangerous word that could be used where democratic institution are concerned.  If it has to be used, let it be used, but &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;, at least to me, connotes a certain thing, and, if it gets in, it practically amounts to a canker which destroys all faith in public institutions. It makes the people of the country almost despair.  I think the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; ought to be kept for the thing to which it properly applies.  If there is something taking place such as has been suggested, I think it could get quite a different name, but I do not know whether it is or not.  I have heard some examples <Col N="1476" /> given here of different types of letters that went out to different Deputies.  In so far as I can see, it was quite possible that those letters could have gone out truthfully.  If it is a fact that those were all of a type, and that there was a policy, then I would say that it was a completely wrong and bad policy from every point of view, and I am as fully against it as any Deputy on the opposite side.  Unfortunately, when there are three or four Deputies of different Parties for the one constituency, there is rivalry amongst them in trying, each one, to show that he is more influential or is able to do something better with Government Departments than the others.  Even when I was in Opposition I disliked this idea of Deputies going to Government officials who had decisions to make, and trying to influence their decisions, but it is extremely difficult to get a remedy.  It is quite obvious that it would be almost impossible for the Minister, who is the proper person to approach in the first instance, to deal with all the individual cases which Deputies do bring up from time to time.  The only reason, in my opinion, why Deputies ought to bring cases along for consideration is when some general rule appears to be affecting or bearing too harshly upon a particular individual, or where there are circumstances in an individual case which the Deputy considers should be taken into account as a modification of some general rule.  I think, as was suggested by Deputies on the opposite side, that to have Deputies going and trying to get favours of one kind or another is quite wrong.  The Deputy who lends himself to that is doing a wrong thing, and no Government official ought to give heed to him, no matter what side of the House he comes from.  I do not think it is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That puts a different complexion upon it.  What it means is this: that a case which was made in writing was not effective until an individual Deputy explained the matter further, or, so to speak, added something verbally to the written word which changed the situation.  We all know it is a fact that if you send a letter to a person&mdash;it does not matter on what subject&mdash;the cold letter may not get that person completely to realise the whole facts of the situation in the same way that he will realise them if there is a verbal approach when questions can be asked and answered. If I get a letter about something, there may be a number of reasons which prevent me from agreeing to the particular proposition set forth, but if I have an opportunity of asking questions and find that the answers to them present a new aspect of the matter, then I may be able to give way.</P>
      <P>I believe it is a great pity, from one point of view, that this thing happens at all.  The fact is that it does happen, and that Deputies from different sides of the House come along to Departments and to Ministers.  I wish it could be all done through the Ministers.  It is through them that it should be done if they could get some mechanism making it possible for them to do it. If it were done directly through a Minister, he would be able to apply his mind to whatever the matter was, and in that way a lot of these ugly features would disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad from the point of view of the relationships between civil servants and Parliament, and bad from every point of view.  Perhaps I should not say from every point of view, because when an individual Deputy advocates a case before the person who is going to make a decision on it he is able to present to that person some particular features of the case which might otherwise be overlooked.  But I <Col N="1478" /> dislike it intensely myself and wish that we could have some system by which it could be avoided.  It is there and has been there for a very long time.  The result of it is that where you have three or four or, sometimes, a larger number of Deputies representing a constituency, there is a certain amount of rivalry between them.  I remember that during the elections I saw some letters which Deputy Norton had sent out and which would indicate, by his efforts, such and such a thing was done.  I mention the Deputy now because his case comes to my mind, but there would be a number of others as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During election times, when Deputies are seeking reelection, they want to put before their constituents the effective work they have done, as representatives of a particular constituency.  Because of that rivalry, you have a situation brought about in which Deputies try, very often, to arrogate to themselves the credit for the doing of things which, if there had not been any particular representations of that kind, would have been done.  I do not know how the thing has worked out in this case, but, since the matter has been raised, I will have an examination made into it.  I do say that it would be quite wrong if there was an effort made by Government Departments to make it appear that all the work done had been done simply by Deputies on the Government side and that nothing was done by other Deputies.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that if Government Deputies could get things, and if other Deputies could not get them, it would then appear that, possibly, there was going to be unequal, unfair or biased administration.  I think that would be wrong, and from that point of view it would defeat itself, if the object were to try to get public kudos.  If it should appear that people giving administrative decisions were going to be influenced by representations, particularly <Col N="1479" /> from the Government side, then it would seem to indicate that there was biased administration.  But the letters, or anything of that kind, would not convince me that, in fact, such a policy was being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letters which have been quoted could, with perfect truth, have gone to different sides, according as to whether some people had made representations and so on.  Deputy Corish cites an example which he thought proved something.  To me it did not prove anything at all.  He said that he brought a Fianna Fáil Deputy with him to interview a Minister.  He did not tell us whether the Minister was aware that he had only pulled the Fianna Fáil Deputy along with him.  I take it that if two Deputies approach a Minister as a deputation on some particular problem, no matter who is the initiator of it, and if a reply is going out, it will apply to each of those who made the representations to the Minister.  It was not the Minister's task to know whether the proposition came originally from Deputy Corish, or whether it was true, in fact, that Deputy Corish took the Fianna Fáil Deputy by the arm outside in the corridor and brought him into the Minister's room.  That would not prove anything to me.  The fact that a letter was written to the Fianna Fáil Deputy would not prove anything.  The Deputy did not tell us whether he got a letter as well.  He said that a letter came to him.  I suppose the address on the envelope was for him&mdash;otherwise it would not have gone to him&mdash; and that the enclosure was for the other Deputy.  Could it not have happened that the other Deputy got Deputy Corish's enclosure?  If I were the judge in that case, I would say that whoever sent out the letters simply sent out the same sort of letter to the two Deputies and put them into different envelopes. If Deputy Corish had followed it up he probably would have found that the other Deputy had got his enclosure. That is possible, it seems to me.  However, these are relatively small things to have to handle.  It is not so easy to deal with the whole problem as to how Deputies are to make the representations <Col N="1480" /> which they feel they should make in regard to particular cases concerning their constituents.  It is not easy to see how that can be done in such a way that it will not have the appearance that there are favours, that there is not biased administration on one side or the other.  If it were possible, I would like to see all communications of that sort going directly through the Minister.  I suppose that is not possible.  It would not be possible for a Minister to see all the Deputies who would wish to see him.</P>

I take it that what the Deputies on the opposite benches object to is that it should go out this way to a Fianna Fáil Deputy: &ldquo;In accordance with representations made by you, such-and-such a thing will be done.&rdquo;  While they <Col N="1481" /> object to that, Deputy Hughes, to take an example, comes along and makes representations and wants the reply to go out: &ldquo;In accordance with your representations&rdquo; or, &ldquo;because of your representations such-and-such a thing was done.&rdquo;  It is not easy to get uniform procedure or to do a thing in such a way as will prevent people from feeling that they have a grievance. I know this to have happened, that very often two or three Deputies will come along to deal with the same matter at the one time.  In this House we often see a Deputy from a particular constituency standing up and then a Deputy from another side will get up.  It is the same when dealing with Questions.  When some local question is raised, questions come, not from one but from two or three Deputies.  Sometimes if a Deputy hears that a question is being raised by another Deputy in the same constituency he comes along and makes certain that he becomes a party to it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £342,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Supplies, including payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This supplementary sum is required for two main purposes.  I informed the Dáil that, arising out of a shortage of coal requirements, we have arranged to procure and to transport to Dublin approximately 200,000 tons of turf for industrial needs.  The turf made available for industrial use will be 64/- per ton, but selling it at that price will involve the Government in a loss.  The loss in the sale of turf sold for industrial purposes will be considerably less than in the case of turf stacked in dumps and sold from dumps for domestic purposes, because it can, in the main, be transported from the bogs to the consumers, and, in any event, will be sold in quantities considerably larger than the domestic ration.  It is estimated that on turf sold for industrial use a loss of about 15/- per ton will develop.  On the basis of 200,000 tons sold, an additional £150,000 will be required, and that figure has been brought up to £200,000 to meet the eventuality of some turf having to be sold for industrial purposes from the dumps.  In the case of turf sold from dumps the loss will be greater, because there is wastage allowance also involved. The second purpose for which this sum is required is on the construction of additional camps.  On the assumption that the fuel emergency will continue to 1945, it is thought <Col N="1484" /> opportune to make arrangements now for increased turf production next year. One of the measures contemplated in that regard is the construction of three additional camps in the Kildare area.</P>
    <P>Whether it will be possible to build these camps at all depends entirely on the availability of material; but on the assumption that materials will be available, we require from the Dáil the necessary financial sanction.  Plans for the construction of three additional camps were made prior to the recent development in relation to fuel, which has raised doubts as to the availability of materials.  Assuming that we can get the materials, we propose to proceed with these plans.  The construction of the three camps will involve, it is estimated, an expenditure of £105,400; but in addition it will be necessary to undertake certain drainage works, the construction of roads, railway and loading banks, to a cost of a further £36,600, making a total sum required of £142,000. The total additional amount required, therefore, for fuel purposes in the year is £342,000, which is the amount I am now asking the Dáil to vote.</P>

      <P>There is one question I would like to ask the Minister, in regard to the turf subsidy.  Last year, the Minister gave us figures as to the cost of producing turf and the price at which turf is sold in Dublin.  Could the Minister give us any indication now as to what it is costing, on an average, to produce the turf which is being sold in Dublin at 64/- per ton?  Could he also give us an assurance that it is not contemplated&mdash;as has been rumoured in certain quarters&mdash;to increase the price of turf to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me what turf costs to produce.  He is, I think, seeking information that will be of little use to him.  The cost of the turf to Fuel Importers, Limited depends, not merely on the production price but also on the transport charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that was a good while ago.  We got figures last year, which indicated that there was a subsidy of 28/10.  I think, on turf sold at 64/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give no further information: the only figure I can give now would be the same figure as last year, as the costs that are going to arise in connection with this year's harvest cannot yet be determined.  It is assumed, as I told the Dáil during the discussion on the main Estimate, that the charge for turf produced by the county councils will be some shillings higher this year than last year, mainly due to higher wages paid to turf workers; but apart from that increased charge for county council turf and some additional transport costs, arising out of increased rail freights, the all-in cost of the turf should remain much the same.  A great deal depends on the quantity of turf sold direct from railhead to fuel distributors, or the quantity that can be delivered by rail or road into distributors' yards.  On that turf there is, in fact, little loss at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss mainly arises in connection with turf that has to be stored in dumps.  In the extra handling involved in the ricking, first in the dumps and subsequent unloading of the turf from the dumps, the wastage is reckoned at about 20 per cent. and thus adds about 20 per cent. to the total cost.  That wastage may, in fact, prove of less financial significance in this year than in the past as, heretofore, we wrote off the turf mould as a dead loss.  It has not proved to be a dead loss.  Originally, we contemplated sending that mould back by canal to the briquette factory and making briquettes out of it, and some 500 or 600 tons was disposed of in that way; but latterly there has been a substantial industrial demand for turf mould and, in fact, all the mould which was available has been sold to industrial firms whose boilers are of a type which permits of the use of mould as fuel in preference to the use of sods. However, to what extent that new development&mdash;and it is a new development&mdash;will affect the all-in cost of the <Col N="1486" /> turf, it is very difficult to say at this stage.</P>
    <P>The actual cost of turf produced varies considerably from bog to bog, and we take the average cost at the point of discharge at 57/4.  That is an average cost and does not represent the actual cost in any particular district. It would include the cost of turf production by county councils as well as turf purchased from private individuals. An allowance must also be made as regards the price of turf produced at the turf camps, which is higher still, added to the varying transport costs and, in various circumstances, some allowances in respect of the cost of putting turf in dumps and wastage of the turf in dumps.</P>
    <P>I can give the Deputy only the figures for last year and could not give a close estimate for this year.  On the turf which is being sold for industrial purposes and which will be sold in larger quantities direct to consumers and transported from the bog area to the consumer, we expect to lose 15/- a ton; but the Deputy will understand that that is nothing more than a guess, as a number of factors may make it more or less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Leaving out the question of price and cost, the quality of the turf&mdash;particularly of that coming into this city&mdash;must be considered. It was a scandal at any time to send up, some of the turf I have seen brought in and in the course of transit; but, under present circumstances, when the transport situation is so acute, I think it is a crime.  I have seen turf loaded on wagons and in lorries for this city that would not be drawn out of a bog by people at home in the country.  It would not pay them and they would not dream of doing it; they would not even class it as turf at all.  It is a shame to bring it up.  I know there are difficulties, but I suggest that the Minister should make representations to the Turf Development Board, not only for the <Col N="1487" /> sake of the unfortunate consumers here in the city, but certainly in order to make the fullest possible use of the limited transport at our disposal, that as far as possible only turf of good quality will be brought in.  I know that there has been an improvement. I do not think that there is such bad turf coming into the city now as there was last year or the year before, or in the first year it started; but I am afraid there is still a very considerable quantity of turf coming in that, in my opinion, it is a shame to give to consumers, as it is nearly impossible to burn it, and that it is also a shame and a complete waste of transport to be bringing it here at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to my particular area.  As I am sure the Minister knows, it is between Cahir and Mitchelstown, on the main Cork-Dublin road.  About four miles south of Cahir, there is an old ball-alley and a road leading from there to the Galtee Mountains, about three Irish miles from the trunk road.  The bog is within sight of where I live, but I have never been on it and it has the reputation of having the best turf in Ireland&mdash;but then, we are all good at the use of superlatives.  There are banks there where the turf is 30 feet deep.  I think Kilcoran is the name of the townland.  About three years ago a grant was made by the Government to recondition three miles of that road up to the turf bog.  There must be hundreds of acres of turf there, but we get our turf for North Tipperary from Kerry and Galway.  That must be a great waste in transport, when there is turf within three miles of us.</P>
      <P>I understand the reconditioning of that road cost £300 or £400.  There are really only two people taking turf from that bog and about 100 clamouring for it.  If the Minister would take note of that, I think the county surveyor in Clonmel would put him wise as to it.  What happened I do not know, but the road was to be reconditioned. The Government was giving a grant and possibly the county council, but there it is.  There are hundreds of acres of turf there, 30 or 40 feet deep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in Kildare, Laoighis and Wieklow but mostly in <Col N="1489" /> Kildare.  As to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, precautions are taken to ensure that bad turf is not transported.  We fully appreciate the necessity for conserving transport facilities and avoiding the waste of these facilities by using them to bring turf that can never be any good. Arrangements are made for inspection of the turf at the loading points to ensure the rejection of turf that can never be any good.  It does not follow that turf which is not immediately usable is rejected.  The turf may be segregated into two classes&mdash;that which is immediately usable and can be sent direct into the merchant's yard or into the yard of the industrial consumer and turf which, although not immediately usable, is capable of becoming usable after a period in rick or in dump.  The aim is to secure that turf which cannot be used and which will not be capable of use is not transported.  I expect that there will be a satisfactory improvement in the quality of turf this year because the season has been favourable to turf-winning.  But people in Dublin City who are not accustomed to using turf should realise that turf is not coal, that it has peculiarities which coal has not, one of these peculiarities being absorption of moisture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf absorbs moisture when transported under rain, when stacked on damp ground, or when placed in proximity to wet turf.  It is not like coal in that respect.  Therefore, turf requires to be handled in an entirely different way from coal and it is only in the course of time that people in the city who have not been in the habit of using turf as a fuel will become accustomed to its peculiarities and make the best possible use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the road mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell, he must have in mind a minor relief grant for the construction of the road to which he refers, in which case I refer him to the Board of Works, or some road work necessary to facilitate the production of turf by the county council, in which case he has got to go to the county manager.  The Turf Development <Col N="1490" /> Board would not be responsible for the construction of a road of that kind.  It may be a road required for the convenience of local people producing turf for their own needs, in which case the Board of Works may, or may not, be prepared to make some grant for its construction.  If it is intended to facilitate turf operations by the county council, then the county council would be responsible.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reference to the handling of turf and the handling of coal tempts me to make a few remarks.  Deputy Morrissey referred to the wastage involved in using railway trucks for carrying turf which is inferior.  Is the Minister satisfied with the way coal is being handled on the railway and with the utilisation of the railway trucks for this purpose?  I have information that 26 wagons were lying under load for six or seven days at a station between Arigna and Dublin.  Will the Minister look into the transport facilities afforded in connection with our Irish coal?  It is coming in now with fair regularity and promptitude from the mines.  What is the average time required to bring a wagon of coal to Dublin, Bray or Carlow?  Up to the 20th of this month, 26 wagons were lying under load with Irish coal at a station between Arigna and here.  Why should the wagons be kept out of service in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the biggest problem in connection with the transport of turf is concentrated in Dublin.  I refer both to the turf coming into Dublin and to the rehandling of the turf within the city boundaries.  I put it to the Minister that those responsible might be urged to reconsider the whole system in operation at the <Col N="1491" /> moment.  We can recall numerous complaints last winter, both inside the House and outside, that turf was not available in different parts of the city because of lack of bellmen in certain districts.  The Minister did make certain improvements, but in some parts of the city&mdash;notably in Crumlin and the west end of Cabra&mdash;it was impossible to obtain turf on more than one day in the week.  I suggest that this concentration of the available turf in two main dumps should be reconsidered from the point of view of transport.  It has been suggested to Fuel Importers that the situation might be dealt with by the opening of dumps by the corporation.</P>
      <P>We have in the city certain lines of transport along which the turf is brought in&mdash;railways and canals.  Along the Grand Canal, a new bank has been made at Dolphin's Barn.  Could not other banks be made, not only along the Grand Canal, but along the Royal Canal?  In that way, you would have local dumps of turf immediately contiguous to the people who are going to use it.  It would come straight off the barges to the people, and a great deal of handling would be cut out.  It would also save a tremendous amount of local transport, as sections of the Grand and Royal Canals run through the two districts where the demand for turf delivered in that form is greatest.  In that way you would relieve the congestion that is developing on the main dumps.  When there is a big consignment of turf by rail or by road, it results in men having to work from 20 to 25 hours by way of overtime every week in order to clear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will also get over the difficulty of trying to find sufficient local transport. I refer to the bellmen who take the turf, in the small quantities necessary, to the outlying districts.  The number of bellmen now engaged in carting turf in that way is slightly more than the number who used to handle coal, because at the present time they have to handle almost two and a half times the quantity of fuel.  Naturally, there is a certain amount of difficulty in finding bellmen to meet the requirements of the people in the outlying areas.  In Crumlin and some other <Col N="1492" /> areas on the outskirts of the city there are as many as 40,000 or 50,000 people, and in the winter time if you get beyond a certain point, it may be found that there is very little turf to spare. If local dumps were available along the Grand Canal, they would be within easy reach of many of the families residing in those outlying areas.  That would mean cutting out the transport of the fuel a distance of at least four or five miles.  These dumps could be built not only along the canals, but also along the railway lines that we have circling round the city.  I believe it would ease the present fuel transport problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might put that matter to Fuel Importers and see if it would not be possible to arrange a system based on local needs during the coming winter.  The position is that 320,000 tons of turf will be brought in this season, as against 160,000 tons last year.  That shows the enormity of the problem that has to be faced.  Unless there is some improvement in the method of distribution, the position will be somewhat the same as last winter.  Large quantities of turf will remain in the dumps and the fuel will not reach the people who need it.</P>

The Central Fund Act, 1944, authorises the issue of the proportion of the total of the Estimates for the current financial year which has been granted on account by the Dáil; the further release from the Central Fund provided for in Section 1 of this Bill will make available the balance required for the public services for the current financial year, excluding the amounts of the Supplementary Estimates for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance and for Supplies already introduced, and such further Supplementary Estimates as it may be found necessary to lay before the House later in the year.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the Bill prescribes legally the several services on which the sums authorised to be issued from the Central Fund under the Central Fund Act, 1944, and under this Bill may be spent, and the amount which may be spent on each such service. These services and amounts are set out in a Schedule to the Act, which is, therefore, the headline by reference to which the Comptroller and Auditor-General scrutinises accounts to see whether public moneys are being applied in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas.  This process of setting aside definite sums of money to be spent on specified purposes is known as &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; and gives the Bill its short title.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes the usual provision for borrowing by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of meeting demands on the Exchequer, the amount authorised to be borrowed being the same as the amount authorised to be issued from the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>It may be found in the coming months that the unemployment relief grants are not sufficient to cope <Col N="1495" /> with the position.  Will the Minister say whether local authorities can have power to apply for additional grants in order to cope with the unemployment that may grow upon us rapidly owing to the scarcity of timber, cement and other materials necessary to carry on the building trade?  We must consider the position in the cities and towns and in the country districts from the point of view of growing unemployment between now and the next meeting of the Dáil.  Has the Minister considered any emergency regulations to cope with that problem so as to provide the wherewithal for the big numbers who have lost, and will lose, employment?</P>
      <P>I understand that within the last month over 2,000 men lost their employment in the building trade alone. We have been told in the corporation that the position is likely to become worse because of the failure to get materials.  We are told there is timber available, but there is no method of transporting it, and there is no electric power to cut it when it is brought to the sawmills.  I would like to know, before the House adjourns, what are the Government's intentions in connection with any unemployment that may arise within the next couple of months through a shortage of materials?</P>
