This district&mdash;with which it is proposed to combine some tributary schemes&mdash;has been inspected by an engineer, but it extends into three counties, Mayo, Galway and Roscommon, and petitions complying with the requirements of the Act have not yet been received from the County Councils of Galway and Roscommon.

      <P>Owing to the fact that there are large and well-equipped schools already in Galway it is not quite clear that there will be a sufficient supply of pupils for the new school, and if there is not a certain minimum average of pupils in attendance it will not be possible to provide for the new school a staff which could ensure its success.

      <P>Information is not available in the precise form asked for, but the following represents the position in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notices of acquisition of land or premises have been served on 96 occupiers other than public bodies. Agreements as to compensation have already been reached with 60 occupiers, involving lump sum payments amounting to £37,200, and rentals amounting to £767 per annum for land acquired temporarily.  Payment has actually been made to 43 occupiers of a total lump sum of £30,998, and annual rentals of £606; payment will be made in the other cases in which agreements have been reached when the occupiers concerned have made proof of title.  In sixteen of the thirty-six cases in which agreements have not yet been reached notices were not served until recently; negotiations have been <Col N="7" /> begun in the remainder, and I understand that six are on the point of settlement.  I have no doubt that the others will be disposed of by agreement in due course.  No case for the reference of any claim to arbitration has yet arisen, nor is there any reason to anticipate that any procedure will be necessary other than settlement by agreement, which has already proved satisfactory in all cases negotiated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there was a considerable amount of discussion as to the effect of the woollen tariff on the ready-made clothing manufacture which has grown <Col N="18" /> up, and which has been stimulated as a result of the tariff on apparel. Representations were made by the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers' Association, through their advisory committee, and the matter was referred to the Tariff Commission, who made a report which I hope will be in the hands of Deputies this evening.  The difficulty which the Tariff Commission were up against in fixing the exemption limit for cloth in their original report was the point at which it should be fixed.  It was admitted by the representatives of the woollen manufacturers who went before them that the very cheapest cloth would not be made here, but the Tariff Commissioners found that there were certain firms here which were making cloths, at any rate of a fairly cheap variety; that there were firms in the Free State which were making use of reclaimed wool in the manufacture of cloth, and that as a matter of fact a firm had installed a rag-pulling machine.  They were anxious to fix the exemption limit low enough to encourage manufacturers who were inclined to develop that particular end of the business to proceed, with the result that they recommended in their original report that the limit should be 1/6, that cloth over 1/6 should be liable, and that cloth valued at 1/6 or under per square yard should not be liable to duty.</P>
    <P>They have considered the representations of the wholesale clothing manufacturers and the views expressed by the representatives of the Irish Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers' Association, and as a result of that further consideration they are satisfied that cloths valued at 2/6 per square yard, or about 4/- per trade yard, should not for the present be liable to duty.  The manufacturers have admitted that for some time ahead they will not be able to supply cloths of that value, and while in certain lines of business the wholesale clothing manufacturers would still have a fair margin of protection, in some other lines of business, if they had to pay duty on the cloth which they use, they would not <Col N="19" /> have the margin of profit which is necessary to carry on business.  The recommendation of the Tariff Commission is that the extension of the exemption should be for a period of five years only, and at the end of the five-year period we should revert to the original limit of 1/6 per square yard.  It is one of these matters which the Tariff Commissioners indicated they found it extremely difficult to make up their minds about. It is one of the matters in which it is exceedingly difficult to get entirely reliable evidence.  Different people who have been before them at different times have slightly differed in their views.  For instance, the woollen manufacturers began by stating in the first instance that if the tariff were granted the whole needs of the consumer could be supplied. Then a little later they said that at the end of one to one and a half years they would be able to meet every class of stuff that would be required to clothe the people of the country.  Later on they said that they could not manufacture cloth for ready-made clothing for sale at 1/6 or 3/- a yard.  Now their admission is that, for some time at any rate, they will not be able to produce the cloths for the ready-made clothing trade.  The alternative, therefore, that the Tariff Commission had before them on reconsidering the matter was to decide whether they would recommend some raising of the exemption limit, or recommend an increased duty on ready-made clothing. They have recommended that there should be for the five years' period an increase in the exemption limit from 1/6 to 2/6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for Deputies to discuss this Resolution until they have actually received the report of the Tariff Commission upon which it is based, but the Minister will recollect when the original Resolution imposing the duty upon woollen cloth was before the House, Deputies on this side were at great pains to point out to him that the particular manner in which it was done would result in decreasing the <Col N="20" /> effective duty on ready-made clothing. We argued then, however, that the way to escape that situation was not the method he now proposes to adopt.  The effect of this increased exemption limit from 1/6 to 2/6 will be to encourage the importation of shoddy cloth into the country.  There can be no doubt whatever that that will be the effect.  There will be a very strong inducement to manufacturers who formerly imported cloth of a better quality to import the cheaper cloth now, because they can get that in tax free.  We have given this matter careful examination, and have had an opportunity of discussing it with those whose interests are primarily concerned.  That and other sources of information open to us convinced us in our belief that the way to deal with the situation was to increase the duty on ready-made clothing.  If you increase the duty on ready-made clothing you will be maintaining an effective protection, and you will be giving to ready-made clothing manufacturers at the old limit.  You would be increasing the market available for Irish cloth and encouraging the use of a better class of cloth in ready-made suits.  I think we will be under an obligation to oppose this Resolution. It is the wrong way to go about dealing with the situation which the mistake of the Tariff Commissioners has created.  The introduction of this Resolution at this stage is, in fact, a vote of censure on the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>They have been considering this application for a duty on woollen cloth over two years and despite the very long time they took on it the final report which they submitted to the Dáil was one which they found, on reconsideration, they could not stand over and consequently they come here to amend their original proposition.  The whole situation with regard to the protection of Irish industries appears to have been seriously muddled and the Government is open to very severe criticism on that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would there be any use asking the Minister to ask the Tariff Commission again to reconsider <Col N="21" /> their decision.  Perhaps if they did they might get additional information to induce them to change their minds and to take the course which common sense indicates is the obvious course in regard to a duty on ready-made clothing.  As I said, the effect would be three-fold and there would be no ill effects except perhaps a slight increase in the cost of the suits made out of shoddy.  To increase that price is to the national good in order to discourage the use of shoddy and to encourage the use of the better cloth produced in the Irish mills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to defer consideration of this Resolution until we have the report of the Tariff Commission before us?  I feel it very difficult to discuss a matter of this kind and of this importance without having the evidence that was before the Tariff Commission.  I think it is only fair to the members of this House that they should have this information before resolutions of this character are brought forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In the original discussion on these financial resolutions I asked if the Irish woollen millers could not, in some way, meet the situation by manufacturing a cheaper class of cloth, which I thought would at least go some way towards meeting the demand that existed at that time and which still exists&mdash;that it would be a sound business proposition for some woollen miller in this country to engage in the manufacture of a cheaper class of cloth, the trade name of which is shoddy.  I suggested then that there was apparently in this country a demand for shoddy, and whilst that demand continued, and while it was profitable for somebody outside the Saorstát to manufacture shoddy, that it might also be considered profitable for someone within the Saorstát to manufacture shoddy. I am giving expression to an individual view when I say that some attempt is made in this Resolution to meet that point.  I think the term used by the Minister was &ldquo;reclaimed wool.&rdquo;  An attempt is made <Col N="22" /> here by reducing the price per yard to 2/6 to meet the situation.  As one who comes from a district in which there are many woollen millers, I believe that we have enterprise enough in this country to meet the situation that at present exists.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Lemass who spoke of the better class suit.  Deputy Lemass must remember that there are thousands of people in this country who cannot afford the better class suit, and who will feel not at all thankful to him or to anybody else for such a suggestion.  I speak as one who believes largely in protective tariffs.  In some industries we need protection&mdash;selective tariffs, if you like.  I do not think these people will be at all thankful to Deputy Lemass for suggesting that the tariffs on ready-made clothing should be increased to such an extent that it would be far beyond the purchasing capacity of the poor person. Such person has to purchase not one suit or two suits, but several suits of clothes in the year.  I am considering the family man who has to clothe himself, his wife, and possibly three or four children.  I do suggest that here is an attempt, at any rate, to meet this case.  I do not care whether the solution comes from a Fianna Fáil Government or a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, notwithstanding the fact that I may be labelled as having voted Fianna Fáil on one occasion when it suited me and Cumann na nGaedheal on the next when it suited me. That is very likely a charge that I will lay myself open to.  Here is an honourable and decent attempt to meet the situation.  We cannot have it both ways, we cannot hold out that we are all out for tariffs, and when there are certain reactions, when the ready-made people approach us, say we are not.  We cannot have our money on the two horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the position created in this country that whilst many of us are out for tariffs, we find after a bit that there are certain reactions. We cannot square our consciences by going back to these people and saying that we will do our best. <Col N="23" /> There must be some finality as far as tariffs are concerned.  I think this is the via media; it is meeting us half way, those of us who still believe that the woollen industry in this country as a key industry requires protection.  We found, having supported a woollen tariff, that there were certain reactions and I think this is the way to meet the reactions which many of us did not anticipate. I for one, did not anticipate, when supporting this tariff, that it would have the reactions which I found afterwards it did have.  I discussed this matter with people in the ready-made trade.  Whilst they felt that it might adversely influence their trading for many years to come, I do believe, having discussed it with many of them, that this will meet their case.  I am prepared to go back to the people whom I represent, at any rate, and discuss it with them.  I intend to support this Resolution.  I may say that I am speaking on this as an individual.  I have not consulted any member of my Party in relation to this matter.  We did not get a chance of discussing it.  But I do believe that it is a decent attempt to meet the situation created by the tariff on woollens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support this Resolution, not because it is a tariff resolution but because it demonstrates clearly that those people who ask for tariffs are not doing it for the sake of giving employment on all occasions, but for the sake of getting profit.  It is an admirable illustration of that fact that we have it stated in the Tariff Commission's report that this woollen industry has idle capital to the amount of £300,000.  They have got their tariff and they are not prepared to use any of the £300,000 to instal machines to produce cheap material for the working man.  I think it is proof, if proof were necessary, that all this is done by back stair methods to get profits for manufacturers, irrespective of the amount of employment they are to give.  If this £300,000 were used in making cheap material for which there is <Col N="24" /> undoubtedly a market, as many people cannot pay the higher prices for clothing, there would be a good case for the manufacturers.  I would agree, to some extent, that they had justified their request for a tariff, but here we have a set of rich manufacturers who have deliberately withheld their capital from developing their business for years for the purpose of getting the Government to guarantee them an extra 25 per cent. profit on their goods.  The working man wants a cheap suit but they refuse to make cheap material to meet the demand.  I will have to support the Resolution.  I hope that other reactions will so develop that this tariff on woollens will be taken off in a year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy who has just sat down, or I, heard the Minister for Finance aright.  I understood him to say when he was introducing this Resolution that at least one woollen manufacturer had invested in a rag-pulling machine and intended to manufacture the cheap quality of cloth which is required for the making of ready-made clothing.  I may be wrong, but I thought he did say that.  I think the Minister also admitted in the same breath that the Tariff Commission were very anxious to encourage manufacturers to develop this new line of business.  If that is so, then I think the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is a rather paradoxical way of giving that encouragement, because one of the effects of the Resolution which the House is asked to consider will be to stifle that industry at its birth.  If hitherto the woollen manufacturers in a free market in Ireland have not been able to develop that end&mdash;if there is no inducement to do that&mdash; what inducement is this Resolution going to offer them?  Possibly we could understand a proposal of this sort if it were intended to have effect only for a very limited term. Admittedly the manufacturers say that at the present moment, and possibly for some time, they cannot meet the whole demand for the <Col N="25" /> cheaper cloth.  But surely they are going to be able to meet it in a much shorter period than within five years?  I understand the proposal the Minister has in mind is to grant this exemption for a term of possibly five years.  I submit that is much too long a period.  If he is sincere in his desire to encourage manufacturers who are prepared to embark upon the manufacture of a cheaper quality of cloth, I submit that he should introduce this Resolution and make it effective for some period not exceeding twelve months.  That would give enterprising manufacturers a clear indication that at the end of a limited period they would have a chance here in their own home market.</P>

      <P>It is rather amazing to observe not so much the suggestion as the repeated assertion in Deputy Anthony's speech that a tariff on woollens necessarily means an increased price for ready-made clothing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not borne out by the results of any tariffs in Great Britain, so far as one can observe. It is amazing to find a Labour Deputy seizing hold of the favourite argument of the importer to make a case against a tariff in operation. Here is a proposal to give away work that this State stands very much in need of&mdash;to cancel the effect of the woollen tariff passed here quite recently.  It is to say, in effect.  &ldquo;Let us, instead of encouraging the manufacture of woollens for the clothing of the Irish people, encourage the importation of shoddy for clothing the Irish people.&rdquo;  Yet that is supported from the Labour Benches.  I do not think this country can afford to give away work.  I think it is far too much in need of work at the moment.  The effect of this Resolution will be to give a great impetus to the manufacture of shoddy suits in this country.  Naturally, when they are manufactured here <Col N="26" /> the sale of them will be pushed. That is going very seriously to effect the attainment of the ideal that everybody had in mind&mdash;that Irish people would be clothed from native materials.  Deputy Anthony evidently is not too keen on that ideal. We here are keen on it, and I think anybody who believes in it, anybody who sees the necessity for retaining work in this State by providing for the people's requirements, must vote against this Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Moore suggest that we have no wool to retain in this country?  Does he suggest that this would not be a useful industry?  Does he suggest that it will keep money in this country if the people cannot afford to buy the class of woollen material which is at present turned out by our Irish mills?  Here we have a concrete case where a miller is prepared to turn out the stuff.  Is not that keeping the money at home?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Resolution was originally proposed it resulted in a situation where a suit made out of Irish cloth, costing three shillings a square yard, could be sold at the same price as a suit made out of English cloth at 2/6 a square yard, upon which duty had been paid.  The effect of this Resolution is to reduce the price of the English suit in order to enable the manufacturers to sell that in preference to the suit made of Irish cloth.  It will have even a greater effect; it will encourage the manufacturers to import the cheaper cloth and sell the cheaper suit in order to expand their business.  We will by passing this be in fact encouraging the use of shoddy in preference to the cloth produced in Irish mills&mdash;better cloth which can be sold at a cheap price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said practically all I want to say.  I can only repeat that it is a very wrong policy that Deputies should assume as axiomatic that prices necessarily rise with a tariff.  I think it is wrong that those who may have very many tariffs coming before them in future should approach them with the certainty that <Col N="27" /> they are going to raise the price of the goods affected.  It is not borne out in practice.  As a matter of fact, it is a contradiction of the theory which should guide us in the matter.</P>

      <P>What a silly argument! I was saying the prices ought naturally to reduce as the mills increase their turn-over and as they have a more secure market. There must be some curious reason when this method is proposed of meeting the requirements of the ready-made manufacturers.  The obvious method would seem to be to increase the tariff on ready-made clothing.  One would like to hear a more elaborate explanation from the Minister for Finance as to why this method is adopted.  The method proposed is an extremely harmful one, and one which those interested in industry should oppose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass announces that this is a criticism by the Tariff Commission of itself.  He has not studied the Tariff Commission report on woollens very carefully. If he had he would have observed the statement that they did not get the assistance they were entitled to receive either from the applicants or the opponets of a tax on woollens.  In the addendum to the report it is set out that they were given misleading evidence.  They were told by certain people when the application was being considered, and before it was granted, that the Irish woollen mills in a very short time could supply cloth of all grades.  It is only now when the tariff is granted and when the manufacturers have had what they consider to be the big bulk of the trade thrown in their way, that more accurate statements are being made. We now find statements from them that for some years to come they do not see themselves able to manufacture, under the exemption spoken of, the type of clothing used in the cheaper suit worn in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been statements made that numbers of suits sold in the country are made from this cheaper kind of cloths. That bears out somewhat the contention spoken of by the retail people that their business was going to be seriously hampered if the Saorstát mills could not supply cloth of a particular type, and if the demand for these suits continued.  We are taking this way of dealing with the situation on the advice of the Tariff Commission.  The alternative is to increase the retail tariff all round and to give the public the benefit of a higher price on certain articles which the Free State manufacturers do not see they will be able to manufacture for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked by another Deputy what is the incentive to the Saorstát miller to get into this type of clothing. And another Deputy says that the result of the tariff will be that a greater amount of shoddy will be imported <Col N="29" /> into the country for the manufacture of a type of cheap suits. Surely, that is the incentive to the manufacturer to get into this lower end of the trade if he has capital for new machines, or if he can get a better business and look for capital for machines hereafter.  And if the manufacturer finds his trade in the good types of clothing is ruined because a bigger amount of shoddy stuff is being imported and, therefore, that his business is being eaten into, surely he will have the incentive immediately presented to him of going into this end of the business. Manufacturers know very well from the previous report of the Tariff Commission, that when they can show under different circumstances that they can deal with this end of the trade their application is likely to be favourably received. They have the suggestion that the exemption point was fixed very low.</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty that Deputy Anthony spoke of, that people in this country want a certain grade of suit. The manufacturers of woollen fabrics say that they cannot get the raw material for that type of suit. There are two alternatives&mdash;leaving it open to the manufacturers to find if they can manufacture the lower grade cloth or allow this type of cloth to be imported, thus giving business to the maker of ready-made suits in the country, and leaving it open to the woollen manufacturer hereafter to come along and claim that the exemption point should be put down to the limit previously fixed by the Tariff Commission.  It is the sane and sensible way of getting over the difficulty, if one bears in mind to any extent the consumer. Deputy Lemass's rough-and-ready way of dealing with the situation is a marvellously good one, if one did not care what happened to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how an increase on the tariff on imported ready-made clothing could increase the price of the suit made out of Irish cloth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would increase <Col N="30" /> the price of the suits which have to be bought, seeing that the woollen manufacturers in the Saorstát say they cannot make this particular type of cloth.  That would be certain to increase the price of the suit.  If there is going to be a demand for a particular kind of suit, the cloth used in which the Saorstát manufacturers say they cannot manufacture at the moment, then it is clear that shoddy suits are going to come in and the shoddy suits are to be at a higher price.  Surely that is clear to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance the question already asked by Deputy Good.  Is there any particular reason why this Resolution could not have waited until the House was in possession of some of the evidence that was given by the manufacturers?  Is there any technical difficulty about the time? I am merely asking for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to the postponement of the Report Stage of the Resolution until Friday and introducing the Finance Bill that day only that the Finance Bill cannot be introduced until these Resolutions have been disposed of, because we propose to have sections in the Bill giving effect to these Resolutions.  It is desirable to have the Bill circulated as soon as possible. This report can be in the hands of the Deputies this evening or to-morrow morning.  It will certainly be in the hands of the Deputies in the morning and there would be time between that and Friday morning for the consideration of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the Minister have left these Resolutions over until then?  It does seem a very loose sort of procedure that we should be asked to consent to this Resolution, which is founded upon evidence which ought to be produced to us and which is not being produced to us until after the House is supposed to have come to some decision on the Resolution.  I do not want to say anything unkind at the moment, but it is rather difficult to find a word that is not unkind to describe a proceeding <Col N="31" /> of the kind.  It is a proceeding that ought not to be followed in the future.  I thought that the reason for this procedure was that the time at which this Bill had to be introduced had expired, or something like that, and that there was a technical reason.  But, on the face of it, when we are asked to give this decision before we have the evidence and when no reason whatever is given for that, then I think it is unreasonable. It is perfectly obvious that the House is being asked to express an opinion on this Resolution, which has been drawn up by the Minister for Finance on certain evidence, and that that evidence will not be in the possession of the House until the House has expressed its decision on it.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that that is a method of dealing with financial matters which is really an objectionable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy Flinn said, there is really, for all ordinary cases, no alternative to this procedure.  When it is proposed to impose or remit taxes, the only fair and reasonable method is to have a resolution brought into the Dáil without notice and to have it given effect at once.  Otherwise you would have disturbance in trade, perhaps abuses.  You would have, for instance, serious forestalling if it were known that taxes were going to be increased.  It is necessary, when a tax is going to be imposed for the first time, or increased, that the House should go into it and give it a First Reading and then the matter can be considered later on Report.  In regard to remissions, very much the same thing will apply. If notice were given that there were going to be remissions, then you might possibly have business held up and factories closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion, when the sugar duty was reduced, the reduction did not take place for a week. In that case, a factory closed down and the hands were paid off, I think; therefore, in cases even of remissions the most suitable practice for the responsible Minister is to bring the <Col N="32" /> proposals to the House and then the House, unless the proposals seem to be so objectionable that it will not consider them at all, can give them a First Reading.  The Resolutions are then taken back and the House can consider them on Report.  On Report, the House can reject them if it seems wise to it to do so.  But I think the procedure followed&mdash;and a good deal of attention has been given to it&mdash;is, on the whole, the best procedure, and in most cases is the only possible procedure.  It means, of course, that the House shall allow a matter to go through without very serious consideration in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wanted to adopt the procedure we adopt on ordinary Bills, why could not a resolution of this character be introduced and then discussed at a subsequent date? We came here this afternoon and found this Resolution put before us. A discussion takes place on a matter that has been before the Tariff Commission. We have not got the facts that possibly were before the Commission, with the exception of what the Minister desired to mention.  To my mind, that is most unfair, and I must protest against this constant chopping and changing.  The way we are changing tariffs is practically the same as selling apples.  We passed this tariff only a few weeks ago and now we are making a serious alteration in it.  On previous occasions I protested against the want of stability in our tariff policy.  If we want to have trade at all, we must have settled conditions and stability. We cannot be chopping and changing tariffs from week to week; yet that is the policy the Minister asks us to support.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to give due consideration to the proposals of the Tariff Commission, when I have these proposals before me, but to ask the House to adopt resolutions binding itself to a decision before the evidence is before it is, to my mind, unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that this <Col N="33" /> matter should be dealt with in the same way as ordinary financial resolutions are dealt with, that the House need not discuss it at length and can hardly do so to-day as it has not the report of the Tariff Commission before it, but should give it the First Reading that is given to financial resolutions when they are put before the House.  They will have the report to-morrow morning at latest, or probably this evening.  Deputies will have an opportunity of reading it, and the Report Stage of the Resolution can be taken on Friday, when the matter can be fully discussed. One of the reasons why I desire the Report Stage to be taken so soon as Friday is that, pending the passage of this Resolution, the introduction of the Finance Bill is held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not arrange in future that if this procedure is to be adopted we should get <Col N="34" /> the report of the Tariff Commission at the same time?  This particular report must be a very brief one, and the House is looking at this question as a very special problem.  The very nature of tariffs is illustrated by this particular tariff.  The Minister having regard to his knowledge of that fact, and the spirit in which this House has examined that tariff as a problem, most certainly should have gone out of his way to see that as much information as possible was in possession of the House at the moment that Deputies were asked to discuss it.  As far as I can see, there does not seem to be the slightest difficulty in giving the House that report immediately after the Minister has formally moved the Resolution.  On another occasion I hope the Minister will try to treat the House, in these matters of finance, a little more respectfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that any woven tissue imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 23rd day of May, 1929, and chargeable with the duty imposed by Section 1 of the Finance (Customs and Stamp Duties) Act, 1929, was manufactured in and exported from Saorstát Eireann and has since such exportation undergone the process of shrinking and no other process of manufacture, Section 6 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act. 1879, shall apply to such woven tissue notwithstanding that it has undergone outside Saorstát Eireann such process of shrinking.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This Resolution is to enable cloth of Saorstát manufacture which has been shrunk abroad to be re-imported free of duty.  It has been found in the case of one or two mills that if this concession were not given their trade would be substantially affected. There is at least one mill which does a considerable trade with merchants in Great Britain.  These merchants buy whole webs of cloth, which they shrink, and part of which they sell again in the Saorstát, and the persons concerned with the mill in question have reason to fear that if those purchasers were deprived of a market in the Saorstát for part of the cloth they would go to some outside mill for their requirements.  It is not anticipated that this will do any harm to the one firm in the Saorstát which engages in shrinking.  At any rate, it will do away with the danger that firms that have a trade with Great Britain will lose that trade. The amount of cloth involved is comparatively small, and the whole thing is rather a small matter, but it might be serious for the couple of mills that are concerned.</P>

      <P>I think that it is a most undesirable practice to consider a recommendation of this kind and to propose this resolution without considering the one firm in the State that might be directly concerned with it.  It is possible that this resolution will do their business considerable harm, and although it is not our intention to oppose the resolution, we think that this firm should have been consulted and that the Tariff Commission is open to serious criticism because they did not notify them that this proposal was under consideration in order to get their opinion concerning it.</P>

      <P>That firm has, of course, the advantage of carriage both ways.  It is not anticipated that it will be affected so far as cloth that is purchased in bulk by a merchant here is concerned.  The resolution could really have an effect only where the cloth is purchased outside, and where some portion of it is returned.  The amount of cloth so far returned is very small, and there seems to be no ground at all for anticipating that that will increase with this resolution.</P>

      <P>The only notices so far as I know that were given were statement that I made.  I think in this House, but certainly in the Seanad.  This matter of shrinkage, the question of cloth of cheaper varieties required for the manufacture <Col N="38" /> of ready-made clothing, the question of cloths shrunk abroad, and the question of furniture cloths were specifically mentioned.  I stated in the Seanad that these matters were being referred to the Tariff Commission, and I know that representatives of the trades dealing with them had been consulting with the Department of Industry and Commerce before the question went to the Tariff Commission at all.</P>

      <P>It is most likely.  We received only to-day, as we came into the House, the report of last week's proceedings.  Certainly to suggest that any ordinary detailed statement of the Minister appears in full in the newspapers is absurd.  What I would call the attention of the House to is the obvious and palpable lack of knowledge on the part of the Minister for Finance of what actually did go on at the Tariff Commission.  He did not know whether the mill had been consulted or not until he asked. He did not know anything about it until he asked the representative here.  And the Minister is in possession of the report.  The rest of the House has none of that knowledge. The man who knows most about the matter is palpably and culpably ignorant of what went on before the Commission.  I thought that there was some statutory notice required, or that some machinery was set up in connection with the Tariff Commission, by which those who went before that Commission had regular means of getting to know what goes on.  The Minister apparently does not know.  He does not know whether any of these means were taken because he had to rely on casual conversation across the benches here <Col N="39" /> to find out.  Honestly, if the conduct in relation to these particular Resolutions, as exhibited by the Minister, is typical of the amount of care and attention which has been paid to financial business by the Minister, God help the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any woven tissue which is imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 23rd day of May, 1929, and but for this Resolution would be chargeable with the duty imposed by Section 1 of the Finance (Customs and Stamp Duties) Act, 1929, is intended solely for use in the upholstering of furniture or vehicles, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such woven tissue to be imported without payment of the said duty or repay any such duty paid on importation.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>In connection with this matter, the Tariff Commission states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As mentioned in paragraph 44 of our report on the original application, no representations were received by us during the course of our investigations into that application from users of wool-furnishing fabrics.  It was not until after the imposition of the duty and the publication of the report that the furniture manufacturers took any action, although the scope of the application and the proceedings at the Commission had been given full publicity in the Press and advertisements had been published inviting persons <Col N="40" /> whose interest were likely to be affected by the granting of the application to communicate with the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is that there is one mill in the Saorstát which has undertaken the manufacture of furnishing fabrics, but the Irish Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers' Association when consulted in regard to the proposed exemption of these fabrics from the scope of the duty replied: &ldquo;One firm in our Association is making some effort in that department but we fear that there is not much prospect of these cloths ever being supplied in the variety required.&rdquo; The position, therefore, is that in certain branches of the furnishing trade the benefit of the existing tariff on furniture would be largely reduced if furniture cloths were not exempted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister say whether he has taken into account the fact that there is another application at present before the Tariff Commission which may obviate a case for this so far as cloths required for coach building are concerned.  There is an application from coach builders before the Commission and they are expecting, as a result of that application, that their business will be vastly increased. I know that certain firms have been in communication with one woollen manufacturer with a view to the manufacture of materials suitable to their requirements.  At one hearing of this application to which I refer a coach builder exhibited a vehicle, and the body, which he had made, was covered with material manufactured in a local woollen mill.  It does not seem to me to be a pressing case and I would like to know whether the Coach Builders' Association have been consulted or whether the Minister has taken into account the matter to which I refer.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 9&mdash;Game Licences.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied, and paid on the occasions hereinafter mentioned on and by every person who, under any Act passed or to be passed during the financial year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1929, takes out or renews a licence for dealing in game an excise duty of three pounds in respect of every licence so taken out or renewed.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of any such licence as aforesaid shall be charged, levied, and paid at the time of taking out such licence and also on every renewal of such licence and shall be paid and collected by means of stamps denoting the amount of such duty impressed on such licences and renewals, and the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, shall apply to such duty and stamps.</P>
      <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This Resolution is necessary in this particular year because of Section 17 which has been inserted in the Game Preservation Bill.  It says: &ldquo;A Justice of the District Court upon an application being made to him by any person and upon payment by such person of the fee required by law may, subject to the provisions of this section, issue to such person a licence (in this Act referred to as a game dealer's licence) for the sale of game .....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There formerly was a law in existence requiring the payment of a licence duty by game dealers.  There was a licence duty payable by game dealers which was imposed by Section 2 of the Game Licence Act of <Col N="42" /> 1860 which fixed the rate of duty at £2 per annum.  When the Department of Justice was dealing with the Fire Arms Act in 1925, it was intended to introduce a measure dealing with the question of game preservation and game dealers' licences. That, however, was not dealt with at the time, and a new scale of duty for firearms was prescribed in the Finance Act of 1925, and the old provisions relating to gun licences and game licences were repealed, including the provisions of the Act of 1860. That was the only statutory authority for the issue of game dealers' licences.  Consequently, since the 1st August, 1925, there has been no necessity for a game dealer to take out a game dealer's licence.  It is proposed in the Game Preservation Bill, which is before the House, that it shall be again necessary, and provision is being made by this Resolution to charge a licence duty of £3 per annum.  A couple of years ago a section such as this was inserted in the Finance Act, but it has not come into operation, as the Game Bill requiring the taking out of a licence by game dealers was not passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this motion, I quoted Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution.  I pointed out that there had been a breach of Article 6 by the Minister for Justice, that he had illegally arrested people, and that that had been proved by trials in court.  The judge, in giving judgment, said that no proof had been adduced to show that these people had been lawfully arrested.  We may take it that if these officers had proof they would certainly have produced it, and if those arrests were capable of being proved lawful, proof would have been forthcoming.  It was not forthcoming, and the findings of the jury in two cases prove that that also was the layman's and the citizen's point of view&mdash;that those people were unlawfully arrested. Further than that, the Ministry saw itself that it was not able to sustain its attitude, because in a third case it entered a nolle prosequi.  If the Ministry of Justice had proof that these people were legally arrested, they were wrong in entering a nolle prosequi.  They cannot have it both ways.  They entered a nolle prosequi because they saw they had done something unlawful, had been found out and could not continue that line of conduct.  The Minister for Justice constantly asks us to take legal action in these matters to get a decision in the courts.  Here you have just exactly what the Minister was asking for, in more senses than one.  He has got a decision of the courts, and it is now for the House to decide whether they are going to allow this breach of the Constitution to pass with impunity. It has an opportunity on this Vote of registering its total disapproval of the unconstitutional action of the Government.  They are the unconstitutional people.  They are the people, because they desert their Constitution, who are the causes mainly of the disturbances in the country.  Their own officials have said as much, as has already been pointed out by Deputy Lemass in quoting the words of some C.I.D. <Col N="44" /> men, that they were going to drive some of these people they arrested into taking violent action.</P>
      <P>With regard to Article 7, which purports to protect the homes and the premises of citizens, when I asked the Minister whether raids had been made on premises without warrants his answer was in the negative. I have personal evidence to the contrary. I happened to go into 27 Dawson Street myself on business, and a number of C.I.D. men came into the premises.  They went upstairs into a particular room, and I got curious and followed them.  I asked them what they were doing there, and they said they were conducting a raid.  I asked them to show their warrant, and they had no warrant to show.  I asked who was in charge and I was given the name.  I took down the name and the status from the card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I was there.  I often go into those premises on business.  I happened to see them going in and I asked, as I was entitled to ask, the name of the officer in command.  The name of the officer was Michael David and his number was 12548.  He said he was in command.  When they were not able to produce warrants, they said they were acting under instructions and they would go back and seek further instructions, which they did, on the 'phone. They then came back and said that as they were not able to find the person they were looking for, they were to withdraw.  That was on the 23rd March.  There had been raids on these premises on the previous Thursday and Friday when everybody was arrested.  There were raids <Col N="45" /> on Monday, 25th March, when, I am informed, there was no warrant produced. There was a raid on the 3rd April and no warrant was produced. There was a raid on the 4th April, and there was a warrant produced. On Saturday, 6th April, one stray C.I.D. man wandered into the office and was greatly disconcerted to find that there was no raid on.  Something went wrong.  On Monday, 8th April, there was a raid which lasted from 11.30 to 2 o'clock. On the 12th there was another raid. On that occasion the officers were Messrs. Kirwan and Pluck&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should not have mentioned them in this case. But they refused to produce cards on application.  They had no warrant, and said there was no one in charge. On the 18th there was a raid with a warrant, and I believe there have been raids since.  Now the answer which the Minister gave to the House shows the total unreliability of his own information.  I need not stress the aspect of it that this action was totally unconstitutional&mdash;just as much as the other action was.  These raids were sometimes carried out under circumstances of brutality, as for instance, when Miss Albinia Brodrick, who is not a young woman, was treated very brutally in the open street.  A shop girl who happened to be looking on had to go into a shop as she got sick.  I suppose that these people rely upon the conscientious objection of certain individuals to take action in the courts.  They think they can wreak their vengeance and their brutality on certain individuals because these <Col N="46" /> individuals have an objection, even in their own defence, to make use of the courts.  That has been the action of the Department of Justice during those two months.  Fortunately, it seems to have slackened down its pace more recently, but during that period we have had arrests, without charge, of persons up to the number of 150.  Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am under-stating it.  Then there was detention without food.  No food was supplied to those prisoners in the Bridewell, although, according to the regulations, every prisoner is entitled to two meals per day.  There was detention without exercise, and, of course, there were illegal detentions. Some persons were arrested eight or nine times.  Patrick Kirk was arrested nine times.  Geoffrey Coulter was arrested seven times. Proinnsias O Riain was arrested thirteen or fourteen times.  Peter McAndrew was arrested six times. John J. Tallon was arrested four times.  J. Sugrue was arrested five times.  Thomas Carey was arrested six times.  Charles Carey was arrested seven or eight times.  Charles O'Neill was arrested four times, and many others were arrested several times.  It is unnecessary for me.  I think, to go further.  If the Minister wished he could give us full details of the conduct of his Department. At least he says he could, but so thoroughly unconstitutional is he and his Department that he will not even report here to the House which is supposed to control him and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These raids, without warrants, occurred, amongst others, in the houses of Mrs. O'Neill, 31 Merchants' Quay; Mrs. P. O'Donnell, 39 Marlboro' Road, Donnybrook; Mrs. Despard, Roebuck House, Clonskeagh; Mrs. O'Carroll, Rathfarnham; Mrs. Coyle, 58 Aughrim Street; Mrs. Sweeney, Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, and also in the public offices of Comhairle na Phoblachta.  In some of those cases methods of what is known as third degree interrogation were indulged in, although none of those persons have been charged with any crime.  Some of them were <Col N="47" /> treated in a manner which can only be described as third degree, such as Sean Purcell and Christopher Murphy, Fianna Eireann, Cork; James Markey, Dublin, and Maurice Walsh.  Purcell and Murphy briefly state the facts as follows:&mdash; Together with Sean O'Leary, Kevin Bullen and Sean Breathnach, Scouts Purcell and Murphy were arrested in Prince's Street, Cork, about seven p.m. on the 3rd of April.  They were brought to Union Quay barracks.  In the barracks no charge was preferred against them.  Bullen refused to sit down.  He was pushed into a seat by a C.I.D. man who was urged by another C.I.D. man, whose name I can also give to the Minister, to knock him down.  Breathnach also refused to sit down, whereupon he was struck twice on the head by another C.I.D. man, whose name I can also give to the Minister.  The prisoners were then put into separate cells, from which they were subsequently brought singly, to be interrogated and searched.  Amongst the C.I.D. present at the search were &mdash;here I have a list of names which I can supply to the Minister any time he wishes to hold a proper inquiry into the matter.  Murphy, who is a mere youth, was asked how long he had been in the Fianna.  On refusing to answer he was struck by a C.I.D. man and told &ldquo;he would be drowned that night.&rdquo;  A badge of the Confraternity of Angels, a religious confraternity, was taken from his coat and kicked around the floor.  Another C.I.D. man took the boy into a room, away from the other C.I.D. men, and told him that he would force him to divulge information about the Fianna and threatened to put him into a dark dungeon.  They then tried to entice Murphy by promising him a comfortable position if he gave information. Purcell was told by the C.I.D. man that he would have him branded so that he would be known again.  Another C.I.D. man, whose name I have, threatened to shoot him, and assured him that those who would do the murder would not be known.  After five hours' detention <Col N="48" /> the boys were released.  The following statement was made by James Markey, 25 Upper Wellington Street, Dublin:&mdash;</P>

      <P>This James Markey, of Upper Wellington Street, was interrogated by detective officers.  He refused to give information, and then he was asked to give a written undertaking that he would not take part in a conspiracy.  He did not believe he was taking part in a conspiracy, and he refused to sign. Maurice Walsh was another who was treated in a like manner.  He was also asked to give an undertaking, and he refused to do so.  The method adopted in these cases was to keep the persons for a long period in <Col N="49" /> solitary confinement, and then suddenly confront them with the statement that they were taking part in a conspiracy, and attempts were made to get from them information which they refused to give.  Then there were cases of assaults by the C.I.D. Some of these were mentioned already.  I have the names of seven: John Hassett and Michael Cahill, whose affidavits have been read already: T.J. Ryan, Cranny; Patrick Burke, Carhue, Cooraclare; Patrick Cahill, Carhue, Cooraclare; Martin Whyte, Cahermane, Lisdoonvarna; &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo; Breen, Deryshane, Coolmeen. Mr. Ryan, who is a veteran of the Tan War, was subjected to persistent persecution.  I do not wish to detain the House any longer than I can help, but he made an affidavit, a portion of which I will read.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>About 10 p.m. on the 2nd March, C.I.D. man&mdash;&mdash; (I can give the Minister the name), followed by four others, entered the house of Patrick Burke, Carhue, Cooraclare.  Burke was in bed. Mrs. Burke and Pat Cahill were sitting by the fire.  The C.I.D. man questioned and searched Cahill, striking him a violent blow in the stomach with his clenched fist.  Two C.I.D. men then rushed into the room, where Burke was in the act of rising from his bed.  (Burke is nearly 70 years of age).  He asked them: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; One of the C.I.D. men threw him back on the bed and held him while another C.I.D. man struck him repeatedly with his clenched fist. Both the C.I.D. men beat him about the head and shoulders, his head and lips being cut and bleeding. His daughter tried to intervene, and one of the C.I.D. men struck her several times on the head.  Burke, clad only in his shirt, was dragged, kicked and beaten downstairs and out through the yard to the public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the C.I.D. men said on that occasion: &ldquo;I admit we are worse than the Black and Tans, but we <Col N="50" /> must do something to earn our pound a day.&rdquo; Another C.I.D. man said: &ldquo;Send this to &lsquo;An Phoblacht&rsquo; now.&rdquo;  The victim of this particular raid, Patrick Burke, is nearly 70 years of age, and is the father of Commandant Burke who fell in the war against the Tans.  Similar brutal treatment was meted out to Martin Whyte.  In the presence of a witness (Mr. Mack) a certain C.I.D. man struck him several times on the head. kicked him, and dragged him down the road into a field.  The C.I.D. men kept him for half an hour in a quarry, where they questioned him and beat and kicked him.  He was a week in bed under the care of Dr. Pearson.  I can supply the names of the C.I.D. men concerned in this. A man named &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo; Breen was treated in a similar manner by C.I.D. men.  They seized a poster announcing a commemoration to be held at the grave of Padraig Hassett who was killed in the Tan war, and they asked Breen where he got it.  Refusing to answer, they dragged him out of the house, asking him: &ldquo;Are you one of the men that is ready to die for Ireland?&rdquo; A scarf was twisted tightly round his neck, half hanging him, and he was dragged about by the hair and by one ear.  Blood streamed from his ear.  He was then kicked into the house.</P>
    <P>Then there were cases of kidnapping and torturing.  Patrick Fox, of Summerhill, Dublin, was kidnapped near the Bridewell gate by masked men on the night of March 21st.  He was taken out of the city, and in a lonely field was beaten and threatened with death because he would not divulge information about the Republican organisation.  Charles Carey, of Northbrook Avenue, Dublin, was similarly kidnapped and tortured on the night of March 22nd. These details were sent to the public Press, but the public Press would not publish them, and would not even publish the resolution passed by the Dublin Trades Council protesting against action of this sort.  I do not know whether the Minister would take notice of democratic bodies like that, but he might at least take the view of such protests that they do <Col N="51" /> not come from any party interested directly or politically in the matter. Of course, the Minister has already stated his attitude towards juries in Ireland.  On a famous occasion he said: &ldquo;I personally pay no attention to the verdict of a jury.&rdquo;</P>

The fact of the matter is that so far as the sufferings of these victims are concerned, they remind one of a French saying, that the suffering of other people is only a dream.  So far as the Minister is concerned, the suffering that these people go through is a mere dream to him.  In fact, a considerable amount of what goes on in that Department appears to be a dream.</P>

Those who defend the policy of the Department of Justice do so in the name of law, order, and majority rule.  By what majority of the Irish people was it decided that the Union Jack was to be flaunted to such an extent that it exasperated certain sections?  By what dictate of prudence or of law and order was this emblem, which is fresh in the minds of the people as having been steeped in the blood of men like Pearse, Connolly and Casement, allowed to wave in the country?

      <P>The point I was making is that for a considerable time after any war there is a very exasperated feeling induced, and if the flag of a hostile country is allowed by the police forces to be flaunted in any country, then it is the police who are responsible for the consequences that follow.  When the Union Jack is allowed to be flaunted in this country and when Baden-Powell's scouts &mdash;Empire Scouts&mdash;are allowed to go about, as they are, vaunting the &ldquo;come back&rdquo; of British influence in this country, I say that the things that follow, follow inevitably, and it is the Minister for Justice and his Department who are to blame for being lacking in the prudence which would put a stop to the thing at its source and not allow it to get to such a stage that the evil becomes really a great evil.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence combines us all together&mdash;all who profess Republican views are classed together as a set of criminals and murderers. There is no admitting that at all as being the valid attitude of mind of those people who hold that the sovereign nationality, the sovereign right of Ireland is indefeasible and imprescriptable.

      <P>The episode of the Union Jack, which has had a great deal to do with certain things that <Col N="57" /> happened in this country, was not discussed.  All I wish to say is that while persons who stand for that attitude of mind to the Union Jack should be given as much protection in this country as German nationals would be given by French statesmen, at the same time, for the sake of those foreign nationals in this country, a line of conduct exasperating to the natives is a very unwise line to take.  The very people who represent those foreign nationals should be the first to prevent further acts of exasperation resulting from the conduct of people like the C.I.D.  We have a motion to refer this Vote back for reconsideration. When that motion has been dealt with, I take it that the Estimate does not become automatically passed, but that we will be able to deal with statements made by the Minister on the main Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters that I would like to clear up on this Vote.  Personally, I have found that the members of the Civic Guard act fairly and in an impartial manner.  For instance, at the last election they gave me, personally, all fair play.  In only one case in the county did they show partiality. I put a question to the Minister at one time with reference to certain members of the force who, I held, should not be in authority in this country, and the reply was not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish now to make a statement with reference to certain other members of the force who, I understand, are still members of the Detective Division, and whose presence there, I hold, is a danger to the public peace of this country.  I have a statement here.  I know the Minister disapproves of my reading statements.  He holds that I use these statements for making unfair attacks on the Civic Guards.  I do not want to make unfair attacks upon anybody, but I think it only right that the people of this country should get protection against certain people who are supposed to be paid for protecting them, and who, instead of protecting them, treat <Col N="58" /> them violently and unfairly, to put the matter mildly.  This statement is rather interesting, and the person who made the statement I am about to read is prepared to substantiate it.  Perhaps it will make the matter clear if I read some extracts from the statement.  A certain barracks was attacked in Co. Waterford, and the evening afterwards this conversation was overheard in a neighbouring barrack.  I am not going to give the names.  I can give them to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise it is that these men are still in the public service and no effort has been made to get rid of them.  What happened on that occasion may happen in the near future.  I think it is only right that public exposure should be given to this now, and that every effort should be made to get rid of persons of the type to which I refer I shall read the extracts.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I remember the night the Civic Guard Barrack in Knockanore was raided.  I heard Guards &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; discussing it the following morning.  I asked them was Knockanore raided last night and Guard &lsquo;A&rsquo; said it was, but it was raided by the detectives themselves. I asked him was he joking and he said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; that Detectives A, B and C went out and raided it last night and they are gone out now to investigate it and arrest more.  They only arrested two men and released them immediately afterwards but gave one of them an awful beating because he would not promise them he would lift his hat to the Guards when he would meet them in future.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A shot was fired through the window <Col N="59" /> of this barrack and in the room at the time was the sergeant's wife. Men were arrested and severely beaten for this supposed barrack-attack by the very men who attacked the barracks, and these men are, I understand, in the detective division still.  The letter goes on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;The sergeant at Knockanore reported the raid the following morning. He said he would know the men by their accent, a distinct West Cork one.  When he left, the detectives were joking about the matter and said the sergeant would make a very bad detective.&rdquo;  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I also remember seeing Superintendent &lsquo;A&rsquo; at the barracks a few days previous to the inquiry, 22nd November.  I heard himself and Guard &lsquo;A&rsquo; discussing about the inquiry and they seemed to be very upset over it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This may be interesting to the Minister for Justice:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They seemed to be very upset over it, and I heard Superintendent &lsquo;A&rsquo; swear that the Minister for Justice would never have an inquiry into his doings again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The person said to the guard did he mean that.  The man himself answered and said: &ldquo;Yes, I mean it all right.&rdquo;  Now, men who can do this sort of thing should not be in the position to inflict serious damage on their fellow citizens.  At the time this thing happened, a number of men were very savagely beaten.  One case in Waterford County was brought into the civil courts and damages were awarded against the C.I.D. men concerned, but this case never came into the courts, and the men in this case were just as savagely beaten as in the other case. At one time it was thought that the matter could have been brought into the courts, but the men who were beaten had no money to bring it forward, and when they saw the result of the other case that the damages imposed on the C.I.D. men could not be recovered they asked: &ldquo;What is the use of our going to law?&rdquo; The position is, in one case, very painful. <Col N="60" /> A child was born shortly afterwards, and as a result of the savage beating of the man that child is a cripple for life.  The very men who talked in this way in the barracks are the very men who act so savagely.  Surely if the people are to have confidence in the administration of justice in this country men of that type should not be in the police force, and it is only fair that every effort should be made to have men of steadiness, ordinary decency and common sense in such positions.  There are men in the detective division at present who would be a disgrace to any organisation, men who are potential criminals. Until such men are driven out of the force it is very hard to expect people to have any great confidence in them.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I wish to bear testimony to a considerable number of the Guards, and I know very many of them acted considerately and are thoroughly ashamed of this sort of work.  It is not fair to such men that blackguards of that type should be allowed to remain. Are we to take it that the Minister for Justice condones this sort of thing and that men of this sort are to be allowed to travel over the country terrifying citizens?  At present many of those men are stationed in towns in Ireland.  They apparently have nothing to do all day but drink.  They stand at street corners and if they see a man, whom they know to have Republican views, come along they immediately blackguard him.  They realise that they have guns in their pockets and that they can attack him with safety.  It is a common practice for them to tap the guns in their pockets when they abuse him, and they say that he must not talk back. Of course, it is unfair to the other men in the force and it is certainly unfair to the citizens of the country. The men who hold Republican views in this country are entitled to hold them, and if, because they hold Republican views, they cannot come in to their towns and transact their business without being insulted as they are, we are a long way from getting justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words mainly arising out of matters touched on during the course of the debate.  At the outset I would like to say that it does not necessarily follow, as was indicated by one speaker on the Government Benches, that anyone who criticises the Vote of the Department of Justice or its policy for the time being is in sympathy with either crime or criminals.  It is our duty in this House to make criticisms, as we think necessary from time to time, in regard to this or any other Department.  One criticism that I think might be offered and which has not been touched on yet is regarding the failure on the part of the police authorities to trace the people who are responsible for certain grave crimes that were committed in this country within the last two years.  I would like to have from the Minister.  When he is replying, some explanation regarding that failure, or I would like to know whether he has still any hope that those responsible for the murder of the late Minister for Justice and the commission of the two great crimes in Dublin during the last year are likely to be apprehended and brought to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is due to the House, too, that the Minister should give a full and adequate explanation of the policy which he was following in in regard to these arrests about which we have heard so much during the last two or three months.  What was the object to be attained?  The Minister must admit that his policy was a very grave departure from the usual practice.  We know that the best police force in the world are liable to err and very often err grievously, and the practice of arresting people, detaining them for a certain time and not bringing them to trial undoubtedly leaves itself open to very grave abuse.  The Minister, I think, should tell us quite clearly and candidly what object he had in mind and what object he hoped to achieve by adopting the policy of frequent arrests of several people without bringing any charge against them and what steps his Department <Col N="62" /> took to see that there was no abuse. Does he propose to continue that policy, and if it is not proposed to continue it or if it has been dropped what object has it achieved?  I think it is due to this House that the Minister should give us some more satisfactory explanation than has yet been offered with regard to these arrests and raids during the past two or three months.  In the course of the debate it has transpired very clearly that any criticism that was offered of the police force was confined to one particular section of the police forces.  That is the view on all sides of the House.  I think it would be well if the Minister would give us some information as to the organisation of the C.I.D.  I must confess that I know very little about this force.  I understand, quite clearly, the basis on which the ordinary Gárda Síochána are organised and the lines on which they operate.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I know precious little about the organisation of the C.I.D.  To whom are they responsible, for instance?  If members of this force are operating in rural areas, to what particular officer are they responsible?  Are they responsible to the sergeant of the district, or to the superintendent of the district, or to their own particular officers?  There is a feeling, rightly or wrongly, that they are a body in themselves, with responsibility only to their own officers, that there is in charge of them one officer who is not responsible to anyone except the Department of Justice.  I think it is the duty of the Minister to say whether or not that is the case, and, if it is not the case, to tell us exactly what the position is, or how the C.I.D. are organised.</P>
    <P>There is another belief pretty common that I would like to mention here.  It has been put to me on various occasions that there is one particular section of the detective force for dealing with what is known as ordinary crime and that there is a separate section whose duty it is to deal only with what is called political crime.  If there is any such distinction I think it is wrong.  If there is not, then the Minister will tell us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Another point that arose during the debate that I should like some information on is the question of expenses for the defence of officers of the police force when legal actions are taken against them.  Is it a fact that if a civilian takes an action against a member of the police force that the legal expenses for the defence of the police officer are borne by the State?  If that is so, does it apply to other servants of the State? If an action is taken against a postal official, is he defended by the State or are the resources of the State's legal department placed at his disposal? Does it apply to any other officer of the State, and if it does not, what exactly is the principle behind it in the case of the members of the police force?  Perhaps the Minister would explain that to us too.</P>
    <P>Much mention has been made here of the action of members of the detective force in regard to men who are their political opponents.  I think there is a great deal to be said for the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Lemass, to the effect that there should not be found now in the C.I.D., men who were active participants in certain troubles during the civil war.  I think it would be well that men should be in that position, for one reason only, that they are good and efficient officers. I think it should be recognised that we had troubles here during the civil war and that placing men who were active participants on one side in positions in which they are bound to come up against men who were their opponents on the other side, is not a policy which will lead to peace or to that confidence in our police force that people of all shades of politics ought to have.  I would very seriously suggest to the Minister the advisability of looking into this question, to see if something could not be done whereby men who were active in the civil war period would not be in positions where they would have to deal with men who were their political or active opponents at that time.  We had to recognise that after the Free State was established <Col N="64" /> here, when we had to remove from office&mdash;and many held it was wise&mdash; officers who were active on the British side.  That was done as a matter of policy.  It was quite possible that they would have made good officials if they continued in their various departments, but it was considered politic that they should not be allowed to continue.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter which ought to be investigated, to see if it would not be better, in the public interests, that the men who are occupying these particular posts would be men who, in fact, had nothing to do with the incidents which occurred during the troublous period of seven or eight years ago, but men who were selected for those positions because of their police records.</P>
    <P>Passing on from the question of the police to another and less contentious matter in this particular Vote, there are one or two things I want to say on the question of the film censor's department.  As far as I remember, this particular office was intended to be self-supporting.  I find, as far as I can gather from the Estimates, that the receipts from the office are something like £2,450, while the expenditure is only £1,400 or £1,700.  The film censor occupies a very important and onerous position. While the salary may appear to be a substantial one it does not seem to me to be in keeping with the position which the film censor holds. There is no bonus attaching to it, and there is no provision made for superannuation.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.  There is only one shorthand typist in the censor's office, the only other people, as far as I can gather, being the operator and the wind boy, whatever his duties are. The shorthand typist, who has to act as secretary to the Appeal Board, has, to my mind, a very poor salary, something just over £2 10s. a week.  I suggest, in view of the fact that the income from the censorship department exceeds considerably the amount that is expended on it, that the position of the staff ought to be <Col N="65" /> looked into.  I think we should recognise that the film censor has a position which, if it were not filled by a man of the type that holds it at the present time might be open to grave abuses.  That should be taken into consideration when the salary and emoluments and the general position of the office are considered. I would like the Minister to say a word on this when replying on the general question of the Vote.</P>

      <P>It is with a great deal of reluctance that I made up my mind to take any part in this debate at all.  Discussions of this kind have become almost a recurrent vice with the Dáil.  At regular intervals we have debated matters of politics and matters of police and mixed them together in the most inextricable fashion in which all sorts of ancient charges are furbished up again and thrown across the House.  As far as I can see, there is only one slight sign of improvement in all this, and that is that whereas such debates used take place a few years ago on the Army Estimates, debates of the very same type and semi-political discussion have been transferred now to the Police Estimates.  I suppose that may be taken as a sign of the fact that the situation is, at any rate, easing somewhat, and that if we are not by any means in an ideal position we are at least better off than we were a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for intervening in the debate at all and allowing myself to be subjected for a few minutes to this vice is, that certain things were said in the course of the debate which I do not think should be allowed to pass unnoticed by those of us who sit on this side of the House.  I said that this type of debate was a kind of disease.  The discussion that has taken place shows pretty clearly that it is not so much in itself a disease, as a symptom of a disease, and a very serious disease.  Everybody is as anxious as possible that we should have the most perfect police force, and that while every rigour should be shown to criminals, there should <Col N="66" /> be no interference whatsoever with the ordinary citizens by the police or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Charges have been made in great number during the last week to the effect that such interference is taking place, that the ordinary citizens are being interfered with by the police, and that where such interferences are alleged to have taken place, the fault lies altogether on the side of the police.  Deputy Lemass told us last week that his Party was the only Party which stood for peace in this country.  Every other Party apparently, including not only ourselves but the Labour Party, were opponents of peace and the most subtle and dangerous opponents. The arguments which Deputy Lemass uses, not so much to prove as perhaps to insinuate that statement, is a rather curious sort of argument.  He indulges in a kind of metaphysics which may be all very well for the public platform but surely should hardly pass in this House without some slightly deeper discussion.  He suggests that because the Fianna Fáil Party at a certain stage changed its name from whatever name it called itself before that stage arrived and took certain rather superficial action, therefore it has become, all of a sudden, a Party of perfect peace.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Lemass that, granting that a change has taken place, everything depends on whether the change was a change in essence or a change merely in accidentals; and I suggest that a change of name is of no importance whatsoever unless it involves a change in policy and a change in the inner workings of the Party's mind, so to speak.  The Fianna Fáil Party have now externally and as far as accidentals are concerned, abandoned their previous warlike attitude. They have taken to themselves a new name, or rather an old name, and they have strung together a series of election devices and put these before the people as a policy. They are always prepared to talk at great length about their policy, what their policy is, and so on.  There is one fundamental element in a policy <Col N="67" /> which should be the first thing to be considered in the policy of any Party.  On that I suggest that out of Deputy Lemass's own mouth the Fianna Fáil Party have not suffered any change whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins last week recalled to Deputy Lemass a statement that he had made in a speech previously. Deputy Lemass at that time got up and corrected Deputy O'Higgins. When he made that correction, or purported to make that correction, the Official Report of the debates was not available.  The Official Report has since been circulated, and I find that Deputy Lemass not only made the statement on which he was challenged by Deputy O'Higgins, but he actually made a statement which is more serious, if anything, than that with which Deputy O'Higgins charged him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass laid down certain conditions.  He said: &ldquo;If we could get some definite assurance from the Ministery,&rdquo; and he then laid down a series of conditions upon which he said he thought he &ldquo;could promise on behalf of the people whom we represent the fullest possible co-operation except in connection with these laws which were passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.&rdquo;  He first of all made conditions.  Having made these conditions he proceeded to make exceptions for the carrying out of these conditions.  He went on to explain that &ldquo;in relation to the ordinary criminal law which we all want to see obeyed you can get that co-operation if you ask for it.&rdquo;  When he said &ldquo;if you ask for it&rdquo; he obviously meant &ldquo;if you agree to the conditions that we lay down.&rdquo;  He said you can get our co-operation in seeing that the ordinary criminal law is obeyed on certain conditions, but we make an exception and that &ldquo;exception is in connection with these laws that were passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass denied or tried to evade these words when challenged by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> These words are now in print and Deputy Lemass must answer for them.  What do these words mean? These words mean, if they mean anything, that the Fianna Fáil Party first wish to make conditions before they will give any co-operation to the State in seeing that the ordinary criminal law is obeyed.  That means that the Fianna Fáil Party before they give any co-operation in seeing that ordinary criminals such as burglars or people guilty of criminal assaults, and other crimes, apart altogether from any political consideration, are punished, must get conditions. That is the first element in the Deputy's speech.  That means that the Fianna Fáil Party do not agree, in their capacity as legislators, to assist in the carrying out of any law whatsoever which this Dáil makes at the present momenf.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is a very serious statement, and when a Deputy makes a statement like that on behalf of a Party which he claims speaks for half a million voters, he is giving out of his own mouth the best possible indication of the real source of the disease from which this country is suffering.  If there is anything wrong, if the police are exceeding their duties, if attacks do take place on individuals, as the Fianna Fáil Party allege, then I suggest that the one great contributing cause to that evil &mdash;I suggest the greatest contributing cause to that evil&mdash;is the fact that, in Deputy Lemass's own words, they must see certain conditions carried out before they will agree to co-operate in the enforcement of the ordinary criminal law.</P>
    <P>He goes further than that and he says that even if these conditions are granted there is an exception that he must make, and that is the exception in connection with these laws that were passed for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.  It is not clear what exactly Deputy Lemass means by that exception, but I think it is not unfair to say that he wished to except and exclude altogether from the operation of any laws those who choose to object to laws which were passed for <Col N="69" /> the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.  It is not unfair to attribute such a meaning to Deputy Lemass, because that is the meaning that Deputy Lemass's leader has several times given expression to.  Over and over again in this House we have been brought back to the fundamental position that there are numbers of people who wish to use arms against these laws that were passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing, and who wish to overturn that political status by force of arms. We have pointed out that if there are people here who want to change the political status of the country, there is an obvious and easy method for them to adopt in bringing about that change.</P>
    <P>There is one method, and that is that they can vote for the Party which has as its policy the changing of that status.  If the votes are sufficiently numerous they can put that Party into power as a Government and so change the status that they desire to change without the loss of a single drop of Irish blood. But the position, apparently, is that whether or not they are willing to use their votes in that fashion, and whether or not they are willing to support the Party for which Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera speak, they insist on having the right at any moment they choose to take the lives of other Irishmen in order to upset the political status now existing.  It is a serious matter to have a political party proclaiming that it will not co-operate in putting down ordinary crimes such as burglary until certain political conditions are granted.  It is the great evil from which the country suffers, and no kind of quibbling and no amount of producing anonymous documents and statements, such as Fianna Fáil Deputies have been producing here&mdash;no amount of wild complaints&mdash;will get over the fact that the real reason for whatever unsettlement and whatever difficulties exist in the country is that there are certain people for whom the Fianna Fáil Party speak here who insist on <Col N="70" /> having for themselves, and by their own authority, the right to take the lives of Irishmen and Irishwomen in order to upset the political status now existing in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said he was inclined to agree with Deputy Lemass on one point.  Deputy Lemass suggested that it would be advisable that the detective force should not include within its numbers men who had taken part in the civil war.  He said it would be advisable, just as happened in 1922, when this State was set up, that people who had to do with the civil war should be removed from any position where they might come into conflict with people whom they had to fight.  I wish to point out to Deputy O'Connell that before any such state of affairs can come into existence he must get Deputy Lemass and his Party to change their minds on this fundamental point.  He must get them to remove their objections to these laws which have been passed for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.  He must, at least, get them to admit that these laws can be changed by the exercise of the vote, and shall not be changed by any other means, and that all Irishmen of every party will stand together to see that only one method of changing the laws is allowed to be in force in this country.  Until Deputy O'Connell does that, I suggest to him that he is blinding himself in purporting to agree with what Deputy Lemass said.</P>
    <P>He draws a parallel between the state of affairs after the civil war and the state of affairs after the Treaty was passed.  I would like to point out to him that there is absolutely no parallel.  In 1921 a Treaty was made between conflicting States.  That Treaty was passed by a majority of this House, ratified by two Parliaments, and it became the law of the land.  In 1923 nothing of the kind happened; there was no Treaty; there was no conclusive, formal ending of whatever state of war existed; there was no reason, therefore, why the State should cease to be on the defensive after 1923 any more than there was before <Col N="71" /> 1923.  The only change that took place was that the Party which afterwards chose to change its name and to call itself Fianna Fáil decided to put away the guns and the bombs which it had previously been using against the majority of the people in this country.</P>
    <P>When this discussion is going on it is apposite to ask: &ldquo;Are these bombs and guns still in the keeping of the Fianna Fáil Party, and if they are not, where are they?&rdquo; I suggest to Deputy O'Connell that until he knows where these bombs and guns are, and until the people of this country or the authorities in this country, whoever they may be, know where they are and who is in control of them, no sensible citizen, much less a responsible member of this House, should suggest that the men who so ably defended this country in 1923 and previous to 1923 should be removed from the task of defending this country now against the same enemies who attacked it in 1923.  No sensible man can deny that that is the position of affairs.  We know that there are enemies in this country.  We know that not a month passes without some so-called political crime being committed in an attempt to do away with these laws that were passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Connell or if Deputy Lemass desires that the men who defended the country in 1923 and previous to that should be removed from the task now, I would like to know if they would agree to having the same conditions apply to the other side.  Would they ask that the men who were attacking this State in 1923 should cease from the task of attacking it now, and would they ask that the whereabouts of the weapons which were used to attack it in 1923 should be made known to the people who are liable to be attacked now, just as much as they were liable to be attacked in 1923? I suppose we will go on with this kind of debate year after year, and have the same series of confused <Col N="72" /> charges collected, or purporting to be collected, from all over the country.  We will have the same series of electioneering propaganda tossed out in the Dáil, as if it were gospel truth, and at the back of it all we will have people now and again, like Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera, admitting quite openly and quite candidly that not only do they not stand for cooperating in putting down ordinary crime, such as burglary, but that they do not even stand for the protection of any citizen whatever against anybody, whoever he may be, who likes to come along and say that he will take the life of that citizen, in order to upset laws passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.  We will have that state of affairs going on, I suppose, for years.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Lemass, to Deputy de Valera, and to their Party, that there is no use at all in coming here and masquerading as a Party of peace, no use at all in using all that fine language, painting themselves white and everybody else black, telling the people that they, and they alone, are the bringers of peace and goodwill, so long as they continue either to make speeches containing statements such as these, or in their heart of hearts to uphold and to approve of policies such as are contained in these statements. These statements, I say, betray the root of the evil from which this country is suffering, and I say that every citizen, no matter who he is, should realise that the country will continue to suffer from these evils, that men will continue to be killed, that outrages will continue to take place, and that these debates and charges will go on as long as Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera continue in the same frame of mind fundamentally as in 1922 and 1923.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on the motion, which is entirely too mild for the Department concerned.  This is a motion to refer this Vote back for reconsideration, and it gives the opportunity to the Minister to state definitely <Col N="73" /> whether he intends to change the policy of his Department.  I will be anxious to know whether he intends to make a definite change in the policy, and to get rid of those gentlemen who are bringing that Department into the contempt of every decent-minded man.  I would like to know whether he intends to state definitely that he will accept the motion and reconsider the policy of the Department, which I consider has been very fairly criticised.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>To commence with, I will deal with a few points which Deputy O'Connell raised, because they stand apart from anything else which has been discussed upon this Vote.  Deputy O'Connell asked about the payment of the film censor who, he stated, was underpaid, and he said that the receipts were more than sufficient to balance the outgoings of the censorship. The Deputy is not accurate in that.  For all practical purposes, the receipts and the expenditure balance. I think the Deputy has been misled, because certain outgoings, as I said in my opening statement, amounting to £530 in one place, and £10 and £20 in other places, appear elsewhere in the Estimates.  Deputy O'Connell also wished to have an explanation as to the organisation of the Gárda force, and especially of the organisation that he called the C.I.D., and what other Deputies also called the C.I.D.  There is no body in Ireland known as the C.I.D.  There is no institution of that name.  There is one force of Guards, and one force only, and these are under the same head.  There are Guards who do detective duty.  There are Guards who wear uniform constantly, and are not so much concerned about detective duty.  But they are all exactly the same force.  The Deputy asked to whom the detective officers make their reports, and to whom they are responsible.  They are responsible to their officers; they are responsible to the superintendents of the Civic Guards, and, finally, they <Col N="74" /> are responsible to the head of the Civic Guards, the extremely able, energetic and capable Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I pass now to the various attacks which have been made in the course of this debate by certain Deputies. Deputy Ruttledge opened the discussion, but as there was extremely little in anything he said that was not said afterwards at far greater length by Deputy Lemass, who has the art of expansion, I will, for the moment, pass on from Deputy Ruttledge. I will pass on also from dealing with that little comic&mdash;semi-comic, at any rate&mdash;interlude we had where Deputy Flinn poured out mock heroics to the House.  Poor Deputy Flinn! Somebody seems to have told that unfortunate Deputy&mdash;so it is said at any rate&mdash;that he was the greatest Irish orator since O'Connell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was stated on a Fianna Fáil placard in Galway: &ldquo;Come and hear the greatest orator since O'Connell talk upon the land annuities,&rdquo; and from that time this unfortunate Deputy seemingly has been trying to live up to that reputation, has been trying to prove himself the greatest Irish orator since O'Connell.  What is the result?  You heard all the mouthings and rantings, and you saw the gesticulations of the third-rate tragedian when this debate opened. In fact the poor Deputy reminded me very much of the frog in Esop's fable.  The frog tried to blow himself out so that he would appear to be the size of a bull and poor Deputy Flinn was blowing and blowing and blowing himself out to try to appear as a great orator.  The frog burst. I do not know what will be the fate of Deputy Flinn, if he carries on this class of oratory.  It was amusing, but rather melancholy, to see the poor Deputy trying so hard, and with such very poor results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke a little later and was very jubilant, very happy. Deputy Lemass crowed with all the <Col N="75" /> vigour one would expect from an energetic young bantam cock in the glory of the morning.  He had got me, he declared, on the horns of a great dilemma.  Fancy anybody being pinned on the horns of a dilemma by a logician like Deputy Lemass! This was the great dilemma: He said that certain persons like Ryan and Hassett were making statements and putting them upon affidavits, that they were bringing charges against the Guards and making the Fianna Fáil Party their mouthpieces in the Dáil for this purpose.  He asked: &ldquo;Will you hold public inquiries?  If you do not you you are on the horns of a dilemma. Hold your public inquiries or prosecute for perjury.&rdquo;  That is his dilemma&mdash;&ldquo;hold your public inquiries or prosecute for perjury.&rdquo; Let us consider his dilemma for a moment.  We know what the object of these charges that have been brought here daily is.  Everybody knows that this organisation, which is out by every means in its power, by any method that it can adopt, to overthrow this State, to overthrow and destroy the peace and harmony which now exists in the State, exists and can only exist by publicity.  Publicity is the very breath of its nostrils. Without publicity it cannot carry on, and in order that it may get publicity; when any single member of that association wishes to bring any charge that may come into its head against any member of the Civic Guard, all he has to do is to get some of the puppets&mdash;Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, or some of the back benchers&mdash;to give voice and utterance to this charge.</P>
    <P>These people know that if the morale of the Civic Guard can be broken down they have some possible chance of success.  They know equally that unless they succeed in breaking down the morale of the Civic Guard, unless they succed in demoralising the Civic Guard, all their efforts will be to no purpose. They cannot succeed and their whole organisation must go down unless they manage to bring demoralisation into the Civic Guard, and in order that they may attempt to <Col N="76" /> demoralise the Guards they get Deputies opposite to bring this type of charge against the Guards.  Oh, yes, have public inquiries so that if a member of the Guard does his duty he can be subjected to every kind of insult and attack in this House and outside! They seem to hope by this means to demoralise the Guards. That is their one object, and it is for that purpose that they put up Fianna Fáil Deputies as their mouthpieces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have also, I take it, kicked Fianna Fáil Deputies into the attempt that they have been making to drive a wedge between the uniformed and the ununiformed branches of the force. They are endeavouring to say to the uniformed members of the force: &ldquo;Oh, you are excellent persons; you are splendid persons, and we have nothing against you.  It is these detectives whom we are against. These are the men whom we want to attack.&rdquo;  That is an attitude which suits these people outside&mdash;to endeavour to divide the Guards and in that way to endeavour to have dissatisfaction in the Guards, to endeavour to break down the morale of the Guards.  That is what would suit the people outside and that is the game which the Fianna Fáil Party is playing for them.  But I am perfectly confident that no attempt made, here or elsewhere, to break down the morale of the Civic Guard will succeed.  That force is as finely disciplined a force, as strictly controlled a force, as well organised a force as exists anywhere. It is a force led by a sense of duty, it is a force which is properly carrying out its work to-day, and no matter what calumnies may be invented against that force from outside, and no matter what invective the Fianna Fáil Party may direct against it in this House, that morale will stand unshaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the question of public inquiries&mdash;that whenever any ragtag and bobtail in this I.R.A., as it calls itself, wants an inquiry it is <Col N="77" /> to be held.  But let me now come to the horns of the dilemma&mdash;prosecution for perjury.  The answer to that is very simple indeed.  In the first place, if a prosecution for perjury would lie I would not bring that prosecution because, as I have said, the one earthly hope that these men have of keeping their association going is advertisement, and I am not going to help them by giving them an advertisement.  They may get Deputy Little to read a long string of names of great heroes, of great martyrs and sufferers, in order that they may get the advertisement that they want, but I certainly will not help them to get a cheap advertisement.  I say that if a prosecution for perjury lay&mdash;but, of course, a prosecution for perjury does not lie, a prosecution for perjury in these affidavits could not be brought, and if Deputy Lemass does not know that Deputy Ruttledge certainly ought to know it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say distinctly that no prosecution for perjury lies on any affidavit unless that affidavit is made in connection with judicial proceedings, or else is an affidavit which is required or authorised by law.  You can put a great number of false statements on oath and be perfectly safe that no prosecution will lie against you.  I may inform Deputy Lemass, for instance, that he may put a terrible lot of things in an affidavit and be perfectly certain that no prosecution for perjury will lie against him.  He may say, for instance, that Deputy <Col N="78" /> Flinn is the greatest orator since O'Connell, and he may put that on affidavit, but he could not be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Again, he might say that Deputy Derrig is the most brilliant and flashing orator since O'Connell's contemporary, Lawlor Shiel, and he could not be prosecuted.  He might say, moreover, that Deputy Hogan is a typical Labour Deputy who would feel like a fish out of water in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, and Deputy Lemass could not be prosecuted. Deputy Little told us the other day that the one bulwark between this country and disaster was the sense of humour in the Fianna Fáil Party, but the only humorist I find in that Party is Deputy Carney, with, perhaps, an occasional flash from Deputy Jordan.</P>

He could say that Deputy de Valera was always consistent in all his speeches and that the end of his speech never contradicted the beginning.  He might say that he himself was always very careful and always verified his facts. He might put all these things in affidavits and, if he liked, he might send them to the Clare County Council, have them read and voted on, and, at the same time, a prosecution for perjury would not lie against him because the affidavits would not be in connection with legal proceedings and would not be required or authorised by law.</P>

      <Col N="79" /> I said a few moments ago that the association referred to lives and can only live on publicity, and that if it is not allowed to meet together, conspire together and carry out work it must die.  Deputy Lemass and his friends tell us that this is a deliberate endeavour on our part to manufacture crime, that we are making for crime, and that we are encouraging this association to carry out crime.  What are their own words and their own views?  I have them here in a paper which was captured upon that young man Green whom Deputy Little so affectionately styled Sonny Green.  The writer is talking about what they call &ldquo;our&rdquo; enemies.  Their enemies, of course, are the present Government.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has always been one of their aims, as a means of defeating and driving under ground, to keep Oglaigh na h-Eireann from all contact with the people, to prevent the open propagation of our policy and by gradual isolation to force us into a state of semi-stagnation where growth would be impossible, where we should be inarticulate and incapable of achieving anything, and where they hope that the disintegration that would naturally follow on these conditions would do the rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is their view&mdash;make them inarticulate, make them incapable of achieving anything, and the disintegration that will naturally follow on these conditions will do the rest. That is what our policy has been doing and that is the policy which we will continue to pursue.  We will prevent them, so far as we can, being articulate.  We cannot make them entirely inarticulate, I grant you. They may get Fianna Fáil Deputies to do their speaking for them.  When Deputy Little makes his visits, as he constantly seems to, to Suffolk Street he may get his instructions and be told what type-written documents he is to read in this House. To that extent, we cannot make them inarticulate, but, except for the assistance they get from Fianna <Col N="80" /> Fáil, they have no other method of getting that publicity and advertisement which they themselves say are the essence of their existence.</P>

Deputy Lemass referred to a certain poster that was issued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party during the last election in North Dublin.  He wanted to know if that was handed by the Guards to the Cumann na nGaedheal Publicity Department, and if the Cumann na nGaedheal organisers had a right to go in and search the archives of the Guards.  They have not, and it was not handed, as I already told the Deputy, by the Guards.  That document was sent to me, as the Guards always send captured documents to me, and by me it was circulated to the Executive Council.  That document was published as an advertisement, and it was correctly published as such.</P>

I agree with Deputy Lemass that it is rather a pity that the majority of Cumann na mBan are not in an asylum, but possibly they have not gone completely over the border-line yet.

      <P>You have that proved by pamphlet after pamphlet and by paper after paper in approbation of it.  You have it in the paper, the &ldquo;Nation.&rdquo;  Of course, it is not your paper.  You have nothing to do with it.  You disown it whenever you like.  Of course, you do not call it your official paper, but, as has been pointed out in the House, it has already shown its approbation of these attacks on jurors.  The only assistance that this association gets <Col N="83" /> is from the Party opposite.  It gets complete encouragement from the Party opposite to carry on the plan of campaign which it is carrying on at present.  Every speech which is made by Deputy de Valera is a direct encouragement to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy de Valera, although belatedly, denounce the murder of Mr. Armstrong and the attempted murder of Mr. White, as murder and attempted murder.  I was glad to know that in Deputy de Valera's view the persons who murdered Mr. Armstrong were guilty of murder, because it follows that Deputy de Valera would wish to see them expiate their crime on the scaffold, if properly tried and found guilty.  I am pleased to know that.  It is distinct progress, but Deputy de Valera immediately, afterwards takes up a different line of conduct and informs these persons outside the House, that they are the true Government, they are the true successors.  We have no moral support, no right to make laws in this country, no real, moral support.  They are the really true Government.  They are the de jure Government.  We are, at best, only a de facto Government. They are the de jure Government, the successors to 1925.  Therefore, Deputy de Valera is taking part in an illegal assembly here and Deputy de Valera here is usurping the powers which these men outside should have.  What follows from that?  Deputy de Valera is a member of this illegal assembly.  Deputy de Valera is part of this illegal assembly. The Party opposite are always fond of telling us that at some time or other they will be the heads of the State and they will be in power.  What will they do when they are in power?  What can they do?  They are only de facto.  They are not de jure.  They have no right. What can Deputy de Valera do except abdicate in favour of these persons. He would have no moral right to govern; they have the moral right. According to him, they are the de jure Government.  How could he prosecute them or how could he prevent their doing what they like to <Col N="84" /> bring war and disturbance to the country?  He said they are the de jure Government.  That is the attitude which Deputy de Valera takes up at one moment in his speech and at another moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought the very opposite.  If Deputy Lemass is now genuine and bona fide in his views, and Deputy Aiken, too, and if they want to see no outrages committed in the country, and if they want to see no arms except in the possession of persons who are entitled to carry arms&mdash;that is, the forces of this State&mdash;will they now give such information as they possess as to where the dumps of arms are to be found?  I do not say that they may know exactly where they are now.  I do not say that, but will they now give to the Guards all the information which they had in their possession as to the amount of arms that there was in this country and as to where they were located in 1925? If Deputy Lemass took a step like that, then I would begin to believe that Deputy Lemass was the real, sincere and true advocate of peace that he wishes himself to be believed to be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge has charged me with treating the Party opposite with contumely.  Do they deserve any other treatment when they act as they only too often act in this House, when they endeavour to give every sort of advertisement, and, by advertisement, to give every help to the persons who are trying to upset this State, when they bring charge after charge, whether it is refuted or not does not matter, against the Civic Guards?  Deputy Lemass made a charge here, out of the Waterford case, that letters were written, and that no information would be given by the Guards as to the location of persons against whom decrees had been got.  Deputy Lemass must have known that that was wrong, because I find here in the Debates for March, 1928, that I gave the whole of the facts to Deputy Lemass.  What I am going to quote will be found in the Official Debates for the 21st March, 1928, column 1524:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass informed us yesterday that he got complaints at his information bureau, of which I understood him to say he was in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Then I go on:</P>
    <P>The other day not one, but a whole series of Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches, all shouting together (that often happens) informed the House that information as to the whereabouts of the defendants in a certain case that came from Waterford had been asked for at the Depôt and was refused. I knew nothing about the facts on that occasion.  It was the first time I heard the charge made, and I asked that a question should be put down.  Of course no question was put down.  What were the facts?  On February 15th the solicitor for the plaintiffs wrote to the Civic Guard Depôt asking for information, and on the 17th of the same month they got the information they asked for.</P>
    <P>And yet, though Deputy Lemass gets that specific information as far back as March, 1928, he comes here in this debate and reiterates the same charge. That is not all.  We had a very clear and specific statement here the other night, made by Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly.  Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly's statement was this&mdash;I am reading from Vol. 29, No. 5, of the Official Debates, column 1832&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some of the men responsible for the murder of Kevin O'Higgins are in the employment and the pay of those men&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those men, I take it, are us.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and not one of them has been tried or arrested for it.  These are deliberate statements.  I am speaking with a sense of responsibility. I know what I am talking about. I know these men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there is a clear, definite statement that Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly has knowledge that Civic Guards were concerned in the murder of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins.  He has got definite information on the subject. There is no doubt about it. Naturally that matter had to be followed up.  If a Deputy has information, we must discover exactly what the information is, and this shows the accuracy of the charges which were brought against the Civic <Col N="90" /> Guards, and shows one of the very strong reasons why charges coming from the mouths of the Fianna Fáil Deputies must be more than carefully investigated.  That statement by Deputy O'Kelly had, as I say, necessarily to be followed up.  A Chief Superintendent of the Civic Guards was sent to interview and to get information from Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly.  I purpose reading to the House a report of that interview to show the evidence upon which Deputy O'Kelly made that very clear, definite, specific statement which I have read.  The report of the Chief Superintendent is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As directed in your minute of 11th instant, I beg to report that, accompanied by Superintendent Kelleher of Dunleary District, I met Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly at Leinster House yesterday by appointment. I informed him that I was investigating the murder of the late Minister for Justice, Mr. O'Higgins, and that a statement in reference to the murder, made by him in the course of a speech in An Dáil on 9th May, 1929, had come under my notice, and that the statement attributed to him led me to believe that he was in a position to disclose some information which would be of use to the Gárda in their investigation of the crime.  Mr. O'Kelly informed me that he had no first hand information on the subject, but that his statement was based on information which he received from another member of the Dáil, whose name he could not disclose without the latter's consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, you have had it here that Deputy O'Kelly knows that &ldquo;some of the men responsible for the murder of Kevin O'Higgins are in the employment and the pay of those men, and not one of them has been tried or arrested for it.  These are deliberate statements.  I am speaking with a sense of responsibility.  I know what I am talking about.  I know these men.&rdquo;  He is interviewed, and it turns out that Deputy O'Kelly knows nothing on earth about the <Col N="91" /> matter.  All he knows is something he has heard from another Deputy. The Superintendent goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I asked him if his informant was Mr. Lemass, T.D., and he replied that it was another person. He left the room for a short time and returned accompanied by Mr. Gerald Boland, T.D., whom he introduced to us as his informant on the subject.  Mr. O'Kelly remained in the room during our interview with Mr. Boland.  Mr. Boland stated that he had no first hand information on the subject, but that his information was contained in a statement in the Dáil in a speech during the discussion of the Estimates in March, 1929.  He could not remember the date of his statement, but said that it was all contained in the Hansard Reports. I told him that I had not seen the Hansard Reports and requested him to give me the substance of his information now.  He appeared to have no hesitation in doing so. Mr. Boland said that it had leaked out that on the Friday before the murder the late Minister had threatened to take drastic disciplinary action against certain members of the &lsquo;C.I.D.&rsquo;, and that this action was resented by the higher authorities of the police, and that a climax had been reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that whoever gave that information to Deputy Boland was entirely wrong.  Nothing of the kind happened, and nothing of the kind was in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That having regard to the lack of proper facilities for the shipment of cattle from Dublin port <Col N="94" /> and the fact that the carrying trade from the Free State to British ports is practically non-competitive, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should confer with the Dublin commissioners, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and the Cattle Traders' Association with a view to the erection of suitable municipal lairages at the North Wall and for facilities for berthage convenient thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion is on the paper for thirteen months, and I owe an apology to the House for dragging the cattle of this country, worth something like nineteen million pounds, into an atmosphere reeking with the odour of bombs and blood. As I have stated, this question of the lairages in Dublin has been before the Government for thirteen months. While I do not want to anticipate the reply of the Minister, I should have much preferred that in the long interval which has elepsed the necessity for moving the motion had been removed.  However, it appears that I have to go on, and in the circumstances I must try and read some of the notes which I wrote thirteen months ago, although the ink on the paper has almost faded away.</P>
    <P>Anyone connected with the cattle industry in this country will agree with me that the conditions and arrangements for the shipment of live-stock from our ports, more particularly our principal port of Dublin, leave much to be desired.  In fact, it would appear, so far as my investigations go, that the Government take very little interest in this very important industry.  The question of lairages, transit, etc., everything leading up to the export of the cattle, seems to be left in the hands of the railway and shipping companies without any proper control or supervision or any great interest being shown in the matter by the Government. I shall run over briefly what the conditions are at present and what I suggest they should be.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions in the lairages in Dublin it is almost impossible to have proper veterinary inspection <Col N="95" /> of animals.  This is rendered difficult owing to the fact that the yards and lairages are scattered and considerable unnecessary strain is, therefore, placed on veterinary inspectors in watching the animals. After being rejected in one pen animals are constantly taken to other pens on the chance of their being passed eventually.  The cattle, after long journeys, do not get sufficient time in Dublin to rest and feed after discharge from the railways and before being put on the ship for the sea journey.  From investigations I have made, it appears that some years ago, after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease&mdash;I think in 1912 or 1913&mdash;the British authorities suggested to the then Department of Agriculture that cattle should be detained at Irish ports for at least twelve hours before shipment.  I am sorry to say that the cattle traders at the time did not think that was a reasonable request.  In any case, they turned down the proposition and suggested that two hours was sufficient detention to rest the cattle. That was agreed to at once by the British authorities, but to safeguard themselves I suppose, and in order to see that their own inspection would be a satisfactory one, they imposed a detention of ten hours on the other side.  If we have any respect for our cattle trade and the conditions under which we put our live-stock on the market, we should see to it that our cattle are exported in the best possible condition.</P>
    <P>If this long and essential period of detention of the cattle in this country is to be carried out, it is absolutely necessary that properly-equipped lairages should be provided at the North Wall.  If that is done, there is no reason why the cattle for export cannot be detained here for twelve hours, instead of two hours on this side and ten hours on the other side, so that the cattle when they are heated and excited and footsore may cool off and the veterinary inspectors may have a proper opportunity of seeing that no cattle unfit for export are sent away, and <Col N="96" /> that they can stand over any animal sent out of the country.</P>
    <P>A twelve-hour detention period at this side would also be of advantage to the city of Dublin, but I am not arguing for the city of Dublin.  I am interested in the farmers and the prosperity of the State as a whole. If, however, you view the matter from the point of view of the workers in Dublin, it would be of great advantage to them.  When there is a detention period necessary, if we dealt with the situation here ourselves, and if proper lairage accommodation was provided, and put under the control of the Department of Agriculture, a good deal of much-needed employment would be given to Dublin workers in feeding and watering and attending to the cattle. In addition to that, hay and other products of this country would be consumed here instead of having to be bought at the other side.  That is a side-issue, but it is important from the employment point of view in Dublin.  It would not alone be a benefit to the port of Dublin, but it would be of benefit to the cattle industry, and I think it is very necessary. If that were done, people on the other side would have greater confidence when buying our cattle. Under present conditions our live-stock, particularly fat cattle which are exported, suffer very materially in value owing to our neglect of our business on this side.</P>
    <P>I heard it publicly stated that a gentleman who came across here from Glasgow a couple of years ago had an interview with the Minister for Agriculture in the Free State and also with the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland and he made a statement to the effect that deterioration in cattle exported to Glasgow amounted to £1,000,000 per annum, due to the conditions prevailing in the transit of the cattle and the driving to the ports.  That was a very large item, and all this money comes ultimately out of the pockets of the farmers.  The cattle dealer must save himself.  He says &ldquo;this animal is worth so much when it arrives on the other side allowing <Col N="97" /> for deterioration in shipment from Ireland.&rdquo; If we did our business here in a way that would inspire confidence in those to whom we sell on the other side, it would mean a benefit, on the lowest estimation, of 30/- per head on fat cattle and a proportionately smaller sum on stores and other livestock.</P>
    <P>Besides the deterioration in the value of cattle, due to the lack of facilities, we must remember that that deals only with cattle coming from the Dublin market.  Take cattle that have been sent by rail&mdash;perhaps a ten, twelve or fourteen hours' journey from the west, or the south, or the midlands.  We know what happens to these cattle.  They are driven perhaps three, four, five or six miles to a fair; they are kept standing on the fair green for hours; then they are rushed to the train and loaded on trucks for Liffey Junction or for Amiens Street.  They are rushed from there to the North Wall, with its so-called lairages, and after two hours' detention to rest, after 24 hours on foot, they are sent across to the English markets.  It is unnecessary to explain what that means in the appearance of the animals and in their value when they arrive at the other side.  It is of the greatest importance that we should pay attention to the export of our cattle, which mean 43 per cent. of our total exports.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned, but it is no harm to emphasise, and point that it is of vital importance in connection with our export trade in cattle that the lairages should be under the control of the Department of Agriculture.  Under the present conditions there is great difficulty in handling, and things happen on this side during the veterinary inspection that would not be tolerated on the other side.  If we have no respect for our products we cannot expect people in England to teach us our business.  They did the best they could in the past, yet we do not seem to have benefited.  It is very important from the point of view of guaranteeing our trade and seeing that everything is done right that the Department of Agriculture should have absolute control over the lairages. <Col N="98" /> There are some lairages run by individuals and railway companies and shipping companies, but I say it is the Government's duty to take complete control of the lairages and to be responsible for the conditions to which our cattle are exposed.</P>
    <P>There is looseness at present.  A lot of drovers and dealers and others are allowed to interfere with the veterinary inspectors in their work, and all this does not tend towards efficiency.  If this matter was looked after and handled by the Government, all these abuses would disappear. In other countries, they never allow outsiders into the lairages until the inspection work is completed.  I have consulted many people, and they all say that there is a deterioration of 30/- per head in fat cattle and from that down to 15/-per head in various other branches of livestock due to this deterioration. If you look at the figures of our exports, you will find that this loss to the country from inefficiency, inattention and indifference would make a very considerable difference in our trade balance in the future.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not, strictly speaking, within the compass of the motion I move, but I think I would not be straining the matter very far to introduce it here. That is the question of the Dublin Cattle Market.  That has to do with the shipment of cattle and the proper condition of lairages.  The market at present is condemned by everybody who has anything to do with the cattle business or who knows anything about it&mdash;both those at home and those who come over here to buy.  The market is entirely unsuitable. Up to the present, it is not properly equipped as a market to deal with the numbers it has to deal with.  It is too far removed from the railways and other points of shipment. Added to all the trouble there is in dealing with things at the North Wall, when the cattle are bought at the market they are rushed to Liffey Junction or Amiens Street or the Great Southern Railway. A great many of these cattle go up North and arrive there without rest.  They get no period of detention <Col N="99" /> at all.  They are sent from the Dublin market North, so they must arrive at their destination in a pretty bad condition indeed.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well that the Government, in dealing with this matter&mdash;if they intend to deal with it &mdash;should go into the whole question of providing a proper cattle market for the city of Dublin, which has to deal with probably over 50 per cent. of the cattle exports, and which would deal with much more if proper facilities were given.  I know that that has been going on for a number of years.  I am not blaming the present Government for that, but we want them to get alive to what is happening.  For years, when cattle were bought in the west of Ireland and in the midlands, and even in the south of Ireland, the natural port of shipment for them was Dublin, but they would not be allowed to go through Dublin.  Years ago&mdash;and I am informed that the same practice obtains to-day&mdash;at Ballinasloe Fair and some of the other big fairs in Ireland, the shipping companies' canvassers attended the fairs.  Long ago it used to be the practice for the shipping companies' representatives and the Great Northern Railway representative to attend these fairs and guarantee shipping through Belfast, and get the cattle through Belfast for England.  The Free State railways would not guarantee shipment, and the consequence was that the whole traffic went the other way. We have faults here.  I think possibly there is not a proper understanding between the railways and the shipping companies, or, on the other hand, the Free State shipping companies are not doing their business rightly and are allowing the Great Northern Railway to beat them every time.</P>
    <P>This question of a cattle market in Dublin is one of great importance and even though everything might be done to equip it, to put proper lairage accommodation there, to have it covered, and to have it so that the cattle could lie down and rest and be in proper condition for <Col N="100" /> shipment after all necessary detention&mdash;if all that was done we would still have the problem of the cattle market being an unsuitable place.  Considerable loss has accrued to every one concerned and the State in particular, owing to the fact that the cattle market is where it is and is not properly equipped.  From the information that I have, there is, I understand, quite efficient accommodation, something like 23 or 24 acres, right beside the port, at the different places where the boats are at the North Wall, which would provide properly equipped lairages and also a properly covered cattle market for the city.  If that were done I have no doubt we would get all the trade coming through Dublin which Dublin is entitled to, and until that is done we cannot make complaints about other people who do their business better, getting better business than this city.  I know very well that here in the City of Dublin there are some people who may possibly consider that they have certain vested interests round about the site of the present cattle market.  But all those things would have to be dealt with.  I do not want to destroy anyone's interests in whatever property they have.  The interests of the State come first.  If necessary, those people should be compensated, and if not, they should not stand in the way of having the market placed in a proper position so that cattle sent out from this country will be marketed under the best conditions and so that this country will get the best value which they would get if things were worked in the right way.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of monopoly in the carrying trade, I say it is practically non-competitive. I might have gone the whole way and said it is non-competitive.  At present we have several shipping companies which comprise a monopoly.  There was a time when we had nine Irish companies financed by Irish capital and when, in consequence of competition for this trade, there was a competitive rate.  Cattle could be sent across for something like 4/10 per head.  The price now is 16/6.</P>

      <P>To Birkenhead. The price now is 16/6, because twelve lines are all amalgamated under the heading of Coast Lines, and the consequence is that the Irish farmer and the Irish Free State are losing, I should say, hundreds of thousands a year by the very fact that there is no competition in this business.  The question of berthage comes into this very largely.  It is very difficult for anyone to get berthage at a Dublin port.  At the time the famous vessel, &ldquo;The Brussels,&rdquo; was put on&mdash;it did not last very long&mdash;it was supposed to be competitive.  It was originally put on to be a competitive vessel, but very soon it was absorbed by the octopus of Coast Lines.  At that time there was considerable opposition to the people who purchased &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; getting any berthage at the North Wall.  They had a great deal of trouble.  A great deal of lobbying and canvassing was carried on with the Port and Docks Board, with strong opposition from those members of the Port and Docks Board who controlled not alone the Port and Docks Board but very nearly the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin.  The gentlemen who were running these Coast Lines are the gentlemen who obstructed competition in the Port and Docks Board, and they themselves were the Port and Docks Board.  At that time the Dublin Corporation was in existence and had a number of representatives, seven or eight, on the Port and Docks Board.  Were it not for the fact that those representatives were there on the Port and Docks Board, no facilities in berthage would be given to &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; and competition would never have come.  Having been beaten on the question of berthage and of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; being put on, the next best thing was to buy &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; at a fancy price.  It was bought at an exorbitant price; in fact, nearly all the vessels recently acquired by Coast Lines were bought at peak prices.  What is the result?  This monopoly is paying <Col N="102" /> much higher dividends to-day on inflated capital out of the farmers' pockets than the combined companies could pay when they were in competition.  I was informed that in 1926 the profit on Coast Lines, Ltd., ran to something like £38,000.  Last year it was nearly half a million. That half a million of inflated capital is coming out of the pockets of the farmers and going away from the Free State because all the profit made by this monopoly is not paying one halfpenny as a return by way of income tax or anything else to this country.</P>

    <P>We may have flattered these gentlemen at a little function which took place here the other day and which I was glad to see brought about, that was the starting of the floating exhibition of Irish goods, in &ldquo;The Killarney.&rdquo; The President, the Vice-President and others were present.  It is a good idea, rather a novel idea, to have a floating exhibition of Irish products going around England.  It is even a better idea to have the ship named &ldquo;The Killarney,&rdquo; but it would be still a better idea if the ship were owned by an Irish company. The name was the only thing Irish about the ship.  I see that other vessels have been built to carry Irish produce and profit out of Ireland, not in Dublin or even Belfast but across the other side, and they all have Irish names, such as &ldquo;The Lady Meath,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Killarney,&rdquo; and others.  We must be gullible people when we allow those monopolists to come in and use Irish names on their ships, and not give us one halfpenny in return.  Perhaps it was this thought that was in the Vice-President's mind when he spoke at this function the other day.  It would appear that Coast Lines, Limited, gave the use of this vessel, &ldquo;The Killarney,&rdquo; for the occasion.  &ldquo;The Minister for Finance said that he would like to thank Sir Alfred Read and the company over which he presided, not only for his hospitality but for his enterprise.  It was a great thing that they had a firm carrying their produce to the most important market that was not going on the old lines but which was taking every opportunity <Col N="103" /> that offered&rdquo;&mdash;and all the money that was offered too&mdash;&ldquo;and was always looking for new ways to develop that trade and to develop industry in this country.&rdquo;  I do not see any new ways of developing trade by taking all the profits they make out of the country, but perhaps the Minister for Finance was tremendously impressed by the fact that the principal agent for Coast Lines in this country was a very clever man.  &ldquo;He should also like to say a few words about Mr. David Barry.  They recognised in him a keen and sound business man who not only desired the good of this country but realised as a business man that the advancement of this country was for the good of the company.&rdquo;  Certainly, but he recognised the fact too that possibly Mr. David Barry is the only citizen&mdash;I suppose he is a citizen&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners have not been able to get at, and in that way I think anything that might be said flattering him as a business man was amply justified.  Few of us can earn a living in the Free State and earn big dividends from our companies and not pay, but surely Mr. David Barry should have the four-leaved shamrock when he succeeded in doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the attack on the individual.  I am talking entirely on the question of the representative of Coast Lines.  I am very sorry.  I apologise to the individual but not to the representative of Coast Lines.  I am dealing now with 43 per cent. of the exports of the Free State, but the whole of the exports are dealt with by a monopolist company.  I think it is only right that the Government should take notice of that fact and provide whatever means are in their power&mdash;they are all-powerful in other directions and they should be all-powerful in this direction&mdash;to deal with it.  Not alone the cattle export trade, but all our carrying is non-competitive in this country. That is a matter that the Government should take serious notice of. Without attempting to injure the business of anybody, it is their duty to see that our goods are put on the market in the best possible condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may quote again from the statement made at that little function, I notice that the President very properly dealt with the fact that there was not a fleet of vessels.  As he said, it is not one vessel we should have showing off our produce, but a fleet of vessels.  We have not even <Col N="105" /> one vessel to show off our produce. We still have to go to somebody else to get a vessel, which is a disgraceful state of affairs for a country exporting so largely and depending so much on our exports.  I will quote the exact words of the President:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the forefront,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I place our trade in live stock with Great Britain.  This trade alone is one of the largest and most important of its kind subsisting between any two countries in the world. Last year the total value of that trade to the Saorstát amounted to £19,230,097&mdash;representing 43 per cent. of the aggregate value of our domestic exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might conclude my remarks by adopting every word of what the President has said with regard to our live stock exports.  I think I could not emphasise the necessity for doing something more strongly than by using that quotation from the President's speech.  He recognises the importance of the export trade in live stock, and I think it is time that some steps were taken to put our live animals on the market in a proper condition.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he comes to reply, will be able to say that already something has been done, that some steps have been taken to provide competition in the transit trade, and also to provide lairages.  As to the form of this motion, I will be quite willing to amend it.  As I said at the start, it has been on the Order Paper for thirteen months.  When I put on the motion it was not nearly so important as it is to-day, for the reason that I then hoped, and a number of people hoped, that our live stock export trade would gradually reduce, that it would be changed into a dead meat trade.  At that time, we had the Drogheda factory re-established, and we had hopes&mdash;at least, I had hopes&mdash;that it would be run on such lines that we would gradually drift from exporting our fat cattle to exporting dead meat, thereby being enabled to provide other industries from the hides and offals of the <Col N="106" /> animals.  Now, the Drogheda Factory is a failure and there is not much likelihood of anybody re-starting it.  After two failures at Drogheda, nobody is likely to put down any considerable sum of money in order to start once more the dead meat trade there.</P>
    <P>To-day, then, this motion is of far greater importance because we are going to be tied to the live-stock business for a considerably longer time than I expected.  The motion is, therefore, more important than it was thirteen months ago.  I should like, with the permission of the House, to alter my motion in so far as the question of a conference with the Dublin Commissioners, the Port and Docks Board and the Cattle Traders' Association is concerned. Perhaps it might be considered derogatory for the Government to consult with these people, but I set down the motion with the idea that the Government would take all the necessary steps and secure the information essential to deal with this situation.  After thirteen months it is only natural to assume&mdash;I hope I am right in so assuming&mdash;that various channels of information have been tapped.  I suggest, therefore, that the motion might be altered to read: &ldquo;That the Executive Council should take steps to provide suitable municipal lairages at the North Wall with facilities for berthage convenient thereto.&rdquo;  If that is agreeable to the House, I would like so to amend the motion. If that procedure is not approved, I will let the motion go in its present form.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I have not been briefed as well as Deputy O'Hanlon.  I do not know what is the power of the Government in this matter.  I do not know what power they would have if all the accommodation available there is given away to some private company.  Evidently at some time somebody gave away the site and it is now a question between the railway companies and the shipping companies.  If the site is divided between these companies, legislation would certainly be needed to take away from them sites that they cannot show cause for retaining.  I think it will be admitted that all the markets on the other side are very different now from the markets that existed there formerly.  The Dublin market is an open market; all the markets on the other side are enclosed. I mean by that, that they are roofed.  If such a market were to be constructed here it would mean the expenditure of a lot of money.  The one thing upon which we must make up our minds is that the monopoly of the shipping trade of the country cannot remain in the hands of one set of individuals.  It is no wonder the freightages are so high.  There is really no competition, because competition is shut out. It may be stated that there is no space there and that we cannot interfere. I hold there is space, or space could be made.  I have only seen that part of the city once and I obtained my view from the top of a tram.  I saw a lot of strand that could very easily be converted into excellent sites merely by allowing it to be used as a dumping ground for city refuse.  I saw a very flat shore on which very little water comes. That could easily be made an excellent site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate will have served one good purpose if it has the effect of <Col N="108" /> inducing the Dublin Commissioners, the Government, or whatever authority may be concerned, to provide more space there to meet this or any other situation that may arise.  It is really the proper place for a market. The railway lines from all over the country meet there and quite adjacent you have the docks.  We know the trouble that exists at Cabra, where cattle are taken off in the middle of the night, where the accommodation is poor and where there are really very little facilities.  The cattle have to be left in the wagons until such time as men come in the morning to take them off.  I am not talking about the West because I do not know much about it, but I know that in Kilkenney cattle are loaded at nine or ten o'clock in the morning and one is lucky if he sees those cattle at five o'clock the next morning at Cabra.  They are shunted about day and night at different stations and they arrive in such a condition that you would scarcely know your cattle in the Dublin market.  I often had cattle at the Dublin market and only I happened to know each beast individually I could scarcely recognise them in the morning.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has referred to the condition of cattle arriving on the other side.  One thing very largely responsible for that is the method of penning cattle on the boat. Much better facilities are given now than formerly; more penning space is given, I will admit, but there is no additional space overhead.  Cattle have to remain on these boats from twelve to fourteen hours on the Birkenhead route&mdash;it all depends on the route&mdash;from the time they are penned until they are discharged; on the Glasgow route they are left much longer, about twenty-four hours.  The only thing you could liken the conditions on the boat to is a Turkish bath at a very high temperature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is outside the motion, but it has been spoken of already.  Anyone who has seen Irish cattle at the other side can easily recognise <Col N="109" /> the conditions the cattle must have passed through before they arrive at Birkenhead or Glasgow. They are actually dead to the world, and the only explanation is that they have been almost sweated to death.  It is quite apparent that the loss on these cattle must be very considerable.  In such a situation it is necessary for whoever has authority to do it to remedy the position. In Aberdeen, Glasgow and Birkenhead they have much better facilities than we have.  Their markets are all covered in.  The proper place for our market is the place where we have all transport facilities converging. You have your railway lines and shipping situated very conveniently at the North Wall.  For that matter you have conveniences on the other side of the river, but I think the north side would be better.  I am not briefed, as I have already said. I say it is up to whomsoever can do it to put this matter right.  I expect it must be done through legislation. If people have a monopoly of the space at present available down there, it is either through pressure or through means of legislation that this can be rectified.  Alternative space is there.  If that space were only used as a dumping ground for the refuse of Dublin, there would be made available in a very short time 30 or 40 acres on the north side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this opportunity has occurred of discussing certain phases of the transportation of live stock.  I am sorry that it is not possible to go more deeply into the matter.  We have been hearing for a great number of years of the importance of this industry. We have been told that it produces 42 per cent. of the wealth of the nation.  I do not believe that there is a single industry in this country to which less attention has been paid.  Largely through that inattention, and through the want of shipping and lairage facilities, we have been forced to export store cattle instead of fat cattle.  That alone is a very serious loss in the wealth of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If economic principles are correct, <Col N="110" /> it is always wrong to export raw material. We are exporting raw material and we are largely turning from fat cattle to the export of store cattle for the reasons that we have not fair or proper facilities at our principal ports.  It is there that the whole industry is controlled.  If we continue at the present rate, and if we allow monopolies to do as they please, and not just as little as we want them to do, I fear that the result will be that the whole cattle trade of this country will soon be a purely store trade.</P>
    <P>There were times in this country when those shipping and transport companies adopted a more reasonable attitude, and that was before this monopoly system was introduced. Even the men who cross to England to sell cattle had facilities. They got certain considerations for the amount of money as freights that was paid through them.  Shipping companies then took a reasonable, business-like view, but I fear that there is none of that to-day.  It is simply a matter of taking all they possibly can.  There is no industry, I believe, that is in such a confused state as the export cattle business. The methods adopted for the inspection of stock are more harmful than otherwise.  Live stock&mdash;lamb and beef&mdash;is a very delicate commodity. It needs special handling.  When we speak about the Argentine as a great competitor, we must remember that they have succeeded because they had the energy to do what we should have done and paid particular attention to the transport of their live stock in their own country.</P>
    <P>We here, as a Government, have no control whatsoever, as far as I know, at the Port of Dublin.  It is simply one mass of confusion.  Individuals who have certain interests are always there to take all they can get, and they have no interest whatsoever in the condition of the live-stock. When the live stock reach the other side, the same thing happens. The live stock has to be detained at Birkenhead, say, for ten hours.  They are detained here for two hours.  I do not see why we <Col N="111" /> should not have proper facilities, controlled by the Government here, to detain live stock at this port in Dublin, or at any other port, for the full twelve hours.  In that time, these cattle could be reasonably inspected.</P>
    <P>Any person who has travelled to Birkenhead and had a look at that most delicate commodity when it reaches Birkenhead will appreciate this.  Let anyone look at the condition of lambs after reaching Birkenhead from Dublin.  These lambs are detained there for ten hours in these puzzle yards.  On looking at them, one would begin to doubt about the civilisation we boast about and about the good of those societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals. As long as the present system is allowed to prevail, and as long as the shipping companies have a monopoly and are without opposition, those abuses are bound to remain.  I believe that the whole result of this is that we have been forced into producing and selling store cattle instead of fattening.</P>
    <P>The same thing holds good in the Dublin Cattle Market.  I do not for one moment agree that this is at all an up-to-date market.  I am satisfied and convinced that it is a most out-of-date market.  Therefore, I do not believe that we are sincere when we talk about the importance of this great industry.  We, as a nation or the Government of this country, have never taken any serious steps or never made any effort whatsoever to put that industry on a sound or business-like basis.  It may be that they know that it is not as economic as they pretend it to be.  That may be quite so.  I am doubtful as to whether the industry is an economic industry.  That is a very doubtful problem, and I am more doubtful still when I consider that the price of that produce is something like 25 to 30 per cent. above the pre-war figure, while the freights are 100 per cent. above that figure&mdash;certainly above 100 per cent.  When we consider that position and that not the slightest effort was made to inquire into that, I believe that the industry must be considered as not economic. <Col N="112" /> Else some serious effort would have been made to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>Another point that strikes one in this particular industry is that generally in the spring-time store cattle are actually dearer than fat cattle.  Of course, we come back again to the question of the handling of the cattle.  The stores are really dearer.  We supply Scotland with store cattle.  We get more per hundredweight for the store cattle and the Scotsman gets a good deal more per pound for the beef produced in Scotland than we can get for it in Ireland.  Again, it is a question of transport.  It is to a large extent, too, a question of the detention and handling of these cattle and the want of proper supervision. That, I take it, must be to a large extent a national loss.</P>
    <P>People wonder and are curious as to the reasons for that.  I believe that the reasons are to be found in this&mdash;that proper facilities and proper supervision by the people who are really interested in it are not given.  That is because it is not exactly to be expected that the English authorities have the same interest in our produce as we would have ourselves.  I take it that if it could be brought about that we would have a State-controlled lairage at the port of exportation and if our live stock would be detained for the full twelve hours, that would be a great advantage.  It is true that the British authorities give permission to sell stock within two hours after landing.  But anybody who understands the trade will know that stock, after landing off the boat, are certainly in need of rest.  If you give them two hours' rest, as soon as the two hours are up you cannot sell the stock for another ten hours. If they happen to be stores, it makes a considerable difference.  They have time to heal up.  I believe that the whole loss and the whole drawback to the production of beef in this country is the question of transportation and detention.</P>
    <P>The detention should be in the hands of those who would naturally be expected to be more sympathetic to the producers than <Col N="113" /> people who have no particular interest, except from the consumers' point of view.  That largely reacts on the price that we obtain for meat in England.  To a certain extent it raises the price of Irish produce, in the shape of beef and mutton&mdash;too high for consumers.  Butchers who buy damaged cattle have often a loss of sixty or seventy lbs. of meat in one beast.  If that occurs, the butchers have only two parties to look to in order to recoup themselves.  One would be the seller the following week, but the ones they would certainly aim at would be the consumers. The butchers have to get paid for their losses some way.  To my mind that is where this question is of such importance.  It is for these reasons that I would like to see some effort made so that we would be in the position of having lairages controlled so that the period of detention would be here, and in order to break the monopoly, because where a monopoly of that description exists the producers&mdash;especially when they are farmer producers who have no particular organisation&mdash;are unable to attack them, and it is only just and fair that the Government should make some effort to assist.  Monopolies had been springing up in the shipping trade in this country for a good many years before the war. Previous to that, cattle suffered a certain amount of damage, but the shipping companies gave reasonable compensation. In addition to that, there were arrangements by which the railway companies by means of fast special trains fed the shipping companies. These arrangements do not seem to exist now, or exist in a haphazard manner, and extraordinary things occur owing to the action of the shipping companies.  We find that freights from certain places in Ireland are at times perhaps less than freights from just outside Dublin. That is another proof of the confusion that exists in connection with live stock transport.  Those are reasons why I am glad that this opportunity has occurred to discuss what is, or what is supposed to be, an industry of great importance in this country.</P>

      <P>I think the most remarkable thing about this motion is its origin.  When we remember that Deputy O'Hanlon is never tired of describing himself as a free trader, as a devotee of the Manchester School, as a strong individualist, and pours contempt on us poor protectionists and advocates of State interference, this motion is certainly a very remarkable one.  Not merely does Deputy O'Hanlon want State interference, but he wants the State to take steps to promote municipal trading. That is certainly a remarkable line to take.  Why he has such confidence in a municipality to remedy the evils he speaks of is more than I can understand.  As a matter of fact, I think both he and the Senator who brought forward a similar motion in the Seanad about a year ago are rather confused as to what they really want.  For instance, the Senator who proposed the motion in the Seanad, which also advocated a municipal lairage, said: &ldquo;The lairage question is a national one.  It should not be left to be dealt with by either the Port and Docks Board or the City Commissioners.  I believe the Government should interfere, as the question is a national one.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Hanlon told us to-day that the Department of Agriculture should have complete control, and again I think he stated that the Department should have absolute control, so where on earth we are with regard to this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know that Deputy O'Hanlon, if you put it to him or to any other person interested in this trade, would really have confidence that the municipality would do a great deal better than the people who are now in charge. Municipalities have not always been highly efficient in trading.  To say <Col N="115" /> that they would take a national interest in this question, that they would take every possible step to see that these inhumanities and ill-treatment of cattle that were described this evening would not happen under their control, is to put a great deal of confidence in the City Commissioners or the future City Council, or whoever is in charge.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. I do not think it was ever suggested by anybody that people who send traffic through Dublin, cattle or anything else, could put up market facilities.  We are claiming no more than what is provided voluntarily by every other civic authority.  I do not know who put up the markets at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Birkenhead or any place else.

That was a rather extraordinary omission. If they are to be municipal lairages I could understand that after the suggested conference the Dublin Commissioners would possibly see a good thing in it&mdash;that they would be entitled to charge what they liked for the use of the lairage for cattle, and earn very good interest on the capital invested.</P>

      <P>When a big proposal of this kind is considered worthy of being brought forward at all, assuredly we should get some information that would enable us to see who is to bear the expense of it.  As I say, I could understand that, after this proposed conference had been held, the municipality of Dublin would see a good thing in it.  But at least we should be told whether they are expected to do it, irrespective of whether it was to pay or not.  Is it suggested that the municipality should be at liberty to charge whatever they think is reasonable, or whatever will reimburse them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or who is to decide the question of the charges?  I think that that would be an important item in connection with this proposal.  At the same time, I believe that this proposal might be passed, because I think it is necessary for the Government to take some action, and failing a more suitable motion I am prepared to vote for this.  I think that the Government should at least investigate this question as to the position at the North Wall and confer with the different authorities as to what improvements could be effected, or as to the advantage of the new lairage, if it be erected.  I think it is a pity that the motion should have been moved before the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal appeared. I understand that that Report is due within a few weeks' time, and none of us is really in a position to discuss conditions at the North Wall until we have seen that Report. That the whole of the accommodation for lairages and for berthage should be in the hands of a body that is more or less independent of the State at present is not, in my opinion, a position that can be tolerated.  So far as can be seen, the Port and Docks Board have full right to control berthage there, and naturally those who are in power on the Port and Docks Board will see <Col N="117" /> that no one who threatens competition with them will get much encouragement. Judging from Deputy O'Hanlon's speech, I presume it was intended to link up this question with the question of berthage.  I presume that the real purpose of the motion is to ensure that by providing lairages we would be independent of the existing carrying companies, and that independent shipping companies would make their appearance.  I think everybody would desire that and that everybody would vote for the motion on that account.  But I think that the motion was very unfortunately worded, that it does not give a chance to those who see, in the independent position of the Port and Bocks Board, a great danger to the trade of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, a further reason why some action should be taken by the Government.  Competition between Belfast and Dublin is, I understand, extremely keen.  Every day further efforts are being made by Belfast port to win to itself traffic which rightly belongs to Dublin.  The Belfast authorities state that their lairage accommodation is very much ahead of the accommodation in Dublin. That is a very serious item, because if any substantial amount of traffic is taken from Dublin it must mean an increase in the Dublin rates. I do not believe that it should be left as a matter of competition between Dublin and Belfast; I believe that the traffic originating in or having its destination in the Saorstát should go through Free State ports, and I believe that transport should be so controlled that those concerned would not have any grievance in being compelled to obey a direction of that kind.  But pending the acceptance of such a proposal by the Government, I think it is very important that Belfast should not have any advantage, particularly in regard to live-stock traffic.  This question is obviously a very important one.  Two-thirds of the cattle exported from the Saorstát are exported through Dublin port.  That in itself is a sufficient reason for a very ample inquiry into the grievances that are alleged. <Col N="118" /> When one who is himself very much concerned in the cattle trade, one of the leading shippers in the country, makes the statement: &ldquo;The present accommodation is deficient.  The cattle are herded together during the period of detention, are roaring and goring each other in these exposed pens in which there is no room to feed or water them,&rdquo; that is obviously a matter for consideration.  I think that the Minister cannot deny that it is of public interest to see that the matter is inquired into and to see that those who are responsible shall either improve their methods and give satisfaction to the Government or that encouragement is given to some other interest to establish lairages that would be at least in competition with existing lairages, or that would be under some sort of national control.  It is, however, principally on the question of berthage that I support the motion.  I think that is all-important, that when the question of the regulation of berthage is dealt with, as presumably it will be dealt with after the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal appears, it will naturally be a great encouragement to those who see the necessity for Irish shipping companies and for an Irish mercantile marine to start such enterprises if there is a lairage which is independent of the existing companies and which can be utilised by such concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite understand the point of view of the last speaker when, after asserting&mdash;and to my mind asserting quite accurately&mdash;that the motion was, first of all, peculiarly worded, as Deputy O'Hanlon himself confessed, and, secondly, saying that it was unfortunate in the time of its appearance and that it might have awaited the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, then announcing that he will vote for it, particularly on the question of berthage which, he added, the Port and Harbours Tribunal Report is likely to deal with.  I think that this might well have been left over until we had seen what the <Col N="119" /> Ports and Harbours Tribunal had to say on this vexed question as to whether or not the Port and Docks Board had refused at any time berthage facilities to people who had a right to demand them, and who had in fact demanded them, who did not merely make a complaint as to what would happen if a demand were put forward.</P>
      <P>There is a long history attaching to this motion, much longer even than the thirteen months during which Deputy O'Hanlon has had it on the Order Paper.  There was a resolution passed by the Cattle Traders' Association. As a result of that, resolutions were sent to my Department, and to the Department of the Minister for Agriculture, and we endeavoured to get in touch with the Cattle Traders' Association on several occasions.  On one occasion, complaints which they put forward in a vague way were referred to in a letter which went back to them, and we asked them for a detailed statement giving the occasions on which demands were put up to the Port and Docks Board and to the railway companies in regard to the provision of lairage accommodation.  We also asked them to state whether they received answers to their demands and whether they regarded them as satisfactory. We received no reply. Eventually, there was a resolution in the Seanad and it was deferred at my request, so that a conference might be arranged between the Port and Docks Board, the Cattle Traders' Association, and the two Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not possible to hold that conference for certain reasons mainly because the Cattle Traders' Association did not put forward particulars which we believed they had in their possession.  Finally, the matter came to a head when a Senator moved a resolution in the Seanad similar to that now before us.  He asked me to state what had happened since the previous motion had been considered, about a year previously. I detailed the circumstances, which were, briefly, these: I had again written to the Chairman <Col N="120" /> of the Cattle Traders' Association asking for certain information, and I got back a letter.  The whole correspondence is in the Report of the Seanad for the 28th March, 1928.  I think I can summarise it by saying that I asked them for data which they had not got, although it was data which any reasonable man would see was in his possession before he made the charges on which the resolution was founded.  The resolution in an amended form, it being agreed by everybody that it committed nobody to anything, was passed.</P>
    <P>As a result of that resolution, I tried to get in touch with the Senator who moved it.  Certain elections intervened, but afterwards it was taken up and I was told not to bother about it as the Cattle Traders' Association had a scheme for improving the lairages at the North Wall which they wanted to put before the Minister for Agriculture, that when that was discussed their reasons would be given as to why the lairages should be erected, and that if accommodation was provided they believed that the whole freight question would ease itself. No such scheme was, however, put before the Minister for Agriculture, and all we have now is this resolution in similar terms to that discussed in the Seanad.  I am glad that it comes before us, because on many occasions the Cattle Traders' Association put themselves forward as complainants, mainly against the Dublin Port and Docks Board, in their attitude to the questions of berthage and lairage, and sometimes they joined, as co-defendants, the railway companies owing to certain land which the railway companies are said to own near the North Wall and of which the Cattle Traders' Association asked a certain grant which had been refused.</P>
    <P>The Cattle Traders' Association are the complainants.  They say that they have evidence on three items, namely, freights, lairage accommodation and berthage facilities.  One would expect that the case would be made in some detail and not merely described in the vague <Col N="121" /> phrase, quoted by Deputy Moore, of the Senator who moved the resolution in the Seanad, namely, that there are pens where animals are inadequately kept and where they gore each other during the night. That is the statement.  One would have expected some comparison between the lairage accommodation in other places and the accommodation provided here.  One would have expected, further, a statement from somebody in support of the Cattle Traders' Association that there is ground somewhere more suitable for lairages and that it is in the possession of somebody who was asked to give it, but who refused that request.  Further, the reasons given for the refusal should be stated.  People would then have an opportunity of judging whether or not the reasons given were sound.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient merely to say that freights are too high.  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned 100 per cent. over 1914, and Deputy Moore interjected by saying 200 per cent., but he refrained from saying 200 per cent. when he came to speak.  I have vague figures given by the Cattle Traders' Association, and I have very detailed figures given by the Coast Lines Company, the British and Irish Company.  Until the Cattle Traders' Association can be got to come into conference and disprove the detailed figures given by the British and Irish Company, these figures must hold.  I do not say that they are correct, but I say that in the absence of rebuttal they must take pride of place.  One would have to consider, in addition, the statement that the rates were nearly 200 per cent. more than in 1914. That might be established by evidence, but the fact that it was established would not necessarily prove that the freights are unjust, that they are hampering trade.  It might be deplorable from the point of view of the cattle trade, but by proving that they are 200 per cent. higher you do not prove that they are exorbitant.  One thing has been alluded to here in the course of the debate, and it should be alluded to very often, namely, the chartering <Col N="122" /> of the &ldquo;Brussels,&rdquo; what befell the &ldquo;Brussels,&rdquo; and why it was bought at a price which, according to the Senator who moved the resolution, was 500 times the value which any reasonable man could put on it. Competition, in other words, was to be bought off by buying the &ldquo;Brussels&rdquo; and by granting directorships to certain people interested in it. The payment of that money was one way of getting rid of competition. It was one way in which people recouped themselves for their loss.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy O'Hanlon&mdash; although he did not state it, it was implied in his speech&mdash;the reasons for joining the question of suitable lairage accommodation and berthage facilities with that of freights were, as expressed previously by Senator Counihan, that the cattle trade wanted to charter ships so as to get into competition with the shipping companies, but that they could not do that unless they had some place to detain the cattle for inspection. They accordingly must have proper berthage facilities and facilities for the speedy loading and discharge of whatever vessels come in at their behest.  Let us take it that that is the aim of the resolution.  I suggest to the Deputy that the resolution should not suggest that the Government should confer with the persons named in it.  I do not think that there is any necessity for a resolution of that sort.  I invited the Cattle Traders' Association in three letters, and openly in debate on two occasions, to come along with the figures. I invited them to take part in a conference over which the Minister for Agriculture was to preside in the presence of the other parties concerned to thrash out the whole question in regard to freights, to get a proper comparison with 1914, to give cases where reasonable facilities for lairage accommodation were unreasonably withheld, also whether better berthage accommodation could be provided, and at whose expense it should be provided.  Without any resolution, I again throw out that invitation to the Cattle Traders' Association, and if they like to join <Col N="123" /> with the Dublin Commissioners there is a room big enough to hold the lot. As I say, repeated attempts have been made to get the Cattle Traders' Association to put forward detailed statements in letters so that detailed examination could be made of their figures, and they were invited to meet the railway people.  I think that they met the railway and shipping companies on one occasion, but generally their attitude is that taken up in the letter read in the Seanad. I wrote to them.  They stated that the information which I wanted was not in their possession, although it should really have been the foundation for the particular complaints they made.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>When the debate stopped at seven o'clock, I was dealing with certain statements made by Deputy Boland to a Chief Superintendent who interviewed him and Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly. The statement was this:</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland said that it had leaked out on the Friday before the murder that the late Minister had threatened to take drastic disciplinary action against certain members of the C.I.D. and that this action was resented by the higher authorities of the police and that a climax had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was put forward by Deputy Boland as the reason for the assassination of the late Minister for Justice. <Col N="124" /> He linked it up with what he said this afternoon and what he said in a previous debate.  He linked it up with the findings in the Waterford case and the punishment meted out by the Minister in the Waterford case.  I have already stated what the punishments were&mdash;two superintendent cautioned, one superintendent transferred.  The most serious sentence imposed and the most serious condemnation given out, was one sergeant severely reprimanded with record, warned for reduction, reverted to uniformed force and transferred from the Division. Another sergeant was transferred from the Division; a detective officer severely reprimanded with record, warned for dismissal and transferred from the Division; another detective officer severely reprimanded with record, warned for dismissal and transferred from the Division.  Now from the back benches of Fianna Fáil even, I heard murmurs that these sentences were too light; that heavier and more drastic punishment ought to have been meted out.  Yet Deputy Boland said, in effect, that these punishments were sufficiently strong and severe, that though they happened in January, 1927, and the acts were committed in January, 1927, they were a cause, or a possible cause, for the murder of the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Boland continuing, said that the late Minister had been ruthless in dealing with certain members of the Army who were no ornament to the Army.  He mentioned this as an instance to show the late Minister's strength in dealing with either the Army or the Police.  He went on to say that any detective investigating a crime looks for a motive, and he stated that in his opinion there was sufficient motive in the indiscipline of the Gárda to justify an inquiry into the state of affairs in the Gárda on the Friday previous to the crime.  He stated that no inquiry had been held, and that he and his Party were not satisfied that there had been full investigation of the crime in the absence of such inquiry.  He said that in his opinion a prima facie case existed in the state of affairs in the Gárda to justify the arrest of certain members of same for the murder, and that there existed a sufficient motive in the threatened disciplinary action for the murder by the disaffected members of the &lsquo;C.I.D.&rsquo; I asked him to name one of these, and he replied: &lsquo;Neligan knows a good deal about it.&rsquo;  Mr. Boland stated that his view was held extensively throughout the country by different classes and by members of different political parties.  I asked him if he had anything more definite than the motive alleged by him, and he said he had not.  He said that the Government Party had attributed the crime to his Party, and that his Party felt they were justified in making the charges contained in his and their speeches, but that their charges <Col N="127" /> are not by way of &lsquo;You're another,&rsquo; but were well founded.

      <P>I have not finished the interview yet.  Deputy O'Kelly drags in for a moment a delightfully interesting interlude. &ldquo;Mr. O'Kelly then said that he had made very full inquiries from Republican sources and that he was satisfied that the crime was not committed by Republicans. Mr. Boland agreed.&rdquo; That is a very interesting statement. It shows a very nice state of affairs. Here is Deputy O'Kelly, and he goes <Col N="128" /> round to all the potential murderers, all actual murderers that he knows, and says to them, &ldquo;Did you murder Deputy O'Higgins, or do you know who murdered the late Minister for Justice?&rdquo; He goes round in this fashion, and gently and simply he thinks that those persons are going to tell him &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>He thinks that the guilty persons are going to make a confession of guilt to him. Now, if that is correct, what type of man is Deputy O'Kelly himself? What type of person is the Deputy who sits second in command of the Fianna Fáil Party?  He is the sort of person, according to himself, to whom the murderer with absolute impunity can admit that he has committed murder.  What else does that mean?  If those persons who he thought had committed, or possibly could have committed, this murder had told him: &ldquo;Oh, yes, it was done by us,&rdquo; would he have given the information?  It must have been one or the other.  I think he must have thought that they would trust him, and trust him implicitly.  If a murderer was willing to inform him and say &ldquo;Yes, I committed the murder,&rdquo; what type of man must Deputy O'Kelly be?  And because he goes round to certain Republicans and asks them, and they plead not guilty, then of course Republicans, in his view and in Deputy Boland's view, are not guilty.  A simple plea is sufficient to satisfy them.  I will go on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Both Mr. Boland and Mr. O'Kelly said that as far as they knew the investigation of the trial was a one-sided affair and confined to inquiries made about Republicans, some of whom were arrested, including persons who were at present members of the Dáil.  I informed them that our enquiries had covered every section of the community.  Mr. Boland nodded approval of that, but suggested that inquiries should be made as to the whereabouts of the C.I.D. <Col N="129" /> members on the morning of the murder.  I said that we knew where every member was on that morning, and he said that he was not aware of that.  Mr. Boland said that it was significant that the detective who was guarding the Minister turned back to the house before the shooting.  I informed him that that was an unfortunate circumstance, but that there was nothing in the suggestion.  Messrs. Boland and O'Kelly finished by saying that this was all they had to tell us and we parted.  Both treated us during the interview in a friendly and courteous manner. I did not proceed to take written statements from them as the substance of their statements did not warrant same.  I beg to add that the interview does not advance the investigation of the crime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we had this definite statement made in the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some of the men responsible for the murder of Kevin O'Higgins are in the employment and pay of those men and not one of them has been tried or arrested for it.  These are deliberate statements. I am speaking with a sense of responsibility.  I know what I am talking about.  I know these men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He knows all this, and can state definitely that he knows that the late Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I gave this quotation before, a Chinn Comhairle. It is from Vol. 29, No. 5 of the Official Debates, column 1832.  That is what Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly says in this House.  That is the nature of the charge which he brings against the Guards in this House.  He is asked to give us evidence and to show how he reached that conclusion. He is asked that by a responsible police officer who goes to him to see if Deputy O'Kelly, having made a statement like that, can give any information which would be helpful to the investigation of the crime. Clearly and definitely as Deputy <Col N="130" /> Seán T. O'Kelly spoke, when it is all over one of the most able officers in the Civic Guard sums up the whole interview in these words: &ldquo;I beg to add that the interview does not advance the investigation of the crime.&rdquo;  Here are all those charges by Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, here are all the charges made by Deputy Boland against the Civic Guards in this connection, and where do they all end? They all end in smoke.  There was nothing got from them but a possibly suggested motive, and that is the type of charge against the Civic Guards that the Fianna Fáil Party are ready and willing to bring, and then they complain that their charges are treated with contumely.  Here was a definite statement that could be of assistance to the Guards, and when it is investigated by an officer of the Guards, who goes to see the Deputies, what is the result?  Not a single bit of information is at their disposal, and not a single bit of information which they could give. That is the type of their charges, and they complain that people who act in that fashion are treated with contumely when they act in fashions similar to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated clearly what has happened, and that these persons outside the House know that they cannot carry on their conspiracies and that they cannot carry out their crimes unless they shake the morale of the Guards.  I have stated that every single thing, in my judgment, that Fianna Fáil could do inside this House to help them Fianna Fáil is doing.  We are told by the great advocate of peace and the rest of his Party, perhaps, that there is no alliance between those gunmen outside the House and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, acting as they are.  Why are they in communication with those persons?  The other day Deputy Derrig told us, when he was talking on the Juries Bill, that under sub-section (6) of Section 8 of the Juries Bill certain persons can be excluded, that is, persons known to be or suspected of being concerned or associated in acts of intimidation <Col N="131" /> of jurors or witnesses, or acts of a treasonable or seditious character, or otherwise hostile to law, peace and good order, or is known to associate with persons concerned, and so on. The Deputy said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the question of association, I should like to ask Deputies should not the fact that you give an officer of the Gárda the right to have a Press representative excluded by reason of the character of certain issues of a paper with which he is connected in a certain way, be sufficient without dragging in here another provision by which many of us on this side of the House, at any rate, could be excluded from court if we went there as Press representatives?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no friendship, no alliance at all between this I.R.A. and Fianna Fáil.  Oh, no, none at all. No friendship, no alliance at all. Yet Deputy Derrig says you are in such close communication&mdash;some of them&mdash;that though you are in daily and close communication with them you hate their policy and you hate their aims.</P>

I say that anybody who attempts by force to upset the existing State is a criminal. I say if you are in daily association with them and encouraging them that you are encouraging and association with criminals.</P>

      <P>There is one Government in the Irish Free State, and it is the only Government in the Free State.  Is there going to be in the Free State one Government and only one Government?  At the present moment should there be two Governments?  That is the main issue between our Party and the Opposition. We say there is one Government and one Government only. There is one Executive and one Executive only, and that is the Executive appointed by the representatives of the Irish people in this Dáil by this Dáil.  We say there is one law-making and only one lawmaking power, in this country, and that is the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State.  On the other hand we have it from the Deputies opposite that there are two.</P>

      <P>I am here. I want an answer to my question. We had the statement from Deputy de Valera, which I have quoted before, that the other persons who carry on are the successors of the Government of which he was a member up to 1925.  Has he ever said that was an illegitimate or improper Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted the passage, but at the moment I have not got the volume by me.  I will quote it again.  I put it to Deputy de Valera, did not that mean that the persons outside, this handful of men outside, were the real de jure Government of this country? When I challenged him on that he ran away.  What is the Party opposite doing the whole time except this, coming into this Dáil and swearing allegiance to the institutions of this existing State, and then praising up as the real, true Irish patriots the persons who have not come in, the persons who are daily committing outrages, and that is the real difference between us and the Party opposite.  We state clearly and definitely that here in this House there is one authority and one authority only, and the laws made by that authority and the courts established by that authority, everybody in this State must obey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do Deputies opposite say that?  I should like to hear a single one of them say that.  I have not heard them say it yet; I have heard the very opposite.  There are those persons outside and everybody in the House knows it.  They have got their arms and they are endeavouring to organise themselves so that they may use <Col N="134" /> these arms.  We know that, and everybody in the House knows it. What is the attitude of Deputies opposite to that?  Do they encourage us when we, through the Guards, preserve peace and order in this country?  Do they give us any encouragement or any help, or do they give any discouragement to those persons outside who are claiming powers independent of this Oireachtas? Never inside this House have I heard them discourage those persons, or tell them that they were acting criminally and wrongly when they endeavoured to upset this State.</P>
    <P>We have a position in this country which must be faced, not shirked, as Deputies would have it shirked, by patience.  Let us have patience, they say.  Let us shirk it by patience; let anything that they like be done, but carry on with patience.  That is not our attitude.  We will not shirk our difficulties; we will overcome our difficulties.  We will not have patience with criminals.  It was stated by the President here that we would have no patience with crime, and we will have no patience with crime, and we will have no toleration for crime.  We are going to make this country safe for every law-abiding person.  We are going to make it safe for every juryman who does his duty and for every witness who honestly gives evidence according to his conscience.  We will make this country safe for persons of that class, and for law-abiding citizens.</P>

The Deputy unfortunately did not, in the beginning of his speech at any rate, speak very loudly, and I could not catch his opening sentences.  I do not know whether he mentioned the name of any person as having given him that <Col N="135" /> information.  As far as I could hear, he did not give the name of the person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>I understood that if charges were brought against persons in this House the names of the persons charged should not be given, but that if charges were brought, the names of the persons bringing the charges could be given, and they are frequently given from the Fianna Fáil Benches. That certainly was what I understood. As regards what Deputy Flinn has stated, that Deputy Goulding offered to give the name at the beginning of his speech, I have already stated that I could not catch what Deputy Goulding said at the beginning of his speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is this charge?  It is that in the year 1926 somebody was in a Gárda barracks and overheard a conversation between two Guards; that the Guards indulged in the most extraordinary conversation in the presence of this person.  I do not know how this person got into the barrack.  That, at any rate, could be told to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">

      <P>In the presence of this person the Guards, in 1926, are supposed to have had <Col N="137" /> this extraordinary conversation, and to have actually stated to each other how they had been guilty of crimes the night before.  That impossible, incredible, ridiculous story is brought up three years afterwards in the Dáil.  Three years afterwards Deputy Goulding gets a hold of it and produces that, on its face, absolutely incredible story: that in the presence of some paid person&mdash;I suppose the cleaner of the barrack or something of that kind; I do not know whom else it could apply to&mdash; the Guards were supposed to say to each other that they committed crimes the night before, how they fired into a house and all that.  Does any sane person think that a story like that, three years old, brought up now, is of the slightest weight or credence?  Not only that, but we have again the Newport case.</P>

There were a number of appeals, and one case is now before the Courts for the fourth time.

There was a decree for £5 damage given by Judge Sealy.  That was appealed against, in the ordinary way, to Dublin. There was no dispute as to the facts. But there was in that case a very real question of law at issue.  The question was this: The door was broken in, in searching for arms.  The Superintendent was engaged in the search.  He could have, on his own written order, searched the house, and was entitled to break open the door on his own written order.  He did not go through the formality of writing out an order.  He simply went there without his own written order.  If he had written it five minutes before it would be all right, but he did not do so.  He went there in search of firearms.</P>

Action could only be taken for breaking down the door of the house.  The serious part of the case is not that, but the bogus attack on the barrack.</P>

      <P>The statement that there was an attack made on the barrack by the Guards is absolutely absurd.  It is said that the sergeant and his men fired at <Col N="140" /> the barrack in which were his own wife and children.  Does anyone believe that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That question was not suggested and did not come up for issue in any way in the case to which Deputies referred. As I said, on this breaking in of the door, it was held on appeal that the Superintendent was not, in law, entitled to break open this door, because he had not written out for himself his warrant.  It was a very small point and a technical point, but the courts have held it and we must take that to be the law.  There was no dispute as to the facts. It was upon that ground that the case was appealed, and it went to only one appeal.  That was the only case that that man Gleeson had, just as Caplis had only one case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The result was that it was held on appeal that the Superintendent, in not having his own written authority, acted illegally.  It was held that through a technical mistake made by the Superintendent&mdash;a mistake that anyone could have fallen into&mdash;he could have written out his authority to search, but that he considered unnecessary because he was there in person acting himself.  I think that was a mistake that the Superintendent might easily have fallen into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with two cases.  The Deputy's arithmetic is very bad.  One and one make two, and I hope the Deputy will bear that little bit of information in mind, because he does not seem to know it up to this.  I have already replied, in the absence of Deputy O'Connell, in connection with the matter he raised, but as he is here now I will take this opportunity of again informing him, because he seems to have been misinformed, on the organisation of the Gárda force.  Deputy O'Connell talked of something which he called the C.I.D.  There is no such force in this country as the C.I.D.  There is one body of Guards only.  There is the uniformed force and there is the Detective Branch, which do not wear uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the same body, the same force and under the same control. The officers are uniformed officers, and it is to them that the detective branch is responsible.  They have control of the detective branch; over them, of course, is the same headquarters staff and the same commission. Some of them specialise in one class of work, others of them specialise in another class of work, but they are the identical body under identical control.  There is no difference between them, and it is as much the duty of uniformed men to detect all sorts of crime as it is the duty of plain clothes men.  Uniformed men must use their abilities to detect crime, and a class of crime they are not specialised in they are not sent out specially to investigate. If they have any possible opportunities of checking crime, of arresting when crime is done, it is as much their duty to do so as it is the duty of any member of the plain clothes forces.  They are the same united <Col N="142" /> body, transferable one from the other.  That is to say, a uniformed man may be moved into the plain clothes force, the detective branch, or a detective may be moved into the uniformed branch, according as the peculiar abilities of the man make him suited for one branch more than the other.  Deputy O'Connell fell in with the suggestion which Deputy Lemass made, that men who are in the Guards and were prominent during the civil war should not be continued in the detective branch of the Guards.  I cannot really follow Deputy O'Connell's reasoning in that.  These men proved themselves to be really the best stuff in the State.  They were men who saved this State when it was attacked, who built up this State, and helped to carry the State out of real danger into the position of almost perfect security we have at the present day, and those are men who should not be slighted, who should not be turned down at a time when their abilities and energies are still required. Those men helped to save the State, and those men, in the position in which they now are, are doing fine work to preserve the State; they are thoroughly well suited in ability and in knowledge to the positions which they hold, and they are doing their work in those positions admirably.  That, I think, was one of the main things which was troubling Deputy O'Connell.  Were they there because of their abilities or not?  They are there because they do their work thoroughly, and they are the right type of men to carry on the duties which they are now discharging.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion made by Deputy Lemass, that the Ministry of Justice should be an external Ministry.  I wonder if Deputy Lemass regards this House as a serious House, if he regards the Oireachtas as the real ruling authority in this country to be taken seriously, if he thinks Irish public life is to be taken seriously, or whether he takes the whole thing as a sort of Gilbert and Sullivan opera business when he makes a suggestion that the Minister for Justice should be an <Col N="143" /> external Minister, that is to say, that in performing the most important duty which any State can have, the preservation of order, which is the first duty of every civilised Government, the Executive Council are not to have any voice; the Minister responsible for the preservation of order is not to be a member of the Executive Council.  He is to be an external Minister.  The Government for the time being is not to have anything to do with the preservation of order.  Some individual, an external Minister, is to have it, responsible only to the Dáil, the Executive not having a word to say, and Deputy Lemass puts that forward, if you please, as a serious proposition.  Deputy Lemass shows his real gift for statesmanship when he puts forward a proposition so grotesque as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit the Minister has made a better case for it than I did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I may make a better case for it than Deputy Lemass made because I am perfectly certain that it is past the wit of man to make a worse case than the Deputy did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take this Department of Justice. Take the Guards and the work they are doing.  They are doing the most important work in the State.  Nobody can question that.  They are preserving order in this State.  They are preserving civilisation in this State&mdash; that is in danger if the Guards are not here to preserve it.  What would one expect from the Party opposite, from any Party with any sense of responsibility or duty to themselves, their constituents or their country, except that, whole-heartedly, they would fling themselves behind that force in preserving law?  They would not be under the suspicion even of being opposed to the preservation of law and peace.  That is what one would expect from any Party in any civilised state.  What do we get here?  We get the tentative offer of Deputy Lemass: if you do something then we will help you in suppressing ordinary crime, but in no circumstances will we help you in carrying <Col N="144" /> out your efforts to preserve this State. I cannot quote the Deputy's words, because I have not seen the official report of this particular debate yet.  I do not know whether it is out or not.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, if he looks through it, will find his own words there all right, and will find that his words are precisely the words I am attributing to him. Does the Deputy now say that he and his Party are willing to fling themselves whole-heartedly behind the Guards in the prevention of every single class of crime in this country? If he does, then he will have made a very big step forward and will have added enormously to the reputation of his Party in the eyes of all persons who have the interest of this country at heart.</P>

I did not hear the statement that the Minister for Justice read out giving an account of an interview between a Chief Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, Deputy Boland and myself. I was not here.  Therefore, I do not wish to comment on it, but I have heard that the Minister, when he was giving the grounds for the interview quoted my words from the official report.  I want to make a personal explanation with regard to one sentence in that report.  I said I know these men.  The men I had in mind were the gentlemen opposite, one the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the other the Minister for Defence.  I did not make that as clear as it ought to have been made in the official report, but at the time I made a gesture by pointing to the men opposite.</P>

      <P>I take it when one account of the interview has been published that I am entitled to give my version of it, as complete a statement <Col N="145" /> of it as I can possibly' give.  I was not present when the interview with Deputy O'Kelly began.  After about five minutes I came on the scene.  I said I was glad to see that they were still active in the direction of finding the people who had murdered the late Minister for Justice and that I thought I would be able to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the political section of the C.I.D.  I did not say at any time that I knew who did it.  Neither did I say that Neligan knows, but I said it is believed that Neligan knows and that I believed it and still believe it.  I must say that most of the report that was read out by the Minister was correct.  There was one word used by the Superintendent which is attributed to me.  I am sure he will not deny that he used it.  I proceeded to establish the case.  I said it was well known that the late Minister had taken very definite and drastic action against certain people who had disgraced the Army.  This is not in the report. He did not stop at the Minister.  He went right down the ranks.  Everybody knew he was a man who kept his word.  He did what he said he would do.  It was at this stage that the smaller of the two officers said &ldquo;Yes, he was a ruthless man.&rdquo;  I am absolutely certain of that.  I consulted Deputy O'Kelly on the matter.  I believe it was the smaller of the two who used the word.  His name is Brennan.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Boland, continuing, said that the late Minister had been ruthless in dealing with certain members of the Army who were no ornament to the Army.  He mentioned this as an instance to show the late Minister's strength in dealing with either the Army or the Police.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="146" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He supplied the word &ldquo;ruthless&rdquo;; I never used it. I said it was common knowledge.  I quoted a phrase of the Minister that I had knowledge, without strictly legal proof, that a certain situation existed, due to these Waterford beatings on the Friday before the Minister was killed.  That was common knowledge.  I asked him was it not so.  He did not deny it.  Neither the Minister nor anyone else denied my statement of the 14th March till tonight. Then when he was challenged he did not say he was denying it of his own knowledge; he said he was referring to the files of his Department. When I was speaking of this evidence the Minister or nobody else denied the statement I made on 14th March, that such a position did exist in the Police Force, that the heads of the Police Force were about to be dealt with in the same way as the heads of the Army had been dealt with by the same gentleman.  I I went a bit further, and this is coming down to an individual.  I said it is rather hard on one particular man.  He said that he was sent back on that fatal morning.  There was no one there to contradict him. I said I was going to supply some motive for the crime on the part of these people, and that it would be well worth those gentlemen's while to investigate it.  I said also that had a similar situation existed with regard to any civilians they would have been arrested and put through the third degree, just as the Republican people who had been arrested had been put through it, those who were taken in the raids. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to get into these people's hands knows all about it.  I asked him could he say if they had been to those people.  The man who did all the talking, the smaller of the two, said he could assure me that they had investigated this thing fully; that they had examined amongst others ex-Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about that, the Minister wanted to know whether, if Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly himself were making inquiries, he would be so simple as to expect people to say <Col N="147" />&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when asked if he murdered the late Minister.  Was the Minister so simple as to expect ex-Guards to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?  I had no suspicion whatever about ex-Guards, and I made no suggestion that any ex-Guards had anything to do with it. What I said was that the conduct of these people who had declined to be ex-Guards and who were determined to remain in the Police Force should be investigated.</P>
    <P>When I had finished I said to the police officer I think I have made a pretty good case from the point of view of motive.  This is almost verbatim, as far as a man's memory can go, and they were relying on memory too.  I said it was not a question of ex-Guards at all, that they were people who were still in the force and who were determined to remain in it.  I asked: &ldquo;Is not that a pretty good <i>prima facie</i> case from the point of view of motive?&rdquo; The Minister does not think so.  If there was half of that against any civilians I tell you they would have been tried. He admitted there was, but he said: &ldquo;Motive is not the thing; you have got to bring the people on the scene.&rdquo;  I said I am not in charge of the Police Force, but if I were I certainly would have investigated the movements of these people on that particular morning.  I would have started with the gentleman who said he was sent back.  I would have followed up that gentleman.  I made that case just to show these men that, in my opinion, there was a <i>prima facie</i> case against this particular section of the Guards.  I said that I established definite motive. There was no contradiction of the statement I made, that this situation existed in the Police Force until to-day. Therefore, I presume that I was entitled still to believe that such a situation did exist.  I think any fair-minded man will admit that. That is as far as I went as to the motive that might exist in this section of the Police Force.  I went further to show why there should be no motive amongst Republicans, why no Republican should wish for the murder of the late Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I said&mdash;this is not stated in the interview, but I am sure these gentlemen will not deny it&mdash;that Republicans were very pleased with the action the late Minister for Justice took in ridding the Army of the people who committed some of the worst crimes, and against whom we certainly had the biggest grievance; that any objection or any grievances that we had against the late Minister for Justice were due only to his talk, the talk he used both in this House and outside it; that we were quite satisfied with that, because we always got an opportunity of meeting him with the same weapons; that is, talking against him, and that we were quite prepared to deal with that.  I asked these people why should we, or anyone on our behalf or any Republican, wish to kill a man who had rid the Army of the people who had been our greatest enemies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was not a question of a simple plea being sufficient with us.  I showed that there was an absence of any motive; that no motive had yet been shown by anyone as to why any Republican should do it, but I supplied the motive on the other side.  The only thing missing was that I could not put these men on the scene.  How could I do it?  I told them I was quite prepared to help them and they will admit that. As far as I can see the position these gentlemen are officials and there was enough put into the report of the interview to make the Minister's case.  It probably was edited.  I am not going to deny that these officers <Col N="149" /> said that they knew where these people were on that particular morning, but I do not recollect that.  They may have said it.  I will not deny that they said that, but I do not recollect their having said it.  I do say this much that I did say that I would feel very happy to be convinced that these people whom I suspected and whom a good many others suspected, had nothing to do with it.  Everyone on this side would certainly feel very happy at that.  I am not going to comment on the rest of the Minister's speech.  I would like another opportunity of doing that.

I was not kicked out of the Army.  The late Minister for Justice did not ask me to resign my Commission from the Army.  I resigned my Commission of my own act.

The motion which has been decided by the House was that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  That is a very different matter.  I am submitting this as a point of order, a point that may be considered to be already decided, but I am raising it in order that we may be perfectly clear.  One was a Vote for money, and the suggestion behind the proposal to refer it back for reconsideration was precisely that it should be reconsidered. In other words, it was a matter which might be reconsidered in view of the debate which has taken place&mdash;a motion which the Government could accept.</P>

It was by you stated that that right had never been denied, and that it need not be asserted.  That right I now claim to speak upon the motion that this Vote be rejected.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very much difference has taken place in the ordinary arrangements and details of the working of the Gárda Síochána since the Estimate was before the Dáil not so very long ago.  The main difference which Deputies will notice on looking through the Estimates is that a reduction in the Guards' allowances is estimated for. That reduction we debated in this House comparatively recently.  The reduction consists principally in a cutting off of the allowance made to the Guards for boots and also a reduction in the allowance for cycling. These were the main grounds of reduction. I am not going into that now because it was fully dealt with recently.  The only matter to which I might draw the attention of the House is that this year we anticipate there will be a certain reduction in other respects in the Gárda Vote, because recruiting has been entirely stopped for this year.  We anticipate a certain saving under that head. The annual wastage in the Guards is roughly about 200, and this year we are not filling any portion of that wastage.  It must not be thought <Col N="159" /> that the policy which we are adopting this year in not filling up wastage is a policy which can be pressed very far.  In the present condition of the country, and taking into account the various and manifold duties which the Guards have to perform, it is almost impossible to shut up any of the existing stations, because as soon as an attempt is made to do so, the inhabitants get into a state of fever and excitement, every single one of them complaining that they have not got the proper protection which they should have, that small pilfering can go on, that their turf, eggs and little bits of property are not safe unless the district is regularly patrolled by Guards from the vicinity. I do not anticipate in the near future any large reduction in the strength of the Guards, or any large diminution in the number of stations. Setting off the reductions we have made against the annual increment which, of course, put the pay up, the total decrease this year is £29,065.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head A shows an increase of £5,752.  The annual increments payable to the members of the force would ordinarily have caused an increase of about £28,000 on this sub-head. Last January, however, the Executive Council decided to suspend all recruiting for the Gárda Síochána, and it is not intended that recruiting shall recommence, at all events during the current financial year.  As a result the vacancies which are being caused by resignations, deaths, and dismissals are not now being filled.  The normal annual wastage through these causes may be taken at about 200, so that by the end of the financial year the strength of the force will be less by that figure than the numbers shown in the printed Estimates.  It will be observed that in consequence of this decision it is estimated that a sum of £25,975 will be saved during the year, and a deduction of that amount has been taken in arriving at the total for this sub-head.  It may appear at the first glance that the arithmetic is a little defective, but the reason is that all the 200 Guards do not resign on <Col N="160" /> the first day of the year and, therefore, there is not a saving on the complete pay of each man for the year.  Some may resign, say, when there is only a month to go, so that there would be only one month's saving of their pay, and in other cases, for some short periods, there will be a certain number of places not filled up.  That explains the particular figure in the sub-head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B shows a decrease of £20,800 below the corresponding figure for last year.  This reduction was made possible by a revision of the allowances payable to members of the force, as I have already told Deputies.  Had this revision not taken place the sub-head would have shown an increase of more than £7,000 on the figure for last year, owing to the increase in the number of married men drawing rent allowances.</P>
    <P>The revised Allowance Order, which came into operation on the 1st April, provided, however, for the discontinuance of the payment of boot allowance, thus effecting an annual saving of over £27,000.  The allowance payable to men engaged as motor drivers or mechanics, shown in the printed Estimates as being at the rate of £18 per annum, has been reduced to £15 per annum.  Sub-head C. The rates of subsistence allowance payable to members of the force necessarily absent on duty from their stations for prolonged periods were revised by the recent Allowance Order.  As a result of this revision, the amount of this sub-head has been reduced by £600 below the figure for last year.  Sub-head D., Locomotion expenses, shows a decrease of £19,250 below the figure for 1928-29.  Of this figure a saving of £13,500 is being effected by the reduction in the rate of cycling allowance payable to sergeants and Guards from £5 per annum to £2 10s. per annum.  It is hoped to save about £4,000 by a revision of the allowances payable to officers and inspectors for using their own cars on official duties.  Hitherto these allowances have been paid on a mileage basis, and the question of revising this basis of payment is at present under consideration.  For <Col N="161" /> that reason Deputies will understand that £4,000 is the best estimate we could make.  We cannot guarantee that the £4,000 will prove accurate. Sub-head E shows a decrease of £1,459 below the figure for last year. In the other sub-heads from F to L there are only slight variations. Turning to sub-head M, this shows an increase of £1,810, due to the increased number of stations at which telephones have been installed by the Post Office.  Of a total of about 840 stations outside Dublin, a considerable number have been already provided with telephones.  I have not got the exact figure at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, understand that for the carrying out of police duties a telephone is most useful by enabling one barrack to communicate with another.  I would like to see every barrack with a telephone, especially for the detection of crime.  In the case of a bank robbery, for instance, where a man may have been observed escaping, it would be very helpful if the nearest barrack were rung up and given that information, as it would probably lead to the robber's arrest. Sub-heads N and O call for no special observations.  In regard to sub-head P, it is estimated that the Appropriations-in-Aid of this Vote for the present year will be £6,570 less than the amount for last year. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the police rate in the Dublin Metropolitan area will be at the rate of 4d. in the £ as against 5d. in the £ for last year.  This reduction was provided for by Section 16 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, which enacted that the amount of the rate should be reduced annually by one penny in the £ from its original figure of 8d. in the £, until finally extinguished in the year 1933.  These are the only figures in the Estimate that I think I need mention.  As regards the numbers in the Guards, rates of pay, comparisons with pre-war strength of the police force, and so forth, all these matters were fully gone into six months ago, and I think that all the figures were fully dealt with <Col N="162" /> then.  The costs were gone into, and I think that I would only be wasting the time of the House if I repeated what I said a short time ago.  I realise that the House does not want me to re-say what I said on that occasion.  In introducing this Estimate, I do not think that I have any further remarks to make.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The Minister has come before the House with figures practically similar, as regards personnel and strength, to those which he brought before us in connection with last year's Estimate.  Last November figures were given by me and other Deputies showing that the country was over-policed, that a much smaller force might be equally efficient and equally effective.  I am not going to go into the question of policy now, as I understand that that has already been ruled out and that we are to confine ourselves on this Vote purely to the administrative side.  I pointed out at that time that the present strength of the Civic Guard for the Twenty-Six Counties, excluding the Dublin Metropolitan area, is practically the same as&mdash;very little short of, at any rate&mdash;that of the R.I.C. in 1918.  I gave the figures at the time to the Minister and stated that the strength of the R.I.C. in 1918 was 9,867 for the whole of the thirty-two counties, excluding the Dublin Metropolitan area, and the cost was £1,443,432. The Minister referred incidentally to-night to the position in the country. I understand what the Minister referred to, but I assume that on this motion I am not entitled to go into it, except to state that I believe that the position in 1918, from the police point of view, could not be described exactly as normal.  I gave particulars at that time to show what was the comparative strength of the police in other countries compared with population.  I showed that in New South Wales it was 1 to 784 of the population; in Scotland 1 to 754 of the population; in England 1 to 831; and in the Free State 1 to 428.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> At that time the Minister for Justice emphasised the many Acts which had been put into operation which imposed extra duties on the Guards.  He also referred to the various Acts which were passed relative to the Department of Agriculture and also to the carrying out of the Census, to the enforcement of the School Attendance Act and so on.  I think, however, if the Minister inquired into the matter he would find that there are very few Acts which impose extra duties on the Guards with the exception of the School Attendance Act, which is not very efficiently administered, according to the reports of the various teaching organisations.  If we take the strength of the Guards at present we find that it is exactly the <Col N="164" /> same as last year.  Are we to assume from the Minister that there has been no change in the conditions of the country since then?  When I quoted figures last year, I was told that the position was not normal and that in the then existing conditions it would be inadvisable to make any reduction in the strength of the force.  Are we to assume that the alleged efficiency of the Guards has not resulted in improving those conditions and that it is necessary to maintain the force at the same strength to-day as when we passed a similar Vote last year?  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>By a decision given on appeal on 9th August, 1926, the pension of this woman was raised from 6/- to 8/- a week.  About 20th April, 1928, she raised a question for a further increase.  The Foxford Pension Sub-Committee proposed an allowance of 10/- a week.  The case came up on appeal, and it was determined on the 9th October, 1928, that the pensioner was not entitled to payment at a higher rate than 8/- a week in view of her means.</P>
