    <P>The total number of applications for retirement received to date is 2,610, of which 2,006 have been disposed of.  Of the latter number, 237 were withdrawn.  I have no information at present to show that further withdrawals may be expected.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill referred to in the question is dependent on the formal signature by representatives of the British Government and the Saorstát Government of the agreement arrived at interpreting and supplementing Article X of the Treaty.  I hope that the agreement will be signed within the next few weeks and the legislation will then be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will make inquiry if any list has been preserved of the persons who made extracts of papers formerly stored in the Record Office; and, if so, whether any steps are being taken to communicate with such persons, with a view to obtaining copies of the extracts in their possession.</P>

      <P>The names of persons who made extracts from documents formerly in the Record Office for genealogical or historical purposes are preserved in registers which commence in 1878.  The registers do not give addresses, but a small number are known where the original permits still exist.  A number of these inquirers have presented to the Office copies and abstracts made by them from the Records and these notes will probably be of interest to future inquirers. An appeal is made in the fifty-fifth Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Records for further similar donations <Col N="1689" /> and, from time to time, requests are sent to individuals who are believed to be in possession of such extracts.</P>
      <P>A very much more important class of copies of Records are the certified copies, many thousands of which were issued annually by the Office.  These were principally issued to solicitors and a very large number must still be in existence. Strong appeals were made, through the Press and through the Incorporated Law Society, to solicitors in possession of such copies to return them to the Record Office, and a promise was given that an official copy of every such document would be given, if required, free of charge to the donor.  The result of the appeals have been somewhat disappointing. Some firms have generously presented large numbers of very valuable documents to the Record Office, officially certified copies of original probates, etc.  If all solicitors had the public spirit to do this, the more modern Records which were in the Record Office could almost be reconstituted on certain sides.  I understand that the Irish Manuscripts Commission proposes to issue an appeal to each solicitor individually concerning documents which may be of historical interest, and I hope that as a result of this appeal more solicitors may be induced to deposit documents in the Public Record Office.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Deputy Keeper addressed a communication to the rector of each parish whose Registers were in the Record Office and were not salved, setting out the Registers destroyed and inquiring whether any copies of them had been preserved.  Transcripts had been made in a number of cases, and some clergymen have very kindly lent their duplicate Registers to enable copies of them to be taken by the Record Office.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that a duly accredited Press representative was excluded by the Gárdaí from a preliminary investigation by a Peace Commissioner of criminal charges against certain persons, held at Tipperary on Tuesday, 23rd April, 1929, and, if so, by whom the exclusion was authorised; whether he is further aware that a report of the proceedings at the investigation referred to was officially supplied to a Dublin newspaper, and whether he will state what was the reason for the discrimination shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The proceedings connected with the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence are not proceedings in open Court, and all members of the public may lawfully be excluded from such proceedings.  In the case to which the Deputy refers&mdash;the armed robbery of the Bank of Ireland at Tipperary&mdash;it was essential in the interests of justice that the public should be excluded, and so far as the exclusion of the public, including Press representatives, was concerned, it was complete and impartial.</P>
      <P>I gather, however, that the complaint is rather that an official report of the proceedings was subsequently furnished to a Dublin paper, and not to the local Press representative.  I am informed that the police gave the local Press representative a brief account of what transpired at the special Court, but, they were so much occupied with the case and their time being limited at the moment, the statement given to the local Press representative was admittedly cursory. The Dublin paper, on the other hand, happened to telephone for information at an hour when the police had more time to spare, and the Dublin paper consequently got a fuller statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted and regretted that in the circumstances the local Press representative got less particulars than the Dublin paper, but there was <Col N="1691" /> no intention to discriminate against anybody.  I may perhaps say that the police acted throughout this case with the most commendable energy, intelligence and courage, and I am sure that the Deputy will agree with me that it would be very regrettable if the only reference made in this House to the case were made by way of apparent censure on a very minor point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I might say that I have nothing but the greatest commendation for the way in which the Guards acted in this particular case. I would ask the Minister whether he would answer that part of my question which asked by whom the exclusion of the Press representatives was authorised, and whether the Gárda, acting on their own, have the right to exclude the public and the Press, or whether that is a function for the presiding Justice or the Peace Commissioner, as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy actually anything about the circumstances as to who made the order, but I can inform the Deputy that it is not a public Court, and, not being a public Court, neither the Press representatives nor any member of the public have a right entitling them to go in there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that when a prisoner is brought up before a Court and charged, and the authorities ask for a remand and offer sufficient evidence to justify a remand, that it is not a public Court and that the Gárda, acting on their own authority, have a right to exclude the public and the Press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Guards should always get an order from the District Justice or Peace Commissioner, as the case may be, who is giving a remand.  But it is not a public Court and such an order can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only answer that I can give is that the report I have before me omits to state that.  I can tell the Deputy that the proper course for the Guards to adopt, and which I assume they adopted in this case, was to get an order from the District Justice or the Peace Commissioner, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that some of the tenants on the J.H. Cronin Estate, in the parish of Killeentierna-Dysert, Co. Kerry, signed agreements in the year 1907 to purchase their holdings under the 1903 Land Act, and agreed to pay 4 per cent. interest in lieu of rent; that these tenants are compelled to pay for a period of 21 years interest in lieu of rent at 4 per cent. instead of the 3¼ per cent. interest on purchase money, and whether he will now state if his Department or the vendors are responsible for the delay in vesting, and whether the difference between the 4 per cent. and the 3¼ will be refunded by the party who is responsible for the delay, the difference in one particular case being £80, and in another eight over £70.</P>

      <P>The sale of the estate of J.H. Cronin, Co. Kerry, E. C. No. 4814, from the vendor direct to the tenants under the provisions of the Land Acts, 1903-1909, was carried through by means of voluntary agreements made between the parties. <Col N="1699" /> The Commissioners vested the lands of the estate in the tenants in accordance with the terms of these agreements. The agreements fixed the purchase moneys of the holdings, and provided that interest in lieu of rent, calculated at the rate of 4 per cent. thereon, should be collected by the Land Commission from the dates on which the agreements were signed to the dates on which the holdings were vested in the tenants.  This was accordingly done and the interest in lieu of rent paid over to the vendor. The delay in vesting the lands of the estate in the tenants was due principally to the inability of the vendor and the tenants to arrive at an agreement on the distribution of the bogs, and the Commissioners, having made several unsuccessful attempts extending over a number of years to effect a settlement of the turbary disputies, finally decided to close the sale of the estate and deal with the distributions of the turbary under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923.  This is being done.</P>

      <P>There is a matter which I wish to raise on a question of privilege&mdash;the privilege which is accorded to members of this House and which was, as I submit, abused in this case.  In the report of last evening's debate on the Juries Bill there is a statement which is on record: Deputy de Valera was speaking, and I said: &ldquo;And have one only wounded.&rdquo;  Mr. Lemass said: &ldquo;You are much more efficient.&rdquo;  Mr. G. Boland then said something, and then Mr. Smith said: &ldquo;He is a proper cur anyway,&rdquo; and Mr. Lemass said: &ldquo;He is all that.&rdquo;  I desire to give an opportunity to the Deputies who made these remarks, possibly in the heat of the moment, to withdraw them now.  As you, sir, understand, this House is a privileged place, and persons can say things here which they dare not say outside.  I regret that Deputy Smith is not here now, but I am sure that Deputy Lemass is prepared to withdraw the suggestion as far as he is concerned.</P>

      <P>The remark was made by way of interruption, I take it, and was not heard by the Chair.  If it had been heard, notice would certainly have been taken of it.  The practice is, when a very glaring case of this kind occurs, that the Editor of Debates draws the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to it.  If it was not heard by the Chair, it should not appear in the Official Report.  This remark will certainly not appear in the Official Report.  With regard to the point of order at issue, when a remark is made in the House to which exception is taken, objection should be taken to that remark at once, and if not at once, not later than when the Deputy addressing the House has concluded his speech, and before any other Deputy has addressed the House, or before the Chair has intervened on any matter. I think that is a sound rule.  If it were not observed, we should be constantly after questions, going back on previous proceedings.  An exception is usually made in the case of a Deputy who desires himself to withdraw something which he had said on a previous day.  That is not the present case.  The matter is raised not by Deputy Smith, but by Deputy O'Sullivan.  That is the rule, and I think it is a sound rule.</P>

      <P>It is not in connection with this particular matter. I raise it not as a point of order, but as a question of privilege.  It was impossible to raise this last evening at the end of Deputy de Valera's speech, as I actually did not hear it. It is, however, recorded in the Official Report, and the deletion of a remark like that from the Official Report by order of the Ceann Comhairle is, I suggest, not what should be done.  I know that Deputy Lemass does not wish to be personally rude to me, but I say again that when an occasion like this arises, when there are exchanges of remarks, nobody&mdash;it does not matter who he is&mdash;should insult you, sir, or this House by seeking an opportunity for saying what he would not say outside the House.  I know Deputy Boland will say that he would say it.</P>

      <P>I am not displeased at having an opportunity of making the position quite clear on this matter.  Deputy O'Sullivan did not hear the remark now complained of; the Chair did not hear the remark made.  Therefore, for record purposes, the remark was not made, and it will not appear in the Official Report of yesterday's proceedings. It would be impossible to report all the various remarks that are made from various parts of the House when certain Deputies are speaking&mdash;it could not be done.  In any event, it is not a question of privilege; it is a question of order. I want to make that ruling quite definite now.  If it were a question of privilege, the Deputy would be entitled to raise it.  But when a Deputy takes exception to something said, he should do so at once.  If he does not do so at once, he should do it before another Deputy has intervened, after the Deputy then addressing the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to offer my resignation to the House from this Committee.  I do not do so for personal reasons, but as representing the view of the official Opposition Party.  My resignation is tendered as a protest on behalf of that Party, and it expresses its complete disassociation from the practice of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders, particularly as it affects Bills of the character of the Bank of Ireland Bill. We hold that when any Party of considerable importance in the Oireachtas is of opinion that the public interest is affected by a Private Bill, that Party should be afforded an opportunity of informing itself fully of all the details of the Bill by having its chosen representatives on the examining committee to follow the Bill through all its stages.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that the main function of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders is to hear appeals from the decision of the Examiner as to compliance with the Standing Orders. That Committee has never tried to appoint committees on a Party basis. That has never been the function of the Committee.  The Committee has always tried to select members of the two Houses who they thought would be suitable for a particular Bill.  The Committee itself was not selected on a Party basis, and is not representative of the different Parties in this House.  I want to make that clear.  With reference to the action taken with regard to the Bank of Ireland Bill, the Joint Committee has not departed from the <Col N="1703" /> procedure which it has followed from the first time the Committee was formed, but has followed that procedure right through.  In this case, Deputy Little intimated to the Committee&mdash;he himself being a member of the Committee&mdash;that it was the desire of his Party that certain members of his Party should be appointed on that Committee.  The Joint Committee on Standing Orders did not agree, and, as a result, Deputy Little withdrew from the meeting, and, at a later stage, intimated to the Committee his desire to resign.  That is the report which I have just read for the House.</P>

      <P>You may take us as objecting very strongly to the action of the Committee on Standing Orders.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just as on others.  The procedure in the case of the ordinary Committee of Selection is that representatives of the different Parties intimate to that Committee what members of their Party are prepared to serve on it. These members are usually chosen by the Party with a view to the particular circumstances.  The members of the Party know each other much better than other Deputies can know them, and, accordingly, they make these selections in view of the particular abilities or qualifications of the members in connection with the committee that is projected.  In connection with this particular Bill, there were to be seven members on the committee, and we hold that as we number more than one-third of the two Houses, we are entitled to representation, and we believe that the action of the Committee in not putting on members of our Party is equivalent to partisan action.</P>

The Committee acted in the same way as it acted during the last six years.  What the Committee refused to do was to alter the whole procedure and practice of the last six years, if I may say so without any offence, at a Deputy's behest.  That is all.  I submit that the function of the Committee is to select a Committee of members of both Houses who, in their opinion, are best fitted to serve on any particular Bill, having in view the fact that this Committee is supposed to be a judicial or semi-judicial body.</P>

The Deputy desires <Col N="1706" /> to make what would be regarded by the Joint Committee on Private Bill business as a fundamental change in our Private Bill procedure. I think he should take steps to do that by amending the Private Bill Standing Orders.  I know of no other way in which it could be done, because you need to get this House to agree to a fundamental change and to get the concurrence of the other House if we are to continue to take business as at present by means of a Joint Committee on Bills and an identical procedure in both Houses.

An Leas-Cheann Comhairle, speaking in his official capacity as the <Col N="1707" /> Deputy charged with the direction of Private Business here, tells us that the Joint Committee has acted in accordance with its usual procedure. If Deputies want that procedure changed, they must take some steps to do so.  How this is to be done is the next matter.  I have given some consideration to it, and I am not quite decided as to how it could be done.  Proceedings could be initiated to amend Private Bill procedure.

Exception was taken on a recent occasion to a Committee of five.  You had to have at least seven.  There was a Committee of eleven also, and to that extent the Standing Orders do take cognisance of the fact that the Dáil is not absolutely a united body.</P>

      <P>I propose to ask the Committee to agree with the following amendment introduced in the Seanad:</P>
      <P>Section 3.  A new sub-section inserted before sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Whenever the Minister is satisfied that a house in respect of which a grant may be made under this Act was erected for occupation by a particular person in substitution for another house which, while occupied by such person, was rendered uninhabitable by coast erosion, the grant (if any) made by the Minister under this Act in respect of such House may exceed the appropriate limit specified in the first sub-section of this section, but shall not exceed such of the limits specified in Part I (exclusive of the Note appended thereto) of the Second Schedule to the Housing Act, 1925 (No. 12 of 1925), as is appropriate to such grant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that on the Report Stage a question was raised as to whether anything special might be done to assist those people who recently, in Greystones, had their houses destroyed by the action of the sea.  The matter received the consideration of the Department, and in co-operation with the Board of Health it was estimated that about twenty houses were involved, that ten houses could be replaced by the building of labourers' cottages, and ten would probably be erected by private persons to replace houses destroyed.  Certain arrangements were tentatively entered into with the Board of Health that they <Col N="1713" /> would undertake to build ten cottages, and that they would recommend the County Council to give a grant equal to the State grant to private persons building houses to replace those that were destroyed. Arising out of that, this amendment proposes that houses built by a local authority or private persons to replace those private houses in Greystones, if erected before February of next year, will be entitled to State grants at the rate that existed up to the 1st of April last rather than to the grants at the reduced rates that are enshrined in this Bill.  The amendment is in general terms, so that if there are any other houses outside Greystones that come within the limited range of time and money no one will have a grievance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  Its Title shows clearly that it refers to a number of diverse matters, and I would first draw the attention of the House to the manner in which the provisions for the protection of jurors are sandwiched in between other provisions which, in my opinion, make fundamental changes in the criminal law of this country, and which in other countries could not be introduced, much less passed by the Assembly, unless there was a fairly unanimous feeling with regard to the principle of such provisions and a unanimous public opinion behind it.  If there is anything that must convince one that the introduction of the question of the majority verdict into this measure is entirely wrong, unsound and unnecessary, it is the manner in which the Minister for Justice treated that question in his opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department, I understand, have been discussing the question of reforming the jury system for a considerable period. They were, I believe, discussing the question whether they could not reduce juries to six in number, and were discussing various other alternatives as against the present system.  It seems to me that if the Minister's Department have been discussing this matter, and if they have consulted legal opinion, as I am sure they have, the Minister should at least let the House know what the legal opinion thinks of this question of the majority verdict.  I know that legal authorities say that a good deal can be said for the principle of majority verdict; but I also know that in countries like the United States of America and England the unanimous verdict of the jury in a murder case, for example, is necessary.  Before this House takes such a far-reaching step as to change that procedure, and <Col N="1715" /> give nine out of twelve members of a jury the right to send a prisoner to his doom, they ought, I submit, to have very full, very detailed, and very substantial arguments produced in favour of that course.  I say that, because if there is one thing more than another about this Bill that should convince us that it is an important matter, and a matter of serious import to the country, it is that cases tried under it will be very important.  They will either be murder cases, treason cases, or felony cases, and in all these very serious cases, where the life of the accused is in danger, where there is any danger of a false verdict leading to the wrongful execution of the prisoner, the English law was extremely careful to maintain every possible safeguard.  Here we are changing the procedure, and, as the Minister for Justice says, we are changing it because the Executive Council have considered that it should be so.</P>
    <P>If we are advancing at all in the Free State, and if we are having the law and peaceful conditions, established and also if we are looking to the tourist traffic and for money to be invested here, we ought, at least, have reached a position where the Minister for Justice, in introducing a measure which vitally affects the lives and liberties of the citizens, should be able to give a more definite statement of what the Executive Council have in mind, and of the reasons that led them to this course, instead of simply saying: &ldquo;We have considered it; that is the be-all and end-all.&rdquo;  That might have been all right, as I have said here before, when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were in undisputed authority in this House, when they could afford to jibe and jeer at the late Leader of the Labour Party and his supporters when he endeavoured to draw a rein upon their panicky legislation. Now, however, the conditions are different, and if the Ministry adopted the attitude that I mentioned a moment ago, of saying that there are stable conditions here, that there is security for life and property, <Col N="1716" /> that there is full liberty and protection for everybody, and that peaceful conditions reign, then I submit that that is a very definite and solid reason for voting against this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Ministry, whatever the legal arguments in favour of a majority verdict may have been, were, however, not content to introduce that principle of amending the jury system in a measure.  They sandwiched in many other provisions for dealing with political or semi-political cases, or cases that, at any rate, a large number of Deputies on these benches consider come under those categories. If in addition to that principle of introducing the majority verdict you add the question of secrecy, the secrecy under which all these proceedings are now to be carried on, you will see that instead of widening down from precedent to precedent we are going back steadily.  I submit that the reason that we are going back in this matter&mdash; instead of going forward and extending popular liberties, restricting them&mdash;is that there is a certain attitude of mind in the Ministry and, I do not deny it, in other parties perhaps, which is chiefly prevalent in the ideas, utterances and policies of the Ministry but which is not reflected in public opinion down the country. That attitude of mind could be fairly summed up in the remark of the Minister for Defence last night that the axiom, &ldquo;A man is innocent until he is proved guilty,&rdquo; should not hold in these cases.  Why should it not hold in these cases?  Is it sufficient at this hour of the day, in this Free State and in the conditions that now prevail, that we are going to pass a measure of this kind because the Minister says: &ldquo;The State is in danger. Therefore, abolish the law, abolish the right of citizens, and do away with the principle that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty and substitute instead&rdquo;&mdash;for that is what it would come to&mdash;&ldquo;the principle that a man is guilty unless he can succeed in proving himself innocent?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> Formerly it was sufficient that one juror could secure the re-trial of an accused person.  That was a very valuable right, and when I am told that the lives of the Dublin jurors are in danger I am sorry for it.  Like every other member of my Party, I condemn the attacks on jurors.  I believe that, instead of furthering the cause which some people may think they are intended to advance, they are only impeding that cause.  I will, however, also say this, that in regard to Dublin juries you cannot, as was said in this House before, let the knife drop at a particular point and say to the Irish people: &ldquo;You had a certain point of view before the 6th December, 1921, and after that you are to have an entirely different view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You cannot make people change their minds by Acts of Parliament. People will have their own ideas of fair play and justice no matter what you may say here, and if the people feel that it is the will of the Executive and not fair play, justice and full liberty for the citizen that is being implemented in legislation here, you will not get the support of the people, and your last state will be worse than your first.  If we have a young State which we are anxious to build up, and through which we are anxious, in due course, to reach the full aspirations of the people, I submit that during that precarious opening period, we ought to be extremely careful that any steps we take in these matters have the sanction of tradition behind them.  We ought not, at any rate, to have the sanction simply of the old British tradition here.  I am looking at it from as fair-minded a point of view as it is possible for me, and I cannot believe, when the Executive decides, as undoubtedly it will decide under this Bill, in spite of all the powers it gives it, to change all this type of case to Dublin City for trial by a jury, that the people can have any other feeling than that the Government desires to have a certain atmosphere here and a certain point of view, represented wholly or, as far as possible, in the juries.  If we <Col N="1718" /> want the jury system to last, instead of confining it to a certain area and ringing it round with these restrictions and these so-called protections, we ought to try&mdash;and the co-operation of all sincere members of the House would be given&mdash;to spread the jury system so that it would not be necessary to take any prisoner, no matter what charge he was to be tried upon, out of his own area into what has been called a strange land where he has no information, where the State had full power and information at its disposal and certain privileges on its side that the unfortunate prisoner cannot have.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the question of the rights of the prisoner in the Bill. You have, as Deputy Lemass pointed out yesterday evening, taken away one of the fundamental rights of the prisoner, and you have given no reason for it, when you have placed in this Bill the principle that a majority verdict will rule.  The other safeguard that the prisoner had in these serious cases, where his life was perhaps in the balance, was that he should know the names of the jurors. If he is not to know the names, of what avail is that safeguard which English law gave him, though in a restricted form in this country, and in a still more restricted form by the Juries Act of 1927, and which we now seek to abolish, in fact if not in the letter of the law&mdash;the right of challenging the jury?  How can a prisoner challenge a jury when he knows nothing about them, if he is not allowed to have any information except the colour of the juror's hair, as has been suggested, or the colour of the clothes he wears, or some other fact that comes under his notice? Before the House subscribes to that principle I would ask Deputies to consider whether it would not be better, as Deputies on the opposite side have suggested, to abolish the jury system altogether and to set up some other system, some system of real court-martial, as Deputy O'Higgins says, some special tribunal for special crimes, so that a real Star Chamber could be set up in this country, with the Minister for Justice as <Col N="1719" /> Grand Inquisitor and Deputy O'Higgins as Grand Torturer in charge of the rack, to put those special prisoners who had been arrested for special crimes into that Star Chamber and keep them as far as possible separate from the ordinary administration of the law.</P>
    <P>By bringing in this complicated and unworkable measure you are simply heading straight for a complete dislocation of your legal machinery. You are also heading straight for the position that, instead of giving jurors confidence, instead of giving them the feeling that you are going to protect them, and that they will be henceforward absolutely safe, you are trying to put them into the position that they are going to be definite partisans of the Government Party in any political case that comes along.  You are not going to give them an opportunity to escape from that position.  You are going to take jurors, whether they like it or not, whether they agree with the law or not, whether they know that the confidence of the people is behind it or not, and force them, because that is what it amounts to, to bring in verdicts in accordance with the conditions that the Executive Council are now laying down. I submit that they can proceed in due course to the complete abolition of the jury system itself, because if the Government can come along on the flimsy pretext they have adduced in this case to destroy the jury system to the extent to which they now propose to destroy it, they can come along to abolish the whole system later on on some other pretext.  It would be much better, as Deputies have suggested, if the jury system were left alone and if some other method, if method be necessary, were adopted, if the Government had some sort of Star Chamber method by which, I gathered from the statement of the Minister for Defence last night, he would like to try some ladies.  It would be much better simply to go back to that Star Chamber method instead of upsetting the whole jury system in this country.</P>
    <P>The prisoner under the Bill before <Col N="1720" /> us is to have his right to know who the jurors are taken away from him. That is, in my opinion, an absolute right, a right which no party in power in this House has the right to take away, if the party in opposition do not agree with it in principle. If the party in opposition, who may, at some future date, be called upon to carry out these provisions or to repeal them, do not support the principle of such legislation, some day or other the question will come up again.  That will mean that the whole ground, and goodness knows what that might include, will have to be gone over again.  The 1927 Act gave the accused, at any rate, the right to challenge for cause.  The challenge which an accused person had under British law must be compared with the slight privilege that the Irish prisoner now has.</P>
    <P>The accused person under English law had the right to challenge the whole array of the jury.  That was a principle that English law recognised, and that was a safeguard imposed on a tyrannical or unscrupulous Executive.  It was called upon in the case of the trial of Daniel O'Connell, and in later times I believe that the late Governor-General of the Irish Free State used that weapon, or at least, threatened to use it&mdash;the weapon of challenging the whole array of the jury in cases where he felt that the full legal machinery and the full resources of the Government were being exercised unscrupulously against the accused person.  That was done away with, and in addition to that, the right that English law also gave accused persons in this country, in cases of treason or felony, the right of peremptory challenging without any cause, but simply on account of the gravity of the offence, was done away with under the 1927 Juries Act.  The 1927 Juries Act should have been the last word with regard to interference with the rights of the accused person, because you took away the challenge of the array and the challenge without cause.  You left the challenge with <Col N="1721" /> cause, and what does that mean?  It means that before this Bill was introduced the prisoner had the right of challenging six persons. And what was the right of the State?  The State had, and still will have, the right to challenge any number of persons to stand by, and in an ordinary civil case, I believe, in the Courts it has been known that the State has challenged twenty jurors to stand by. What will happen in a political case where the accused person will be charged with murder if feeling is strong in the country on the matter, and if there is ground for believing that it can be regarded as a political issue?  If the State challenged twenty jurors to stand aside in an ordinary civil case they may challenge hundreds in that case if they do not think that this Bill gives them such complete right over the liberty of the accused person, and gives them such power to determine the issue in advance, that it will be quite unnecessary to exercise the stand-by which they have exercised to the fullest extent up to the present.</P>
    <P>Now, how is the prisoner going to exercise this right that you are going to leave him of challenging six persons whose names he does not know?  How is he going to exercise the right which I say the Irish people want for every person, the right which they had under English law and which you now want to take away, to challenge every juror whom he may reasonably charge with bias in the case?  If he does not know the juror how is he to know whether he is biased or not?  Let the Minister for Justice answer that question and if he answers it satisfactorily, and if he can get the Irish people behind him, very well, but I say that the Irish people want in the law the safeguards British law gave the accused person and that if, in a particular sense, you are abolishing the unanimous verdict, you must and ought to leave the prisoner the only other safeguard he has when his life is in the balance, and that is the safeguard of challenging jurors <Col N="1722" /> for bias.  You are taking away that right and you are leaving the State the right to challenge as many jurors as they wish.  You are giving the right to the State to change the trial to a venue where the prisoner, as I said before, will be in a strange land.  You are giving the State the right to get the fullest possible information about the jurors and to make up its mind about them, and you are taking these things away from the accused person.  I submit that is not law, that the Irish people will not accept it as law and that it is not in accord with the spirit of justice and fair play here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I pass on to the provisions <Col N="1723" /> of the Bill, and I hope to be able to show the House that, in addition to doing away with the majority verdict and the right of the accused person to challenge the jury, &mdash;because in effect he can no longer do that&mdash; you are also giving them powers because the Executive Council thought there were persons in this country whom they disliked, against whom they had a personal animus, and against whom, let us say also, they had a suspicion of their participation in acts against the State. Ought they not to have been satisfied in this measure with the abolition of the right of the accused person to challenge and the right of the accused person to have a unanimous verdict?  No, they are not satisfied with that, and they interfere with the machinery of the law.  Those Ministers on the opposite side who told us that they have an independent judiciary take every opportunity they can get of rushing measures like this through the House to force the judges from one position into another, to put responsibility upon their shoulders that the judges do not want, and to give them every ground that the Executive can manufacture to stand upon except the right in law, because if this Bill were in consonance with law you would have got the opinion of your legal men upon it.  But because a few officials in some Government office decide that certain devices will help the State in particular trials, they rush these devices in the form of a Bill.  You throw it at the head of the judges, and the judges find it almost impossible to administer. Later on it has to be amended, and that is what is going to happen in this case, because, as I said before, you cannot alter such a fundamental principle of the criminal law as the administration of the jury system without setting the whole system by the ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 6 of this measure there are provisions by which a person who refuses to recognise the Court or displays gross disrespect to the Court which, in the opinion of the judge, is equivalent to a refusal to <Col N="1724" /> recognise the Court, and so on shall suffer a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.  What is the reason for dragging in this question of the refusal of the prisoner to recognise the Court at the present time?  The jury, when the prisoner is presented to them in the dock, when the charge is made against him, with the full array of State counsel behind it, and when the prisoner makes his statement, can then determine whether he is a patriot or a ruffian. I think it should be left to the jury to decide the question, but you are not going to leave it to the jury.  The twelve good men and true whose common sense is recognised as the final arbiter in England and in the United States of America are not going to be recognised here as the final arbiters as to whether a man who refuses to recognise the Court is acting in gross disrespect of the Court or is acting in furtherance of certain conscientious principles that he holds.  And you are going to say to the judge, &ldquo;if in your opinion.&rdquo; Why should any legislature put down in law, &ldquo;in the opinion of the judge&rdquo;?  On what law is the judge going to base his opinion?  That is an example of the kind of legislation that is being passed through this House.  If the Executive want the judges to do a thing, let them state the principles upon which they want the judges to give their decision.  Let them not fix upon the judges the odium that should rest upon themselves, of having to decide, without any points of law to guide them, whether the accused person is guilty of gross disrespect or not.  That is not the only section in the Act in which you are putting a certain arbitrary function on the judge.  You are putting upon him the onus of making up his mind upon certain matters.  But if the Executive cannot state it here now in their Bill it ought, I submit, be left to the juries to decide and not to the judges.  If the judges are going to be the guardians of the rights of the people, and if they are going to be the foundation of peace, good order, and confidence in the State, they must be placed absolutely above these questions, <Col N="1725" /> and the Executive should not try&mdash;in my opinion it is quite wrong to the judges, and it will have unfortunate reactions later on&mdash;to place upon the judges this responsibility which, perhaps, I would go so far as to agree ought to be left to the juries.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to refer to in this Bill is the liberty of the subject.  The liberty of the subject is one of those principles which are recognised in countries where peaceful conditions prevail as being a fundamental thing and a thing that cannot be upset or changed every day the Executive gets panicky or whenever some member of the Cumann na mBan shakes her fist at the Minister for Defence.  If you are going to have laws based on incidents like that and on personal opinions, you are going to have very confused laws indeed.  If the Executive really believe that they are going to have the Fianna Fáil Party later on administering these laws, I would suggest, with all due respect to them, that they should take the views of the Fianna Fáil Party more into consideration, and in particular in matters which your Constitution lays down as fundamental.  It is a most extraordinary anomaly, and one naturally that it is very hard to explain to the country, that the present Government can, whenever they think fit, without any reasons, come in by the exercise of a majority vote and amend the Constitution, even in its most vital articles.  Here they are completely abolishing the right of the liberty of the subject that is supposed to be guaranteed in that Constitution.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 4 of the sixth section deals with what is to happen to the prisoner after he has been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for refusing to recognise the court.  Upon his release clause (a) states he shall be detained in custody as if he had been returned for trial at the sittings to which his trial so stands adjourned.  That is to say, after the prisoner has been released after the completion of a certain term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced, he can be arrested and re-arrested, <Col N="1726" /> and he can get six months' imprisonment on an illimitable number of occasions and, at the end of it all, he can be re-arrested and interned. That is what it amounts to. But there is no safeguard whatever in the Bill to protect the accused person in this case.  There is no safeguard or protection whatever to give the House the slightest suspicion that the Executive have any other purpose in mind in that clause and the succeeding one than to continue the policy that they have been working up to the present of arresting and rearresting large numbers of people without charge.  If they had a better idea in mind, if they really wanted to further the interests of law and order, surely they would have to recognise their Constitution and that fundamental article in the Constitution to the extent, at any rate, that they would insert some safeguards which would have given the accused person some protection against trumped-up charges and against frequent arrests on bogus charges.  In clause (b), if there was no verdict found when the accused person was tried on the main charge, &ldquo;such sentence shall not prevent such person after he has suffered such imprisonment being tried again on the charge in respect of which such failure to find a verdict occurred.&rdquo; So that the Executive Council are not alone preserving the right to detain the person in custody when his term of imprisonment is up, but they are further reserving the right for themselves to have it both ways, and that is a most extraordinary thing for any Government to try.  If there is no verdict found the prisoner can still be kept in prison until such time as a verdict is found.  If that is not a definite direction to the nine jurors on whose support the Government counts to bring in a verdict in the case, if this man is sent to prison and comes out, we can again send him to prison for refusing to recognise the court.  We can keep him in jail if we wish, under that system, for the rest of his natural life.  In that way I say the Government are assuring themselves of the verdict of the jury.  I have more respect for <Col N="1727" /> the jurors of Dublin city and county than to believe that such special provisions in an Act of Parliament are necessary to get them to bring in a fair and honest verdict.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is the other Section which places new responsibilities on the judge, and it takes away from the jury one of the things, I think, which ought to be left to them, and that is: &ldquo;Whenever and as often as a judge presiding in the Central Criminal Court, or a judge of the Circuit Court sitting for the trial of criminal issues, is satisfied that, by reason of intimidation, or attempted intimidation of jurors or witnesses,&rdquo; and so on, the judge can then adjourn the case to the next following sitting.  On what principle is the judge going to act?  Who is going to bring forward the evidence, and what is the evidence going to be that such intimidation or attempted intimidation of jurors or witnesses has taken place?  It is rather a poorly-worded Bill that does not even state in this very important matter, which we are told is the origin and cause of the whole Bill&mdash;the question of intimidation&mdash;the nature of the evidence which is to be presented to the judge.  If they want us to believe that the judge is simply going to make up his mind ad hoc because a police officer says there has been intimidation, I think they are trifling with the House, and I think it is a mistake for Deputies, who have at heart the principles that I am speaking about, to allow the Government to trifle with them in this matter.</P>
    <P>If the Government believe that there is intimidation&mdash;they have had cases of it, they say, and they know exactly how it has taken place and the extent of it&mdash;why is there not in Section 8 a definite provision as to evidence being given before the judge?  Why do the Executive Council take this whole question of intimidation and place it upon the judge's shoulders?  Why do they at the same time that they say they have discovered a perfect measure for protecting jurors, place the full odium upon the judge of having to <Col N="1728" /> decide, and not show us&mdash;I am not a lawyer; perhaps the Minister for Agriculture will show us later on&mdash; how the judge is going to approach the question?  If he is going to approach the question simply on the word of a police officer that is not sufficient, because that is one of the things that arises under this whole Bill&mdash;the question of increasing the powers of the police.  I think it ought not to be done.  If there were a reasonable provision and if the Executive could show us that they really intended that the judge should sit as a judge, that he would administer law in this question of intimidation, and that evidence should be submitted to him&mdash;surely that is not too much, considering that the judge, if he so wishes, can clear the court under another provision&mdash;I would say that the Executive Council had approached the matter seriously.  But owing to the manner in which the judge has to deal with this question, I submit it is being dealt with purely as a party issue, purely as an issue against certain organisations in this country, and that is the way the Government are dealing with the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that it would be better to change it&mdash;I suggest it myself&mdash;that this particular type of case, which Deputy O'Higgins said should be tried in a particular way, should be dealt with in a special measure.  But when the Minister says that if this Bill is going to fail &mdash;he has not shown us how it is going to succeed&mdash;he is going to introduce another Bill that will abolish the jury system altogether, I say that he would have done that already, but he felt perhaps some inkling of what I said earlier, that the judges would be placed in such an impossible position that the very foundations of society, as the President said in another connection, would be threatened.  I hope, whether the Bill is carried into law or not, and whether it is a success or not, that the Government will really stick to their word, if they have any word in this matter of an independent judiciary, and keep the judges, as far as possible, away from those cases <Col N="1729" /> in which it might be said they were acting under political bias, or acting under the direction or wishes of the Executive Council.  When I see the Executive Council introducing definite provisions in a matter of this kind to place further responsibility on the judge's shoulders, I say they are not out to preserve the judiciary as an independent judiciary, but that they are first out to preserve themselves in power, and to have revenge upon their enemies by every means at their disposal, and after them the deluge.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of discussions in this House in regard to the exercise of their powers by the police.  Deputy Boland, who is not here at present, has definite examples of cases where the Executive and the police, who are their servants, are shown in a very unfavourable light in some of these political cases.  If the ordinary Civic Guard superintendent were the person to be responsible in these cases, something might be said for it, although there is nothing to show that the Civic Guard superintendent can have any point of view in this matter, or that any other point of view will be allowed to direct him, except the point of view of the Executive Council, who are his employers. But we know that the powers which are to be conferred upon the police under this Bill are to be exercised largely, if not wholly, by the body known as the C.I.D., and I, as one Deputy, while anxious to give every party and organisation its due, say that I can have no confidence in the Executive which gives further powers to that body.  I have had personal experience myself of the way in which they have carried out their duties.  In my opinion, they are thoroughly irresponsible. Their attitude is simply to get a man into jail if the Executive Council presses them sufficiently hard to find the culprit in a certain case&mdash;to get somebody into jail, at any rate, and when he is in jail, to keep him there.  By that means you will keep him out of danger, and you will be able to justify yourself <Col N="1730" /> to some extent to the Executive Council.  That is putting very mildly, I think, the attitude in which large numbers, if not all, of the C.I.D. approach these cases, and in that they have been wilfully and maliciously encouraged by the utterances of the Minister for Justice here, when, as Deputy de Valera said yesterday, definite cases were brought before him, prima facie cases showing, at any rate, that further investigations should be made, he simply scouted the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The clearing of the court during certain criminal cases&mdash;&ldquo;If an officer of the Gárda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, states on oath to the judge presiding at such trial that in the opinion of such officer it is necessary for the protection of the witnesses and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the Court during such trial, the judge shall order the Court to be cleared and shall not proceed with such trial until the Court has been cleared in accordance with this section.&rdquo;  Further on Section 7 (5) says: &ldquo;Whenever immediately after the clearing of a Court under this section an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent states on oath to the judge presiding in such Court that one or more than one recent issue or issues of a specified newspaper has or have contained articles <Col N="1731" /> or other matter calculated in the opinion of such officer to intimidate jurors or witnesses either generally or in the particular trial,&rdquo; then the judge shall forthwith order the representatives of all such papers to be excluded.  Then there is the sub-section which states that an officer of the Gárda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, can have any person excluded from the court, because it is an officer of the Gárda Síochána who is to be the judge in this case, and the judge is simply to be at the beck and call of the officer of the Gárda Síochána; and when the officer orders the judge to exclude a certain person from the court, who has claim to be there as a representative of the Press, the judge is given no option whatever but to exclude him.</P>
      <P>In my opinion Section 7 and the sub-section I have quoted place the police in an entirely new position in court, and give them powers superior to the judge, power to give him directions that the court shall be cleared and that the Press representatives shall be excluded, and so on.  Now with regard to sub-section (6) a particular person claiming the right to be admitted to the court as representative of the Press can be excluded. The officer of the Gárda Síochána has to swear on oath that he knows such person to be or to be suspected of being concerned or associated in acts of intimidation of jurors or witnesses or acts of a treasonable or seditious character, or otherwise hostile to law, peace and good order, or is known to associate with persons concerned, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of association, I should like to ask Deputies should not the fact that you give an officer of the Gárda the right to have a Press representative excluded by reason of the character of certain issues of a paper with which he is connected in a certain way, be sufficient without draggoing in here another provision by which many of us on this side of the House, at any rate, could be excluded from court if we went there as Press representatives.  If the <Col N="1732" /> Gárda Síochána are able to prefer charges against those persons they ought to prefer them and have them tried in court.  The Executive ought not to take up the attitude with regard to this matter of the liberty of the Press, which is as important in its way as the question of the liberty of the subject, and the right of full publicity for the case in which the prisoner may be tried for his life.  The Executive Council have no right to take up the attitude that the whole question may be airily dismissed by a wave of the hand by saying that the police officer will instruct the judge to exclude such persons.  If that was the law in this country before 1921, the Minister for Finance, for example, and and other members of the Government Party, would have got very short shrift indeed for writing articles in &ldquo;Irish Freedom.&rdquo;  If the Minister for Justice in his peregrinations goes up some day to the grave of Arthur Griffith in Glasnevin, he will see printed on the little cross over that grave a list of periodicals, called the Mosquito Press at the time, which kept the flame of nationality burning when the Minister for Justice was not heard of.  I venture to say that when the Minister for Justice is gone organs of that kind, which the late Arthur Griffith and Seán MacDermott edited for so many years, may fulfil a very useful function in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not say that any organ has a right to incite to murder, and I deprecate that just as much as I deprecate the petty attempt of Deputy O'Sullivan to seize on a particular phrase that Deputy de Valera let fall in a long speech and to try to twist and distort it into a most malevolent allegation.</P>

I used the actual phrase, and I raise this question in view of the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to-day that one must raise a point like this immediately. I ask Deputy Derrig to withdraw at once the suggestion that I twisted the statement made by Deputy <Col N="1733" /> de Valera into a meaning that it was not intended to bear.</P>

The fact is that responsible men, great publicists in other countries, men like Mr. Hilaire Belloc have said that when they wanted to find out how things were in Ireland, and to get at the actual feelings of the people, you had to consult organs like &ldquo;Nationality,&rdquo;&ldquo;Irish Freedom,&rdquo;&ldquo;Scissors and Paste,&rdquo; and so on.  They did not consult the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Irish Independent.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Not your type.  The law has given the Ministry full power already to deal with matters of publication in the Press.  If these Republican organs which the Ministry are so much afraid of say anything concerning a particular trial which is sub judice the Ministry have full power to deal with that.  Furthermore, with regard to the attitude of the prisoner in court in regard to matters of intimidation and so on, I submit that under a number of heads in this Bill judges have already full power under the powers of contempt of court to inflict summary sentences. The Government have full power to deal with the Press if it acts wrongly in these cases.  But they deliberately want to take away from <Col N="1734" /> the prisoner the only right of publicity that he has.  If they excluded, by Act of Parliament, the Ketchams and Brethertons who advertised the Government in such lurid colours well and good, but these gentlemen from across the water, as well as the Irish Press, are to be allowed in, to make the fullest possible capital out of the trial, to indulge in the fullest possible scaremongery and advertisement of Ireland in Great Britain. These gentlemen are to be allowed in. No restrictions are to be placed upon them; they can write what they like, but representatives of one solitary little weekly paper are to be excluded simply because they are on the side of the prisoner.  That is the sense of fair play of the Ministry.  I submit it is not a sense of fair play of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The reason for all this law, as it is called, is that we have a conspiracy on foot.  We have heard the Minister for Defence and the newly elected Deputy for North Dublin tell us about this conspiracy. And what have they been able to tell us?  They tell us that circulars were sent out to jurors within the past year or two on a number of occasions by certain organisations.  Those associations are not large in number.  They are all known to the Government and I submit if the Government believed there is such a conspiracy on foot, and if, as the Minister for Justice told us a few weeks ago, it is limited in scope and that they have their heels upon its throat, then they ought to bring these people to justice under the ordinary course of law instead of seeking special powers from the Oireachtas to deal with their political opponents.  They have full powers already.  I submit that there is not a conspiracy, and I submit that the statement of Deputy O'Higgins which I daresay was very carefully prepared in a certain Department, with the full details, is substantially the same statement that the Minister for Justice, if he thought it wise, would have made if he had been really trying to prove to the House that there was such a conspiracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, Deputy O'Higgins <Col N="1735" /> said, an organisation called &ldquo;The Ghosts,&rdquo; there was an organisation of An Phoblacht, the organisation called the &ldquo;Prisoners' Organisation,&rdquo; the Cumann Na mBan and the organisation called the I.R.A. With regard to those organisations they may be reduced to two classes. You have, at any rate, men and women.  The Minister for Defence dealt at length with some of those ladies whose names are well known and who have appended their names frequently to anything they have written.  I have no doubt whatever but that the ladies' part of this conspiracy, as it is called, is by far the most dangerous so far as the personal safety of the Ministers themselves at any rate is concerned.  I cannot get away from the feeling, and I sympathise with the Ministers that their own personal difficulty and the animosities that have been created against them in the country have made them regard this question in a certain light.</P>
    <P>But even if they have their own feelings in this matter, other people have their feelings also, but no matter what our feelings or our spleens may be, we ought not to trust them very far.  We ought to trust to the better instincts of human nature; we ought to adhere as far as possible to the real constitutional course of law when dealing with matters such as these.  I say there is not a conspiracy of the kind that it has been attempted here to prove.  There are numbers of individuals who very often, I say, are goaded into desperation by incessant raids and attacks by the C.I.D.  It is quite useless for the Opposition here to speak of that matter.  I know that the Government Party does not place the slightest credence on anything that comes from this side of the House. We can only hope that they will alter their opinions in that matter, and that they will recognise that we here, equally with them, are the guardians of the rights of the people.</P>
    <P>When we do produce definite examples of misbehaviour, I submit that we at least be given the satisfaction of having some inquiry made <Col N="1736" /> into these charges.  No inquiry has been made, and I submit that that attitude and that particular force is very largely responsible for the most unfortunate things that took place during the last few months.  The Ministry, instead of being like the Bourbons, in the position of being able to forget nothing and to learn nothing, should make some gesture to show that they recognise that we must all live in this country, and that, as far as possible, we ought to try to tolerate one another's opinions, and we ought not, because people belong to the Sinn Fein organisation, carry on an incessant persecution of them.  If the Ministry would recognise that, I submit that they would be doing far more for the object they have in view than they can achieve by passing measures like this.  I ask them if the danger is there, if a conspiracy is there, if they believe that this is the best thing they can do to protect jurors &mdash;I think I have shown the defects of this measure&mdash;it is better for them to admit they cannot protect jurors.  The only way to protect jurors is to have such a public opinion of the country as will see that the law is obeyed.  In order to secure that the public must have confidence in the Executive, and if the public have confidence in the Executive, the law will be obeyed.  If the Executive leave their political bias out of the question and show that they are simply carrying on administration by their police for the welfare of the country and its people, then they will have a normal country.  I ask the Minister not to pursue this measure.  It would be almost impossible to work it.  This measure has grave danger, as I have already pointed out here, of completely upsetting and confusing the administration of the law.  It is far better to let things take their course, but to issue a warning that the Government intend to take action if any further attacks on jurors take place, and to withdraw the Bill, at least until we see whether the conditions will improve.</P>

      <P>Deputies on <Col N="1737" /> these benches were solemnly warned yesterday by Deputy de Valera of their responsibilities in respect of this Bill.  Now I am, I think, fully conscious of the fact that the members of the Dáil have definite and serious responsibilities in this matter.  The responsibility is not a single responsibility but a double responsibility.  They have a responsibility, in the first place, to the jurymen and to the preservation and protection of the jurymen who are being threatened at the moment. They have, in the second place, a responsibility to the people who are being accused or are likely to be accused of crimes.  It is a very difficult position, and it is a very difficult task to secure evenhanded justice as between these two responsibilities. It is a task that the Dáil must face in dealing with this Bill. I believe that this Bill is capable, if properly understood, of being so used as to carry out both of these responsibilities.</P>
      <P>It is an unfortunate thing that a matter of this kind which is concerned with the administration of the law should not be capable of being discussed except through a kind of political haze.  The real difficulty in all this matter and the real reason why jurymen are now in danger of their lives, and why the jury system is in danger of destruction in this country is because it has proved impossible to keep politics and political consideration separate from the maintenance of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about responsibilities, I would like to remind Deputy de Valera that if there is any one man in this country who is responsible for that state of affairs it is Deputy de Valera himself.  Deputy de Valera's speech yesterday was a complete proof of what I say.  He began his speech by referring sarcastically to the continuity of the British Government, as he called it, in this country.  His speech was a very fine illustration of the continuity of Deputy de Valera himself.  Deputy de Valera talks in the year 1929 in practically the same tones and with practically the same sentiment that he talked in 1922.  We had again <Col N="1738" /> yesterday the same old phrases: &ldquo;Men will be found who will render this Bill inoperative.&rdquo;&ldquo;Others will come along who will see that this corrupt and tyrannical Government is not allowed to carry out the functions&rdquo; for the carrying out of which it was placed in power.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has proved himself an expert both in prophesying and assisting in the carrying out of his own prophecies.  The greater part of his speech yesterday, if it meant anything, was a complete throwing overboard of the whole case for Irish nationalism in this country. He produced a string of speeches delivered in the British House of Commons when dealing with Acts for what the British Ministers called the suppression of crime in this country and he produced a list of Acts passed through the British House of Commons for that purpose.  He attempted to make it appear that there was a parity and a continuity between those British Acts and the Acts passed now, passed as they are for the purpose of maintaining order in this country.  Now, either these British Ministers who made these statements had the right to make them or had not the right.  If they had the right to make these statements, then the whole Irish national movement, and particularly that part of the Irish national movement with which Deputy de Valera was associated, was nothing but a humbug and a murderous humbug. The lives that were sacrificed at the bidding of Deputy de Valera and his colleagues in this country were sacrificed for a sham, if what Deputy de Valera tries to pretend is true.  If Mr. Balfour and his colleagues had the right to make these statements, or had the right to pass these Acts, then Irish nationalism meant nothing.  If they had not that right and if they were not entitled to pass these Acts or to make these statements, then Deputy de Valera's speech yesterday was a sham and a humbug and meant nothing.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways. It has been always the doctrine of Irish nationalism&mdash;it was a doctrine held long before Deputy de Valera <Col N="1739" /> was ever heard of&mdash;that under any system of election, under any form of representation, any body of men elected by the Irish people had a better right to govern this country and to maintain order in this country than any body of men elected by the British people.</P>

It is not a doctrine that hinges upon any particular statute or any particular treaty or any particular system of election.  It has been always held that any body of men elected by the Irish people, no matter how, to act in the name of the Irish people had a better right to take any action in the name of the Irish people than any body elected by the British people.</P>

      <P>Let me now <Col N="1740" /> come to the second point of Deputy de Valera's speech yesterday.  Because Deputy de Valera thinks that the Oath which members of this Parliament have to take is wrong, and ought not to be taken, therefore jurors are to be shot dead at their doorsteps in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Or only wounded.  We have heard a lot of humbug about the continuity of British methods, and we have heard that the Government here, a Government elected by a majority of the Irish people and deriving its authority and its power through that election by the Irish people, is on a parity with past British methods.  If that is sincerely meant, then Deputy de Valera and his friends have never understood at any time what Irish nationality means, and have been engaged in a murderous sham during the greater part of their political careers, or else it means they are trying to delude ignorant people throughout the country.  It means either one or other of these things. I do not think that they are likely to delude members of the Dáil, but no matter how often those things are dealt with in the Dáil, we will have them repeated at cross-roads through the country.  We will hear again the old story about the continuity of British methods, about King George's representative, about British Government methods, and about Forster's Coercion Act.  Deputy MacEntee will trot out those things in Tullamore or somewhere else, or perhaps Deputy Lemass will, the idea being that the people in the country are too ignorant and thick-headed to see that their legs are being pulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rest of Deputy de Valera's speech, when he was goaded by the ill-mannered interruptions of Deputy O'Sullivan and myself, boiled down to the statement that because Deputy de Valera does not like the Oath, therefore crimes are going to continue to be committed.  The position is, on Deputy de Valera's and Deputy Derrig's admission, that there exists a body of people, or there exist <Col N="1741" /> bodies of people, in this country who are prepared to go to any length to oppose the authority of this Parliament. Their reason for so doing, according to Deputy de Valera, is because an Oath has to be taken by members of this Parliament.  Deputy de Valera holds that if that Oath were removed all the difficulties would vanish.  His alternative to the Juries Bill is a Bill to abolish the Oath.  He believes everything would be quite right if we did away with the Oath.  What does that mean? Deputy de Valera and his Party have, as part of their policy, if returned to power by a majority of the people, to do away with the Oath.</P>
    <P>Then the position is that these people who are prepared to go to any lengths in order to resist this Parliament are faced at present with the terrible alternative of either supporting Deputy de Valera and his Party at the polls or else committing murder, and sooner than accept the alternative of supporting Deputy de Valera and his Party, they prefer to commit murder.  That is the logic of what the Deputy has been saying.  There is nothing to prevent Deputy de Valera and his Party, or any other Party, from wiping out the Oath from the Constitution, once they get the sanction of the majority of the Irish people for doing it.  It is in the Constitution simply and solely because the majority of the people have agreed to have it there.  Once they change their minds, then Deputy Lemass or anybody else able to make them change their minds can get the Oath out.  If people are ready to go to any length to resist the laws made by this Parliament because they do not like the Oath, the only conclusion I can come to is, that little as they like the Oath they like Deputy de Valera and his friends a great deal less.  All they have to do in order to get rid of the Oath is to vote for Deputy de Valera and put him into power.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Lemass would withdraw the allegation made against me that I was telling lies.  I will not however, waste time on that matter now.  As regards the question of interpretation, Deputy de Valera cannot be got to agree even with an interpretation which he puts on his own statement.  As I say, that was the gist of his speech&mdash;why not have patience, why not try the ordinary law?  There is nothing like a sufficiently serious situation, according to Deputy de Valera.  He did not use these exact words but he said something like it&mdash;one juror had been wounded and a witness has been killed and we are to have patience and things are to go on as they have gone on.  Why is all that to be? Because Deputy de Valera and his Party, in common with other people, do not like the Oath in the Treaty. That is what it all boils down to. It is a kind of situation about which it is difficult to say anything satisfactory. It is not the sort of situation which argument will meet.  We are all perfectly prepared to allow these people to do everything they can to get rid of the Oath and the Constitution, if they want to, short of committing murder, of committing violence, but we want to know where the Fianna Fáil Deputies stand in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do they stand for enforcing the ordinary law which is made by the elected representatives of the Irish people?  Do they stand for enforcing that law against everybody or do they not?  Do they stand for protecting the instruments, the innocent <Col N="1745" /> and often unwilling instruments, of that law against attacks that are daily made on them?  It has been said that the problem with which the Government is faced is that juries will not bring in verdicts to suit the Executive Council.  That is another of those cross-roads' statements which are good enough to go down in the country but which will not carry weight here.  People who live in Dublin know that that is not the situation, that the situation here is that ordinary citizens, called on without any initiative on their part, against their will very often, to serve on juries, are not certain that their lives are safe when they do their ordinary duty without political bias. That problem exists.  It is a problem not of the Government's making. When we hear talk of doing away with trial by jury and abolishing the fundamental rights of citizens of trial by twelve good men and true, I would point out that if these fundamental rights are to be invaded and if these privileges of the citizens, or subjects, as Deputy Derrig called them, are being taken away it is not by the Government but by the people who are making it impossible for jurors to function in this city. The jury system is a vulnerable thing.  The people called on to serve on juries are mostly, I imagine in nine cases out of ten, people who have no political interest and who, perhaps, do not bother about voting on the occasion of a general election. They, like the majority of us, do not want to risk their lives in this duty which is often unpleasant.</P>
    <P>The jury system is very vulnerable and, if it is being taken away, it is being taken away by the people who set upon innocent citizens at night and punish them because they carry out the duty which they have sworn to carry out.  I believe that this Bill has a chance of succeeding in dealing with this particular evil for this reason, namely, that this attack on juries is only an element in a political gamble.  It is only, in one aspect, a method of advertising, and in another aspect it is a violent means of keeping alive organisations which would die <Col N="1746" /> unless they had some violent means of keeping them alive.  I do not believe, if it is made difficult to find out who the jurors are, and if it is made difficult to attack jurors, that attacks on juries will continue. Some other method of propaganda will be discovered for keeping these organisations alive, but jurymen will be let alone.  For that reason, apart from other aspects, the Bill is fundamentally sound and is well worth a trial.  I would remind Labour Deputies that when the Government did take the steps which Labour Deputies are now clamouring for they were amongst the first to denounce the Government.</P>
    <P>When the Government introduced Bills in this House, setting up special courts for dealing with a certain class of crime, nobody was louder or more fervent in his denunciation of these Bills than the leader of the Labour Party.  The Government are taking the step that they are taking in this case because, if you like, they are not so extreme as the Labour Party, because they are not so anxious to take away the fundamental rights of the citizen, to take away those principles which lie at the root of the British Constitution, as the Labour Party puts it.  They wish to see, before scrapping this method of trying the facts in cases like this by a jury of independent citizens, whether that method cannot be strengthened, whether it cannot be put on a basis that will ensure its continuance not only until this measure has been liquidated but in perpetuity.  I think the attempt is well worth making.  If it fails, then the Labour Party can come along with their draft of a more drastic Bill, if they like.</P>

      <P>That is a point which is worth making clear, and I want to ask the Minister to make the point clear.  I suggest that it should be possible under this or any other Bill to allow the advocate of any particular prisoner to have access to the jury list so that he might be able to challenge any juror.  If some provision of that kind were made it would confine knowledge of the composition of the jury to as small a number of people as possible, and at the same time it would ensure that the prisoner in any particular case could protect himself.  I would also suggest, though again this is a point on which I am not by any means expert, that even if this Bill were passed there does exist a protection in the right of appeal.  There is the Court of Criminal Appeal for a prisoner who feels that his trial has been unfair.  He is at liberty, whether this Bill is passed or not, to appeal against his sentence and against the findings of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): This is the first time I ever had the advantage of being lectured by a University Professor and I confess, having experienced that advantage, his statement is all Greek to me.  It is a splendid specimen of what one would expect from what has been described as a hack speech, a speech which considers his Party and the viewpoint of his Party before anything else. At the outset I would like to remind the two big Parties that in dealing with this Bill the citizens of the country ought to be considered more than the viewpoint of any particular Party, and that the matter of approach to this Bill ought not to be the scoring of debating points upon any particular Deputy but rather the consideration of what effects the Bill will have on the general community and the State.  That is the way the Bill ought to be approached and considered. In considering the Bill in that fashion I suggest there are two points which we might very relevantly examine.  The first point I suggest we should examine is what <Col N="1750" /> is the necessity for the measure? What is the necessity for this permanent and drastic legislation?  I listened carefully yesterday to the speech made by the Minister for Justice and I endeavoured to find in it any evidence of a side and far-reaching conspiracy to overthrow the jury system in this country.</P>
      <P>I listened to that speech and when he is introducing a measure of this kind that is permanent, drastic and far-reaching, I think it is his duty to tell us what is that conspiracy and to produce evidence as to that conspiracy and let the jury know.  Deputy Tierney, of course, treated us to a certain amount of statements that there were conspiracies, that there were actions but he did not tell us what they were.  He did not give us any evidence, I submit.  The first thing that should be done by the Government, before introducing this Bill, is to give evidence to show that this Bill is a necessity and, having shown that it is a necessity, then we can proceed to consider the utility of the measure for the purpose with which it is alleged to deal.  They say there is a conspiracy but I suggest to the Government that the Government after all is but a committee of the citizens of the State and that they have no more right to conspire against the liberty of the citizens, and carry through that conspiracy by force, than any other organisation of the citizens and under this Bill, if it becomes law, the ordinary guarantees and safeties of the average citizen will, to a great measure, disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very nasty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to be as nasty to people who have no patience to wait to hear the truth on both sides.  I warn Deputy O'Kelly of that.  He told us of incidents <Col N="1751" /> that, of course, everybody regrets. He told us of incidents that no considerable number of the citizens of this country stand for or are in favour of.  But I suggest to him that incidents of a similar nature take place in other countries and there is no panicky legislation of this kind.  I suggest to him that he need only do a night's travel and he will find incidents as serious, as grave and as menacing to the State and the citizens of the State, and there is no panicky legislation.  I suggest there are other vast and extensive States, Republics, if you like, where incidents just as serious take place, and there is no panicky legislation to meet them.  Does it mean that the police organisation and the Detective Division here, who were so very well praised here yesterday, and praised on many other occasions, are unable to deal with the criminal forces and the criminal instincts of some people of this State?  If it does, let that failure be confessed, and let some other means be devised to deal with criminal intentions and criminal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as to the utility of the Bill. Not being willing to discuss Deputy de Valera's speech or Deputy Tierney's speech, I do not propose to be very long in considering this measure. The utility of the matter is very important, and if we are to give it any consideration at all we must consider what is its utility.  How does it propose to carry through the object for which it is introduced? How is it proposed to protect jurors? Fiction is full of mystery men who do impossible things on impossible occasions, but the Minister is going to introduce into the Irish State a number of mystery men about whom will hang an atmosphere of mystery and romance.  He is going to number twelve, twenty or thirty men, and he is going to have them empanelled in secret.  He is going to allow the prisoner the right to challenge, but why should a prisoner challenge number forty-six any more than eighty-two, or why should the prisoner challenge number eighty-one <Col N="1752" /> any more than one hundred and fifty if the prisoner does not know whom he is challenging?  What is the good of challenging where he does not know whom he is challenging? The State knows exactly who the people are; it knows whom to challenge; it is not going to be guided by numbers.  It knows the names of the people; the tags are to be put up for the prisoner, and he has no means of discovering who they are.  Having numbered his jurors and empanelled them in secret, so that nobody would know who they are and nobody would be able to do them grievous bodily harm, he proceeds to march them into open court, where they can be recognised.  Was there anything more silly ever introduced into a Bill unless it is seriously considered to close the courts against the public and the Press and give admittance to nobody.  What is the good of putting numbers on the jury inside and marching them out into the jury-box where they can be recognised? Would the Minister tell us what would be the effect or advantage of it towards the jurors?  Of course, perhaps the idea is to close the courts to the public and to close them to the Press.  I know the Minister has power to do it, I know he suggests that it is here in the Bill, that on the sworn statement of a police superintendent the Press and the public can be excluded and you take away from the judge any discretion in the matter.  You put the entire responsibility on the police officer that everybody is to be excluded from the court, and, having empanelled your jury in private, having destroyed the right to challenge of the prisoner, and having, on the evidence of a police superintendent, cleared the court, you proceed to deal with the prisoner in a democratic fashion! Surely, that is a democratically constituted court by a democratically constituted Government!</P>
    <P>I can find no necessity for this Bill, at all events, from what the Minister has told us.  He has given us no evidence as to the necessity for the Bill and no demonstration as to how this Bill will effect the <Col N="1753" /> purpose it was introduced for.  Of course, we are all accustomed to the story of plots, counterplots and such things that have been the stock-in-trade of Governments in this country for ages.  One would have hoped that this Government would have departed from that tradition. One would have hoped, when this Government came to this Dáil with the Bill which they say there is a necessity for, that they would produce sufficient evidence in this Dáil to convince the members that there was a real necessity for it, and having proven that there is a necessity for it that they would proceed to show how it is about to achieve the purpose for which it is introduced. I cannot see the necessity for it or even the utility of it when it is put into operation.  For centuries we have been endeavouring to demonstrate to foreign people that we were worthy of self-government, but as far as I can see, since the present Government came into office, it has been endeavouring to demonstrate that we are incapable of self-government.</P>

Now, what is the plot?  Is there any Deputy in this House who does not know that there is a plot to abolish trial by jury here in certain cases?

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, you said that this is a serious matter.  I regard it as one of the most serious issues that was ever before this House, because I believe I am a democrat and I believe that trial by jury is the most essential but at the same time the most vulnerable institution of democratic government.  I ask here now, and I want an answer to that question, an answer in the way that it should come if any Deputy is to follow me.  Does any Deputy in this House deny that there is a cowardly and well organised attempt to smash trial by jury in this country at the present moment?  I would like an answer to that question and if any Deputy in this House is inclined to <Col N="1757" /> answer no to that question, I ask him another.  What further evidence does he want?  Already one juryman has been badly wounded, already an attempt has been made to murder one juryman, specifically because he gave a verdict and because he did not perjure himself; already a witness in another case has been murdered because he told the truth.  Do you want any further evidence or is this talk all humbug? If you want any further evidence I will give it to you here and now.  I will go a bit further to say, with full responsibility for what I am saying, that I here and now will establish a connection between the party on the benches opposite and the organisation to which belong the members who are doing this.  It is not unknown to the House that there are Republican Organisations outside. There is an organisation called the Fianna.  There is an organisation that calls itself Comlucht na Pobhlachta and it is not unknown to the House that there is an official organ called &ldquo;An Phoblacht.&rdquo;  I will read an extract from it, dated February 23rd, 1929.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In Maryborough Jail Hogan and Con Healy have been treated as ordinary convicts.  The slave-minded jurors who convicted them are responsible, and are paying for their treachery.

This is not a fact.  All good Republicans will be delighted to know that this is not a fact.  He was on that jury. Well he knows it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; of February 23rd, 1929.  The person who writes these articles for &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; is the same person.  I shall read it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As the &lsquo;Prisoners' Notes&rsquo; are often too gloomy, I am going to improve them this week by a few cheering items.  If anyone wants an amusing sight let him venture out on a cold, wet day and view sad and shady-looking C.I.D. men standing outside the houses and also the business premises where the jurymen live or are employed, who were cowardly and misguided enough to convict of treason that Tipperary Volunteer, Con Healy, who has devoted his whole life to unselfish service of the nation, and thus handed him over to British vengeance&mdash;five years in Maryborough hell.  The employers of some of these jurymen are not at all flattered by the assiduities of <Col N="1760" /> the C.I.D.  They have to do business in the Irish nation, and it is never a good business advertisement to be watched by the police; people seem to take malicious pleasure in asking them why their premises are being watched.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This appears on the very same date as the notes in &ldquo;An Phoblacht,&rdquo; after there was an attempt to murder a juryman.  For what?  Because he did not perjure himself&mdash;a fashion able crime in this country.  Where does it appear?  It appears in an organ edited by the Deputy who sits opposite, and to which Deputies on the opposite benches make weekly contributions; it appears in an organ that puts the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party to the country. Who writes it?  The very same person who writes the incitements to murder in &ldquo;An Phoblacht.&rdquo;  Then take &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; of April 6th, 1929:&mdash;&ldquo;Fianna Eireann (Boy Scouts of Ireland)&rdquo;&mdash;we all know them well.  This appeared after the last election in Dublin at which Deputy O'Higgins referred to the men who attempted to murder Mr. White and who murdered the witness as &ldquo;sewer rats&rdquo;&mdash;a perfectly proper term, in my opinion.  He referred specifically to them and here is the comment signed &ldquo;Langlaoich, Chief Scout&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another gentleman who signs himself &ldquo;Director of Organisation.&rdquo;  Here is what he writes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Yesterday England's John French called us vipers.  To-day England's Free State spokesmen call us sewer rats.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men who attempted that murder were called sewer rats by Deputy O'Higgins and they come out with this note in the &ldquo;Nation.&rdquo; What is that?  Is that a condonation of this murder?  Is that a justification in Deputy O'Kelly's paper of this murder?  If it is not, what is it, and what is the explanation of it? If Deputy Hogan wants any further evidence of conspiracy, will he be <Col N="1761" /> good enough to indicate what sort of further evidence he requires?  The Deputy knows it well.</P>
    <P>The very night Mr. Armstrong was murdered Deputy Cooney makes this statement in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the Minister deny, on the other hand, that we have in this State an Executive Council imprisoning men who tear down the Union Jack, which is not the flag of this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have here sheaves of these documents issued by this organisation with which Deputy O'Kelly and the organ which he edits, and to which Deputies opposite contribute, are so closely allied.  Here are some of the contents of these documents:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To Irish Citizens.  Break the connection with the British Empire. The Irish Republican Army are striving to-day as Tone strove in another generation to free Ireland from British rule.  Unfortunately some of Dublin's degenerate and slavish citizens assist them in their work.  Last month the following&rdquo; (then follows a list of jurors, headed by &ldquo;John White, &lsquo;Nevada,&rsquo; 3 Ashdale Road, Terenure)....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every one of the Deputies opposite knows of these, and the cowardly pretence that they do not know that there is an organisation attempting to murder jurors and to break down the law at present is beneath contempt. Every Deputy knows of all these publications&mdash;knows that these organisations are there and issuing these publications.  Here is another, issued the next week, after the job had been done:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Packed Juries: John White, &lsquo;Nevada,&rdquo; 23 Ashdale Road, Terenure (now in Steevens' Hospital)....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan cannot speak again in this debate, but I hope he is satisfied that there is a conspiracy.  If he likes, I shall continue to read further extracts.</P>

      <P>What is the explanation of this?  Why is it that &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; publishes practically the same incitements to and condonation of murder and of this campaign as the organ of the people who are doing this?  I was a little amused listening to Deputy Derrig saying that we were afraid of the Cumann na mBan &mdash;when he was trying to make a joke of this issue and suggesting that all that was behind this Bill was that some member of the organisation known as the Cumann na mBan might shake her fist at the Minister for Justice.  He was indulging in utterly cheap and trifling jeers which are absolutely out of place on a subject like this, and asking what was the reason for this.  I want an answer to another question.  I want to know where Fianna Fáil stands in this matter.  I want to know why it is necessary for their organ&mdash;it may not be their official organ&mdash;to condone this; why it was necessary for Deputy de Valera yesterday practically to condone it, as I will prove out of his own mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall tell Deputies opposite, I told them before.  They need not worry too much about us.  We will not lie awake at night over these matters; we tackled bigger problems than these and solved them and we shall take whatever steps are necessary to save the jury system and jurors in Dublin.  Democracy must protect itself as well as any other form of Government and we would be unworthy of the great men who went before us, and sat on these benches, if we did not take what steps were necessary to protect the right of the citizens to be tried before a judge and jury under an equal law in this country and we will do it, and if necessary abrogate that right for a period.  Deputy Hogan can hear that.  We are not afraid of the Cumann na mBan, or <Col N="1763" /> the little gang who are carrying out this campaign.  I shall tell the House the position of Deputies opposite. It is exactly as I said it was on the Annuities debate.  Any gang of ruffians in this country who shout the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; louder than you are your masters.  You will learn that yet, absolutely.  The day you challenged the Government that had the authority of the Irish people behind it, the day the leader of the party opposite brought about the civil war in this country, and talked about wading through blood, that day he put himself into the position that he is, that he will be, and will always continue to be in, that is at the mercy of any gang of ruffians, no matter how illiterate, how criminal, who care to shout the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; louder than he does.  I say deliberately that the attitude of the party opposite on this Bill can be explained on no other basis except that they are afraid of these men and that they must be their spokesmen and must try to make it impossible for us to deal with them.  But we will deal with them.  I would not make so little of myself as to answer the arguments put forward by the opposite side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney explained that there was a difference between this Government elected by the people in 1922 and Mr. Balfour.  Deputies opposite know that.  Of course, they know it, but they have to keep up the pretence.  They have landed themselves in this particular mess. Deputy Tierney also explained that trial by jury was being attacked. Deputies opposite know that.  Deputy Tierney went to great trouble to explain that if the Party opposite ever got a majority, which they never will, in my opinion, they could abolish the Oath.  Deputies know that; it is sheer waste of time to repeat these arguments to them; they know every bit of them.  You have to use other arguments altogether.</P>
    <P>To get back to Deputy de Valera. He declared: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice had indicated his whole position and the attitude of the <Col N="1764" /> Government in the last part of his speech.  He threatened them with another twist of the screw. Listening to the Minister he (Mr. de Valera) felt that he was reading some of the speeches made by Forster, Balfour, and, in later times, by Sir Hamar Greenwood.  The whole attitude of the Ministry, and particularly the Ministry of Justice, in recent times had been one that proved the thesis maintained by Dr. MacNeill in the old &lsquo;Volunteer&rsquo; days of the continuity of British Government in this country.  The Minister for Justice told them the Bill was an improvement of the law.  But instead it went behind Magna Charta and undid every liberty for which men had been fighting and which they had won.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Coming from the mouth of a man who told the people some years ago that they had no right to do wrong; who told them the issue between majority and minority rule might well have to be bloodily fought out &mdash;I well remember the cliché&mdash;coming from this man it is the most arrant piece of hypocrisy I ever heard of.  He went on to say that the Minister knew perfectly well that this was the kind of a Bill that would receive no sort of support from the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, and further he said: &ldquo;They knew that crimes were committed, but no one on the Fianna Fáil Benches had attempted to condone these crimes.  Was it because those two crimes had been committed that the people were to be deprived of trial by jury&mdash;the only safeguard that a citizen had?&rdquo; Deputies should make no mistake.  We are not concerned with protecting the criminal.  The point of this Bill is not to protect the criminal, but to protect the jurors.  We are thinking of the citizens, we are not thinking of the few criminals in the country, but of the people in the country. With regard to the charge of packing juries, we never pack juries. &ldquo;Was it because one juror was wounded and a witness killed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He quoted the speech made by Mr. Balfour at great length and asked <Col N="1765" /> the House to reject this Bill &ldquo;because there was a way of dealing with the situation&mdash;a way which would be successful where coercion would fail, and that was by giving all the people of the country an opportunity of accepting an Irish Assembly for the making of laws. ...I say a man has a fundamental duty not to be the instrument of corrupt and tyrannical power.&rdquo; You can divide these statements into two classes.  There is one class which points out that we are exactly in the same position as Balfour and Forster&mdash;members of a Government who had no right whatever in this country and who were endeavouring to oppress the country and had no authority from the people.  He tells us, further, that there is a way to settle this question&mdash;that there will be no necessity for this Bill if we scrap the Treaty.  I do not hesitate to say that that is an absolute condonation of what has gone on.  If we are in the position of Forster, we deserve to be shot and we will not whine about it.  If we are in the position of Forster or Balfour, then the Irish people should deal with us. If we have no authority here, we are traitors in this country and the men who are our agents, if you wish, the men who are carrying out the law, judges and jurors, deserve the fate they are getting.  That is the clear implication.  If that is not the implication, what is it?  Of course, again it is the old story&mdash;make a statement sufficiently vague that it can be read by one side in one sense and by another in another.  That brings me back to the &ldquo;wading through blood&rdquo; speech made at a most critical time, 1922.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke about continuity with the British Government. There is continuity there&mdash;it is the same old story&mdash;the man who is always willing to speak daggers but uses none.  I have positively more respect for the men who are committing murder than the men who are giving them authority for doing it because that is giving them authority for doing it.  The Bill may be effective or ineffective but it will be tried and we will take whatever steps are <Col N="1766" /> necessary.  Until the majority of the Dáil turn us out we have a sacred responsibility, and we would be nothing better than arrant poltroons if we did not stand up to that responsibility. Whatever steps may be necessary to deal with this campaign, we shall take.  We have tackled bigger problems.  I read with some amusement.  Deputy Lemass advising us, as an alternative, to sack the heads of the police force.  He spoke of their inefficiency. He is a good judge of inefficiency&mdash; I will say that.  It came rather well from the Deputy who is the spokesman of members of this organisation and who has been squealing in the Dáil for the last six months because of the activities of the C.I.D.  Make no mistake about it.  We have had a pretty troubled time for the last five or six years.  Deputy Hogan will be glad to know that we have made some attempt to establish decent democratic conditions in this country. We have made an attempt to show the British Government that they were wrong&mdash;that it was possible to give every man and woman an equal voice in the running of this country and at the same time establish a decent liberal country with decent liberal, social ideas.  We have done that.  Our reputation is fairly high in that respect all over the world.  We are not going to smirch it now; we are not going to allow any gang of misguided criminals or any persons who may be their patrons to wreck the State, and we are prepared to take any steps necessary to deal with this menace.  I am glad to say that the menace is not nearly as big a problem, is not nearly as dangerous as many of the problems that we met and solved.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has said that he would not make so little of himself as to answer the arguments of the Opposition Party.  He fell back on his old weapon of vituperation.  He asked the a definite question.  He asked the people on this side are they afraid to deny, or will they deny, that there is a conspiracy to break up <Col N="1767" /> the jury system.  I am prepared to admit that there is evidence of a conspiracy to do that.  But the Minister himself says that this is only a gang of misguided criminals who are attempting this, and under cover of this vituperation and the panic of the Front Bench the Government are going to do something to amend the whole criminal law of the country.  If this gang of misguided criminals that the Minister knows so much about are trying to break up the jury system, what excuse is that for the Minister making a farce of the whole system of trial by jury?  Can he not be straight about it and bring into effect some of those emergency measures that they have on their Statute Book?  The Minister said definitely that he was going to establish a connection between the Fianna Fáil Party and the murder gang.  He failed miserably in that attempt.  He quoted a letter from the &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; newspaper, edited by Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He did not.  Let that be taken in any way the Minister likes.  The Minister has not established any connection between this Party and the murder gang, and neither is anyone here afraid to denounce crime wherever he finds it. <Col N="1768" /> What are we asked to do in this Bill?  We are asked to give into the hands of that Government the semblance of trying people by jury, when as a matter of fact it will be drumhead courtmartial that we will have established.  We will have established a perambulating jury; a jury of unknown people can be brought round the country under the provisions of this Bill.  Who is to know but that these people may be members of the C.I.D.?  They may be people who have been found to have returned a satisfactory verdict in other cases and who can be relied on to do the same in the future.  They can be brought into areas where convictions are required&mdash;to do the work that the Executive Council wants them to do. These gentlemen who want to secure that power for themselves are notorious for their contempt of the law.  Starting with the Minister who has just sat down who could not wait for an accused man twelve or eighteen months ago to get an ordinary trial, but had to get up and accuse him of a crime before he had been tried&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The President, on 17th November, 1926, when speaking on another of these panic Bills, the Emergency Powers Bill, referred to a, prisoner awaiting trial, a man who had been arrested in the Midlands. He did not exactly give his name, but everything else.  He indicated beyond yea or nay who the man was and left no doubt in anyone's mind as to the guilt of this man, before that man met his trial.  If that is the respect for the ordinary, decent law which every plain citizen knows should be observed when a man is on trial for his life or liberty, then I make him a present of their respect for the law.</P>
      <P>I pass over the Minister's statement that this was the most disgraceful debate he ever listened to, because I heard him say the same on practically every debate here.  He said the same on the Unemployment Debate, when Deputies from every Party, including his own Party, gave a picture of the state of destitution to which their constituents were reduced. On that occasion the Minister for Agriculture got up and said he was ashamed of them for showing their sores in public.  In fact, in every debate of any sort in this House the Minister has adopted the same attitude.  It is a pity anyone else is allowed to talk at all except the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>We had to-day an example of acting in haste and repenting at leisure as the first business of the day.  At the time I withdrew the implication or the suggestion that I made I said that the President had got a cut-and-dried scheme, and, of course, he had not, because the thing was too foolish.  But he was able to get his solid majority to follow him into the lobby in favour of the most foolish resolution that was ever put before the House when the people of all parties sat down to consider it. We had the spectacle before the whole House of that resolution. What is going to happen to this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had desperate measures brought in here, and big majorities for them, and then these measures were left in abeyance.  We were told that the whole life of the nation and <Col N="1770" /> the future of the country were depending upon them, and then nothing was done.  As Deputy Hogan very clearly pointed out, there is something serious behind this Bill. If it were an Emergency Bill we might pass it and never use it.  But it is another of these stunts.  There is another election coming off.  The speech in the Rotunda was on the eve of the election in North Dublin. There is another by-election coming off in Sligo-Leitrim, and this is another emergency measure to meet the case of the election in Sligo-Leitrim. It is simply a by-election stunt, but it is more serious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan wanted to know what about the ordinary citizens. He belongs to a Party that more or less did not take part in the struggle as we did here.  Speaking for the ordinary citizen, are you going to allow vituperative speeches like that of the Minister to carry you off your feet, to carry you away from your better judgment, so that the permanent criminal law of the country may be altered because what the Minister calls a gang of misguided criminals are attempting to break up the jury system?  If there is such a situation let them bring in some of their emergency measures to deal with it.  The President, when he found how far the words that he would like to have confined to North Dublin travelled, when he found they got to Australia, to America, and to the rest of the world, was very anxious to make clear that the situation was not nearly as bad as his speech would indicate.  In fact, things were almost normal.</P>

It does not matter whether the case has a political significance.  This is going to be the law of the country, and before people allow the Minister for Agriculture, with all his abuse and vituperation, to rush them off their feet, they should consider that aspect.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on the question of prisoners in March, 1928, and I made a suggestion there which, if adopted, would have obviated a lot of trouble.  I claim to be a lover of peace although on a few occasions I did things that might not have have been too peaceful.  However, I made a desperate effort on that occasion to get the Government to exercise a bit of commonsense and wipe the state. I appealed to them to give a chance to the people on the run and to stop the civil war.  They turned down that suggestion.  For the benefit of the Minister who is present I will read a small passage from the remarks I made in 1928.  I believe if my suggestion had been acted upon we would not have had all this trouble.  Let me not now be taken as trying to justify the shooting of Mr. White or Mr. Armstrong.  I say that if the suggestion I made at that time had been acted on there would have been none of the shooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 21st March, 1928, I spoke about the harsh treatment meted out to one prisoner who came out, being forced out by economic causes.  He got nine months for escaping, for walking out of the prison.  I went on to say: &ldquo;The others are going to keep as they are until they are <Col N="1772" /> beaten.  On the occasion that I refer to, I also suggested to the Minister that the practice of bounding down these men on the run, as well as the incident that occurred a couple of days before in Clonmel, when one of those escaped men was fired on and wounded by the Guard would inevitably, if the Government did not take a decent line in this matter, lead to somebody amongst those prisoners firing back on the Guards.  I am forced back to the statement I made in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate when I said that every effort that had been made by this Party here either to forget the past or to get the country into a decent line of ordered government again has been simply turned down, and that one attempt after another has been made to stir up strife again.&rdquo;  The root cause of all this was that there were men hounded down.  They were not going to face nine months' imprisonment. Some men are hotter than others and when they were pursued there was always the danger that they would fire back.  One of them did and he got five years.  If the Government had given them a chance and wiped the slate clean there would be none of this.</P>
    <P>Is there such a situation in the country at present that the Government is justified in bringing in this measure to alter permanently the fundamental criminal law?  If there is, then the President's contradictions of reports in the American Press and of Mr. Ketchem's articles are wrong.  President Cosgrave said that things are practically normal. He said there was a small gang. Surely he will not hold that a small gang of people, who are probably known, is going to be the excuse for altering the criminal law so as to remove all public confidence in fair trial.  That point is especially important because this is a Government elected by the Irish people.  This Government have, on my own showing, been guilty of contempt of court because Ministers stated in this House that people who were not tried but who were in custody were guilty. We are told when we say that a person should be considered innocent <Col N="1773" /> until proved guilty that we are using a cliché of British Liberalism. I do not care what it is; I maintain it is a sound principle and it is a protection for the ordinary citizen. A man should be considered innocent until he is proved guilty.  We are told that is a cliché of British origin. The whole thing reminds me of the man who got a steam-hammer to break a nut.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that they have been examining closely the working of the jury system; that they were going to improve the jury system by this Bill which makes it possible for one jury to try all the cases they want to try.  The Minister said they were obliged to alter things to meet present day requirements.  That is a very significant statement to make. Deputy Flinn suggests that Sligo-Leitrim is the excuse and I think that is about the size of it.  Other methods, we are told, will be used. I suggest that if the situation is so serious those other methods should be used.  There are all sorts of threats by Government speakers.  If the situation is as bad as they say, let them try those other methods and leave the jury system alone.  Some Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Hogan&mdash;said, quite truly too, that even with the case of a juryman being killed, or a sheriff, the present law would be able to deal with the people who did it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney made a statement with which I entirely agree.  He admitted that this organisation would die if violence were not used against it.  I claim that violence has been used by the Government to keep that organisation in existence.  I said last March twelve months that the very action you were taking was keeping this organisation in existence.  I agree with Deputy Tierney although he meant it the other way.</P>
    <P>It comes to the same thing.  We came to the same conclusion from different sides and we met in the centre.  Violence begets violence. They have made no attempt to treat the thing in a decent, straightforward, and manly way.  They are going on with this vituperation, pin-pricking, and steam-hammering.  They <Col N="1774" /> came in to-day with another emergency measure to deal with disorder but they asked the House to discharge the order in that case.  I think they would have more respect from this Party and from the rest of the country if they treated the thing in a decent and manly way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this measure from a rather narrow angle. I represent County Dublin which supplies jurors, one of whom was &ldquo;only wounded.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee appears to sneer, but I would ask him to reply to questions which I shall put up.  I am speaking for the people of County Dublin who sent me here, and they are the persons for whom this Bill is drafted. It is a Bill entitled an Act to make further and better provision for the protection of jurors and others concerned. That is the first reason why I speak.  The second reason is because it was suggested here last evening that I never make a speech in this House because I am afraid. Whoever said that probably does not know me.  The third reason why I speak is that I promise not to go back beyond the Act of Union.  I happen to have the Official Reports here, and there is one quotation which I will make from them. After Deputy Boland's statement about terrorism, pin-pricks, sledge hammers and everything else, I would ask the House to listen to this quotation.  Some Deputies will, no doubt, recall it, and those who cannot will hear it.  On the 20th December, 1921, a Deputy speaking in Dáil Eireann asked: &ldquo;Who would sit in judgement on the Irish people?&rdquo; President de Valera replied: &ldquo;Themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is the principle which this Bill insists upon, namely, that the Irish people have the right to sit in judgement upon themselves.  I am quoting the words of the Leader of the Official Opposition himself and I want him and the House to understand that his statement last evening, when he went beyond the Act of Union and quoted speeches made in the British House of Commons, was answered by himself on <Col N="1775" /> the 20th December, 1921, when he said that the Irish people are the only and competent judges as to what is and what is not right in this country.  If the people desire to change what is called the criminal law in this country they have a right to do it whether it is for good or evil.  I believe that any measure which this House would pass to protect the jurors of the country, especially those of the County of Dublin, in whom Deputy MacEntee and myself are so interested, would have the whole-hearted support of the people of this country.  It is very easy to get up in this House and say that So-and-so said that twenty years ago, that Balfour said that thirty years ago, or that somebody else said something else over a hundred years ago.  It is easy to read out a series of Acts of repression which were passed by the British Houses of Parliament which purported to make laws for this country.  It is an insult to this House to suggest that the laws which are enacted here are to be put on a parallel with those enacted in the British House of Commons, ten, twenty, or fifty years ago.  The regrettable situation is that the chief Opposition in this House will not take upon itself the responsibility of condemning these crimes.  I heard Deputy Tierney say that Deputy de Valera said that there was only one man wounded.  If I remember rightly, and I am prepared to be corrected, Deputy de Valera said that if there were ten or fifteen wounded was it not better than that something else should happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know either&mdash;that is the catch&mdash;probably better that something else should happen than that one innocent man should be convicted.  At least, that, I think, is what he meant.  Is it not better that one, ten, or fifteen jurors should be only wounded than that one innocent man should be convicted? <Col N="1776" /> That is not the principle at stake in this Bill at all.  I hope that no innocent man will be found guilty.  I regret to think that the ordinary criminal law, as they call it, is being paraded here, and it is suggested that Deputies on the other side of the House stand up for the ordinary criminal law.  It is great for them to do so to-day, and to think that now all we want is the ordinary criminal law.  Occasions were when it did not please them.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Agriculture is right when he says that the members on the benches opposite must take their full responsibility for the happenings in this country They must take responsibility for what may happen as the result of statements made in this House last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council were described, not individually, but so far as I remember, as the Balfours and Forsters.  I know that Deputy de Valera will come in and say: &ldquo;I never said that.&rdquo;  What did he mean when he talked about Sergeant Sheridans?  That is the ordinary criminal law which they want to stand over to-day.  They say that it is being filched from them.  They say that they want the Sergeant Sheridans and that they want the laws administered to them by the Forsters.  Deputy de Valera recalled even the Maam Cross murders and talked of the tyranny of the law. He declaimed that he was the one Deputy in the House who loved fair play.  He appealed to the consciences of members on this side of the House.  I wonder does the Deputy realise that there are other people besides himself who have consciences.  Will the Deputy's conscience awaken to a sense of responsibility in regard to the speech he made last night, and to other speeches, if another juror is only wounded, or if another witness is only murdered?  Will he then come back to the House and say: &ldquo;You misinterpreted me,&rdquo; as he said in a famous speech that there were still in this county young men who might have to wade through the blood of Irish soldiers or Irish Ministers? <Col N="1777" /> He will come back and say: &ldquo;That is not what I meant, but that is what people will say I meant.&rdquo;  He is the person who has said it.  It all comes back to the question of respect for this House as the law-making authority in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera and his Party must accept that or not accept it. If he gets up in this House and says he does not accept it let the country decide.  If the country is not satisfied with what Deputy Boland and Deputy Lemass are so pleased with, the common criminal law, they can alter it.  They have the right to do wrong.  On the 20th December, 1921, the Leader of His Majesty's Opposition in this House accepted that.  &ldquo;Who will sit in judgment on the Irish people?&mdash;President de Valera; Themselves.&rdquo;  The Irish people have sat in judgment and have decided this matter.</P>

      <P>This is a quotation from another poster: &ldquo;Jurors, who prove their loyalty to the British Empire by convicting Irish Republican political prisoners, to be given a free passage for self and family to any desired part of the Empire&mdash;(Better protection guaranteed than that given to the unfortunate Carey).&rdquo;  While Deputies on the opposite benches have not condemned these things they have used every opportunity of attacking the institutions which this House and the country have set up in this State to preserve order, whether it is the Gárda Síochána, the Courts of Justice, or the prisons they detest so much.  They have used every opportunity of freedom which the House gives them to attack these institutions. If, as I have said, in two or three months, another juror or ten or fifteen jurors, as Deputy de Valera said, are &ldquo;only wounded&rdquo; and other witnesses are &ldquo;only murdered,&rdquo; I hope he will come back to the House and say, &ldquo;Yes, these are the words I did use on that occasion.&rdquo; Deputy Boland spoke at some length in an attack on the administration of justice.  There is a way of dealing with that.  This Bill intends to protect jurors and witnesses concerned in the criminal trials and proposes for that purpose to amend the Juries Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that there is no reason why solicitors and counsel should be excluded from the courts. I am sure the Minister knows that <Col N="1779" /> they are persons who would not avail of any information they would receive in court to do anything which would be derogatory to the strict administration of justice.  I think it is very important that every step should be taken to protect jurors, even that of numbering them.  As I said in opening, a very large number of them come from County Dublin, which I represent. I think every step should be taken to make it more difficult for persons who desire to kill them and to make it more difficult for persons of the type of Deputy de Valera and his followers to get up here when an unfortunate man has been killed or wounded and say &ldquo;that is what he deserved.&rdquo;  I desire to support the Bill as representing a class from whom the jurors of the country are chiefly drawn.</P>

      <P>I do not accept for a moment the view of the Deputy that more latitude is given when I am out of the Chair than when I am in it.  I have heard the reverse view also put very strongly.

      <P>The whole point that I had to make was that we were accused of being connected in some mysterious way or another with these armed men.  The Minister for Agriculture deliberately made that statement.  He made it in a very eloquent fashion, and having set out to prove it, he merely gave a few quotations from some papers and then proved nothing.  My whole case is, that if there are armed men in the country those armed men were brought into existence by certain articles that were written previously, and that there is a continuity between those articles and the armed men that we have in the country at the present day.  However, if I am not allowed to give the quotations perhaps I will be allowed to prove the three points that I set out to prove.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not attempt anything so nonsensical as to connect somebody who had something to do with the starting of the Volunteers sixteen years ago with the armed men of to-day.  I had not the pleasure of listening to the Minister for Agriculture, and I do not know what attempt he made to connect the chief Opposition Party with the armed men of to-day.  I feel certain that if he did try to make a connection that it had relation to to-day and not to sixteen years ago.  I think it is entirely beside the point to make a case against the men who were in the organisation of Volunteers.  The opponents of the measure here, as Deputy O'Higgins said last night, try to make a case for the man on trial, be he guilty or innocent.  We would all like to make that case, but there is a man entitled to consideration before the person on trial, and that is the man who is called in from his business or ordinary calling to serve on a jury for the trial of a case.  We have not heard from the chief Opposition members any genuine expression of regret, at least as far as I have heard, of the treatment of jurymen in Dublin.  No suggestion has been made by that Opposition Party that would offer security to those people.  When a man is taken from his ordinary calling and brought into court to deliver a verdict, he is bound by his oath, and he calls upon his Creator to witness <Col N="1785" /> the truth of his verdict.  I believe the Government that calls on a man to perform that duty has an obligation towards him to see that he is protected and that he will not suffer for any verdict he brings in.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said yesterday that the existing law was sufficient for his protection.  I wonder has Deputy de Valera been living in the moon, or has he been living in Dublin city, or has he been viewing those things through smoked glasses which give whatever hue he wants?  Not only did Deputy de Valera say that, but to the ordinary man listening to his speech there ran through it an undercurrent, if I may say so, of approval of the treatment jurors were receiving.  Has the ordinary law given sufficient protection to jurors?  One juryman was shot at and wounded and a man who gave evidence was murdered.  Of what use was the ordinary law to these people, and is it because they were only jurymen that they should not get protection?  If these people happened to be prominent politicians they would probably get the sympathy of Deputy de Valera, but is it because they are ordinary citizens called in from their every day work to do this duty that they are not entitled to protection?  Refusal to provide protection is to my mind a condonation of the crime of shooting down these people.  I cannot see anything else to it.  If the Government of the day does not give these people protection, if the members of this House will not give them protection, then refusal to do so is nothing less than a condonation of the crime of shooting these jurymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid it could be read into Deputy de Valera's speech that not alone was the existing law good enough for the protection of these people, but that the treatment they were getting was also good enough for them.  I am not prepared to support the Bill before the House as a permanent measure, and I will not do it.  I am prepared, as Deputy Anthony said he was last night, to support any measure which will give protection to the jurymen, even to the extent of the abandonment of the <Col N="1786" /> jury system altogether for a time, but I am not prepared to support a measure that will hand down to posterity an Act which is nothing more or less than a prostitution of the jury system.  I cannot imagine the application of this Act under normal, peaceful conditions in the country, and I would like to hear from the Minister for Justice if he is satisfied that in normal times this Juries Act would give satisfaction.  Personally, I cannot see how in normal peace times there would be any commonsense in calling it a jury system, where the accused person was tried by unknown people.  I have very little faith in the Bill.  I am afraid it will not achieve its object, but the Government is obliged to protect the jurymen.  It is obliged to put down crime, and if the Government thinks that this Bill is sufficient to meet the needs of the day, very well, I am prepared to support it as an emergency measure, but not otherwise.</P>

What guarantee has Deputy Anthony that it will ever reach Committee?  Personally, I have none. I think it would be better if Deputy Anthony and other people who feel as he does would appeal to the Minister to have this as an emergency measure, and an emergency measure only, so that we can give it the support the Government thinks it ought to get and which one would like to <Col N="1787" /> give it for the sake of the people whom it seeks to protect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have listened to a very interesting speech, and a very interesting revelation of a Deputy's mentality when he, a man apparently who is considered fitted by a certain section of citizens in the country to represent them, is prepared, temporarily even, to support a measure which he himself describes as a prostitution of the jury system.  I am not going to repeat the phrase.  I think the fact that it has been said once in this House ought to suffice for this Bill.  It ought also to suffice for the constituents of any Deputy who is going to support such a measure as this, even temporarily.  But it is not going to be a temporary measure: according to the Minister who introduced it, it is not going to be &ldquo;a mere temporary expedient, but a permanent measure.&rdquo;  Those are the Minister's own words&mdash;&ldquo;not a mere temporary expedient, but a permanent measure,&rdquo; and I would ask the Deputy, who, I presume, will go into the Division Lobby to support this as a temporary measure, to go into that Lobby realising that it is not, in the words of the Minister, &ldquo;a mere temporary expedient, but a permanent measure.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's contribution to the liberty of the subject under a Constitution which we have been told is a free Constitution.  I would like the Deputy to understand also that this measure does not apply only to those to whom Deputy Tierney, I think, referred as &ldquo;extraordinary criminals.&rdquo; It applies to every single citizen of this State who may be charged, rightly or wrongly, with an offence against the laws of this State. It does not apply only to those who may be thought to be responsible for the recent attacks upon jurors; it applies to every single citizen, not to <Col N="1788" /> that little isolated group, but to the 2,900,000 people who live under this Constitution.  That is the gravamen of this Bill, and that is the gravamen of the offence which the Minister and the Executive Council are committing against the liberties of this people.  They are making an excuse of what is, in my opinion, a mere sporadic outburst, which already, I believe, those who are guilty of have repented, deliberately to destroy what is written in the Constitution as one of the fundamental liberties of the people.</P>
      <P>I condemn, and wholeheartedly condemn, the attacks upon the jurors. I condemn any man who takes the life of another without due and proper trial in open court before a jury of that man's countrymen.  And because I do condemn it and because I reprobate it utterly, I am absolutely and bitterly opposed to this Bill.  I say that this is a remedy which is bound to fail, that it is a Bill which is not justified in the excuse which has been made here for its introduction.  No honest, right-thinking man in the country condones, in any way, the attacks upon the jurors.  No significant section of the people support those who were engaged in them, and therefore the attacks upon the jurors ought not to be made the excuse for interfering with the rights of the vast majority of the citizens.  If a mad dog were to run amok I do not think that any person would contend that it would be a proper remedy for that situation that the citizens as a whole should be maimed.  Yet that is what the Minister who introduced this Bill proposes to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not muzzling any dog.  This measure relates to the trial of certain prisoners, to men who are possibly being apprehended on suspicion and who, if they are brought to trial, must be brought to trial on evidence.  I have not yet heard that those who are responsible for the attacks upon the jurors have been apprehended.  This Bill does <Col N="1789" /> not propose to make it easier to apprehend or to detect those persons. It proposes to make it easier for the Executive to secure the conviction not only of those prisoners, ordinary or extraordinary, who offend against laws which have a political complexion, but of those who offend against laws which have a purely ethical justification.  Irrespective of whatever class of law they offend against, this Bill is designed to make it easier for the Executive to secure the conviction of those people whom they wish to arraign before a judge and a packed jury.</P>
      <P>The President has told the people of the world of the wonderful progress which we are making under his régime.  This Bill is the finest example of that progress which could possibly be produced.  Like a crab, it progresses backwards.  It goes back, not merely to the age of Queen Anne but, in the words of the Minister for Justice himself, to the golden age of Justinian when jurors were swept away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister told us that it proposed to repeal a Statute passed about 1854, that it proposed, in his own words, to make the jury panel a confidential official document.  Why should the Minister hold that out to the Dáil as a desirable thing?  Surely if men are to be tried as they ought to be tried, in open court, before the eyes of the people, the people are entitled to know, apart altogether from the rights of the prisoner in the matter, the names of those who will constitute the jury which will deliver the verdict.  It has been held that the publicity given to the jury panel is a very vital and a very important safeguard for the prisoner.  The Minister for Justice himself admitted that though the right was only enjoyed in a certain limited way in England, it was yielded to the prisoner in the most important cases and in the most important issues upon which a citizen can be brought to trial.  In England, though it may be withheld in a case of murder, though it may be withheld in other cases where a man is charged with crimes of dishonesty, <Col N="1790" /> in cases which have a political complexion, where an issue is to be tried out between a citizen on the one and and the Executive on the other, the right of scrutinising the jury panel is yielded freely to the prisoner. The Minister admitted that in cases of treason and misprision of treason, in these vitally important cases, the gravest crimes known to the English law, the prisoner is entitled to secure the publication of the jury panel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But in case of a like kind in this country the only justification which the Minister has for introducing this Bill is that here, where it is more important, possibly, than in England, in order that the confidence of all men may be established in the Executive and in the Judiciary, in order that those who have been divided most widely by bitter political differences may be taught and made to feel that they will secure justice in the courts of this country, the right which is yielded freely in England is, by this Bill, to be denied to its citizens.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins accused us of speaking in this debate as though the only people in this country who matter were the prisoners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an accurate representation of our attitude. There are other things to be considered.  We say that not only do the prisoners matter, but other things matter.  The due discharge of justice, the administration and the preservation of the law also matter. But above and over all, the great thing that matters is that justice should be done and that a man should be fairly and openly tried, that he should know beforehand those before whom he will be arraigned, that he may have an opportunity of scrutinising the panel of jurors, that that panel may not be constituted without his knowledge in such a way that there may be included upon it persons, possibly <Col N="1791" /> unknown to him, who, because of some political, business or family feud, some difference of religion or of political principle, may be so prejudiced that they may not be able to yield him a fair trial.  Men's minds are often so warped that even by the exercise of their will they are unable to adjudicate fairly on some issues.  Therefore it is of the utmost importance that the fullest publicity should be given to the jury panel, so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they should be shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an excellent exemplification of the attitude of the Minister and of the Minister's supporters in this matter&mdash;if a man differs from them they believe he should be shot.  A number of them have shot men that have differed from them, without even the appearance of the mock trial that is going to be afforded under this Bill.  The point I was making was this, that it was quite possible that there would be included on a jury panel the names of people unknown to the accused, who, because of some political or religious difference or other affiliation of theirs would not be capable of doing justice between him and the State.  There are in this country of ours, unfortunately, two secret organisations.  One, I believe, is established on a definitely religious basis; the other is established on at least a non-sectarian basis.  Supposing the Grand Panjandrum of one of these organisations, for some reason or other, has incurred the enmity of the Executive of this State, and they decide to bring him to trial, how better could they secure his conviction than by seeing that the jury panel was constituted of members of the rival secret organisation?  The person brought to trial might be utterly unaware that the members of the jury panel were members of the rival organisation.  None of them would be known to him either by name or by sight, and yet they certainly would be, I believe, incapable of giving him a fair trial under certain circumstances.  It possibly would <Col N="1792" /> depend upon the charge in the indictment, but, if the jury panel were published, it would be then open to the accused's friends, with their wider knowledge of men, to come and point out the names of men on that jury panel who, because of their known associations, would be incapable of giving him that fair trial, and they would put him in a position to object in open court to the inclusion of such men in the jury empanelled to try him.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that not only is the panel to be a confidential document, but the very identities of the jurymen are to be lost.  Their names are to be kept secret, divulged to no independent man, not even to the prisoner; they are to be known only to those officials of the Executive who are charged with the conduct of the trial and prosecution. Every precaution is to be taken to ensure that that secrecy is preserved. The jury is to be summoned by stealth&mdash;summoned by post.  The jurors are to notify their attendance by stealth.  Not once are the chosen agents of the Executive to appear in the light of open day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 4 of the Minister's offspring they are to come early in the morning, to whisper their names to a certain functionary of the court, and then they are to depart, no man knowing whence they came, no man knowing whither they are going.  No man to challenge whether they are honest citizens or ruffians.  You can picture them stealing away, coming to the court early in the morning like members of an Italian conspiracy, or of the Ku Klux Klan and whispering to the officer of the court that the conspiracy is all complete, that the bravadoes are all present and ready so that the trial may now proceed.  In what country except this, under what Executive except this, would such an atmosphere of conspiracy be permitted to pollute the courts of justice?  Not even when the prisoner is arraigned is he going to know the names of the men who are about to try him.  Those names are to be kept secret.  Under Section 4 (d) of this Bill we read: &ldquo;...every <Col N="1793" /> person attending the court as a juror shall be called, addressed, and referred to for all purposes in the court solely by the number by which he is distinguished on the panel of jurors from which he is drawn and no such person shall be called, addressed, or referred to in the court by his name, nor shall the address or description of any such person be called or mentioned in the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every precaution is to be taken to ensure that the names of those persons who are empanelled to try the issue between the Executive, on the one hand, and the citizens on the other, will be kept secret from the people of this State.  The jury is no longer to be constituted of twelve citizens, but of twelve cyphers&mdash; twelve changing and unstable cyphers, of uncertain and unascertainable identity&mdash;with no precaution and no safeguard, as Deputy Boland pointed out, to ensure that the same juror, or batch of jurors, who have proved themselves the ready and pliable instruments of the Executive, will not be empanelled over and over again, under varying numbers, to try those prisoners whose conviction the Executive wishes to ensure.  It may be said that that is possibly an extravagant construction to put upon the section, but it is quite clear from the Bill that that sort of procedure can take place.  This Bill opens the way to that abuse, and once the way is opened a hard-pressed Executive is sure to take advantage of the facility offered for that sort of thing by this Bill.  We will have professional jurors springing up&mdash;jurors who, because they are ready to do the will of the Executive, will have great influence with the Executive and will be able to operate the channels of patronage, will be able to do good turns for their friends because they are the faithful servitors of the Executive, and though they will not be paid they will be, by reason of the patronage which they control, and of the influence which they exercise, as much professional jurors as if they were receiving a daily stipend.</P>
    <P>They will do as they are told until at last the whole jury system, prostituted <Col N="1794" /> as Deputy Brennan said by this measure, is brought into disrepute and becomes an abomination in the minds of all honest men.  Possibly, that is the position which the Executive Council wishes to bring about with these jurymen No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and so on ad infinitum. The C.U.R.'s, as they will come to be called&mdash;Cosgrave's universal robots of jurymen&mdash;mere mechanical voting machines empanelled to ensure, as I said before, that the conviction of an enemy of the Executive Council will inevitably take place.  Possibly, that is the consummation to which the Minister for Justice is looking forward, that this system which he is now initiating will become so odious that what happened in what the Minister described as the golden age of Justinian will come about and jurors will be swept away, and that the Minister, who so far has established no claim upon the recollection of posterity, will be remembered by it as the Minister for Justinianism. When the Minister was first nominated to his present place on the Executive the country wondered at this strange and unknown name.  We wondered with the rest, and when we came into this House and saw the Minister in his place on the Government Bench, with uncongenial and unaccustomed colleagues, looking as much out of place as an egg shell in mayonnaise, we wondered what had brought him there, but when we heard him speak in this House that wonder was dissolved, because we heard then the true accents of Hamar Greenwood and we knew at once the Minister's justification in the Government.  Is his a case of political atavism?  This stone-age revival, this last of the Chief Secretaries who has so steeped himself in British coercion Acts that his very soul has become pickled, has been dug up by the Executive.</P>

But before it becomes too late I would ask members of this House, those of them who because they are not mere political hacks, those of them who were elected as honest citizens to represent honest citizens, those of them who feel that the liberties of Irishmen are as sacred and should be held as high as the liberties of men of any <Col N="1796" /> other nationality, that they will not permit the Statute Book even of the Irish Free State, the Statute Book which this Legislature can write, to be disgraced by writing upon it a Bill so destructive of the elementary, fundamental rights of the citizens as this Bill, which has been misnamed the Juries Protection Bill, but is really meant and designed to make easy for the Executive the packing of juries and the securing of partisan verdicts against those who are its political opponents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very great pleasure to me to hear Deputy MacEntee say he did not condone the attacks upon the jurors in the city. of Dublin.  He went on to say that no decent man would condone them. I would point out to Deputy MacEntee that although this sympathy is very welcome in this House, unfortunately it will not give back to the family of Mr. Armstrong the man who has been shot down by the bullet of the assassin.  In considering the Bill now before the House, we are faced with two alternatives, either the abolition of trial by jury or the maintenance of the present jury system.  It has been generally agreed in this House that trial by jury is the best system of the administration of justice and that, therefore, it should be maintained. But if trial by jury is to remain in this country it is the fundamental duty of this State to protect the jurors who act upon these panels from either the threat of violence or the bullet of the assassin.  Jurors, without any pecuniary reward and at great personal loss, perform their duty to the country and their reward is that death is dealt out to them at their homes in the night.  I suggest that there is a grave duty upon this State to say that this state of affairs must come to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The citizens of this State, particularly those whom I represent, have been generally and grossly intimidated. Threatening notices have been received.  They have been served on people known to be about to act on these juries and the whole object sought to be achieved was the abolition <Col N="1797" /> of the system of trial by jury. I need not remind the House of the tragedies which have happened in this State, but what I particularly want to remind the House and the Opposition of is what remedy do they propose.  Deputy MacEntee has offered this House sympathy but this House needs something more practical than sympathy.  This House wants something that will be a remedy for the existing state of affairs.  We have been told that the Bill the Minister has just introduced is a coercion Bill which cannot succeed, that all coercion Bills have failed and that the rights of prisoners must be maintained.  I, for one, will not contend for a moment that the rights of every prisoner put before the Bar are not sacred rights. I will not for a moment contend that these rights are not of outstanding importance, but what I would ask Deputy MacEntee and the Opposition is this: do the rights of one prisoner at the bar outweigh the rights of the twelve men empanelled to do justice to the State and the prisoner.  What about these twelve men acting there without fee or reward? Are they entitled to no protection? Have they no privileges and does the State owe to these twelve men no obligation?  Why did not Deputy MacEntee and those associated with him deal with that aspect of the question?</P>
    <P>A challenge has undoubtedly been thrown down to this State.  The Minister for Agriculture has made it perfectly clear in this House that a decided challenge has been thrown down to this State, and it is the duty of this State to take this challenge up.  The Bill is a very reasonable Bill which every reasonable man should support, a Bill with few faults and a Bill that can easily be amended and which, with the good will of this House, should be very considerably improved.  The Bill, we are told, will not remedy the defects it sets out to remedy.  There is one thing the Bill will do, and that is, it will render the obtaining of the jury panels in the future a very difficult matter for those gunmen who obtained them so easily in the past.  The jury panel <Col N="1798" /> in future will be a confidential document, and Deputy MacEntee suggests that this means a sort of KuKlux Klan.  Was there ever such absurdity put before a House as arguments of that particular kind? Simply because the names of the jury will not be known to those who shot them down, something secret, something hidden and something mystical exists in that.</P>
    <P>One of the members of the Labour Benches told us it was almost a futile proceeding to introduce a Bill containing sections of this kind.  He told us that these men will be in open court and that they will be recognised, and that the same action can be taken in the future as has already been taken in the past.  I suggest that the difficulties will now be a thousand fold greater to carry out the objects of this secret organisation under this Bill than those existing up to the present moment.  The terrorising of jurors by circular, under this Bill, will become an exceedingly difficult and dangerous matter.  The names of those actually serving on the jury will be almost impossible to obtain, and unless that information should come from the jury themselves, and I am sure that people, who have the good citizenship to serve upon juries, who have faced the danger that serving upon juries has involved, will not be the people to give away the names of their colleagues who have done their duty to the State.</P>
    <P>We are told that this Bill destroys constitutional liberty, the liberty of the subject, whereas in reality, this Bill is an honest attempt not to destroy but to maintain the rights of the citizen against the bullets of the assassin.  We will be told here, and we were told here from the Labour Benches, a rather amazing thing, that non-recognition of the court is not a crime.  What does non-recognition of the court imply?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party.  Non-recognition of the court implies that the courts you have set up to try criminals are a mere travesty and that they have <Col N="1799" /> no foundation in fact.  When the prisoner says, &ldquo;I decline to recognise your court,&rdquo; he says in effect &ldquo;I decline to recognise your law and I refuse to obey your law,&rdquo; and when a man says that, knowing what the consequences are, declining to recognise the just and the right authority of the State to which he owes his duty and allegiance, then I say that man becomes an ordinary criminal, that, as an ordinary criminal, he is entitled to his punishment, and if he is a man he will take that punishment without whining. There can be no doubt that there is a secret conspiracy in existence at the moment which is challenging the very existence of this State, and if those people who constitute these secret bodies intend in future to carry on their nefarious work which they have been successful in carrying on up to the moment, then it is time that this non-recognition of the court should receive the just penalty it ought to receive.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera told us that if juries followed the proper course they would refuse to serve on such juries and that they would take the consequences.  The State in this Bill is determined to afford the amplest protection in its power to those acting upon juries.  They have determined that those who interfere with trial by jury must take the consequences and must pay the price. Deputy de Valera further says that there is another way.  The jury may take another course.  They jury may in verdicts that will show that they have no sympathy with the law and that the people have no sympathy with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, in plain language, does that mean?  In plain language that simply means condonation of perjury.  Men serving on a jury take a solemn oath to find a true verdict on the facts of the case presented before them.  Deputy de Valera exhorts these jurors&mdash;the common, plain citizens of this country&mdash;to commit perjury, and for what?  To protect the assassin and bring contempt upon the law.  I suggest that is a <Col N="1800" /> very serious step for the leader of a great Party, for the leader of the official Opposition in this House.  I suggest that it is subversive of all law, and I go further and say that these people, who have posed in this House as the champions of the liberties and rights of the people, when they advocate a policy such as that they are advocating the subversion of all individual liberty, and that that can end only in bringing disaster upon themselves and upon the State.</P>
    <P>The Public Safety Act is gone. There were many Deputies on these benches who appealed to the Executive to repeal that Act, and when that Act has been removed from the Statute Book the consequence is the shooting of jurymen in this city.  If trial by jury goes what will happen ultimately to this country?  The Minister has told this House plainly in very quiet and unassuming language that the Executive are prepared to take further steps if necessary if this Bill fails.  This Bill is an honest, reasonable and fair attempt to maintain the existing law.  If this Bill should fail in its operation, it will be a really serious thing&mdash;it will be a disastrous thing for this country.</P>

      <P>What is the alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>You have one alternative. We have removed one Public Safety Act, and I am sure it will not be in the interests of the country if it should be necessary to have that Act renewed again.  There are many alternatives.  We have been told, with the usual want of logic, that this is a Bill for all time.  Deputy Little knows something about the law.  Perhaps he will tell us what Bill ever lasted for all time. He knows as well as I do that Bills that were passed with the deliberate object of lasting for all time did not last for all time, and could not last for all time.  This Bill has been brought in under very difficult circumstances, to cope with a very difficult situation.  We did not expect the Minister to say that the Bill had been introduced for six or twelve <Col N="1801" /> months, or whatever particular period may please those on the Opposition Benches.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee evidently has very little faith in the coming into power of his Party.  He told us that the writing was on the wall&mdash;that the writing on the wall after the North City election was more plain and more deeply engraved than before. If that is the case, surely the remedy would lie in the hands of Deputy MacEntee and his Party, by wiping out this Bill in a short period of time when they hope to take up office here.  If the liberties of the subjects of this State are to be maintained and the rights of the ordinary citizens preserved, the successful working of this Bill would be one of the finest things that could possibly happen for the upholding and maintenance of these rights, and any reasonable man who opposes this Bill has not the liberty of the subject nor the freedom of the State at heart.</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig said the Minister introduced this Bill on a very flimsy pretext.  I do not think that an attempted murder and a murder form a very flimsy pretext. I really think the Minister introduced the Bill in an effort to preserve the system of trial by jury. Every fair-minded man, I think, approves of that system, and, if so, he must approve of some safeguards for jurors, so that when they come into the box and hear the evidence given on oath they may be free to give a verdict in accordance with that evidence.  My criticism of this Bill is not that advanced by the Fianna Fáil Party or the Labour Party.  My criticism is that I fear that it will not achieve its object. Although Deputy Byrne has said it may make it a thousand-fold more difficult for certain organisations to get at jurors' names and such things, I think it may have the effect of increasing their efforts a thousand-fold. Moreover, I have a very high opinion of the Dublin citizen, but I do not think it is impossible that one out of twelve jurors may divulge outside how the other eleven voted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pádraig Hogan (Clare), I think, was quite correct when he suggested that Deputy Byrne had a large number of briefs in his locker.  We have just seen the Deputy let the cat out of the bag, when he suggested that the alternative to the failure of this Bill was the re-enactment of the Public Safety Act.  I am not sure that the Minister, when he is replying, will confirm that statement.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Davin do me justice?  I never made any such suggestion.  Deputy Davin asked what alternative there was to the Bill, and I replied that there were many&mdash;that we have had an alternative one, but do not want it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is a greater authority on the question of an alternative than Deputy Byrne, and I accept from Deputy Byrne what he has now stated in explanation of that part of his speech.  Personally, I think that this Bill is more likely to frighten the ordinary fearless juror than to help him to do his duty more fearlessly in the future than in the past.  I quite agree with Deputy Murphy that the ordinary Dublin juryman is not inclined to be frightened or bullied into decisions in ordinary criminal cases.  I do not think that putting a number or a ticket upon the tail of the coat of a juryman, instead of allowing his face to identify him, is going to make that juryman any more inclined to do his duty. In opposing this Bill as it stands I want to say quite definitely and deliberately that I disassociate myself entirely from certain statements made by Deputy de Valera.  Deputy de Valera in his speech yesterday is <Col N="1803" /> reported to have said: &ldquo;If jurors to-day do not bring in verdicts to suit the view of the Executive, the lesson the Executive was to learn from that was that there was grave need for bringing the law and the aspirations of the people into accord.&rdquo;  I never heard that it was the duty of a juryman in trying an ordinary criminal case, or a case of a semi-political or a political nature, to decide for himself whether the law was in accord with the aspirations of the people.  I prefer to think, and I believe I am right in thinking, that it is the duty of the jurymen on oath to decide on the facts of the case as stated in the court.  I do not think there is any justification for that particular statement, and I would go into the Lobby against Deputy de Valera if that were the one reason on which he relied for opposing this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is going to picture this country as being in a condition to-day in which I think it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard in this House this evening two speeches delivered from the Government Benches, one by Deputy Tierney and the other by the Minister for Agriculture, giving different points of view as to the extent to which this conspiracy exists.  Deputy Tierney said in his opinion it was only a method of advertising on the part of the conspirators to proclaim their existence.  The Minister for Agriculture said it was a cowardly and a well organised attempt to smash the system of trial by jury.  I am inclined to agree, as the result of inquiries I have made, that there is a conspiracy to do away with trial by jury and to that extent every Deputy who feels he is responsible to the people must feel&mdash;if he wants to protect the trial by jury system&mdash;he must protect the jurors if he is prepared to do his duty.  That I am prepared to do but I think that this is not the right way to do it.  We read, and others have read, and I think the President also has read the report in the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; of the conditions in this country some weeks ago.  The President did not take any steps to <Col N="1804" /> contradict the report as to conditions in this country as presented by Mr. Ketcham to the readers of the &ldquo;Daily Express.&rdquo;  But when he found that that picture had been repainted in papers that appeared in America and when he discovered&mdash; and he was right in thinking so&mdash; that it was likely to prejudice this country in the eyes of America he very soon sent a message to the American Press to correct the wrong impression that Mr. Ketcham's picture had given to the English public through the columns of the &ldquo;Daily Express.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President said that this country was quite normal.  But he gave a different impression, if I have read his American Press interview correctly, from the impression given by the Minister for Agriculture this afternoon.  If there were thirty or forty young men associated with a number of women making an attempt as they are doing to smash up trial by jury in this country that does not show that there is anything radically wrong with the condition of the country as a whole.  In every day and generation and in every country you have men who are prepared to go out to smash the law by any methods that will enable them to do so.  I do not want to refer to any particular country or to any city in any country but there is more crime committed in one city in America to-day than has been committed in the whole of this country in the last three or four years.  That has not any great effect upon the financial or general condition of the United States.  We are inclined, unfortunately I think for political purposes, to exaggerate the conditions in this country when it suits us to do so.  It should not be done for the purpose of trying to persuade or trying to goad Deputies into voting for a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>The courts and the whole legal machinery in this country, and the system of trial by jury that goes with it, has, in my opinion, the approval of the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this State, and as far as I know from those who support Fianna Fáil, also <Col N="1805" /> Deputies such as Deputy Gorry and Deputy P. Boland were supported by people who approve of it.  It is, therefore, up to Deputy de Valera, and those who sit with him, to protect jurors who are prepared to do their duty.  No case has been made, and no information has been given to the House which would enable ordinary Deputies to vote freely for this measure as it now stands.  I am quite in agreement with Deputy Anthony in what he suggested yesterday.  I would prefer to see trial by jury suspended for a temporary period and substituted by some other form of trial rather than adopt the system proposed in this Bill as a permanent method.  No matter what Deputy Byrne may say, and no matter what number of briefs he can pull out of his pocket, or take from under his desk, if he votes for this measure as a permanent measure, and if he can justify that vote here to-day he will have to justify it here and in the future.</P>
    <P>I suggest an alternative to this measure&mdash;that is, the setting up of a court of three or four High Court judges for the trial of certain cases, and that a majority decision of these judges on certain types of cases would be effective.  Here in this measure we have in Section 6 the right of a High Court judge in the Criminal Court to deal with persons who refuse to plead guilty or not guilty.  Sub-section (3) of Section 6 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a person, charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court with any crime or offence, at any stage of his trial in such Court on such charge by any act or omission displays gross disrespect of the Court or refuses to recognise the Court or refuses to recognise the authority or jurisdiction of the Court, or does any act (other than standing mute or lawfully objecting in due form of law to the jurisdiction of the Court to try him on such charge) which in the opinion of the judge is equivalent to a refusal to recognise the Court or the authority or jurisdiction <Col N="1806" /> thereof, or in any other way acts disrespectfully or contumaciously towards the Court, such person shall be guilty of an offence against the Court and the judge shall forthwith sentence him to suffer a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think if the Government can set up a High Court judge in the Central Criminal Court to decide certain matters the same judge with two others should be given authority and responsibility in peculiar circumstances to try persons and to find them guilty or not guilty on charges preferred against them.  That is an alternative to this permanent measure of making a mockery of trial by jury in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the methods suggested in this Bill of numbering jurors and making them known by numbers rather than by their names, if the people engaged in this conspiracy in this country are as active as we are led to believe, and a small number of them are very active and intelligent, they will find the names of the jurors who are only identified by numbers and they will identify them.  There is nothing in this measure to prevent them doing it.  I say it is an incentive to these young men and women to be more active in the future to try to break through the words of this measure and to find out and deal with, as they have done in the past, the jurymen who have done their duty conscientiously and faithfully under the terms of their oath.  We have, of course, the power in another section of this Bill given to a High Court judge to sentence an individual who refuses to plead or to recognise the court to six months' imprisonment.  When that individual comes out there is power given again to arrest him and bring him before the same court and the judge has power to repeat the sentence of six months' imprisonment, and he can repeat that indefinitely if the individual is so disposed to persist in committing the same offence when brought up.  There would be no finality under the ridiculous procedure of this Act.  It would make a <Col N="1807" /> mockery of the whole system of trial by jury which is recognised in this and every other country as a democratic system of trial.  Again, I believe the power which is asked for to get a majority of the jury is making for conviction purposes and would make it much easier in the future for the prosecuting counsel or people responsible for instituting the proceedings of packing juries than ever before.</P>
    <P>Somebody suggested&mdash;I do not say that it was stated&mdash;that the prisoner had no rights, and that it is the people prosecuting who have all the rights.  It has been discovered in this and every country that people were charged with crimes which, on investigation, were found to be untrue and the prisoners were unanimously acquitted.  Prisoners have rights, and they should have the right to see that the juries are not packed against them.  I think this provision of imposing a sentence on the finding of a majority of the jury is something to enable the prosecuting counsel, no matter what Government he may be serving, to pack a jury as against the system that was adopted in the past.  The Minister for Agriculture laid great stress upon certain paragraphs from unknown writers, anonymous letters or signed letters, which he read from certain so-called, if you like, Republican journals.</P>
    <P>There is a misunderstanding in the minds of a very great number of citizens in this country as to what is the real meaning of the word &ldquo;Republican.&rdquo;  It has caused many hours of acrimonious debate in this House, and many disputes and discussions elsewhere, as to whether Deputy Lemass was a better Republican than Peadar O'Donnell, who does not recognise this House, or than President Cosgrave.  I wish we could wipe that word altogether out of the Irish dictionary.  If we could we would have less trouble in the future as regards the real meaning of patriotism as understood or misunderstood by Irish citizens.  Some fellow named Langley sent a document, which was printed in the <Col N="1808" />&ldquo;Nation,&rdquo; which we are now informed is not the official organ of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I take it the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; is not the official organ of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I believe that one of the Ministers who wrote an article in the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; wrote another article afterwards in that paper saying that the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; had no connection with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I am pleased to learn that the &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; have no connection with either of these Parties, and to that extent I think the extract read should be treated more lightly than it was treated by the Minister.  At any rate, he laid some stress upon certain articles which were printed in the &ldquo;Nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder then if the Minister knows the person who is responsible for writing these articles; and why the gentleman who has written those articles encouraging citizens of this State to murder jurymen is not in gaol?  Why is the man who wrote these articles allowed to walk about? The Minister for Agriculture said &ldquo;We know them.&rdquo;  Is that man in gaol locked up or is he walking about?  I suggest that if the Minister knows the gentleman who has written those letters to the papers encouraging citizens to murder jurors, his duty is to lock up that man and have him brought to trial, as any man who commits such things should be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture charged the Fianna Fáil Party with being directly associated with these incitements.  Why does he not arrest the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and put him on his trial, and let him have an opportunity of disassociating himself from these incitements?  I think the Minister for Agriculture was so enthusiastic about the success of the Show that he exaggerated the position here this evening in stating the case against the Fianna Fáil Party.  He did not, to my satisfaction, definitely associate the Fianna Fáil Party with any of these so-called incitements.  If I thought, as a Deputy of this House. that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was directly associated with <Col N="1809" /> people in this country who are inciting people to murder jurors I would never be accused of walking into the Division Lobby with him on this or on any other measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular evil of this Bill is that it exaggerates certain evils which exist already in former enactments, for instance, by adding the element of secrecy it makes jury-packing not only extremely easy, but it makes it impossible to criticise or expose or check the growth of that subsequently.  First of all, in Section 2 of the Bill you have a development of the Jury Act of 1927.  You have here a change over from the jurisdiction of the sub-sheriff to the jurisdiction of the court direct.</P>
      <P>The old practice had a very valuable principle contained in it, because the underlying principle of the existence of the jury was, as has been referred to by Maine who is a big authority on constitutional law, as one of the remnants of real democratic government.  It is one of the remnants of democratic government in this sense, that the people themselves acted as judges, and it was the people themselves who protected themselves against various other powers and influences working against them.  Under this particular section there was formerly, before the Act of 1927 was brought in, some remnant of popular influence, because the sub-sheriff was not appointed either by the Minister or by the judge.  Here you have the empanelling officer and the summoning officer both directly under the control and authority of the judge and Minister.  Therefore there is a principle involved in this which is a departure from the spirit of trial by jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason given by the Minister was that by handing over the powers now to these two officers he was going to add to the secrecy.  Of course secrecy is written across the whole of this Bill.  In the last century there was a great uproar against the methods of trial by jury in Ireland.  Lord Macaulay referred to the trials as Star Chamber methods.  These are Star Chamber <Col N="1810" /> methods over again.  They are worse. They have the air of an Inquisition about them.  I think really the Executive should bring in a section saying that jurymen should be disguised, should have large cloaks with hoods upon them to cover their figures and their faces so that no one will recognise them.  They should be brought to Court in vans so that no one would see who they are and they should be taken away again in vans. The whole measure has an air of furtiveness about it which is as far away from open, fair trial as night is from day.  It is entirely contrary to the spirit of normal and fair justice in a country which on the whole is not in an abnormal condition at present.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 the panel in future is not to be posted up.  This it is purported is a remedy for something else.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the seizure of jury lists. How does the not hanging up of the panel affect the seizure or non-seizure of the jury list?  It is a completely different thing.  One would imagine that the obvious thing in future would be to put the jury list where it could not be raided, and not be passing Acts dealing with the panel.  The accused is not now to get an opportunity of seeing the panel. This is bringing us back to somewhere in the 16th century.  This privilege was given by an Act of Anne in England and was extended to Ireland subsequently.  It is repealing the Juries Act of 1871 and it is going back to the old methods by which an accused man will have no chance of challenging anybody.  According to the Act of 1927 he should have at least the right of peremptory challenge of six jurymen. How is he to know whom he should challenge?  He does not know their names.  He has no indication whatever as to who they are.  Is he to judge by the colour of their hair, the shapes of their faces and so on?  The man who is charged should have some facilities to enable him to know who the people are who are likely to be prejudiced against him so that he may be in a position to get a fair trial.  This element of secrecy makes <Col N="1811" /> it impossible to have any remedy against the packing of the jury. Under the Act of 1927 you have made law something which was an abuse in the former law, namely, the right of a prosecuting counsel to order every juryman to stand by.  It would be well for us to examine how that abuse started, because an abuse it is.  That abuse is greatly aggravated by the fact that all criticism of its use and of the power to order a standby is gone once this Bill has been passed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;There are two kinds of challenge to jurors, the challenge for cause and the peremptory challenge, the former being employed whenever a clear case of disqualification could be assigned.  It has always been permitted to the Crown and to the subject alike and it has constantly been made use of by both.  The second system of challenge which had formerly been employed arbitrarily by the Crown had been abolished by a statute of Edward I.  The Irish subject, however, unlike the Crown, still possesses the power of peremptory challenge.&rdquo;  This was written by an Englishman in 1907.  By an Act of 1829 he was permitted to challenge peremptorily not more than 20 jurors, having formerly been able peremptorily to challenge 35.  But the Crown had gradually got behind the law in this matter, and although, as we have seen, forbidden by the statute of Edward I. to challenge peremptorily, managed to rid itself of the jurors it disliked in a manner quite as summarily as in pre-Edwardian times. It accomplished the trick in the following manner.  The Act of Edward I., before alluded to, was wrenched from its meaning and interpreted to signify that the King was not bound to state his case or challenge a juror until the whole panel of jurors was called over, and that the Crown might, on a juror being called, direct him to stand aside for the present; that is to say, <Col N="1812" /> until the jury lists had been got through.  In this way, therefore, if a jury could be made up out of the list without recourse to the persons so set aside they were ipso facto excluded.  By this method the Crown virtually resumed the power of peremptory challenge and the Act of 1829 mentioned above, whilst reenacting that of Edward I, declared that the latter could not affect the power of the courts to exclude jurors by making them stand aside for the present on the petition of the Crown Prosecutor.  It is superfluous to observe that this privilege was made use of to the full in order to exclude from juries whomsoever the Government might happen to dislike either as being Roman Catholics or persons of liberal opinion.  The abandonment of this vicious system was initiated by Louis Perrin, Irish Attorney-General in 1835, and its discontinuance completed by Sir Michael O'Loghlen and his successors in the Attorney-Generalship. It is hardly necessary to emphasise the excellence of a reform which purified the fountains of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This practice, formerly used against certain sections of the community and which an Englishman boasts was abolished, is glorified in this Bill and made a permanent part of the institution of justice&mdash;this power of being able to tell jurors to stand by.  Let us suppose under the pressure of excitement, under the pressure of some tragedy, under the pressure of a murder such as occurred recently, the Government seized one or more individuals and, in a moment of panic, tried those individuals and took advantage of the powers given by this Act and packed a jury.  After all, packing a jury is not a new thing in Ireland.  Let us suppose that they packed the jury and got a verdict.  When afterwards in cold blood they would look back on what they did and would find on investigation that the man had been innocent, what remedy would there be?  Suppose it was not the Government that discovered it, but that some citizen had discovered it, the editor of some newspaper, it would be impossible in such a case then for <Col N="1813" /> such a person to bring before public opinion the abuse that had occurred. Such abuse as this occurred during the land war in Ireland.  It was in a case which became famous.  A man named Hynes was tried for his life before a packed jury and was found guilty by that packed jury.  He was condemned to death and executed. It was discovered afterwards that at the time the jury was impounded some of them were drunk and disorderly and they decided their verdict in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>When an expose was made of that, the names of the jurymen had naturally to be mentioned.  Under this Act, however, if such a thing occurred, the public generally would have no remedy against such a jury.</P>
    <P>After all, if we want to have the greatest possible confidence in our system of law, we want to make the people feel that everything is being done in the fairest way possible, in the most open way possible, and that, unless it is done in that way, the machinery of justice is always suspect, and in a time of great stress it will not have the confidence of the people generally.  This Bill, by imposing this element of secrecy, and other elements to which I will refer later, is, in fact, poisoning the sources of justice and making all the things that have been said in the past against jury-packing true of every trial which will take place under this measure.  If in the future in regard to some trial someone like the late Archbishop Walsh comes out and denounces the method of trial or the jury-packing, he will be liable to prosecution.  It will not be possible for an Archbishop Croke to condemn a particular trial or the methods used in that trial, because, if he uses the strong language used in the days when similar things were being done, and when similar remedies were resorted to by the Government, and if he makes reference to the methods of the jury, he also will be liable.  He will be liable if, for instance, he uses strong language such as this: &ldquo;Our money goes to fee and feed a gang of needy and voracious lawyers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In Clause 6 of the Bill we find something which is extremely petty.  Suppose you have a conscientious objector, a person who conscientiously cannot recognise the authority of the Free State courts&mdash; after all, there are such persons in the country&mdash;and supposing a man, who is entirely innocent of any action whatever in regard to any deed for which he may be charged, comes into court and feels that it is his duty not to stand mute, but to say honestly that he does not recognise the court and that he has that kind of temperament of which we have had experience in the past, the passive-resister type, he will be imprisoned.  After six months' imprisonment that man will come back into court and, because he says that he does not recognise the authority of that court, he will get a sentence not exceeding six months.  That is a curious piece of petty legislation.  It is just the kind of thing that you would expect to come from the Crown Prosecutor complex, looking about everywhere for something to hit, absolutely devoid of any tolerance to political convictions different to his own, and seeing crime where there is only difference of political convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again we have Section 7, which will muzzle the Press, and which will only allow such journals to have representatives in court as it pleases.  If anybody comes into court who is in any way displeasing to the Executive he can be excluded, even though he may be representing one of the journals which the Government is pleased to permit to be represented there.  The independence of any journal is destroyed by such action.  No journalist appearing in court would dare to report otherwise than as he thinks would please those who can exclude him from the court at any other action. Then we have the clause which perpetuates imprisonment for those whom the Executive particularly wish to keep in jail constantly without bringing to trial.  It would be bad enough to have to make this case merely as a matter of theory, but when you have examples in the conduct <Col N="1815" /> of government in the past where they have continued to keep men in jail from session to session without trial, it is perfectly obvious that Section 8 will be used in future as an excuse to keep them in jail from session to session without bringing them to trial, and there is no remedy.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10 the jurors are to receive notice by post, not by registered post.  That, I think, is hard on the jurors, because, after all, if a juror receives notice by registered post he is certain to get it, but he is not certain to get it by ordinary post.  I cannot see that there is very much difference in the matter of secrecy between the ordinary post and registered post.  It is an indication of the distorted mentality of the authors of this Bill that they should expect that there may be a difference between secrecy in the ordinary post and in the registered post.  We are told by the Minister that if this does not succeed other methods will be tried.  Looking back on the past, we wonder what the other methods are. There is the possibility of another Public Safety Act, and if that does not succeed, there are, of course, courts-martial.  If these do not succeed I suppose they will have recourse to their earlier methods of unauthorised murders.  The whole business is a vicious circle coming from the morbid psychology of the civil war.  It is going backwards towards that.  That is the fundamental reason why it is not a remedy for the evil.  It is creating the old atmosphere of hatred, anger, and civil war.</P>
    <P>I do not wish for a moment to pass over lightly the murder and the attempted murder which took place but I do suggest that this is not the method in which you are going to meet the difficulty.  You have a condition of things in this country which we ought to look into deeply. We ought to try to examine this not so much as an outsider, not so much as someone who is forcing with violence something upon various sections of the people with a sense of anger and determination to carry it <Col N="1816" /> through no matter at what cost to human feeling, but rather to face it as the fathers of the people, as those who have a difficult situation to face and who want to do it in a way that is most just and most human.  I submit that if the Government succeed in doing it in that way they would be doing it in the most permanent way.  You have in this country a spirit, on the one hand, which is deeply hostile to Irish nationality, which indulges in the waving of Union Jacks, which creates an atmosphere of hostility and of anger amongst a certain section in this community.  The people who display that spirit have been unfortunately encouraged; they have been allowed to wave their Union Jacks. They have been given a feeling of domination in this country once again.  You have reacting against that element a certain element which has been brought up in another school of thought.  It is well for us, I think, to dwell upon that other school of thought and to remind ourselves of the kind of intense spirit there is behind it.  It may at times express itself in a very mistaken line of conduct, but between those antagonisms you have all the factors for the agent provocateur.  What we want to do is to ease that situation, to make those people with that intense feeling of nationality, feel that things have not come to a deadlock, that there is some hope before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney referred to the spirit of nationality and made the amazing contention that Irish nationalism meant the right of the majority&mdash;I do not want to misinterpret him&mdash;I gathered that he said that it meant the right of the majority in the country to do more or less what they liked because they were the majority.  Now, there is a different conception of nationalism. I think the President, the Minister for Education, and the Minister for Defence attended a ceremony recently at the graves in Arbour Hill. One of the graves is the grave of Patrick Pearse.  I take it that in attending that ceremony Ministers were paying a tribute to the beliefs <Col N="1817" /> of Patrick Pearse.  He had expressed, perhaps better than anybody else. what he calls authentic nationalism. He certainly has conveyed that intense spirit of nationalism with which we have all become familiar during the period of the last thirteen years, if we were not familiar with it before.  In one of his pamphlets, the name of which was &ldquo;The Ghosts,&rdquo; he deals with different people who had expressed what Irish nationalism was.  He quoted Parnell, and he said:</P>
    <P>Ireland a nation.  Ireland has been a nation, she is a nation, and she shall be a nation.  England will respect you in proportion as you and we respect ourselves. They will not give anything to Ireland out of justice or righteousness. They will concede your liberties and your rights when they must, and not sooner.  We can, none of us, do more than strive for that which might seem attainable to-day, but we, at the same time, ought to recollect that we should not impede or hamper the march of the nation, and although our programme may be limited and small, it should be such a one as shall not prevent hereafter the fullest realisation of the hopes of Ireland.  We shall, at least, if we keep this principle in mind, have this consolation: that while we may have done something to enable Ireland in some measure to retain her position as a nation, and strengthen her position as a nation, we shall have done nothing to hinder others who may come after us from taking up the work with perhaps greater ability, strength and power and advantages than we possess, and from pushing on to that glorious and happy conclusion which is embodied in the words of the toast which I now ask you to drink&mdash;&ldquo;Ireland a Nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that you have the principles of Parnell, the constitutionalist, and the enemies of Ireland were always trying to associate him with <Col N="1818" /> those who were not constitutionalists, very much as the Minister for Agriculture tries to associate us with some section of the community who have been guilty of recent crimes. Pearse, continuing, says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I can only refer the House to the collected works of Patrick Pearse and suggest that members, before going to the Wolfe Tone anniversary ceremony, should read this book and try to get back something of the old spirit, because there is more chance of our finding peace in at least keeping our minds open to that point of view, even if we feel ourselves that there is no possibility of achieving those ideals. We should keep this State in such a condition that progress towards those ideals must always be possible, and that the extreme element in the community should feel that there is a possibility of proceeding upon peaceful lines.  That, I submit, is a greater remedy and a greater safeguard <Col N="1820" /> to the jury system, which is extremely valuable, than any Act of this kind, which simply creates a vicious circle of anger on one side and anger on the other, and of deed to deed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin objected to Deputy de Valera's remarks about the conduct of juries.  It is held by authorities that the jury system, after all, has another function to discharge besides that of determining questions of fact in criminal causes.  &ldquo;It is the prime guarantee of public liberty, the supreme judge of laws and institutions, and if juries systematically refuse to convict it is because there is some disease which calls for the political knife of the surgeon.&rdquo;  The authority I quote refers to what juries in England did as a protest against the severity of the law and refused to bring in verdicts, with the result that the law had to be changed.  The effect of this Act will be to do exactly what it has been said was done at the trial of O'Connell, when the jury was packed.  The jury system, which, according to Burke, was &ldquo;the palladium of civil liberty and the ultimate aim and contrivance of all Government&rdquo; was, according to Chief Justice Denman, who reversed the decision against O'Connell, turned into &ldquo;a mockery, a delusion and a snare.&rdquo;&ldquo;The popular and the liberal institutions turned into a mask for the worst vices of unchecked despotism.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is, in fact, in the nature of a coercion measure. Deputy de Valera followed the various Coercion Acts covering a period of 120 years or so, showing in what succession this Act came.  From the foundation of the present State we have had a number of Coercion Acts to finish that list. We had the Public Safety Emergency Powers Act, passed on 1st August, 1923.  That Act was passed in order to defeat the law decided in the case of O'Brien versus the Minister for Defence. It will be remembered that the object of that was to retain the civil war prisoners in jail, but in <Col N="1821" /> their extreme hurry to pass that Act they did it in such an unconstitutional manner that on 2nd August they had to pass another Public Safety Act to deal with another crux that had arisen.  Then there was the Public Safety Act of 1924 imposing conditions of release.  There was the Public Safety (Temporary) Act of 1924, No. 15, giving the Minister, or the proper authority, power to change the venue for trial.  Following that we had the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1924, No. 9; the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, No. 18, which was very comprehensive, and there was also the Firearms Act, 1925, No. 17.  Then came the Public Safety Act of 1927.  Some of these were temporary, and the Public Safety Act was repealed. There is an ample power in these Coercion Acts in existence, and the adding of this one more to them does very little to assist the Government, but does a great deal to bring further discredit upon it.</P>
    <P>There is something the matter with the Government.  It pleads that it is an Irish Government, that it has a purely Irish outlook, but I wonder, when people come to look at it in an impartial manner from the point of view of history and judge it by its results, will they judge it to be an Irish Government at all, or will they say of that Government exactly what was said of every administration in Ireland during the 19th century?  After all, in its results it is producing the identical results of the British administrations in this country.  The reason given by a distinguished Frenchman for the results of British administration was that no matter how well-intentioned a British Minister was coming over here, he could never carry out his intentions, because, he said, the English element in Ireland dominated the Minister and the Government.  We have now the same results, emigration and poverty on the one hand, and on the other coercion upon coercion.  These are the big results.  I submit it is reasonable to argue that the same causes are producing the same <Col N="1822" /> effects, and that the present Government and its Party are dominated by those who give funds to that Party, and that they are Freemasons, the enemies of this country.  They are the real enemies and are the real factors of disorder.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very short.  I have been listening the greater part of this day to speeches made against this Bill.  An effort has been made, especially by the Fianna Fáil Party, to camouflage the issue before this House.  The Bill is introduced simply for the protection of jurors. It means nothing else, but Deputies get up and try to camouflage the issue.  It is quite easy to understand why this Bill is needed.  In the constituency which I represent in this House, Co. Dublin, reports have been made to me about men who served on juries and who from that day to this have had to have police protection.  A poor stonecutter living in the Dublin mountains had to attend a jury much against his wish, for he sacrificed his day's pay. He served on the jury.  Though he had received a threatening notice, he obeyed the summons to attend the court, and performed his duty to the State.  Since that, every day and night that man is protected by the police.  Every juror who has sat on a jury and who has been protected these months past is costing the State a little over £16 a week. That is something for the Fianna Fáil Deputies to consider.  They have been preaching economies and saying we have too many Civic Guards and could do with a great deal less.  We could if they stopped preaching intimidation.  I say deliberately <Col N="1823" /> that from the start of the Treaty dispute intimidation is their strong plank, and it is because of intimidation they are in this House in such force.  Have they yet in this House condemned intimidation?</P>
      <P>One would expect, the appeal is so fair and honest, that some member of the Fianna Fáil Party would get up and say they condemn the intimidation of jurors.  No, but they get up and try to get the House to believe that what the Bill is intended for is to do away with trial by jury. The intention of the Bill is to see that trial by jury will be maintained. I hope it will.  Let us be very honest about this.  That is what is expected from us.  We want no more as supporters of the Government than to see that people who assist on a jury will do so without being afraid that they are to lose their lives.  In plain language that is what it is, and it is only fair and reasonable that we should try and pass legislation here to make it safe for people who sit on juries and who, acting on their judgment and according to their oath, decide whether a thing is right or fair.  We stand for that.  Do you? It is because I stand for it that I get up to give my contribution, which is very short, and not like the long-winded speech from the Deputy who has just sat down, and the Deputy who preceded him, Deputy MacEntee, who smacked his lips while attacking the Government all the time.  Why do they not get up and defend the jurors?  We are here to defend them.  That is what the Bill is intended to do, and I support it heartily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer right now the appeal made by Deputy O'Connor to be straight, honest, and above board in dealing with this or with any other Bill, and I would like to say that we do not stand&mdash;I am not the only one on these benches who has said it&mdash;for the shooting or for the intimidation of jurymen.  Is that plain, definite, and clear enough?  We have not stood for it, we have not approved of it, and it has been condemned, not <Col N="1824" /> once, but many times, by many speakers on behalf of Fianna Fáil. But in discussing this Bill we cannot ignore recent history.  I do not want to go back very far.  I will not go back to the golden age of Justinian; I will not go back even to Magna Charta; I will not follow the speakers on the other side who have gone back not alone a hundred years but several centuries.  But I do say that, in discussing a matter of this kind, that goes to the very roots of constitutional law and constitutional government, we cannot particularly ignore the recent history of this country.  Nobody will contradict the statement that the troubled state of the country arises out of the history of the last thirteen or fourteen years, and further back.  How far it is troubled is a question.  Whenever political trouble arises we cannot ignore our history, and our very recent history.  It is all very well for Deputies on the Government Benches to denounce in the most violent terms men and women who belong to Republican organisations, men and women who use arms and who encourage the use of arms.  Who can deny that up to quite recently Ministers were members of these organisations&mdash;secret and public organisations&mdash;and that they preached the very same doctrines and swore young men into these organisations? You cannot deny these facts, and you cannot get rid of this recent history in a week or in a year, or perhaps in ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Cosgrave quite recently made a pronouncement.  It has been stated&mdash;and probably there are good grounds for the statement&mdash;that it was made purely for political purposes in the recent North Dublin election.  He said that the whole fabric, the whole basis, of the social structure of our country was being undermined.  These are not his exact words, but I think they are fairly accurate.  He said that there was a terrible conspiracy rampant in this country that was striking at the very foundations of our Constitution. Now, I suggest that in making such statements he grossly exaggerated the position, even though <Col N="1825" /> we all have clearly before our minds the fact that a juryman was wounded and that a gentleman who was a witness was shot dead.  These facts are very much before our minds, but even with these facts before our minds I say that it was a gross exaggeration of the position to state that the whole fabric of the Constitution of the Free State was about to topple over, for that is what President Cosgrave's remarks amounted to.  His remarks were taken up widely and were circulated. I get papers from many places. Yesterday Deputy Gorey asked us to go to Chicago and see what happens there, and other Deputies asked us to go to other places.  I do not know about Chicago and I have had no newspapers from there, but I have seen newspapers from other places in America which gave huge headlines to extracts from the statement made by President Cosgrave, headlines referring to the awful conditions in Ireland, stating that life in Ireland was not safe, that nobody's life there was worth an hour's purchase. These were the types of headings that the American Press put to the unwarranted statements made by President Cosgrave.  These statements were printed in Continental newspapers&mdash;I saw them in French, German, and Italian papers&mdash;and Ireland was defamed because of what the President said.  The President had to realise that, because as a result of the wide publicity that was given to these unwarranted defamations of our people and of our country he was invited by an influential journal in New York, &ldquo;The New York Times,&rdquo; to reassure the American public, many of whom had probably intended to visit Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Tourists Association is working hard to get Americans, among others, to visit this country, but President Cosgrave did his best to frighten these people off.  Then realising the situation when the harm he had done was brought forcibly under his notice he tried to undo it and he wrote for &ldquo;The New York Times,&rdquo; a statement <Col N="1826" /> which appeared on April 12th, withdrawing the statements he had previously made and saying that Ireland was not a crime-ridden or a murder-ridden country, as he had practically said, that it was a peaceful, law-abiding country, a crimeless country, a country in which there was much less crime than there was in neighbouring countries, which is true.  Two crimes had been committed, and because of these two crimes he defamed the country and its people.  He had to withdraw that, and he had said: &ldquo;It would be a great mistake to pay serious attention to scaremongers.&rdquo;  Who was the chief scaremonger?  Who was the man who of late times defamed and scared the people most?  President Cosgrave. He gives the lie to himself here.  He said: &ldquo;It would be a great mistake to pay serious attention to scaremongers.&rdquo; Of course the American and the Continental Press did not know that his original statement was made merely to frighten the electors of North Dublin.  They did not realise the circumstances and they did not know the facts.  But we now have him running away from his own statement.  He says here again: &ldquo;No doubt the struggle for independence and the subsequent internal troubles have left their aftermath.  You could not expect otherwise, could you? After every storm the waves run high for some time.  Even when they have almost completely subsided an occasional wave shows signs of former fury.&rdquo;  He was speaking the truth there, and I say that he and his colleagues should try to remember that, should try to be consisent in their attitude, should try to be a little more wise and a little more careful in dealing with the situation that he recognises we have to face in this country as a result of recent history, as a result of his own teaching, as a result of his own actions, as a result of the teaching of the Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Free State and of his actions.</P>
    <P>There is no man in all Ireland to-day, inside or outside the I.R.A. or the I.R.B., or any other organisation, <Col N="1827" /> who taught with greater force and more frequently that it was the duty as well as the right of every young man in the country to carry arms than did the Vice-President of the Executive Council.  You cannot get away from that in a year, you cannot get away from it in five years. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said: &ldquo;For our manhood's sake we must not merely deplore our conditions, but must sweat and starve until each has a gun and can shoot to kill.&rdquo;  These were his words.</P>

      <P>The Vice-President of the Executive Council, the man who comes here to-day to denounce in the most violent language young men who belong to Republican organisations, said: &ldquo;He that enjoys the rights of manhood, but has not the courage or ability to guard them, asks to be spat upon.  He is a cheat and a traitor.  In this land the iron of slavery has been so driven into our souls that few of us think it a disgrace, a clear mark of degradation, to be unarmed.  Courage and a hankering for weapons we have, but if we are content to rest at that where do we differ from those who are unarmed from choice and shudder at the sight of steel?&rdquo; Nobody on these benches ever used language that could compare with that, in inciting young men and young women to arm, and to shoot to kill.  I will admit that when he was writing that there was a direct British Government in control here.  I will admit that there has been a change.  I will not admit that this is the absolute Irish Government, that the Vice-President and his colleagues on the Front Bench say it is.  I say it is a Government and a Parliament elected by the Irish people, or by part of them.  I admit that certainly, and I admit that we here&mdash; and I myself am here recognising these facts such as they are&mdash;have a House that is representative, not of the Irish people first of all, because we only represent twenty-six counties, <Col N="1828" /> and secondly, because we do not represent the type of people that the Vice-President spoke for not so long ago.  We do not represent those, because they cannot come in here owing to the barriers that he, the Minister for Defence, and others, have set up&mdash;the very men who imposed an oath on the young men, the very men who went around the country into every parish&mdash; these two gentlemen particularly in County Kerry&mdash;swearing in these young men and teaching them to get arms however they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the Vice-President, on another occasion, who stated that it was their duty to sell their shirts, but that they must get arms, that they must teach each other to shoot, and to shoot to kill.  What I want you to realise is&mdash;some of you who were old colleagues of mine in the old I.R.B. and I.R.A. days know it as well as I do&mdash;that until this country is absolutely free, free of all outside interference, and until it is united, anything that the Dáil can do, anything and everything that Ministers opposite may try to do, will not eradicate the aspirations and even the organisations that are in existence.  We must recognise that they will continue.  You will drive them harder and harder.  It will be more difficult for them to live, if you like, but they will remain. I am old enough, and so is the Vice-President, and the Minister for Defence, to remember when we were members of secret organisations, sworn organisations, when we were harassed and chased about.  I remember that I could not leave Dublin any day for the last twenty-five years to go anywhere in the country that I was not tracked and followed. Every item of my day's journeyings in and around the city, and in the country, and of theirs also, was noted down by detectives, because we went around preaching the gospel, that these young men and young women of to-day believe is the right gospel. We were followed and harassed, but that kind of harassing only lent a kind of glamour to our association with the I.R.A. and the I.R.B.  Some of us believed that we were great <Col N="1829" /> heroes in belonging to these organisations. I am sure that is what the Vice-President thought as he went around with great fervour teaching and preaching to these young men. Some of those who were in these organisations when he was a member are still in them, and they have gone back to being secret organisations, as they were when he and I were younger.  They will remain, and will continue.  Do what you like, and do your worst to them, they will continue. I say here frankly that I hope, in carrying on, not alone their propaganda, but carrying on their legitimate work, to hand on the torch of Irish liberty that has not yet been achieved, they will not stoop to murder. That is plain, clear and definite.  I was never associated with that.  The Vice-President and the Minister for Defence were.  They were associated with murder in their day.  I was not.</P>

      <P>All right.  Be it so. I was not.  I was not a great brass-hat General, I know, but I was associated as a soldier with a rising.  I happened to be Staff Captain to Padraig Pearse in 1916, and I am not a bit ashamed of it.  It was in my office, three weeks after the war broke out, that the Rising of 1916 was decided upon.  There were seven or eight of us; a small minority we were then.  There were one or two Labour men in that office that afternoon, and we decided we would have a rising before the war would end.  We were only a small minority then.  How many could we speak for in the country?  Very few.  Organisations associated with Republicanism were, in the eyes of the majority of the people, contemptible, and our Press was called whatever you like&mdash;gutter press, mosquito press.  It was called all kinds of names.  We did not mind them any more than we mind what the Minister for Agriculture calls some of our papers to-day.  The same kind of papers were in existence then, and were called the same names. These were the papers that the Vice-President <Col N="1830" /> wrote for, and wrote these violent tirades.  I can give you a dozen other extracts in equally violent language from statements written by the Vice-President, calling on the young men and women of the country to join these organisations, to learn to shoot, and to shoot to kill.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is probably getting a little impatient, but I would say this much, if he asks me if we are speaking to the Bill, I say we are very much speaking to the Bill.  There is not a clause in that Bill that has not relation to the recent history of which I have just spoken.  There is not a clause or sentence in it that has not relation to the previous political history of those gentlemen sitting in front of him, and what they taught in their time.  The Minister for Justice was not associated with it, but was one of the great majority who thought that Republicans at that time were despicable, low-down creatures, I am sure.</P>
      <P>I do not know what he thought, but I am suggesting this.  I know he was not in any way associated with the I.R.B. or the I.R.A.  He probably had no sympathy, and he may be quite honest and above board in bringing in any Bill he brings in to stamp out that opinion.  He probably did his best, or would have done his best, to stamp it out thirteen or fourteen years ago, and he is acting probably in accordance with his traditions and convictions.  But these other gentlemen are not.  That is what I want you to remember.  In bringing in a Bill of this kind they are not alone uprooting the basis of all constitutionalism but they are trying to uproot, not alone the principles they taught, but to uproot, at the same time, the principles of Irish nationality, which are the basis of the work of the members of the organisations that were mentioned here to-day and yesterday, these Republican organisations, but this Bill and a dozen other Bills like it which may be introduced in the next twelve months or five years will not achieve their object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> In clause 2 you suggest that secrecy will in future be observed when juries are being empanelled. My belief is that you will not be able to secure that secrecy, no matter how you try.  I have known such methods tried in the past, and I have been associated with&mdash;I am sorry he is not here now&mdash;Deputy Batt O'Connor and others in trying to defeat those who tried methods of that kind in earlier days.  I know some of the gentlemen opposite were, at different times, associated with others, Republican organisations, in bringing influence to bear on jurors when political cases were brought on.  They know all the work that used to be done in these times, and they know or at least they ought to know that no matter how you try it is practically impossible to keep lists of that sort secret.  You suggest here in this Bill that jurors in future shall not be known by name when they enter the court but by number.  That is, I will say, to any law-abiding man, to any man in this Assembly who has any respect for human liberty, for the rights of citizenship, for traditions of law, an abrogation of all the rights and safeguards of human liberty.  Where are all the important principles of law that were fought for down the centuries? Where are they going?  They are being thrown on the dust heap.  It may be the I.R.A. people that are attacked to-day.  It may be the late colleagues of Deputy Duggan, of the Minister for Defence, or the Minister for Finance that are being attacked to-day.  It may be some of those they swore into the organisation. They murdered some of those a few years ago.  And more of them they want to imprison now for sticking loyally to and upholding the principles they were taught by those men.  It is their turn now.  Whose turn may it be to-morrow?</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Labour Party are opposing this Bill.  It is wise on their part, because with an unscrupulous Executive, with men who are capable of murder, and have done murder, and have absolutely employed men to murder&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you think I ought not to emphasise it any more I will not, but I maintain what I have stated.  They have done it, and they have at the moment in their employment, I believe, the men who were responsible for the murder of the late Deputy Kevin O'Higgins. That is a deliberate statement. These men are harassing the I.R.A. to-day.  I do not object to them harassing murderers and assassins. What I would like to see them do is to harass more those who are responsible for all the murders done in 1922 and 1923, whoever they are. Some of them are known to these men and not a soul has been tried for them.  Some of the men responsible for the murder of Kevin O'Higgins are in the employment and the pay of those men, and not one of them has been tried or arrested for it.  These are deliberate statements.  I am speaking with a sense of responsibility.  I know what I am talking about.  I know these men.  I assure you it is not a pleasant thing to have to say these things, but in justice, in fairness to our own, we have to say things that are not pleasant.  Somebody said to-day that we do not like the truth and the truth is bitter.  Sometimes the truth is hard.  Sometimes it is, and it is often bitter.  But when we are faced with an abrogation of all law and of all liberty of the individual, it is up to us to talk out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in clause 2, states that secrecy must in future rule so far as the empanelling of juries is concerned. That, if used by an unscrupulous Executive, might have very serious consequences.  What if an unscrupulous Minister who wishes to convict somebody could influence a County Registrar?  The Sheriff's <Col N="1833" /> power in this matter is done away with under this Bill, but whether it is the Sheriff or the Registrar is immaterial.  You might get some man who for some reason that seems good to himself, would agree with the Minister or the Minister's agent or official that a jury could be empanelled of political or other friends of the powers that be.  Such things have happened before, and they could happen again.  Knowing our history as we know it, some of us fairly well, from the inside, during the last fifteen or twenty years, it is not too far-fetched a thing to say that a County Registrar might be got at to include in the panel men who are agents of an unscrupulous Minister.  I do not know much about the present Minister for Justice or of his political record.  I know very little of it, but I am inclined to think, for his own sake and for the sake of his standing in the profession of which he is a member, he probably would not be guilty of using an official in that way.  But there might be others who would do so.  Are we going to leave it in the power of anybody, if there were a Minister for Justice who would like to get anybody convicted or put out of the way, that he could have put on that jury men who he was satisfied would give a verdict in a certain way?  It could be done; he could have agents collected from God knows where, agents of his own or friends of his own, and included in that jury.  All he would have to do would be to get the County Registrar to agree.  We have seen queer things done in the last seven or eight years, and from that knowledge I am inclined to think that it would be possible to empanel or to pack a jury in that way, a jury that would do the Minister's or the Executive's behest.  We all know that juries were packed in the old days. It is common knowledge.  There is no necessity to argue that matter. There were some lawyers who were notorious for that in the days of the British Government here, but that packing was done in the light of day.  It was open and above board. Everybody knew that it was being <Col N="1834" /> done.  Those who were defending political prisoners in days gone by realised what they were up against, and they fought it as best they could.  They exposed it in the public Press, but now it will be done in the dark.  The Vice-President has somebody that he wants to be put out of the way, somebody who perhaps knows too much, somebody who is too active in following the behests and the doctrines preached to him by the Vice-President and his colleagues, and that man is a nuisance.  He reminds him too often of his past; he should be got rid of, and a jury can be empanelled in secret and the prisoner will get no justice.  That is my belief. Deputy Gorey may smile, but he does not know as much about these matters as I do.  He does not know the history of the last fifteen years as well as I do.  He was not associated with these things.  He never preached these things as far as I know.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that under this section juries can be empanelled, and I believe will be empanelled, who will carry out the behests of an Executive, be that Executive scrupulous or unscrupulous, be the Minister or the agents of the Minister scrupulous or unscrupulous. What I object to is that the empanelling of the jury, if this proposition be accepted, can be done in the dark, it can be done without proper publicity and without first of all the prisoner and his counsel knowing who the jurymen are, or where they come from, what their history is, or without the Press being able to be informed or being able to inform the public of what is happening inside these closed doors. That is a wrong principle, a principle that is going to vitiate every branch of criminal law in the country. If we had such a state of disorder in the country as President Cosgrave described in that famous speech of his in the Rotunda, if the <Col N="1836" /> whole foundations of society were rocking, as he suggested, and it might be even then doubtful, there might be reason for introducing this Camorra kind of legislation.  But there is none, and I say that I can prove it out of the mouth of the President himself.  There is no reason on earth to-day in this country for uprooting the principles of constitutional law and of social and personal liberty that have been established after such great fights for so many centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President, himself, in this &ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; article of April 12th, says: &ldquo;This is a crimeless country to-day. The fact is that the Irish people in general are one of the most law-abiding peoples in the world.  If you want proof of this, you have only to compare the statistics of serious crime in Ireland with those of other countries, not excluding England.  It must be remembered, too, that the percentage of crime detection in this country is very high.&rdquo;  On the showing of the President himself, there is no necessity for including a section of that kind in this Bill.  This country is not a crime-ridden country.  It has seen very turbulent times in recent years. I do not want this to be taken in any way in palliation of what has happened, but, if you look at it calmly, I say you are bound to have reactions such as we have had in the last year or so.  As I said earlier, you cannot expect in one year to undo the teachings of twenty&mdash;it cannot be done.  It is against human nature.  I do not want to overelaborate that, but I should like Deputies who are supporting this measure to think seriously of that.  I should like those who were associated with the movement in its violent or in its constitutional days to think of what we have gone through&mdash;to think of the teachings to which the young men and young women have listened. I should like to say to them, as Deputy de Valera said yesterday, &ldquo;Have patience.&rdquo;  Time is a great healer.  If you have patience, if you do not insist on putting on the screw, and sending your gunmen to fight it <Col N="1837" /> out with guns with these men of the I.R.A., you shall have a better chance of getting peace and order in the country.</P>
    <P>You have, on the one hand, still existing in the country the organisations that the Minister for Agriculture mentioned, or some of them.  He probably knows more about them to-day than I do.  He is supplied, I presume, regularly with information from the Intelligence Department of the Government.  He knows what organisations are there and how numerous they are.  I do not know. All I know is what we all know&mdash; that there are such organisations in the country, and that some individuals in them are active.  We know it is natural that they should be there and that they will be there. We also know that violent methods have been used in the last year or two to try and suppress these organisations&mdash;very violent and illegal methods, unconstitutional methods. My belief is that these methods have the opposite effect to that desired, so far as some of these organisations are concerned.  If different methods were tried, I say, in all sincerity, that I believe we would have different results.  Every Deputy, if he looks at it impartially and calmly in the light of the history of our country during the seven hundred years odd of fighting against English rule, will realise that there has been developed a mentality in the country that reacts in a violent way to political measures of compulsion.  You have that mentality still in the country; you have it perhaps developed to a higher degree because of our own recent history.  If you put the screw tighter and tighter, you will have reactions, and such reactions as we have recently of that type, I, for one, as a citizen with some sense of responsibility and knowledge, would like to see stopped.  I do not say that you are going to succeed in inducing all the young men of the country to give up, for all time, the idea of physical force.</P>
    <P>You will not do that; it is foolish to try it&mdash;that is my honest belief. <Col N="1838" /> You will not get them to give it up &mdash;perhaps they will after a time; but it will take a long time, I believe.  I have already given good reasons why you will not uproot these ideas in a hurry.  Empanelling a jury in secret and putting it in the power of any Executive, whether the present Executive or any other, to treat their political opponents as men have been treated in the past, by juries got together in the fashion in which it is proposed to get these juries, will not make for peace or harmony or good order.  I take it that the suggestion behind this Bill is that it is to promote peace and order.  My belief, and I say it in all sincerity, is that it will have the very contrary effect.  If you think otherwise, then you will go ahead and pass your Bill.  But if you really want it to aim at one class of crime, and one only, the Bill should have been so framed that it would deal with that one class of crime.  I must, however, say frankly that even if these methods were proposed to deal with that one class of crime I still would oppose them.  But you propose to make this not a temporary, but a permanent Bill to regulate criminal law procedure for the whole country for all classes of crime in future.  I think that is a gross mistake; I think that is a blunder that the Executive will probably have very great reason to regret before they are much older, if this Bill be passed as at present framed.</P>
    <P>One of the safeguards that every person tried in a court has to-day is that the court is an open, public place; that the Press are present, and that the members of the Bar have the privilege of attending.  The prisoner knows in advance by whom he is to be tried, and if he is a citizen of the area in which he is tried, he has a fair idea in advance whether or not he will get a fair trial.  All these safeguards are abolished under this Bill.  Section 2 states that the empanelling of a jury is to be done in secret and that the jurymen are to be known henceforth not by name but by number.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> Section 4 tells us that nobody can be present in Court during the calling of the panel.  Now that does away with one of the principal safeguards for every citizen whose misfortune it may be to be in a criminal court.  It is within the knowledge of everybody that it has been the misfortune of many an innocent man to have been dragged in and tried in a criminal court, without talking of political prisoners at all.  It has been the misfortune of many decent, upright citizens in the past to be dragged into the criminal courts and charged with offences of which they were afterwards proved to be innocent. There have been well-known cases, some of them in recent history, where men were convicted, and perhaps after suffering years in jail were proved to be entirely innocent of the charges on which they were convicted.  Whatever chances there are of errors occurring, of unjust convictions and unjust sentences in open court&mdash;and we all know there have been such&mdash;is it not in accordance with commonsense that there is bound to be a much greater number of mistaken verdicts if these ordinary safeguards of open courts&mdash;publicly empanelled jurors known to the prisoner and his counsel, the right of having the Bar and the Press present&mdash;are removed?</P>

      <P>What becomes of the liberty of any citizen who may find himself in the unfortunate position of being tried perhaps for his life in a criminal court when all the safeguards are gone?  There is nothing between him and eternity but nine men, and these men may be empanelled in secret.  If the accused happened to be a prominent political figure, or even not connected with politics, if he happened to be a man who had powerful enemies, all the safeguards of life and liberty are gone.  The rights of citizenship are no more.  Ministers may jeer and jibe at these rights, but there must be some value attached to them when all down the centuries such tremendous fights were made for the preservation of those liberties and rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is coming over us in Ireland all of a sudden that we are proposing to tear up and fling away, in perhaps a moment of passion and of fright, all those rights so dearly won?  I would appeal to Deputies of all shades of opinion to give Section 4 very serious consideration before voting in favour of any Bill which includes it.  Imagine what you are doing?  You are, perhaps, sentencing to death beforehand, many men or women who may be entirely innocent of charges brought against them.  Up to the present it has been the rule in court that one person, having a strong and and honest conviction that the prisoner was not guilty of the offence with which he was charged, could save the prisoner, perhaps, from death.  Now a majority can convict him, and if there are three persons honestly and sincerely convinced of the innocence of the prisoner their belief goes for nothing. If the House passes this Bill it is taking on a very serious responsibility for the future.  It is well to consider and to weigh what it is that we are doing if we pass this Bill.  We would be condemning, perhaps, to death many innocent people.  That is what Deputies would be doing, and that is a very serious obligation to take upon their shoulders.  I do not profess to be <Col N="1841" /> well versed in the law, but I would like to hear if there is any country to-day that has on its Statute Book a law or laws similar to this proposed here for our adoption.  I doubt if there is.  There certainly is not in any country with which we are most familiar.  In America, in England or Scotland, in Australia or Canada, and other countries that have adopted the English system, they certainly have nor anything approaching the racoman methods proposed in this Bill for adoption as the criminal law of the land.  Yet, in many of these countries crime is much more rampant than it is here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to defame any country.  I do not want to particularise. But it is familiar to every Deputy that crime is rampant in other countries with which we are familiar and about which we read in our daily Press; every day we read of crimes; they are of daily occurrence, and they are crimes of a very serious nature too.  Crime of a political nature is a daily occurrence in these countries, but no law of this kind would ever be dreamt of in these countries.  So highly are the rights of individual citizens valued there that they are prepared to do their best to trace the criminals and to expend a great deal of money in the endeavour to trace them.  They certainly would not attempt to uproot their whole constitutional system for the sake of convicting one or two of these criminals who may even have been guilty of capital offences.  Deputy Lemass speaking here yesterday said that there would have been no necessity to bring in a Bill of this kind if the police that you pay so highly were doing their duty.  We are paying for the ordinary Civic Guards £1,500,000 a year.  Imagine a country with a population slightly over 3,000,000 paying £1,500,000 for its Civic Guards.  Crimes of this kind are committed and, according to President Cosgrave, the men or the women who are supposed to be responsible for these crimes are well known.  President <Col N="1842" /> Cosgrave said in that interview, extracts of which have been already read for you: &ldquo;It is quite true that a conspiracy exists to prevent the detection and punishment of a certain type of crime which masquerades under the cloak of politics.  The numbers engaged in this conspiracy are very small; the majority of them are well known to the police and their movements are under constant surveillance.&rdquo; What are we doing with the £1,500,000 a year?  On what are we spending it?  Are we spending it on handsome young men who are charming all the good-looking girls of the country, because they have nothing else to do, and sending up the marriage rate at such a rapid rate as they have been doing all this time?  Is that their chief occupation?  It must be.  It certainly cannot be said that they are wasting their time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
