      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is prepared to consider reverting to the arrangement which was in force prior to 1926, when the Saorstát collected income tax from all manufacturers and traders operating in the Saorstát, whereas under the new arrangement outside competitors carrying on business in the Saorstát <Col N="2068" /> do not pay income tax to the Saorstát on their Irish profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question presumably has reference to the arrangements with the British Government in respect to double income tax, embodied in the Finance Acts of 1926 and 1928.  If so, the answer is in the negative.  The Double Taxation Relief Agreement with the British Government embodied in the Double Taxation (Relief) Order (No. 1 of 1923) and virtually superseded by the 1926 Agreement, gave rise to so many difficulties and complexities that it was almost universally condemned by Saorstát taxpayers, and in my opinion there can be no question of reverting to it. There is, of course, no provision under which a foreign commercial concern trading in the Saorstát can claim exemption from Saorstát income tax in respect of its Saorstát profits, unless it can bring itself within the scope of the 1926 Agreement with the British Government.</P>

      <P>The collector referred to was appointed prior to the change of Government, and I am unable to state whether he is acquainted with the Irish language.  As collectors of taxes are not normally transferable from one district to another, it is not proposed to take any action in the matter.  If and when a vacancy in this collector's district arises, a person able to transact business in Irish will be appointed, if a suitable candidate is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  As to the remainder, the position is that the provision of structural steel-work is included in the ordinary way in the general building contract which was given to a Saorstát firm after invitation of tenders by advertisement in the public Press. The specification contains the usual clause requiring that materials, etc., are, wherever possible, to be obtained from manufacturers operating in the Saorstát.  The contractor was instructed to order the steel work for the mess block from a local firm, quotations having been obtained only from local firms having steelyards in the Saorstát and capable of erecting the steel-work.</P>

      <P>In reply to another question on this subject on the 30th October, I stated that I was unable to agree to make a grant towards the erection of a new break-water at Portnablagh.  I was then aware of the attitude of the county council and of the fact that the works proposed were in excess of those necessary for ordinary maintenance or repair.

With regard to the second part of the question the position is that my Department has communicated with several persons who are stated to have collected subscriptions to this loan requesting them to furnish particulars of the sums they collected.  In a few cases satisfactory particulars have been furnished and authority to repay the subscriptions has been given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Further inquiries are being made in the remaining cases, but the difficulties arising from the loss of original lists and other records of subscriptions render the task a difficult one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The interrogation of Mr. Anthony Mackey when proceeding to a meeting of the Limerick Fishery Board at Limerick on November 20th took place in the following circumstances: The Gárda Síochána were informed that on the 26th October, 1925, Mr. Mackey brought a crowd of some 30 persons who were not conservators to a meeting of the Limerick Board of Conservators for the purpose of obstruction. They were aware that in October, 1928, special precautions had to be taken to prevent an organised attempt to interrupt the business of the Board on the 24th of that month, and they also were informed that on the 1st October of the present year Mr. Mackey, accompanied by one Michael Mackey and one Seán Carroll, broke up a meeting of the Conservators in Killaloe, having forced the chairman to leave the chair, and then held a meeting of their own.  The Conservators were apprehensive that a further effort at obstruction would be made at the meeting of the Board on the 20th ultimo, and they requisitioned the services of the Gárda Síochána to help in the keeping of good order.  A suitable number of police were detailed in the ordinary official way for this duty, and with a view to ascertaining the names of persons attending the meeting each person approaching the meeting was interrogated, including Mr. Mackey.  Nobody was prevented by the police from entering the building.  As regards the power of exclusion of the public, I am informed that Rule 7 of the Standing Orders adopted by the Limerick Board of Conservators provides for the exclusion of the public from meetings of the Board.  No doubt Mr. Mackey, who is a member of the Board, is familiar with the provision of this Standing Order.</P>

If the arrangement of the programme and the methods of teaching are referred to, I would point out that the Department's <Col N="2082" /> directions in these respects make very little difference between Irish and the other modern languages named, and there appears to be no reason why a school, if it prefers to do so, should not follow a programme in Irish based on the directions given for continental languages, provided this programme complies with the conditions as to standard and extent required for Irish, and makes sufficient provision for the acquisition of conversational fluency in the language.</P>

There have been papers set in Irish in which there was not a single line of poetry required.

      <P>The provision of a movable span adds considerably to the cost of erection of a bridge, and the intention to replace the existing bridge which contains such a span by a fixed bridge was doubtless dictated by this consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the bridge is wholly within the territory of Northern Ireland, the matter is of interest to this State only in so far as the replacement may have an adverse effect upon the interests of our citizens.  I have, as the Deputy knows, had this aspect of the matter examined, and I have been informed that no practical use of the opening span in the present bridge has been made for over 20 years.  I have been unable to obtain any evidence that in the present conditions the proposed replacement will impose hardships on citizens of the Irish Free State&mdash;of such an extent, at any rate, as to justify a demand for the largely increased expenditure which a movable span would involve. Nevertheless, in view of what in present circumstances seems to be a rather remote possibility, that <Col N="2086" /> developments might occur which would at some date in the future render the provision of an opening span desirable, representations have been made to the Government of Northern Ireland that they should undertake, in the event of such a possibility arising, that the necessary steps would then be taken.  The matter rests there for the moment.</P>

      <P>While the herring and salmon fishing on the Donegal coast during the past year has not been remunerative, I am not aware that any exceptional poverty exists in the Rosses in consequence.  The year has been very favourable for agriculture upon which the Rosses mainly depends, and the harvest has been above the average.  Herrings have unexpectedly appeared off the Rosses coast during the past fortnight, and in a few nights the local yawls at Burtonport and Kincasslagh have earned over eleven hundred pounds. The stormy weather of the past week has interrupted this fishing, but the herrings are reported to be still on the coast, and the fishermen are waiting improvement in the weather to resume operations.  I am having inquiries made as to lands suitable for reclamation work in this district. Such schemes, if found feasible, will involve employment on road-making and fencing.  The Land Commission has expended over £4,000 in the recent past on roads, drainage and reclamation of lands in the Lower Rosses.  Some employment will be given in the Burtonport district on repairs to slips and other small marine works.  Larger drainage schemes for this district are under consideration at the moment, but these, if they materialise, can be carried out only after the winter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that poverty is more acute in that area this year than in an <Col N="2096" /> ordinary year, owing to the comparative failure of the fishing industry and to the fact that there were fewer labourers employed in Scotland than in an ordinary year? In view of the poverty that exists will the Minister be prepared to outline any scheme which he proposes to put into operation this winter, as it is work for the winter which the people are looking for.</P>

      <P>It is not due to the failure of the fishing industry that that situation arose, as the people in the Rosses are not mainly dependent on fishing.  They are mainly agriculturists and there has been a better harvest and crops have been better than usual, so that it would be an extraordinary thing if there had been unusual poverty in the Rosses this year.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that my attitude in the matter of the new borough is, that until the new borough is consolidated under a new scheme of government I do not want to suggest the adding of any rural areas.  It is proposed that the Bill will contain machinery by which the new borough can take in rural areas after they have fully considered it.  I have personally given a good deal of consideration as to whether the rural areas ought to be brought into the borough in the Bill, and I would prefer the new Council to consider that problem.  If they consider that there are rural areas that ought to be brought in, there will be machinery provided by which they can be brought in without very much cost or delay.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall continue in force for two years from the passing thereof and shall then expire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion which we had in the House yesterday afternoon.  I then <Col N="2111" /> stated that I would bring in an amendment that this Act should remain in force for two years and no more.  As I explained in the course of the discussion, the object of putting in two years is this: that there is now a Committee sitting which is investigating the entire administration of justice in this country.  The number of judges and the appointment of judges, as well as other questions, like the question of appeals from the Circuit Court, will come under the purview of that Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  If they advise anything which is contrary to the principle of this Bill, the legislation embodying their recommendations will automatically wipe out this Bill.  But in order that they may have full time to deliberate and that the Bill following on their deliberation&mdash;as a Bill is pretty sure to follow&mdash;may have full consideration before it becomes law, it seems to me that a period of two years would be a sufficiently long period, but that any shorter period might mean coming to the Dáil for further powers, if a case like the present very urgent and pressing case for the appointment of a temporary judge were to arise.</P>

      <P>I move an amendment to the amendment of the Minister:</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;six months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In thinking over the possibilities of getting rid of some of the worst elements in this Bill one is driven to the conclusion that the only way of dealing with it was to shorten its life as nearly as possible to non-existence.  The attempt we hoped to make was to try and dissociate the work of the temporarily appointed judge from any case in which the State would be a party. But there are obvious practical difficulties in the way which led to the conclusion that the Bill is inherently defective.  In order to prevent the Bill doing damage for a period of two years our only way out of <Col N="2112" /> the difficulty is to reduce that to a period of six months.  The committee that will have in review the situation dealt with by this Bill will have finished its work in a short time and the Minister will have ample opportunity within six months to bring in the Bill required to deal with that matter.  But I think it is rather an abuse of the patience of this House to give a period of two years for dealing with a serious matter which the Minister himself admits leads to evils, and stands against the principle of the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While carrying out his undertaking given to me last night to limit the operations of this Bill to a period of two years, still I would like to endeavour to get the Minister, if possible, to reconsider his decision now in regard to that period.  I think it might be well, in discussing this amendment, which, of course, alters the whole character of the Bill, because it makes it a temporary one instead of a permanent one, to consider the real object of the Bill.  There is some misunderstanding about its object.  Under the law as it now stands, it is possible to substitute a temporary Circuit Court judge for one who is unable to perform his duties owing to illness.  That is provided for by Section 45 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  What this Bill proposes is, as I said yesterday, an entirely different thing. It is not to extend that principle, but it is introducing an entirely new one.  It says that in future not only in a case of illness may a Circuit Court judge be replaced by a temporary Circuit judge, but also, that owing to other public duties or services temporarily imposed upon him or for any other sufficient reason such substitution may be made.  I would like to impress upon the House the width and the scope of this measure, and the difference between what it proposes and what the existing law is.  That is one of the principal reasons why I endeavoured to get the Minister to make the Bill as short as possible in duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> The Minister said yesterday that he did not think there was any introduction of a new principle.  He said it was merely extending the principle embodied in the existing law.  But, as I pointed out to him, surely the fact of a judge being ill is not due to any act on the part of the State, but is what we, in legal parlance, call an act of God.  The fact of a Circuit Court judge being taken from the position in which he is put by the State, and taken from the Bench, and put into another position by the State, is entirely a different state of affairs, and should be governed by entirely different regulations.</P>
    <P>There were three alternatives open for the Minister.  The first alternative was, as pointed out yesterday, that when occasions arose to appoint men of integrity and ability and legal acumen to certain positions, the Executive need not necessarily confine themselves to the rota of Circuit judges.  There is a large body of lawyers amongst whom a good many would be found to answer the description I have just given. That would do away altogether with the necessity that has arisen in this case.  But the Minister did not seem inclined to adopt that suggestion. To my mind that was the proper course for the State to pursue.  Once a man is appointed to the position of Circuit Court judge, no matter how great his ability in that direction, and in other directions, he should not be disturbed from his post and he should be left to stick to his last.  Others might be found to preside over commissions and do other public service equally as well.</P>
    <P>The second alternative would be to create more permanent judges.  Undoubtedly there is a necessity for more judges, more Circuit Court judges, as well as High Court judges.  That would render it possible to have the areas of jurisdiction presided over by those judges curtailed, and it might give them, I do not say necessarily would give them, a certain time that they could devote to other public duties imposed upon them at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  That course <Col N="2114" /> either has not been adopted yet.  But the course adopted by this Bill as it now stands is, that at least for the period of two years, according to the Minister's amendment, the State is to have the power to appoint any number of temporary judges it pleases on the grounds that owing to other public duties or for any other sufficient reason a judge cannot fulfil his duties on the Bench.  That I suggest is a very wide scope of discretion to give to the Executive Council.  The principle of appointing temporary judges at all is I think a vicious one and one which should not be entertained; and all the more so if that principle was to be made permanent in this Bill, if it became law, as it originally stood enabling, at any future time, the then existing Government to appoint any number of temporary judges to take the place of existing Circuit Court judges who might be pursuing elsewhere public duties or for any other sufficient reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister has carried out his undertaking to limit the operations of this Bill to two years and certainly so far so good.  In doing that I admit that the whole character of the Bill has become altered because instead of being a permanent measure it has become more or less a temporary one.  What I would have preferred would be that the Minister would have introduced a strictly <i>ad hoc</i> measure for the immediate necessities of this case which he said was a particularly urgent one but he preferred not to do so.</P>
    <P>He has preferred the method that is now adopted.  There is one gratification we must have, at any rate, and that is, that this measure is not to be taken as a precedent for the whole future policy of this country in regard to the appointment of judges.  We have that crumb of satisfaction from the Minister's intention and amendment to limit the operation of this Bill to two years. I would have preferred, and I still prefer, that it should be limited still further.  I do not see the necessity for the two years' limitation.  I think it might have been six months <Col N="2115" /> or might possibly even yet be reduced to one year.  I do not know whether he would consider splitting the difference between Deputy Little's proposal and his own in agreeing to limit the Bill to one year.  Personally I abhor the Bill because I think it is against the principles of the Constitution and the principles of justice as it should be properly administered by impartial and independent judges.</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House by going into any other argument on that score because I think there is no one in the House, including the Minister himself&mdash;in fact, he has himself admitted that he has not any love for the policy of creating temporary judges&mdash;in favour of it, and the only thing I would like to ask is if it would be possible for the Minister to consider now the reduction of the period from two years if not to six months at least to one year.  Then it would be really more an <i>ad hoc</i> proposal to meet the immediate emergency and necessity of the case.  If he does not choose to do so, of course, I am personally bound by my undertaking to support this Bill, because he has distinctly altered the character of it by conceding the period of two years as against making it a permanent measure which I would have strenuously opposed.</P>

      <P>Taking Deputy Redmond's speech as a whole I think what really his argument would be if carried out to a logical conclusion is this, that you have a certain number of Circuit Court judges.  You are never to have a temporary judge there.  You are only to have a superfluous whole-time judge.  That is what his argument would come to.  Judges will always get sick.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow me to speak.  I did not interrupt him.  You must take one or other of two alternatives; one is you leave the court without a judge; and the other is that <Col N="2116" /> you appoint a temporary judge. You must do one or the other. Therefore, I will assume that the House thinks that litigants ought not to be left without a court to litigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I really must interrupt the Minister.  I am very sorry, but the Minister rather misrepresented me, because in regard to sickness or illness of judges I never suggested that not only should he not have powers, but I went on to show that there is power under the Courts of Justice Act to appoint a substitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald - Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald - Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald - Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not allow me to develop my argument.  He always comes in before my argument is half finished. I will try and get back to my argument. It is this.  You have got alternatives, one is you either leave litigants without a court, and if you do it is unjust to litigants not to have a court in which to settle their differences.  That is, I think, agreed by the whole House.  If you do not you have in the case of illness either a whole time judge in reserve ready to be called upon in the case of illness of the judge who actually gets sick.  That would be too expensive an expedient for the State.  With regard to the other and last case left, that in the case of illness there must be a temporary judge, the Deputy endeavoured to draw a distinction between a temporary judge appointed because a judge is sick and a temporary judge appointed because it is thought advisable that a man eminently suited for the position should be for a short time employed otherwise than in his capacity as judge.  The particular instance which has arisen now is that of the Chairman of a Commission.  I cannot see the difference.  If a judge is appointed in the case of sickness and is temporary he will act exactly the same as the same man would act if appointed for any other reason.  The objection to temporary judges is that they have not got the permanency of position and, therefore, it is said that they cannot have the same complete independence as a permanent judge would have, but that argument is <Col N="2117" /> equally applicable to a judge appointed in the case of illness and a judge appointed for some other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says it is introducing a new principle.  I do not think it is.  It is introducing a temporary judge when for some very grave reason the regular judge is not available or as has happened now in a very unusual case, when you have what you might call the partial illness of one of the judges.  It is impossible to carry out the work of the Courts at the moment.  For that reason, because litigants are at the present moment without a forum in which to litigate, I put forward this Bill to the House as a really urgent and necessary Bill in the interest of litigants.  Deputy Little suggests six months.  Everybody knows, I am sure, that before a committee could sit on a large question like the Courts of Justice Act, hear evidence, think out and draw up its well considered report, and before that could be duly considered by the Executive Council and, when duly considered by the Executive Council, put into the hands of the parliamentary draftsman, a considerable time would elapse.  Every Deputy in the House knows that the hands of the Parliamentary draftsman are very full indeed at the moment and, in consequence, I see absolutely no hope of a new Courts of Justice Bill within six months.  I think it is highly improbable that there will be a new Courts of Justice Bill within a year.  I think it almost certain that there will be a new Courts of Justice Bill within two years.  It is rather generally assumed that the principle of this Bill may not commend itself to the Joint Committee which is sitting. I do not know whether it will or will not, but it will be a matter which they will have to very gravely consider.  I am not going to make any attempt to forecast what their decision may be, nor do I think it would be altogether courteous for me to suggest to them what their decision should be.  I do not think that that would be <Col N="2118" /> right.  I simply leave it completely in the air, as a matter which they will consider.  If they come to the conclusion that a temporary judge should not be appointed in any circumstances or that a temporary judge should only be appointed in certain limited circumstances well and good.  But, at any rate, give us time to be sure if a crisis like this comes, and I look at it from the point of view of certain litigants as a crisis, during the period before they have reported and before the principles they have reported become embodied in law, let us have some means of giving litigants a forum in which to litigate.  For that reason, I cannot accept either Deputy Little's six months or Deputy Redmond's year, and I would ask the House really to consider this as a Bill that is urgent.  I cannot see that there is any new principle involved in it.  Nobody likes temporary judges, but it seems to me that we must recognise that temporary judges are an exception to be used as little as possible. There are occasions when they must be used.  It seems to be a sound principle.  I venture to think it is not a principle at which anybody in the House could seriously cavil.</P>

Drafting a Bill is a most difficult and intricate matter.  I venture to say that nobody will disagree, with me when I say that Bills which come into this House from the Parliamentary draftsman's office are very well drafted indeed, and that every amendment we see drafted in the Parliamentary draftsman's office gives the utmost satisfaction.</P>

      <P>As I reminded the House last evening one of the first Acts of the year 1923 was the Act appointing the Comptroller and Auditor-General and charging him with the duty of examining every appropriation account.  That Act conferred upon him, for the proper discharge of that duty, powers of inquiry, investigation, and report limited only by his own discretion. He was to discharge that duty in accordance with the principles which had been laid down by the earlier British Acts of 1876 and 1921 which Acts were cited in the present Act of the Oireachtas.  Among the other things which were to determine him in the conduct of his inquiry there <Col N="2123" /> was the principle that no Department has the right to refuse information&mdash;even though of a highly confidential character&mdash;to the Comptroller and Auditor-General if he requires it to satisfy himself that the expenditure had agreed with the Parliamentary Appropriation.</P>
      <P>A further principle was also laid down by the Public Accounts Committee of Great Britain, and that was that the Comptroller and Auditor-General alone was competent to say what information is necessary for the discharge of his statutory functions That was the position when the Act was introduced.  That was the position which held here until the Board of Assessors, I think, in the year 1925 challenged the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have access to documents which that Board held were confidential.  As a result of that there developed a controversy which has ended in the introduction of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put before the House an important principle which is at stake here.  Up to the challenge by the Board of Assessors these two things were held&mdash;that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have access to all documents, even documents of a highly confidential nature; and that he alone was competent to say what documents were necessary to him in order to discharge his duty.  This right was challenged by the Board of Assessors.  The matter was argued for some time and then the Executive Council come here and introduce a Bill by which it is implied that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no right to demand confidential documents in this particular case, and, therefore, confidential documents in any case.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no right of access to the files in this matter, what right has he in any other case in which this plea of confidence and secrecy may be advanced?  And if that principle is once conceded by this House then, in the words of the Minister for Agriculture, the Comptroller and <Col N="2124" /> Auditor-General has no function worth twopence in relation to these files, in relation to any documents, or in relation to any accounts.  That is the issue that is involved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let the House once admit that the Comptroller and Auditor-General exceeded his right in asking for these confidential documents and what was pleaded by the Board of Assessors will undoubtedly be pleaded by other Departments whenever a question that it might be awkward for them to have investigated arises. Because of their action in introducing this Bill the Executive Council are deliberately limiting the powers of inquiry and investigation which hitherto had been reposed in the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>Now, suppose that this is done under Cosgrave's Government; suppose that the Department of Justice decides that certain moneys expended on it for certain services are based upon confidential documents; that pledges of secrecy have been given to certain persons and they advance that as a reason why the Comptroller and Auditor-General will not have access to certain files; if that is done by the Department of Justice as it is being done by the Board of Assessors under Cosgrave's Presidency what is to prevent it being done under the presidency of Deputy de Valera or some successor of his? Supposing there was under Deputy de Valera's Presidency a sum of £4,000,000 appropriated for services of education and that in the matter of that £4,000,000 the Accounting Officer said to the Comptroller and Auditor-General: &ldquo;You may examine and audit how we have expended £3,000,000 of that money, but there is £1,000,000 of an expenditure that you must not inquire into because we are bound in that case by pledges of secrecy to those who have been the recipients of that money.&rdquo;  That money quite possibly might have been expended in carrying out propaganda in another State.  By a process of reasoning to which we have been accustomed <Col N="2125" /> in this House from the Minister for Justice, it is quite possible another Minister of the same mentality might argue that propaganda in another State was really educating the populace of that State.  All the time while that was being done the Accounting Officer responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor-General could argue that because of certain pledges of secrecy which he had given, the Comptroller and Auditor-General was not going to be permitted to inquire into the manner in which these funds were expended.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through you will shear the Comptroller and Auditor-General of all the powers that are necessary to enable him to discharge his duties properly.  You will leave to the Comptroller and Auditor-General functions which, as the Minister for Agriculture has already said, would not be worth twopence.  You will destroy the constitutional principles that the Dáil must have control over all public expenditure without exception. Those are the principles which are at stake in this matter. I ask those who feel that the control of the Dáil over public expenditure should be upheld, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should act in accordance with the principles laid down in Great Britain so long ago as 1876, that he should have access to all documents no matter what their nature may be, and that he alone is competent to determine what documents are necessary to enable him properly to discharge his duties, to support those principles by voting against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been emphasised well enough by Deputy MacEntee that an attempt is being made to create a precedent here that should not be permitted by this House.  If, for instance, under this Bill a precedent is created by which certain money spent by the Department of Justice cannot properly be inquired into by the Comptroller and Auditor-General or by this House, what is to prevent any other <Col N="2126" /> Department of the State, having bungled in dealing with public funds, from coming to the House with another Bill of this nature and demanding that it be passed?  The strongest argument in favour of its adoption would be the passing of this Bill.  This is creating a precedent which should not be established by the House in relation to public funds.</P>
      <P>Surely if it is thought that people who have got pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act have been entitled to them, and if there is no fraud to cover up, why is there any anxiety on the part of the Minister for Defence or the Government when the Comptroller and Auditor-General claims the right to examine the files on which these pensions were granted?  I believe that the Government, knowing that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not biassed by any political opinions, and knowing him to be just and honest in his office, fear his justice more than anything else.  That is the reason, and the only reason, for this Bill.  They fear that if the documents on which these pensions have been granted were examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, it would be discovered that an amount of fraud has been committed, and that in the committing of this fraud not only the recipients of the pensions are involved, but the Board of Assessors, two members of which are members of the Government Party also involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think I am entitled to assume that this Bill is being brought in by the Government to prevent fraud being discovered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy conveyed was that there was fraud not only on the part of the recipients of the pensions, but on the part of the members of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It may be possible that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will discover that the <Col N="2127" /> Board of Assessors did not deal justly with the cases that came before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that it will be discovered that not only were the recipients of the pensions guilty of fraud, but also the Board of Assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the impression that my statement conveyed, I withdraw that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be more careful because it is improper in a privileged Assembly such as this to make what can only be regarded as a very scandalous statement and then to make a simple withdrawal.  It is not a procedure that will reflect any credit on the Assembly to make grave statements which could be made nowhere else against individuals and then calmly to withdraw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be satisfied with a withdrawal in a case like that.  I would be prepared to go out of my way to try to repair anything that might be implied in my remarks. I assume, anyhow, that this Bill is brought forward for no other reason than to prevent a thorough inquiry into the granting of pensions. The Government feel that pensions have been obtained fraudulently by certain people and, in their efforts to cover up that, this Bill has been introduced.  It is the general opinion in the country that very many people have got army pensions who are not entitled to them.  From the evidence that I have, and the names that have been given by other Deputies here and the cases cited by them, it has been proved that people have obtained pensions who were not entitled to them.  Deputy MacEntee also proved a case where the Pensions Board produced a certificate that a certain gentleman was entitled to a pension because of wounds received.  When that certificate was examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General it was discovered that the claimant for the <Col N="2128" /> pension was not involved in the making of that certificate so much as the Pensions Board, that they had framed that certificate, and that certificate was falsely framed.  I think we are entitled to assume that when this Bill is introduced it is an attempt on the part of the Government, or on the part of the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is bad enough for the Deputy himself to make charges against boards, but now he says the Comptroller and Auditor-General proved that a Pensions Board&mdash;it is not clear what precise Pensions Board &mdash; falsely framed a certificate.  I have read everything that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has ever written. and nearly everything that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has said at the Public Accounts Committee, since he was appointed, and to attribute to him the statement that a Pensions Board falsely framed a certificate is fantastic.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not make these charges implicating the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General may have stated, as it is his function to state on occasions, that a particular payment was not in accordance with statutory authority.  That is the form of many statements by the Comptroller and Auditor-General on such matters. What the Deputy has stated is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General proved that a particular Pensions Board had falsely framed a certificate. The Deputy ought not to make such statements.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to deal at any length with this Bill.  I welcome it, but I think on the whole that the Bill is unnecessary and has been introduced more as an act of courtesy on the part of the Government than for any other reason. The innocent Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of an otherwise interesting speech, made an extraordinary attempt to reason with the Labour Party with regard to this Bill.  The innocent Deputy O'Higgins was too new to this House to realise that to reason with the Labour Party with regard to this Bill is absolutely useless and unnecessary, because from the very beginning the Labour Party has approached this question of the audit of the military service pensions, not from the point of view of reason, but from the point of view of the passionately emotional, and I think that if we have a speech from Deputy Davin on this Second Reading debate Deputies will realise that he also approaches this matter from a passionately emotional point of view.  This is, in fact, a skeleton in the cupboard of the Labour Party. The matter which is being settled in this Bill is the addled egg which was laid by the Labour Party three and a half years ago, and which was made a political party question by the Labour Party in the General Election before the last, and although the Labour Party have been sitting on this addled egg for the <Col N="2136" /> last few years nothing has yet come out of it.</P>

      <P>The reason why the Labour Party are opposed to this Bill, and the reason why they approach it with such passionate emotionalism, is due to the fact, in my opinion, that they are in a curious position as between the two main Parties in this Dáil.  A large number of the members of both the main Parties have had common experiences and have common memories of the revolutionary period before the Truce which is defined in this Bill with reference to pre-Truce military service, and the Labour Party, I think very patriotically, refrained from taking part in political activities until the national question had been settled.  But there seems to be a morbid curiosity on the part of the Labour Party to discover exactly who shot who before the Truce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that this Bill has been introduced, according to the statement of the Minister for <Col N="2138" /> Finance, who introduced it, in order to allay any suspicions that there may have been as to the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General with reference to the military service pensions and their audit.  Extraordinary statements were made by Deputy Davin.  He made the suggestion that the Public Accounts Committee had suggested that the pensions paid up to the present were illegal.  He made a statement to that effect in the House last week&mdash;&ldquo;It is regularising and legalising the payments already made or to be made in future.&rdquo;  He definitely said or suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ah!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that the Public Accounts Committee had implied in its Report that the payments already made were illegal.  If Deputies read the Report of the Public Accounts Committee they will see that that is an entirely wrong doctrine.  The first theory with reference to the audit of these accounts was put forward by Senator Johnson and is mentioned in the account of proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts for 1927, the first year in which this was considered.  He produced a long statement which was, in the opinion of the Public Accounts Committee, apocryphal and heretical, and the true doctrine as to the constitutional position was enunciated by the Public Accounts Committee of that date, which pointed out that pre-Truce service bore a strong analogy to what is ordinarily the subject of secret service.  The Committee subsequently brought in a slight amendment to their previous decision, and when Deputy Davin suggests that the Committee deliberately reversed its previous decision and declared that these payments were illegal, I think he is not giving a correct interpretation of the minutes as found in the Report of the Committee.  The only words which are to be found are these:&mdash;&ldquo;On further consideration the Committee is of opinion that it is undesirable to deal with a charge which occurs annually in a manner which <Col N="2139" /> appears to limit the powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo; That word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; is very important.  Then it concludes:&mdash;&ldquo;The Committee is therefore of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to remove this anomalous position and to regularise the audit of the expenditure arising out of the Military Service Pensions Act.&rdquo;&ldquo;To regularise the audit.&rdquo;  There is no question about regularising the payments; it is a question of regularising the audit. It is for that reason, in order to satisfy the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that this Bill has been introduced. Naturally the followers of the anti-State in this House oppose this Bill, just as they oppose the Military Service Pensions Bill, because these pensions are given to men who knocked hell out of them a few years ago.  They should develop that new spirit which is so much in evidence now throughout the world, as exemplified by the dinner given recently by General Smuts to his former opponent, and they should show a little more sportsmanship in dealing with these matters. If I were not a private Deputy I would be most anxious to extend the scope of this Bill, and to include amongst the pensioners all those who had taken part in this struggle to establish the State, irrespective of whether they had subsequently been misled by the wiles of the anti-State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  I quite realise how sensitive members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are in this discussion, and I realise how difficult it is to make a case against this Bill without being ruled out of order.  However, I will have to try to keep, as far as possible, at any rate, within the procedure laid down by the Ceann Comhairle during the course of the discussion on this Bill.  If this Bill is passed the Board of Assessors will be entirely uncontrolled in the matter of awarding military service pensions.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General will not be allowed to examine the documents on which the claim to the pension is alleged to be based.  It is an extraordinary thing that in all other public expenditure the minutest details, and all documents relating to such expenditure, are placed before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  When we come across a Bill such as this, aiming at such extraordinary legislation, we have naturally to ask ourselves, why is this extraordinary exception made?  The Board of Assessors are to work in secret, and the documents on which they are to base their awards are not to be disclosed. I suggest that the reason why these documents are not disclosed is to be found in the fact that the Military Service Pensions Act has been availed of for the purposes of political graft.  I do not make that statement in this House, guided by the knowledge that I am in a privileged Assembly.  Anything I state in <Col N="2141" /> relation to the Military Service Pensions Act in this House I am quite prepared to state outside.</P>
      <P>But I am aware that, for instance, in Co. Monaghan during the recent elections there military service pensions were disbursed wholesale by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to men who were not entitled to those pensions according to the Military Service Pensions Act, and I will undertake to prove, in any number of cases, that as far as 60 per cent. of the people who have got these pensions are concerned, they are not entitled to these pensions according to law.  In the town of Monaghan alone, and it is not a very big town, I will undertake to mention half-a-dozen cases, and I will undertake to prove that they are not entitled, according to the Military Service Pensions Act, to pensions.  It is a strange thing that most of these applications had been pressed forward on many occasions between the passing of the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 and the general elections of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary fact that they were turned down time and again for some unknown reason, at least for some reason that will not be put before the public or the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  These people, during the elections of 1927. in June and September, became entitled to military service pensions.  I understand that names are not being mentioned in the course of this debate, and that we must confine ourselves to cases which we are prepared to cite.  I am quite prepared to conform to that rule of debate.  I want to draw the attention of the House to a number of questions concerning military service pensions which I asked in this House on the 13th June, 1928.  I beg now to draw the attention of the House to these questions and to the answers.  The first question is No. 21 on the Order Paper for the 13th June, 1928, and I will refer to the person mentioned in that question as No. 21.  I asked the Minister for Defence if he was aware that No. 21 was in receipt of a military service pension: that he was courtmartialed during the <Col N="2142" /> Truce period and dismissed from the Irish Republican Army, and that the courtmartial sentence was confirmed by the Divisional Commandant, Dan Hogan.  I also asked the date on which the pension was awarded and the date on which the first payment was made.  The Minister replied that the person mentioned was in receipt of a pension as stated; that he was not aware that he was courtmartialed during the Truce period, or that he was dismissed from the Volunteers.  The pension was awarded on the 30th November, 1927, and the first payment was made on the 12th December, 1927. This man was courtmartialed and dismissed from the Irish Republican Army early in 1922.  He never served in the Free State Army in his life, not one hour&mdash;neither did his brother, for that matter, and he also has a pension.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what steps he has taken since the 13th June to ascertain the accuracy, or otherwise, of the allegations which I made regarding this man's position and his claim for a pension.  He certainly has not asked me about it, nor has he asked my assistance in establishing whether this man was entitled to a pension.  He knows that I would have first hand knowledge by reason of the position which I held at that time.</P>

      <P>We have been hemmed in so much it is very hard to devise means by which one can deal with this matter.  I think it will do, with all due respect.  I asked the Minister for Defence whether No. 22 is in receipt of a military service pension and to state the date on which the pension was awarded, the date on <Col N="2144" /> which the first payment was made, and the period of service on which the pension was made.  Further, I asked whether he was aware that No. 22 was courtmartialed and dismissed from the Irish Republican Army during the Truce period, and that the courtmartial sentence was confirmed by the Divisional Commandant. The Minister admitted that this person was in receipt of a pension which was awarded on the 12th September, 1927, and the first payment was made on 23rd November, 1927.  He further stated that the periods of service on which the pension is based are as follows:&mdash;One-twelfth of period from 1st April, 1920, to 31st March, 1921; entire period from 1st April, 1921, to 30th June, 1922; entire period from 24th September, 1922, to 30th September, 1923.  The Minister said that he was not aware that the person mentioned was courtmartialed during the Truce period.  The Minister is not aware that this courtmartial took place either.</P>

I have no intention of disclosing it publicly, but if anyone wants to know I will give the information privately.  I desire to tell the House and to tell the Minister that, for being a party to the same offence, a civilian was fined £200.  He did not pay and he was taken to a military camp and confined for three weeks.  He was released, and the first day that he opened his shop the military from Beggar's Bush seized £50 towards payment of the fine.  That man's business was ruined, and he is now out of the country, whereas the other man, who was courtmartialed and dismissed, is now drawing a pension.</P>

      <P>Surely, the 12th September. I wonder how we got any votes at all.  The person referred to in Question 23 is in receipt of a pension. The period of service on which the pension was based was from the 1st April, 1921, to 30th September, 1923, and the pension was awarded on 2nd September, 1927.  I also asked the Minister for Defence whether he would state the date on which a military service pension was awarded to No. 24, the date on which the first payment was made, and the service on which the pension was based.  The date on which the pension was awarded was 2nd September, 1927.  These people live in the town of Monaghan, and the date on which the first payment of the pension was made was 5th November, 1927.  The period of service upon which the pension was based made up the following periods:&mdash;entire period from 1st April, 1921, to 30th June, 1922; one-twelfth of period from 1st July, 1922, to 31st March, 1923.  I live in that area, in the town which is not a very big town.  That man was never in the Free State Army.  We may be told that he was a Secret Service agent and that he was pensioned on that basis, but if all the men who are drawing pensions in the town of Monaghan were in the Secret Service, I wonder that we were able to carry on at all.  It looks as if everybody was spying on us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy.  In the first case about <Col N="2146" /> which the Deputy asked a question, I know all about it, because on the occasion he volunteered certain information. He said that he knew the facts, that the man had been courtmartialed and dismissed from the Army.  He referred to a certain officer who knew the details of that. He refers to other cases as Nos. 22, 23 and 24.  Did he in a similar way give such information as he would be in a position to give about these cases?  Did he, or did he not?</P>

Considering that I have been available since, if he wanted any information or to make any inquiry into these cases, he could easily have got it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that would not enter into it.  I pass on to No. 25 on the Order Paper of the 13th June of last year.  The person referred to in that question is in receipt of a pension.  The pension was awarded on the 7th September, 1927. The period of service was one-twelfth of the period from 1st April, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921; the entire periods from the 1st April, 1921, to 30th June, 1922, and one-twelfth of the period from the 1st July, 1922, to the 31st March, 1923. The person referred to in that question is a tradesman in the whole-time employment of a public body. During the Anglo-Irish war he was never an hour away from his work. He was on full pay all the time.  He was not in the Intelligence Department during the Anglo-Irish war.  I do not know if he was a secret servant during the civil war, but I do know that during the civil war he never lost an hour from his employment. I submit that No. 25 is one of the cases that could not very well go before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /> The next case is No. 26 on the Order Paper of the 13th June.  This person is in receipt of a pension, as admitted by the Minister, and the period of service covers 1921, 1922, and one-fourth of the period from 1st July, 1922, to 31st March, 1923. The pension was awarded on the 5th May, 1927, and the first payment was made on the 1st June, 1927&mdash;a very good time to make it.  I happen to know this man was a public representative.  I happen to know that he was particularly hostile to the Minister for Finance in April and May, 1927.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>He served there faithfully and well.  I can mention as many cases similar to those as the Minister would like to hear.  Perhaps he has heard enough.  If he requires any more, as I stated at the outset, I will give him any number of similar cases.  In my deliberate opinion, based on my own intimate knowledge of the situation, these people are not entitled, according to the Military Service Pensions Act, to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  I have so far stated the cases of men who were not entitled to a military service pension and who, in my opinion, at any rate, were awarded military service pensions because of their political services. There is another class of case to which I want to refer.  That is the class of case where persons were entitled to pensions and did not get them.  I know the cases of men who <Col N="2148" /> do come within the terms of the Military Service Pensions Act, but who would not swallow the imperial pill.  They left the Free State Army after a couple of years' service, and when they would not give their allegiance to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, there was no pension for them.  One of these cases, in the Scotshouse area, the Minister may know of.  If he does not know about it, I will give him any details that he requires.  This man served for two years in the Free State Army.  He was certified by Irish Republican officers as having taken part in every Irish Republican Army activity in the area during the Anglo-Irish war.  He was discharged with a good record from the Free State Army, but that record failed lamentably when he would not subscribe to continue to give his allegiance to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    <P>The other case of which I have personal knowledge is in the Killeevan district.  This man served all during the Anglo-Irish war.  He served two years in the Free State Army and he was discharged with a good record but he got no pension. I mentioned this case at one time by way of curiosity, to a member of the Board of Assessors.  I just wanted to know how they arrived at these decisions as I thought it would be of interest and he told me that his service in the Free State Army was all right, but that he did not give the necessary pre-Truce service and that if he had given the necessary pre-Truce service, he would have been entitled to a pension.  I ventured to ask what particular amount of service was required to entitle him to a pension and I was told by that member of the Board of Assessors that he should have taken part in an actual ambush.  In fact, he would nearly want to know the colour of the eyebrows of the men he shot, if he was on the wrong side. He would have to take part in an actual ambush; he was not of the right political persuasion.  The men I have mentioned here did not have to take part in actual ambushes.  I have here a certificate from General <Col N="2149" /> Eoin O'Duffy regarding this particular man's record, and his pre-Truce service.  If that certificate is worth the paper that it is written on, and if this man was not entitled to a pension on his pre-Truce service, there is no man in County Monaghan, including General O'Duffy himself, who is entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>Here is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in testifying to the splendid national record of Mr. A.  He took part in all the Volunteer activities in his area, and owing to his connection with the movement he lost his job. After the truce he joined the National Army and served until he became incapacitated from a fall in barracks.  He is a widower with three young children dependent upon him, and, having no employment, his present circumstances can be easily imagined.&mdash; Eoin O'Duffy, Chief Commissioner.</P>

      <P>I do not think even at the price that he would do it.  There is another angle of this Military Service Pensions Bill to which I wish to draw attention, and I think I can satisfy the House that from this angle also it is very necessary that the light of day should be let in on the decisions of the Board of Assessors. On 10th July last I asked a question in this House for the names, the rank, the gratuity, the annual service pension and the annual reserve grant of officers who resigned from the passing of the Military Service Pensions Act in 1924 down to that date.  I got a reply to that question, but it is too long to read it.  I find, however, that the amount of the gratuities paid up to date to officers who resigned since <Col N="2150" /> the passing of the Act of 1924 down to that date was £368,000&mdash;in gratuities alone already drawn.  I think that on that heading alone, on a matter involving an expenditure of £368,000, the Auditor-General is entitled to know, we are entitled to know, and the country is entitled to know, if the people who have drawn that money held the rank that it is alleged they held and if they are entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I looked down this long list involved in that £368,000 of gratuities I found that there were certain familiar names missing.  I thought for a little while and I discovered where the loophole was.  The question asked for the names, the rank, the gratuity, the service pension, and the reserve grant of officers who had retired since the passing of the Act of 1924.  It did not include, of course, the officers who had retired before the passing of the Act of 1924, but to whom the terms of the Act were subsequently applied. I wrote to the Department of Defence pointing out that from my point of view it was more important that we should get this information concerning the officers who had retired before the passing of the Act, inasmuch as there would be more suspicion in the public mind regarding the transactions carried out at that period.  The Minister and his Department parleyed with me a little, but they refused to disclose the information.  I do not want to read the letters as it would take too long but they pointed out to me the amount of labour that would be involved in going through the files of the number of officers involved, and they informed me that if I were interested in eliciting the information regarding any particular individual that, of course, they would place the information at my disposal. But this important disclosure was made &mdash; that the number of officers who had retired before the passing of the Act, and to whom the terms of the Act were applied, was 2,800.  If I am to find out the details that I want regarding each one of these officers, it is suggested that the simple way to do it, the <Col N="2151" /> business way to do it, the methodical way to do it, and the labour-saving way to do it, is to write 2,800 letters. I am not prepared to do that.  I suppose we will find it out some way, or, of course, we could, if we knew all these people, put down 2,800 questions on the Order Paper, and, I suppose, have 2,800 debates on the Adjournment, but the Minister would probably have vacated the Front Bench before we would have finished it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood in this matter.  Under existing circumstances, until this Act is repealed, people who are entitled by law to pensions must get them.  We hope in the near future to be in a position to repeal that Act, because we do not stand for pensions for able-bodied men.  We are quite prepared to see that people who have been wounded in any of the wars of independence in this country will get pensions, but, in the present state of things in this country, or under any circumstances, we cannot stand for giving pensions to able-bodied men. It is altogether contrary to the spirit that animated the men who took part in the struggle for independence.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how do men like Deputies Haslett, Good, Cole and Myles come to support the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on a matter such as this, involving such a huge amount of the people's money, and how do they come to support a Bill such as this, that is to wrap in secrecy and mystery the circumstances under which this money is being doled out.  Deputy Haslett, for instance, was returned by the Protestant Association of the Co. Monaghan.  He was a farmer; he may live to be a farmer again; he may go back to the land, perhaps, after the next election; and I would certainly consider it most interesting to hear a speech from Deputy Haslett on this Bill.  I do not suppose we will be treated to it, but to vote silently on a question such as this, is more than I can understand. There is an extraordinary qualification <Col N="2152" /> for a pension &mdash; a most amazing qualification &mdash; and again I would very much like to know the mentality in approaching this of the men on the Independent Benches&mdash; the men who used to be on them. In order to qualify for a military service pension you must have served in arms in establishing the Government of the Irish Republic, and you must have served in arms in suppressing the Government of the Irish Republic.  It seems to me to be a most extraordinary qualification for a pension, but there it is.  Presumably, the Deputies on the Independent Benches, including Deputy Haslett, satisfied themselves that the service to the Empire in suppressing the Republic outweighs the service to the Irish Nation in establishing it.</P>

Anyhow, I do not think there is any use in continuing. A man could talk even to Christmas Eve here upon this subject, and it does not matter how damaging the facts might be, or what case is put up, or how indefensible is the position taken up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Independent Party, or any other party that supports this Bill.  The whip is being put on, a secret arrangement has been come to, the vote will be cast and the Bill will probably become law.  I am satisfied of this, that we at any rate have put the truth before the House, and if the House is prepared to vote for the Bill and make it the law of the Twenty-six Counties, they are entitled to do so, but I believe the people will have something to say to it later on.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Defence intends to persist with this Bill after hearing the statement made by Deputy Ward.  Is he going to proceed in accordance with the words of the Minister for Finance, who said that this is definitely a Bill to prevent any inquiry into the pensions of such cases as were mentioned by Deputy Ward? Does any Deputy opposite with any sense of fair play or honesty stand for that?  The Minister for Finance, in his opening statement, said that the Public Accounts Committee discussed it, and finally it was promised by the Government that the matter would be regularised and the dispute would be brought to an end by legislation.  Now if the manner of bringing the dispute to an end by legislation is to be legislation that the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not, by any means, get to see even a single one of the cases mentioned by Deputy Ward, I do not think that there is any honest Deputy in this House who will vote for this Bill.  That is if there is any honesty left to Deputies on the benches opposite.</P>
      <P>After what I saw here last week, when the Minister for Local Government and Public Health introduced an amendment, and then he himself and his Party voting against it afterwards, I cannot say much for the Party opposite.  I understood when I heard Deputy Ward's statement the anxiety of Deputy O'Higgins that this Bill should go through.  I understand exactly the reasons for the statement he made here when he said that these cases would be referred back by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Public Accounts Committee and that there would be scandal in so many words. That was a statement made by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the statement was made in the House.  It will be found at page 1759. No. 5, Volume 32, of the Official Report, and the statement <Col N="2154" /> made was: &ldquo;Deputies on all sides of this House know that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has got to report to the Public Accounts Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee in turn have to report back to this House, and that, year after year, that particular report is made the subject of rather large headings in the daily papers. Do they want us to believe that there is going to be departure from that if the Public Accounts Committee deal with this particular subject?  If it is referred to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee it will naturally appear in the Press.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Higgin's statement is that if these cases go back to the Comptroller and Auditor-General they will be referred by him to the Public Accounts Committee.  Every Deputy knows that no case is referred by the Comptroller and Auditor-General back to the Public Accounts Committee except a case which, in his opinion, was a wrong payment, and there are going to be a great many of these cases referred back, and according to Deputy O'Higgins there are going to be glare headings in the Press every day about them. That is the condition of the Bill which Deputies on the opposite side will have to support and to go back to their constituents after having done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to serve as a responsible officer in the I.R.A. in one particular area from 1917 to 1922.  I was in charge of that district for the whole period and I knew every individual in that area who had any service in the I.R.A. during that period.  As a matter of curiosity I addressed a question to the Minister for Defence some time ago and got a reply.  I might say that in that reply the Minister for Defence did not give the information required. The reply, to my mind, was a falsehood in itself.  The reply said that a man named So-and-so from Cork had got a pension of so-and-so.  It did not say whether the man was from North Cork, South Cork, East Cork or West Cork.  It gave no information on that.  Cork is a very <Col N="2155" /> large county and I congratulate the Minister for trying to cloak the issue.  I made inquiries and I may state for the information of the House that about March, 1921, individuals in my district who were not members of the I.R.A. went round at night to the homes of those who were out on active service and told their people that it was a shame for their sons to be out fighting for another district.  They endeavoured to interfere with the activities of the I.R.A. in that matter.  In order to prevent that, early in April, 1921, I issued an Order by which all able-bodied men in my district who were not members of the I.R.A. were liable to be called up in a labour battalion and to be engaged cutting trees and digging drains and breaking bridges and that.  I have tracked down two of these pensions that are being paid.  All the services these individuals had rendered pre-Truce and the services for which they got these pensions were that on two occasions they were dragged out of bed to join the labour battalion in cutting down trees and breaking bridges.  That is all the service they rendered.  If the House thinks that this entitles these men to pensions then they will vote for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask even any members of Cumann na nGaedheal here who are interested in the welfare of the country if they consider it just and honest that the source of information on which those pensions&mdash;the cases quoted by Deputy Ward and others&mdash;should be withheld and that they should continue to draw their pensions without any inquiry into the manner in which the pensions were given.  I can give other cases, the case of one individual, for instance, who was sworn in by the present Minister for Finance in 1914 when he was carrying a pike down in Cork in the days before he turned over to the Empire.  This man served actively during the whole period up to the truce.  He joined the National Army after the truce, and on account of his pre-truce service was made a lieutenant.  He served up to 1924, when he resigned from the <Col N="2156" /> National Army, and got no pension or anything else because apparently he took some small part in activities for which some of the ringleaders were&mdash;I will not say drummed out, but&mdash;swept out of the Army, and for which those individuals who were ringleaders in whatever happened are at present in receipt of large pensions.  This man joined, owing to the fluent tongue and persuasion of the present Minister for Finance, the Irish Volunteers in 1914, served actively up to 1921, and joined the National Army when the split came and served as a lieutenant in the National Army up to 1924.  Is there any justice in depriving that man of a pension because apparently he was one of the dupes, and at the same time award the ringleaders in the revolt large pensions?  That was the position of affairs.  Men whose names at the time were mentioned in this House were driven out of the Army.  They were afterwards given large pensions.  I met this unfortunate dupe walking about at home, with the heels gone from and the toes out of his shoes.  He was deprived of any pension, whilst the gentlemen I mentioned continue to draw large pensions.  Where is the justice in that?</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies opposite that if there was ever an occasion when they should assert their rights here, this is it.  The time has gone, owing to our presence here, when the Front Bench will hit them with a mallet if they do.  If there is any backbone in them, now is the time for them to assert themselves and not to let a burden be placed on the unfortunate taxpayers of their constituencies for whom they are appealing here day after day and week after week. Personally, while the Military Service Pensions Act continues I would like to see those who served actively during the Tan period drawing their pensions, but I do not think it by any means fair or just that, as in the case mentioned by Deputy Ward, service for a month or two at a General Election should be considered military service, pre and after Truce.  But in the cases mentioned by Deputy Ward there is no other <Col N="2157" /> reason why those people should have got a pension except that they served actively from June, 1927 to October, 1927.  You will notice that the pensions mentioned by Deputy Ward were awarded immediately before June, 1927, or in September, 1927, immediately after the election. I think if these cases are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them, that the seat of the Minister for Finance in this House is pretty well paid for by the taxpayers in the country.</P>
    <P>Are the Deputies opposite going to walk blindly into the lobby here and vote for the cloaking of any inquiry into anything of that description? Are they going to do it and go back and face their constituents and say: &ldquo;We voted to prevent any inquiry into this?  We know the fellows did not earn it, but all the same, the poor devils want it.&rdquo;  I think it is time that Deputies opposite asserted some independence, that they should say to themselves that they will not get any wallop on the head for what they do, but say: &ldquo;We will show that the Minister for Defence is not going to lead us by the nose to vote for pensions for election service,&rdquo; for that is what those pensions amount to.  I do not think there is very much use in speaking here after the scene here last week, when I saw the Minister for Local Government leading his whole party into the lobby to vote against his own amendment.</P>
    <P>I think as soon as the people in this country will realise what has happened here you will have a body something stronger than the unemployed coming up here to clear them out.  The Minister for Defence is smiling.  No doubt he is sure that he can work the mallet on any member who dares to vote against the Bill, but I say this much to the Minister for Defence, that if he and his friends, after they introduced that Bill, were the Government of any other country in Europe, the lampposts of their city would be adorned at night.  A body comes in here and endeavours by an Act of this Dáil to cloak up the giving of military service pensions for election work.  I do not think they would have the <Col N="2158" /> neck in any other country in Europe but this to do it, and I do not believe that the citizens even of this piece of Ireland are so smashed down that they are going even now to put up with it.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I have somewhat recovered from the rhetorical anæsthetic that Deputy Esmonde administered to the Dáil some few minutes ago.  Having more or less recovered from it, I made some incursions into the volumes in the library to find out what Deputy Esmonde had to say on other occasions.  We have got to remember that pensions are awarded for service in the Republican Army and in the National Army.  I can quite understand why Deputy Esmonde is anxious to keep from the Comptroller and Auditor-General the files on which the assessments of pensions were made because his estimate of the National Army on one occasion was very interesting.  It was on one such occasion as that that he suggested that in any normal country I would myself be executed for certain statements I made regarding the National Army.  However, what the Deputy himself said in connection with the National Army is more interesting.  In Volume 8, column 1299, he is reported as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are supposed to have an Army, but what exactly is that Army for?  What could that Army do?  We have a Ministry of Defence. Is that Ministry capable of defending the country?  I doubt it very much....  The President is Commander-in-Chief and Minister for Defence, but I doubt if the President could defend Dalkey Island against an invasion. How many guns has he got? ... I do not know how many machine guns the President has.  He may say that for the purpose of the defence of the country he is covered by Article 6 of the Treaty, under which the English Government, for the next two and a half years, will take charge of the defences of the coast, but what guarantee have we that if any danger <Col N="2159" /> arises the British Government will not invite the Lord Chief Justice of New Zealand to discuss their responsibilities under this Article? I doubt if the President, even inside Ireland, could defend the capital.  I doubt if he has enough machine guns to hold the line of the Boyne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde knew the National Army could not defend the line of the Boyne, and could not defend Dalkey Island, and could not defend the city.  Is there any misunderstanding then as to why he should be careful that the files as to rank and service should be withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor-General? Is not he perfectly consistent in his attitude in withholding these files?  He has not changed.  He knows perfectly well what was the extent of service the National Army could give.  He has said it.  It is in black and white in this volume. Therefore he is acting quite consistently in endeavouring to keep the files from the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy MacEntee yesterday evening with some interest. He said that the action of the Executive Council, and of the Minister for Defence in particular, was a slur on, or was not giving due consideration to the Committee of Public Accounts or to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. But it is more than that. It is a slur on the Dáil, who, in the last analysis, should control every item of expenditure and who cannot control every item of expenditure except by their officer, the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Defence and the Executive Council say they cannot give to the Comptroller and Auditor-General the files on which these assessments were made, then they are saying to the Dáil in effect: &ldquo;We ignore your jurisdiction, we ignore your control over the finances of the State.  We will make disbursements and payments for which we will not give you any account.&rdquo; In the interests of the men themselves who are getting pensions the <Col N="2160" /> Executive Council ought not reduce this vote to the level of a secret service vote.  It ought to give these files to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and take these men out of the position of those people who are getting payment for secret service. In certain respects, I am inclined to agree with the Minister for Agriculture. He would preserve the Comptroller and Auditor-General from contamination by coming in contact with these files.  The Minister himself, of course, is one of those rare products of Irish life, an innocent politician.  He would save the Comptroller and Auditor-General his innocence and simplicity like himself. He does not want him to see the files on which the pensions are based.  He could see the files of pensioners, but he does not want him to see the files on which the assessments are based.  He says that rank and length of service are the only things which influence the decisions of the Board of Assessors.  I think anybody who kept his ears open for the last few years must have heard it said that rank and length of service were made to suit the pensions granted and not the pensions made to suit rank and length of service. If the Minister cares a great deal about the men who are getting pensions he will give these files to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and have the public mind disabused on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us that the great value in evidence was the opportunity that one got for cross-examination, an opportunity in coming to a decision as to the veracity of the evidence given and the general character of the person giving evidence.  That, no doubt, is quite true.  The evidence of a person under cross-examination and his general attitude towards the questions are very valuable to anybody in coming to a decision.  Does the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Agriculture say that the entire Board of Assessors were present when all evidence was given, and if those members of the Board who were absent could come to a conclusion <Col N="2161" /> on the longhand transcript of the evidence what was to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor-General from arriving at a conclusion as to the evidence that was tendered and submitted in longhand?  It is another example of the innocence of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture also told us that the Minister for Finance could refer back a case if new evidence could be adduced.  How could the Minister for Finance say it was new evidence unless he knew what the old evidence was?  If he did not know what the first evidence, which we will call the old evidence, was, how could he say that statements which came in were new evidence? Is the Minister for Finance to be in a position to examine the files while the officer who is responsible to this Dáil for all disbursements is to be prevented from knowing what is in these files?</P>
    <P>I simply rose to stress the position that it is not the Comptroller and Auditor-General's office, and it is not the Committee of Public Accounts that is being ignored; it is the Dáil, the elected representatives of the people, who in the last analysis should have control over every payment made in this State, and should have control through its principal officer, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that is being slighted by the Executive Council and the Minister for Defence.  In effect, the Executive Council and the Minister for Defence are saying to this Dáil: &ldquo;We will not allow you to have access to these files; we ignore your authority; we will do what we like.  We will vote the money and we will give whatever pensions we like.  We will give you no evidence as to how we make these assessments or as to how we arrive at the rank and years of service of those people to whom we pay the pensions.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being conversant with this question of pensions, and not being one who took any active part in either war, pre-truce or civil war, I must admit that my knowledge is not very great as regards <Col N="2162" /> the manner in which pensions have been granted.  But as one representing a very considerable body of taxpayers in the constituency which I have the honour to represent, I think it is my duty to see that whenever pensions are granted there will be sufficient reason for granting these pensions, and also to see that the official who, by virtue of the position he holds, is the only one to whom the taxpayers in general can look for protection, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, will be in a position to inquire into the granting of these pensions to find out the different reasons and to find out the services rendered by those who are in receipt of pensions at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude taken up by the Government on this Bill seems extraordinary, because it is obvious to anyone who takes the trouble to give any consideration to this matter that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has very often been the means of more or less placing the Government in a position to be able to repel accusations of extravagance that have been levelled against them in the past.  The very fact of having the Comptroller and Auditor-General is a safeguard for the Government themselves or for any Government that may be in power, because they can state to their critics that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to be satisfied as to the expenditure of any public moneys, that these moneys are being expended in the manner and way for which they were intended.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, by virtue of his position, must be convinced that all moneys, even to the last farthing, has been spent as was intended by the Act.  To curtail the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General would, I think, be very bad policy, especially in regard to the matter of pensions, because there does exist at the moment not alone amongst the supporters of the chief Opposition Party in the House but even amongst the strongest supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, without taking into consideration at all that very big proportion of electors <Col N="2163" /> who are attached to no Party, a very strong suspicion that pensions have been granted to people who are not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>In view of the present economic position of this country, it is almost criminal to think that men should be drawing pensions, some to an amount of £150 a year, or £3 a week, for services that they have not given. I could speak very strongly on this question of pensions if I wanted, because I hold that in an infant State like this no pensions should be paid at all.  The necessity for paying pensions should never have arisen in this country, but that is beside the question.  I would be like a voice crying in the wilderness in going any further into that matter, but the next best thing I can do is at least to ensure that before the pensions are granted all the evidence in connection with these pensions and the services rendered by the people in receipt of these pensions should be placed before the Comptroller and Auditor-General. That would apply to all those pensions that have been granted.  That is the only safeguard that we have at the moment in regard to the expenditure of public moneys, and it is a safeguard that, in my opinion, the Dáil will be very wise to hold and to preserve.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable thing that side by side with the granting of pensions we had introduced into the Dáil very recently a Bill having for its object the giving of relief to able-bodied men in the city of Dublin.  It is rather significant that the columns of the city Press, editorials have appeared protesting against the introduction of this Relief Bill and against the burden that it will place upon the ratepayers of the city.  But we have no leading articles in the same quarters on the question of pensions.  We have had meetings of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce protesting against the burden that would be placed on the shoulders of the ratepayers as a result of this Dublin Relief Bill, a Bill that has for its object the keeping of body and soul together in the case of thousands <Col N="2164" /> of decent men who are entitled to that relief.  Yet I have no recollection of hearing or seeing any statement or protest from members of the Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>We have had speeches here in the Dáil of members of the Government Party protesting against this Poor Relief Bill.  Yet I have been patiently waiting to hear these same Deputies raise their voices against the wilful waste that has undoubtedly existed in this country in regard to the granting of military service pensions.  A huge sum has been granted for these pensions.  I know of two men who, to my own knowledge, have not rendered any service whatsoever to the country, who have got pensions, and side by side with that we have thousands of men, including some of my own friends, who would scorn the idea of a pension, because they maintain that when they went out to fight they fought for the honour and freedom of the country.  I hold, in view of the position of this country in the present time, and taking into consideration the condition of the farming community, and especially the condition of thousands of farmers in the Cooley area, in the county of Louth, who at the moment are faced with bankruptcy owing to the fact that there is practically no market for the disposal of their agricultural produce, that these pensions are an intolerable burden.  The position is one that makes people furiously to think.</P>
    <P>When I think of these things and see the ease with which it is proposed to vote large sums of money by way of pensions really the matter becomes too serious.  When one considers the fact that there is well nigh a quarter of a million pounds being paid out in pensions, when one considers the fact that this huge sum is being paid out and that this year there cannot be voted in the Dáil fifty thousand farthings for the relief of unemployment, I think a position has been reached which should be changed and changed immediately. I think this House should set itself against the policy of curtailing the powers of the Comptroller and <Col N="2165" /> Auditor-General in any way whatsoever. By virtue of his position he is looked upon as the watch-dog of public expenditure in the interests of the nation.  For that reason alone this House should be slow to curtail his powers.  I for one will never support a Bill having for its object the curtailing of the powers at present enjoyed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I hold the Government would be wise to allow the light of day, as far as the granting of pensions is concerned, to be thrown on all the evidence and all the facts connected with those pensions.  If the pensions are genuine, why the necessity for any concealment of the facts in connection with them?  If the Government or the Board of Assessors can stand over the pensions they have granted, what is the necessity for preserving this secrecy?  What is the necessity for not allowing the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have free access to all the files and all the papers and to a full and complete transcript of the evidence which is in the possession of the Board of Assessors?  I cannot see for the life of me why the Government should seek to adopt this attitude in connection with military service pensions.  For the reasons I have stated, I think it is time for Deputies of all Parties to face facts. At the moment we are a poor, struggling nation and, while I am prepared to admit that any young man who rendered service to this country and who, as a result of that service, finds himself incapable of earning a livelihood, would be entitled to a pension, still I think the time has arrived when, if we are to solve many of the problems that exist at the moment, it will be absolutely essential that this question of pensions should command serious attention from all Deputies here.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the time has passed for throwing dust in the eyes of the people.  The time has passed when it can be said that nobody pays any attention to what is said on the Opposition Benches. The people of this country are thinking, and there does exist a very considerable <Col N="2166" /> body of opinion that is going to make itself felt in the very near future.  I say it is about time for the members of this House to realise the position in the country, to realise that we are going headlong to bankruptcy, that it is our duty to conserve our wealth and to be careful, above all, in matters affecting public expenditure.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which Deputies should exercise the greatest care and caution arises on this question of pensions.  The country is too small; it cannot afford these payments, and I hope and trust that as a result of this debate the Government will consider this question of pensions in all its aspects, bearing in mind the capacity of the people to pay, and bearing in mind that there do exist in this small State at least 40,000 to 50,000 men who cannot find the wherewithal to keep body and soul together.  We must legislate here for the whole people of the State and not for a section.  For these reasons I hold that the Dáil should reject this Bill.  It should reject it because the Bill sets out to restrict the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the only official to whom the taxpayers in general can look as the one who will watch carefully their interests.</P>

      <P>I think we should try to view this thing with something like common sense.  We will first take a little matter of history.  In 1924 an Act was passed providing for military service pensions.  That Act, unlike a good many Acts, provided for a Board of Assessors.  It provided that the Board should include a judge or a barrister of ten years' standing.  It provided that the Board should report to the Minister their findings as to the military service of any applicant for a certificate. It provided that every report shall contain findings upon the military service of the applicant in Oglaigh na hEireann, in the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, or in the Hibernian Rifles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned that the Act provided for a judge or a barrister for the Board of Assessors.  The Board, the Act provided, would report on the military service of applicants in the pre-Truce days &mdash; military service in the National Forces or the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann &mdash; and, in addition, the Board would report on the period of services of such applicant in each such force or body as I have indicated.  It would include pre-Truce service and also National Army service.  These reports were to be forwarded by the Board, and eventually they would come before the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Act also provides that such report shall be in the prescribed form.  The form prescribed is laid down in regulations which were laid on the Table of this House, and were available to members of the House.  These regulations were not questioned or challenged by members of the House.  It provides that the findings of the Board shall be final upon the applicant, but that the Board may re-open the findings at <Col N="2168" /> the request of the Minister on the grounds that new evidence is available. It does not provide that the Minister may re-open it.  The Minister can only request the Board to re-open it, and it is only the Board that can re-open.  Moreover, the Board and the Board only may alter or discharge the findings therein as may seem to them just in view of further evidence.  The Act provides that the pension assessment is decided by the Board and by the Board only.  The Minister cannot re-open the question.  He cannot alter the periods or the service laid down by the Board.  The Act provides that the Board is the sole arbiter on the matter.  The Act provides:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of calculating the amount of military service pension which any holder of a certificate of military service under this Act shall receive the military service of such person as found by the Board of Assessors and set out in his certificate of military service shall be reckoned as the equivalent of the respective periods of years of military service respectively specified in the second column of the First Schedule to this Act, and the total number of years of military service in respect of which any such pension shall be granted shall be calculated in the maner set forth in the said First Schedule and the Second Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly from the Act itself the Board decides whether a man had service both pre-Truce and post-Truce, the rank that he held and the period during which he had given that service.  It is perfectly clear from the Act that the decision of the Board cannot be varied by any person whatsoever.  It cannot be questioned by the Minister, though the Minister may, but only on receipt of what purports to be additional evidence &mdash; that is, evidence which was not before the Board before &mdash; submit that evidence to the Board and request them to consider their decision.  The Board may or may not, as it chooses, re-open or reconsider, <Col N="2169" /> and if necessary alter or discharge its findings.  As the Act lays that down it is perfectly clear that the service, rank and membership are defined by the Board and are not variable by anybody.  It was in order to safeguard the situation, that it was decided that the Board should not include an accountant, but that it should include a judge or a barrister of ten years' standing, because it is well known than an unqualified person is likely to misunderstand the value of evidence.</P>

The Deputy asks, does it provide that certain things shall not be available? Does it expressly provide that?  It does not say that, but it is implicit in every article that I have read out.  The suggestion of Deputies opposite in this discussion has been that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should read over whatever notes the Board made themselves on their authority and decided to keep.  They might have decided, if they so wished, to keep no notes whatever of the evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the history of this.  I think I have read out the more relevant sections of the Bill which indicate clearly to any person who wishes to see it, and has the intelligence to see it, that the decision with regard to the periods of service, rank and actual membership of the bodies mentioned is clearly defined by the Bill to be such as is set down by the Board in their report.  The Act does not empower any other person, whether it be the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Minister or anybody else to vary the report of the Board.  As I read the Act, the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot decide on the evidence, no matter what the evidence may be, that the period of service, rank or membership is other than it has been decided by the Board.  All that he could do at best would be to call the attention of the Board to certain facts and ask them to reconsider them. But the members of the Board are the final deciders on that and not the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to audit. When a question of law arises, the functionary to decide that, and the ultimate authority on the matter as far as we are concerned, unless the <Col N="2171" /> case goes before the courts, is the Attorney-General.  This matter went before the Comptroller and Auditor-General. He was put in his position pre-eminently because of his capacity to audit.  The Attorney-General advises on questions of law.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General requested that these files should come before him to enable him to consider the evidence, the Act having already provided that a man qualified to judge evidence as the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not qualified, should be on the Board, and that the matters coming before the Board should ultimately be decided by that Board and by nobody else.  Deputy Derrig took up a lot of the time of the House in speaking on this Bill.  He tried to be superior to the Minister for Agriculture, and said that the Minister had not even read the report of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that while, as I have said, the Deputy took up a lot of the time of the House that he had not read the report of the Public Accounts Committee himself.  Time and again he came back on the point that the fact that the Attorney-General had given an opinion on this matter was not made available to the members of this House or to the members of the Board. Even after the President had given him the column, the date and everything else in connection with that, the Deputy still continued to come back on that point simply wasting the time of the House because he himself had not taken the trouble to read the report.  The Attorney-General having been asked whether these things should or should not be put before the Comptroller and Auditor-General gave his answer in the negative.  That information was made available to the Public Accounts Committee, and through them to this House and to the public generally.  On the question of law, the Attorney-General decided that there was no need for these things to go before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Public Accounts Committee considered the <Col N="2172" /> matter three times.  I do not propose to dig up the exact words they used, but roughly and without misrepresenting them, they decided on the first occasion that the action taken in not making these things available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General was quite justified. I think that was their decision. Very well, the thing went on.</P>
    <P>On the next occasion, while not reversing the decision, they modified it to this extent, that they requested that the situation be regularised.  One could say that it was regularised in that the authority to state the law on the matter had made his statement, that authority being the Attorney-General who was qualified to state the law, and not the Comptroller and Auditor-General who was not qualified to state it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for the Bill is, as Deputy Esmonde has said, largely a matter of courtesy. When there is the slightest doubt, or any possible doubt, it should be rectified.  There are other matters in the Bill which are introduced because some people may hold that there is a certain doubt.  The Committee of Public Accounts, first of all, approved of the withholding of these things from the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and secondly &mdash; not as Deputy Davin stated wrongly when he said the Committee had reversed their opinion; they did not &mdash; they merely asked to have the matter regularised.  Thirdly, as far as I understand their words, having been told it is going to be regularised, as it is now being done, they expressed their appreciation of that.  He said that &ldquo;in deference to the opinion of the Committee, proposals for further legislation will be laid before the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  To quote from the report: &ldquo;He states that, in deference to the opinion of the Committee, proposals for legislation will be laid before the Oireachtas, and he states that the object of these proposals will be to establish that the data on which the Board of Assessors based its findings shall not be, and shall be deemed never to have been, subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Committee is satisfied with this determination to seek a decision of the Oireachtas on this matter.&rdquo;  When told this was being done the Committee expressed their approval of the fact.  Every Deputy on the other side gives elaborate explanations of the craft and villainy we are attempting to conceal by this, when it is merely introduced to remove certain doubts.  That, roughly, is the history of the Bill. An officer qualified to advise has given his advice, which should set people's minds at rest.</P>

There can be no question or doubt that they exceeded their duty and power in making their court secret, and further, there can be no question or doubt that they were actuated by political motives, because they belonged to one party which had just been at strife with the other party, and it is only human nature that they should have a certain attitude towards the people on the other side, and that they should determine that these people or anybody associated with them could never get a pension. or should never in fact be called up. on in this matter, particularly if it were a case of giving evidence to prove that some staunch and tried supporter of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in Co. Meath had a rather weak military record.&rdquo; The Deputy made the statement that nobody connected with those on his side, the side of anarchy, was called upon to give evidence and a few minutes after Deputy Fahy said that he gave evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This business is challenged on two grounds, one, on precedent and the rights of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the other on the grounds of the prevention of public dishonesty. Now, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has such powers as this Dáil gives him.  It is perfectly clear to me that if this Dáil decides at any time to limit in any specific way the powers or the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General it is not creating a precedent except in so far as that specific case is concerned. We are not breaking a precedent, and we are not in any way injuring him in the carrying out of his function, because his function is to carry out the duties that are given him by this Dáil.  Here is a case where I think most intelligent people will agree that his function is not to supervise the evidence as given before the Board of Assessors. Obviously he is not qualified to do that.  Obviously the body that by its very constitution had to contain a judge or a barrister of ten years' standing, was better able to judge, and when the ultimate decision in the matter must be theirs and not his, I suggest that it is futile that he should do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if Deputies will take the trouble to read the Act they will find that the report of the Board is what decides certain things, and these are the very things that they want to throw in doubt. They say they can be varied by his seeing them.  They can only be varied by the action of the Board itself.  That is perfectly clear.  On the question of public policy, the proper authority is the Executive Council; on the question of law the proper authority is the Attorney-General &mdash; at any rate not the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, obviously not. Here is a perfectly simple case.  An Act was passed.  Whether the thing is explicitly made doubly clear now or not, it is perfectly clear that the intention there was, first of all, that the Board of Assessors should have a quasi-judicial function by the fact that it was insisted that it should have on it a judge or a barrister of ten years' standing. Deputies on the other side have constantly charged that the Board of Assessors consists exclusively of party hacks and so on.  The Chairman of the Board was a judge.  The Act did not in any way specify that the Board should keep any notes of the evidence.  Whether they did or not, whether, if they did keep notes they kept complete notes, is a matter I am not qualified to state, because I have never seen any of the files. For their own convenience, presumably, they may have kept notes of the evidence, but that would have been a matter for their own convenience. The Act speaks about their report and so on, but it says nothing about keeping evidence.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General comes along and says he must see the evidence to see if what is stated in the report put before him is correct.  I submit in common sense that that is really absurd.  As to the function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, analogies were made.  His function is to audit the accounts of Ministers, and incidentally of their accounting officers. But the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in auditing the accounts of my Department, has made available to him everything that is available to me or to my accounting officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two arguments were made, one <Col N="2180" /> that there was no harm in having everything made public and, the second that if the Comptroller and Auditor-General did this it would not make for publicity.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in auditing the accounts of my Department, is going to make any report I must see to it that anything he can report on I and the officials of my Department must have available to us.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General is going to see evidence which may cause him to reverse a decision, according to the arguments of the Deputies opposite, obviously if he is going to do that the evidence on which he does it must be available to me and to my officials as well as to him, because he is auditing the accounts of my Department and my accounting officer cannot defend them when the Comptroller and Auditor-General has information and files available to him which are not available to my accounting officer.</P>
    <P>This discussion has not been to get the truth; it has been purely casuistic.  It has been argued that it was necessary that he should get this information because it would prevent money going to people who should not get pensions.  On the other hand, casuistically, not with a desire for truth, it was argued that it would be no harm for him to see the documents because he would only report cases that are irregular, and therefore, as the Government is satisfied that everything is regular, he would not have to report anything. That is not aiming at the truth; it is a perfectly dishonest reason. Let us settle the facts.  Yesterday Deputy MacEntee read certain extracts from the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, carefully cutting things short so that the Dáil would not know the true facts. When you try a ruse like that you are most likely to take in the most stupid people and not the most intelligent. It is perfectly evident that through his trying to work that on the Dáil he has taken in one unfortunate Deputy, a Deputy who took Deputy MacEntee at his face value, and landed himself into <Col N="2181" /> being put out of the Dáil.  Deputy MacEntee referred to a number of cases.  Remember that he had urged that the Comptroller and Auditor-General when he would do these things would only report things which were irregular, and that his report would not make for publicity or injure any person. The Deputy stated the case of a person wounded in 1916.  He undoubtedly endeavoured to convey to this House that this was reported because it was irregular.  He said that the pension, if he was a private, would be £50, if he was a captain £75, if he was a major £100, and if he was a major-general £125, and he definitely tried to convey to this House that this money had been saved through the action of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

In connection with case (1) he proceeded to read from page 218 of the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts for the financial year 1924-25 and he quoted statements made by Mr. McGrath to the effect that this person was not a volunteer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the second column on the same page, from which I quote the facts, are: &ldquo;that on the second or third day of the Easter Rising this man offered his services to the Irish Volunteers in Boland's Mills, but he was not accepted owing to his not being attached to the I.R.A.  He was, however, asked to do some independent intelligence work for them, such as watching the movements of British troops and reporting them.  While on this work he was wounded in Great Clarence Street by, it is alleged, a British sniper.  On that basis the certificate was given that the man was in fact a member of the Irish Volunteers.  There was no formal attestation, etc.&rdquo;  The Chairman, in passing from this case, remarked that &ldquo;the Adjutant-General certified that this man was a member of the Irish Volunteers, and that he was wounded performing his duty as such member.  I think whatever we may say about the particular case, that we are not here to judge between one officer or another as to whether the man was a member.  We must take the report in the matter to the Minister, and on that the Accounting Officer for this Vote would be justified in accepting the liability.&rdquo;  Anybody who knows anything about the Volunteers &mdash; even the little that Deputy <Col N="2183" /> MacEntee knows about them &mdash; should appreciate that this statement of facts justifies the giving of a certificate that this man was wounded as a member of the Volunteers in the course of his duty.</P>
      <P>Case No. 2.  He went on to quote page 216 &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor - General's note &mdash; which says:</P>
      <P>I observe that some ex-members of the forces in receipt of wound pensions were accepted for service in the Gárda Síochána and continued to draw their wound pensions without any modification of either pay or pension.</P>
      <P>But he carefully refrained from reading on the evidence in the same column, which proves conclusively that the Statutes of this House were fully respected in respect of the particular case he mentioned, and that no action followed the calling attention to the matter by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  This House did not provide that in the case of persons entering Government service any portion of their disability pensions should be recovered, or that pensions should in any way be reduced.  He quoted again that a member of the Volunteers was injured at his private occupation, and that but for the Comptroller and Auditor-General the State would be paying pensions to persons shot or injured while following their ordinary occupations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He again carefully refrained from reading on the same column in page 215, in which the circumstances are clearly set out to show that the particular case referred to was that of a Volunteer who was shot by the Black-and-Tans in his shop.  The facts of the case, as stated in the minutes of evidence, show that he was shot because he was known to be a captain in the Volunteers.  It would be interesting to read the Chairman's remark in passing this item.  After quoting Section 31 of the Act, he says, &ldquo;and received such wounds while performing <Col N="2184" /> such duty as a member.  That is the condition.  The authority set up &mdash; in this case the Minister &mdash; after enquiry has certified that the claimants were wounded in course of duty.  I think it is recognised that the course of duty in these days did not preclude a man following his employment, or appearing to follow his employment.  In the circumstances I think it is our obvious duty to pass it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will you admit with regard to the first case I stated that that was the only case in which I said that as a result of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General money was saved to the State?  That is the case of those who were paid pensions under the wrong head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The steps for recovering the money were taken before the Comptroller and Auditor-General drew attention to it, the accounting officer or anybody else notwithstanding to the contrary.  On the question of public policy, the proper authority is the Executive Council, and are we forming an opinion on public policy which is not really shared by other people? Deputy MacEntee quoted from 1863 and 1874 in England.  Now, in this country there were special circumstances, and everybody in this House knows it.  Prior to the Treaty and prior to the Truce there were conditions of war here which were unlike war conditions in any normal country.  There were conditions in which people were resisting an alien Government, and they had to do it in the most subterraneous method possible. That was necessary.  Undoubtedly <Col N="2185" /> it meant in effect that practically the whole work of the war took on itself the ordinary attributes of secret service.  Deputy Davin maintains that there will be no harm in these things becoming public.</P>

He knows perfectly well that as the Comptroller and Auditor General will be auditing the affairs of my Department it must also go before the officials of my Department. He knows perfectly well that the Comptroller and Auditor-General must report anything he considers to be irregular.  He knows perfectly well that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has reported things that he considered to be irregular, but that were not irregular.  I will tell him this, that to my knowledge the reports of the Public Accounts Committee have already injured a man in his business in a most unfair manner.  I will tell him this also, that I have read the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General; I have read in them about Colonel A. and Major B. and the indications given were given sufficiently clearly for me to know who was who.</P>

It means that the proposal which is put by the Opposition is this, that steps should be taken which would almost inevitably mean that the contents of these files should be public, and Deputy Davin stands for that.</P>

      <P>No, what I stated was this: I will deal with my conclusion before my premises, and the <Col N="2187" /> conclusion was possibly more than I should have given.  The Deputy challenges that.  Then I demonstrated that in a particular circumstance, provided a certain course is followed, it will almost inevitably follow that the evidence in the files will become public.</P>
      <P>I illustrated that by giving cases and showing that it was almost inevitable, and I said that Deputy Davin, by proposing that the action which he has urged, and which has been urged by the Opposition in this House, should be taken, is proposing that some of the evidence will almost inevitably become public property. I propose to go on to show that it will be an injury to the individual.</P>

That is precisely what he is saying, but I do not think that there is anything personal in the matter.  I do not know how the Minister can be asked to withdraw a statement of that kind.  It does not cast any reflection on the Deputy.  It is giving the Minister's view of the result of what the Deputy is advocating. That happens constantly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy has misunderstood my line. I have stated, first of all, and I think it is agreed, that Deputy Davin has urged in this debate that these files be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I pointed out that in his examination of the files it will be part of the audit of my Department, and therefore I must see to it that, if he is going to have access to these files, my office which he will be criticising must also have access to the files, so that it may have an opportunity of rectifying anything that may be wrong before he calls public attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that the speech which I made was made on my own personal responsibility, and that I never spoke as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about that.  I am just trying to point out a lot of things that the Deputy overlooked when he advocated a certain course, and I hope that, having seen that he has overlooked so many things, he will change his opinion when he comes to consider them.  First of all, if the Comptroller and Auditor-General has access to the files I must insist that we must have access to them.  We have not had access to them so far.  Secondly, I said of my own knowledge, as a result of the publication of things of this nature, that at least one individual has been injured in his business.  Thirdly, I pointed out that the Comptroller and Auditor-General refers things to the Public Accounts Committee which he deems to be irregular, but which are not irregular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Which the Committee may not, in fact, deem to be irregular.  Therefore, I am building up the case.  I have said also that I have read the reports of the Public Accounts Committee, and I am not quite sure whether it was their <Col N="2189" /> report or the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can interrupt me to point out any flaw in my argument.  First of all, I say that the Deputy has urged that these files should be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I say that they should not, because I have known a man to be injured in his business by reports of that kind. I say that the report&mdash;I do not know whether it was portion of the evidence given by the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the report of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;was made in such a way that I was able, by the data it gave, to recognise individuals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not at that time Minister for Defence.  It was merely through my association with the movement all through and with similar knowledge as is possessed by many people in this State. Therefore I say that it is almost inevitable that if the course proposed by the opponents of the Bill is pursued, the contents of, at least, some of these files will be public knowledge.  At least they will be <Col N="2190" /> so widely diffused that that is practically inevitable and I cannot guarantee that a man's livelihood will not be interfered with.  If this information is widespread through my office, through the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and possibly referred to in veiled language at the Public Accounts Committee, referred to in their report in veiled language, published in the Press in veiled language, it seems to me practically inevitable that the public will get to know about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The rank and period of service by law is such as is defined in the report.  Legally, it exists only in so far as it is reported by the Board and decided by them.  That is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. What he wants is the whole evidence adduced and any proof on which the report by the Board is made.  I suppose we need not bother looking up the exact evidence, but I think it will be agreed, or, at least assumed, that the person to whom detriment would be done would be a beneficiary who received a pension.  I do not want to go on digging through all the speeches but I do not think that it will be denied that in meeting this point it was assumed by opponents of the Bill that the person who might be injured by the evidence was the person who drew the pension. I have not seen any of the files.  Nevertheless, in one way or another, I have a fair idea of the evidence given in a number of cases and I know this, and I mentioned it to Deputy Davin, that there are <Col N="2191" /> men employed in the special employment in which Deputy Davin takes special interest, men employed outside the jurisdiction of the State, who are not necessarily themselves drawers of pensions but who are involved in evidence which was made available to the Board.  I suppose that I myself was eligible for a pension but I have not got a pension.</P>
      <P>I did not apply for a pension, so I think Deputies may grant me sufficient selfishness to assume that I would not be struggling here grafting for others when I did not graft for myself.  I happen to know that there are men employed in employment in which Deputy Davin is particularly interested, who were involved in this evidence, and who are outside the jurisdiction of this State.  Here is an Act laying it down perfectly clearly that the decision as to rank and so on rests with the Board.  Here is a question as to whether the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as well as seeing everything in the report, should also see the evidence upon which the legal men decide.  The Attorney-General, our appropriate officer, advises that he should not see it. Here is the fact that we know that the publication of the evidence is undesirable in the general public interest, first of all.  I have heard&mdash;I do not know whether it is true or not&mdash; that there is one man working alongside another man who, if the evidence came out, would be shocked because of the actions of the relatives of the other man against him. I know that there are men outside the jurisdiction of the State, not themselves beneficiaries under the Act, but whose names were invoked in the evidence, and actions they did on previous occasions were cited in proof of certain facts.</P>

The assistance they gave and its implications were quoted by totally different men in giving evidence and he surely recognises that, independent of the friendship of governments and of the fact that this country is at perfect peace with England, though Deputy Derrig is longing to throw himself against the might of the Empire&mdash;we cannot help that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  That is casuistic argument. The Deputy said that this should be done because of the money it would save for the State and, secondly, that nothing but irregular matters would be reported.  I say that, if anybody got a pension which he should not get, the record of the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be such that, if he did not believe that the Board was justified in believing these people, he would report the case.  I have taken some cases amongst those which Deputy MacEntee quoted to prove that.  I am dealing now with the question of public policy.  It is not in the interests of the State to have all the details that are set out in evidence published.  It is our duty to safeguard the State from that.  This Bill purports&mdash;I will not say to safeguard it because I think it is already safeguarded as the Comptroller and Auditor-General has not the right to see these things&mdash;to make doubly certain that no such wrong shall be done to the State or to any people who have assisted the State in its struggle for freedom.</P>

I am not going to state that anybody gets a pension who is not entitled to it, but I would go so far as to say that if anybody is getting a pension which he should not get, he is getting it by virtue of perjury.</P>

      <P>Let us come to that.  Deputies ought to admit that there are, as I am quite prepared to admit there are&mdash;it is a thing that worries me just as much as it does the Opposition&mdash;people who did not give the service they are supposed to have given.  I am not saying that they should not get pensions, but I am quite satisfied that anybody who <Col N="2195" /> is getting a pension which he should not get, is getting it by virtue of giving wrong evidence.  I am satisfied, once that wrong evidence is given, that when the Comptroller and Auditor-General goes through the files of evidence he has to take at its face value what these people said. He is not going to say that three people said that the man was there on the occasion, and that three other people did not know whether he was there or not.  He has got to take it at its face value.  Any wrong done in the way of pensions being given, is the result of perjury.  Nobody knows better than the Deputies facing me that there is not that feeling towards perjury that there should be amongst a large section of the people in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the point&mdash;that in the case of men drawing pensions who should not be drawing them, it is the result of perjury and that, in so far as rectifying that is concerned, the examination of the files by the Comptroller and Auditor-General is no remedy whatsoever, because the evidence that would be given to him would be the perjured evidence, and he would have to accept that on its face value, so that the whole argument that his examination was going to save the State so much, and was going to get after the people drawing the pensions wrongfully, goes by the board. Deputy Coburn said he knew of cases of men who were getting pensions who should not.  I have never heard of them from him.  Deputy Ward quoted a number of cases.  I remember one case quite well.  Deputy Ward asked about a pension drawn by some man.  He gave me an account of it, stating the periods for which the man was drawing the pension.  He then said that during one of these periods this man had been court-martialed and expelled from the Volunteers.  Naturally, I immediately got after the case, and as a result, I got confirmation of what Deputy Ward stated, and the man's pension was reduced by the period for which he was out of the Volunteers.  Deputy Ward has now questioned whether this man had ever been in the National Army. The evidence I have is that he was in the National Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether he is referring to No. 21 or another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 21 is the case. The Deputy will know the case by the fact that he stated the man had <Col N="2200" /> been court-martialed and dismissed from the Volunteers.  He quoted other cases.  I got up while he was speaking and asked him in reference to one of the cases if he had stated the facts that he considered would negate the right to a pension, as he had done in that other case.  He said that I was trying to draw a red herring, or something like that, but I really wanted to know.  If the Deputy had given me any information throwing doubt on the man's right to a pension during any portion of the time, or during the whole time, I would have immediately made inquiries in my Department.  I remember one case.  I do not remember any other case.  I have the file here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be just in the same position as I am. Another Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party one time asked me about a man drawing a pension.  I gave him the pension he was getting and the period it was for.  He assured me, <Col N="2201" /> I think across the floor of the House, that he was in a position to prove that the man should not be getting a pension.  My immediate response to that was to ask him would he get evidence to that effect?  He brought me evidence, or what purported to be evidence.  I have never seen the file under which that man got the pension.</P>
      <P>A number of signed letters were brought to me by the Deputy.  I went through them.  It was a coincidence that all these letters were written by members of the anti-State forces.  I did not discount them for that reason, but that was notable.  In these letters these men made statements, and incidentally referred to other men who were in a better position to give information about the man than they were.  I immediately got after these other men, and, as a result, that case was proved to my satisfaction, and I shall be prepared to show Deputy Lemass, or anybody else who is incredulous, exactly what happened. Any Deputy who goes through the case will say that such evidence as came in proved that the man was entitled to the pension he got, and that the Deputy, who stated across the House that he was in a position to prove that he should not get a pension, was wrong in his statement of the facts.  The Deputy did his duty as a citizen, of course.  When he thought that the man should not get a pension, he gave all the evidence at his disposal which he thought would prove that.  There have been two cases of men being prosecuted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of correlating two dates that way?  The date of the termination of the Pensions Board was, if I remember rightly, March, 1928.  Very often in this discussion Deputies spoke as if the Board were still functioning, and still sending in reports upon which pensions will be given.  I disbanded the Board nearly two years ago.  If <Col N="2202" /> I remember rightly, it was in February or March, 1928, and they have not been functioning since.  If somebody came along and gave me what looked, if you like, sound evidence that a man was drawing a pension that he should not be drawing, I would naturally call the Board together, and ask them to compare the evidence which I had now received with the evidence put before them to see if further action was necessary with a view to cancelling or reducing the pension, or even prosecuting. In two cases actually the Board prosecuted people for perjury.  I think I have proved here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes a statement which, of course, one can ignore.  What happened is this:&mdash; The Pensions Act was passed; a man wrote in for a form; he got that, filled it in and mentioned certain witnesses that he could call.  The evidence came in.  He was possibly called upon to send in further evidence on certain points.  He sent in all the evidence of his pre-Truce activities.  It was reported that he did not receive a pension because his service as required by the Act was not proved.</P>
      <P>But he might come along at a later stage&mdash;and it very often happened, to my knowledge&mdash;with additional evidence:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided however that the Board may at any time re-open any or all of their findings at the request of the Minister on the grounds that evidence not available prior to the making of their report had since become available.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It very frequently happened that what purported to be additional evidence came in.  When a man sends in something and says it is evidence <Col N="2203" /> additional to the evidence which has been before the Board when they refused a pension or only assessed a pension at so much I send that evidence to the members of the Board asking them if it is additional evidence, and if so, to re-open the case and consider it in the light of this additional evidence.  In cases the Deputies referred to, that were refused and were later granted, they were only granted as a result of the applicant producing evidence that he did not produce on the occasion of his previous application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, I did not make the statement.  To sum up, an Act was passed which clearly laid it down that the period of service and the membership should be such and such only as was defined by the Board of Assessors in their report and they are the only people who can alter or discharge that. The Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Minister, nobody has a right to say that the rank was this and not that, nobody has a right to say that it is this membership and not that membership, nobody has the right to say in this period, not <Col N="2204" /> in that period, other than the Board. They are the only people as laid down by the Act.  The Act clearly did not consider that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would review the decisions of the Board. It is perfectly clear in the Act, although the Act may not specifically have stated it, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General may not see the evidence.  It is perfectly clear that the Act never visualised the Comptroller and Auditor-General auditing, to quote Deputy Derrig, the evidence.  That is perfectly clear because the report of the Board, at whatever stage it is made, although they may vary it at anybody's request, is the final report. Nobody else can make a report, and, for the purposes of this Act, the rank, the period of service and the membership shall be such as defined by the Board only.  That made it clear that it was not proposed that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should review these cases.</P>
      <P>It was stated here in the debate that it may be that the undesirability of having these files made public was overlooked at the time. I do not think it was, because it seems to me inherent in the wording of the Act that something of that nature was adverted to.  The mere wording of the institution of this Board insists that it shall contain a judge or barrister of ten years standing and that their report on these matters should be final.  That seems to me to indicate somehow or other that this situation was adverted to.  Anybody in this Dáil knows perfectly well that these files contain statements of facts and incidents prior to the Truce that it is not in the public interest should be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision of this House that these files, as in the case of other Government documents, should go through the ordinary course of survey by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and that he, in his discretion, should report publicly to the Public Accounts Committee, meaning, as that does, that they should go through the ordinary machinery of <Col N="2205" /> my department and be available to the various officials of my Department would make the publicity of the details contained in these files practically inevitable.</P>
    <P>The proper deciding authority as to what is or what is not in the public interest is the Executive Council, and our decision that it is not in the public interest coincides, I believe entirely, with the real judgment of every member of this Dáil.  It may be casuistically urged not to treat these differently from all other public documents, that it does not imply that there will be any publicity.  I have demonstrated that the action previously&mdash;I am not complaining about it&mdash;of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and of the Public Accounts Committee has been such as to justify one in presuming that it will make for publicity.  We are the proper people to decide, but I suggest that nobody in this House thinks otherwise than that it would be against the public interest.  To my own personal knowledge there are individuals inculpated in that evidence before the Board&mdash;although I have never seen any of the files&mdash;who are outside the jurisdiction of this State, and who are in such a position that publication of the facts about them in those files would injure them in their livelihood and possibly even to a greater extent.  I have pointed out that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not by his training a man qualified to judge the value of evidence, that the law passed by this Dáil stipulated that the Board should contain at least one man by his training capable of evaluating evidence.  As far as I remember, it contained two men of legal experience and one man who during the period was getting legal experience. The Comptroller and Auditor-General has no legal experience. The Act obviously considered that this Board required certain qualifications for considering evidence, and we know that in the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General we did not go into the matter of his qualifications for valuing evidence.  I suggest that it <Col N="2206" /> is not in the public interest that these files should go before the Comptroller and Auditor-General, resulting, as it inevitably would, in publicity of their contents.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that there is no need for this thing to have arisen because the legal adviser to the Government has advised them that they need not be open.  The bringing in of this Bill does not mean, as so many people have suggested, that we in any way find fault with the action of the Public Accounts Committee.  As a matter of fact, the reports I have read I entirely approve of.  I do not know why people should not accept them in the spirit in which we are accepting them.  I have pointed out that all the arguments suggesting that the proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have access to these files would lead to the unmasking of people who had drawn pensions, who should not be pensioned, amount to nothing.  There is nothing in that because the Comptroller and Auditor-General could only read the evidence before him.  It is almost inevitable that there must be some who are drawing pensions who should not be drawing pensions.  That will not be met by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, because if there is perjury the Comptroller and Auditor-General going through the files must accept the perjury he reads there as gospel.</P>
    <P>What becomes then of the whole opposition to this Bill?  Should the Bill pass or should it not? Even if the Bill did not pass I do not think that we would need to give the files to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Our best legal advice is that we need not, and the only contention to the contrary is that of the Comptroller and Auditor-General who is not qualified and of Deputy MacEntee whose position on the Front Bench led me to believe that he was to be in the Cabinet, but I understand now he is going to be the Attorney-General in the very shadowy Cabinet.</P>

I suggest it is perfectly clear that it is not in the public interest that these things should come before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I suggest that the Act never anticipated that they would come before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I suggest that their going to the Comptroller and Auditor-General will not assist to the extent of one iota in discovering one pension that should not be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have got up here and have stated to their personal knowledge&mdash;in one case, the most bona fide case that I came across, it worked out the other way round&mdash;that many people were getting pensions to which they were not entitled.  As a matter of fact, usually that statement is made with a lack of the full conception of things.  If Deputies get up and say they know for a fact that a man is drawing a pension who should not be getting it, it is their duty as ordinary citizens, let alone as Deputies, to come along to me with that evidence. I will naturally consider it, and matters arising out of it may, as <Col N="2208" /> happened in this case, enable me to approach other people who are even in a better position to give me information on the matter than they are.  Once I have done the best I can to get information on it naturally my action will be to call together the Board and say to them: &ldquo;Such a person is getting such a pension, people have come along with this statement and are prepared to swear on oath. I submit this to you to compare it with the evidence on the files and see whether action would not lie in the matter; in any case to summon the beneficiary and demand of him to rebutt any evidence that has come forward.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister is so anxious to get cases like that why does he not give us the addresses so that we may be able to identify those who are getting pensions? There is no use in giving us a hundred names of John Murphys, Paddy Murphys, Tom Sullivans in the County of Cork and refusing to give us the addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the majority of cases the Deputy knows he will be able to form a fair idea as to the men who are getting the pensions. As far as I understand Deputy Ward he stated he wanted certain information.  He put an elaborate question which gave a considerable amount of work to my Department. I gave him a complete answer to his question as far as I understood him.  When he was speaking he said he had asked the wrong question. We were put to all that trouble for nothing.  Then he wanted to come along with another question about records which we really had not got in the Department. If he came along and was able to prove to us that there were illegal cases we would naturally then get after a whole lot of the illegal pensions.  We would put the whole machinery of the Department at work to get after them.  People get up time and again and say that they know cases of people who are getting pensions who should not. One member of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2209" /> Party did certainly lay himself out to give that assistance.  Deputy Ward was of real assistance to us in reducing a man's pension.  We have prosecuted two other men.  As regards the list of names, while you may be doubtful about some, there will be at least more than half that you will be pretty certain of, John Smith in this place or Pat Houlihan in another place.  By writing up to us we will say that is the man, go ahead, there is no difficulty about that.  If Deputies say they cannot make out those getting pensions how can they say they know people getting pensions who should not be getting them?</P>

Merely to use a majority in order to get a Bill through the Committee Stage&mdash;for this cannot be done without the consent of the House&mdash;is a misuse of the majority I submit that we should be given proper time to consider this Bill in the light of the new fact that it has gone through its Second Stage.  We could not be expected to assume that this Bill would go through its Second Stage.  Therefore we are entitled to the usual period of time between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage in order to be in a position to draft amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do think that it cannot be claimed that this Bill is one of urgent public importance.  I do not think that that claim can be made for this Bill.  That claim was <Col N="2215" /> made to-day by the Minister for Justice in regard to the Courts of Justice Bill, 1929, and we were not unreasonable.  I think it is unreasonable on the part of the Government to ask that this Bill should be treated as a Bill of urgent public importance, because on the face of it, it is not a Bill to which these terms could apply.  I do not think it is reasonable to ask that the Committee Stage of the Bill should be taken now immediately after the Second Reading.  I think it would be treating the House in a very improper way to ask that a Bill of this kind, for which there is no justifiable reason for pressing in this urgent way through the House, should have its Third Stage rushed through now. I do not think that there is any adequate reason for asking that it should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask what reasons the Government can bring forward to the House to justify them in pressing the Committee Stage at this time.  It is usual under the Standing Orders that there must be two or three days allowed for amendments.  That has been the procedure for six or seven years.  There is no urgency about this Bill.  I would like to know the reasons the Government have for treating the House in this way, except the fact that they have their six pensioners here forming a majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if the Deputy were less offensive when speaking.  He should remember that when they entered the House his Party had one pensioner, at least.  More than one pensioner was elected as a member of his Party drawing pensions from this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter; the term is applicable and it is a term that the Deputies opposite ought not to make a term of reproach because it is not that.  It is <Col N="2216" /> a term of reproach in respect of an alien authority giving pensions, if it so desires, to those who would be prepared to support that authority. That is quite a different case, however. The case for this Bill, as I said, was made on the Second Stage when the principle of the Bill was discussed.  We are asked now why we are pressing this measure. Deputy Briscoe, as the spokesman of the Party opposite, has been inquiring for at least two years when we intend to conform with the request of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have now done so.  I may say that no Bill has got such an extensive Second Reading on the part of the Deputies opposite as this Bill.  Few speeches have been made by the Deputies on this side of the House. Many speeches have been made by Deputies opposite.  The Deputies on the Opposition Benches showed a desire at one time to have a decision on the Bill.  They have been afforded every possible opportunity of debating this measure.  They have not been limited in the course of the debate. The principle of the Bill was fully dealt with on the Second Reading and it is futile and foolish to suggest that this is a Bill which admits of amendment.  Once it is accepted that the principle of the Bill is the matter which is decided on the Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does it not apply to every Bill that the principle is decided on the Second Stage?  The President has given no reason why <Col N="2217" /> this unique procedure should be adopted in connection with the Military Service Pensions Bill.  It has never happened before in our experience, unless in the case of a very harmless Bill, that the Committee Stage was taken immediately after the Second Reading.  Surely the President will give us some reason why we should depart from general procedure.</P>

      <P>On behalf of our Party we object to the Committee Stage of this Bill being taken tonight. I think the President will agree that at any time he was in a position to point out to the House that a Bill was urgently required and that he wanted to take it without the period provided under Standing Orders elapsing, he was always given facilities.  I think in view of the fact that the Minister for Defence has made the statement that this Bill is not required, and in view of certain other statements that he made, that the Bill would require to get closer examination on Committee Stage than it will be possible to give it if it is taken tonight. I think in the light of the statements made by the Minister for Defence this evening and so as to enable members to prepare any amendments which they may think necessary, that the President ought to agree to the Committee Stage of this Bill being postponed.</P>

      <P>I object to the definition on the grounds that it does not cover what happened, and some other definition will have to be sought for what the Government wants to do.

I do not want it to be understood that those people who are in receipt of pensions&mdash;I am really making an ad hoc speech; I suppose that will be understood&mdash;are not awarded pensions as the result of an inquiry, and I want to give the Minister for Defence an opportunity of explaining to the House, and through the House to the people of the country, how these awards were made, and that they were awards and not grants.

      <P>A Deputy who persists in irrelevance or repetition in debate and who, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle or the Chairman, is speaking for the purpose of obstructing business, may be directed by the Ceann Comhairle or the Chairman to discontinue his speech after the attention of the Dáil or of the Committee has been called to his conduct.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that I should be the judge, but I think it is sustainable that practically every speaker so far has spoken for no other purpose than to obstruct business.</P>

      <P>I submit that in this case the fact that this Bill is to make final, conclusive, and binding, on all persons and tribunals, certain findings without specifying in the Title that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are going to be limited, means that, even if the House has accepted the principle, we can move an amendment which will prevent the limitation of those powers.  I contend, as this Act is virtually an Act to amend Article 62 of the Constitution, that unless the Title of the Bill specifically recites that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are going to be limited.  I am entitled to move an amendment which will safeguard the powers which the Comptroller and Auditor-General has under Article 62 of the Constitution.</P>

If it is deleted it will give the courts of law such powers as they have over ordinary boards or corporations.

      <P>(An Clár): I submit that this is a matter on the administration of the Bill.  It is a matter of bringing the Board of Assessors into the same plane as ordinary citizens who are members of corporations. It is not the principle of the Bill.  The principle of the Bill, as I understand it, is that certain documents which were available to the Board shall not be available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. That is the big principle running through the measure.  In this case, if the Board of Assessors at any time did anything that could be construed as illegal, I want to ensure that that matter could go before a court of law.  If the Bill stands as it is, no court of law would have jurisdiction over them. As I say, it is not a matter concerning the principle of the Bill but it is a matter of bringing them into the same plane as corporations or collections of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  Deputy Hogan's amendment had a wider scope.  This is restricting it to a very narrow ambit.  You have there an authority that certainly this House could accept.  The High Court&mdash;the Supreme Court if you prefer it&mdash;at any rate, the High Court would be accepted as an authority by this House, and would, I think carry very great weight in its decisions on any matter, especially in a matter of this <Col N="2241" /> kind, and an appeal to the Supreme Court would be open.  There should be an appeal.  I think this differs materially from Deputy Hogan's amendment, in that it provides some way by which some authority in the country would have a say in the matter.  After all, this House cannot very well go into the details of any case, and this would provide some authority.  This is no attempt at obstruction.  In all seriousness, I think that some authority of that kind ought to lie in the Court, to give serious consideration, as undoubtedly the High Court would, to any question of this kind put before it.  I think it is wise that there should be some authority in the country open to reconsider matters of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that exactly the reason that induced you to rule Deputy Hogan's amendment out of order should induce you to rule this amendment out of order, and that is that it goes outside the principle of the Bill, as passed on Second Reading.  The fact that it gives power to one court and not to a number does not alter the principle upon which you acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that Deputy O'Kelly's amendment raises a very important issue.  Under Article 65 of the Constitution the judicial power of the High Court is, it is stated, extended to the question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. Under Article 62 of the Constitution, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has been appointed and it is stated that he shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, and shall report to Dáil Eireann at such stated periods to be determined by law.  If the objection of the Minister for Education does express the mind of the Executive Council in this matter, which I take leave to doubt, considering the affection in which the Executive Council hold the Constitution, then it would appear to me that one of the purposes of this Bill not disclosed in the <Col N="2242" /> Title and not discussed upon the Second Reading, would be to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 65 of the Constitution. Some time ago&mdash;I think it was in connection with a prosecution under the Treason Act early in 1927&mdash;a judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hanna, expressed the opinion that the Constitution should not be amended, so to speak, by a side-wind &mdash;that Bills of this nature, affecting the fundamental Articles of the Constitution, should not proceed through this House in any other way, or under any other guise, than that of constitutional amendments.  It would appear to me, if the Minister for Education does really express the mind of the Executive Council on this matter, that the real purpose of the Bill is, first, to nullify the effect of Article 62 of the Constitution and, secondly, to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court to determine the validity of any law, including this law.  In order to safeguard against that possibility, Deputy O'Kelly's amendment ought to be considered. I put that to you, and I suggest it is a very serious point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>The principle of the Bill is, that the findings should be final and conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever.  The House agreed to that.  That is the main principle of the Bill, and Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is just somewhat narrower than Deputy Hogan's amendment, which was ruled out by the Chair.</P>

      <P>With all respect, might I put it to you that in deciding to rule out this amendment the Chair has taken upon itself almost alone to legislate?  The decision on the Second Reading of the Bill did, in a general way, adopt the principle of the Bill, but surely, if proper time were given for amendments a matter of this kind would certainly have come up, and the House would have had time to consider the very important legal and constitutional issue raised.  Although there were numerous and long speeches on the Second Reading, this point was not referred to by any speaker and, therefore, might be said not to <Col N="2244" /> have been before the House.  It is a very important constitutional and legal issue that is raised, when a decision of that kind comes from the Chair, that we are precluded even from getting a vote of the House on a very important issue of this kind.  I put it to you, with all respect, that the Chair ought to allow this to go to the House, at any rate, and not take on itself the responsibility of precluding, if this Bill becomes an Act, any citizen who feels aggrieved by the passage of the Bill, bringing the matter into the courts to have it tested and a decision taken.  I think it is a very serious responsibility and, with all respect, I say that the Chair would be wise to allow the House to vote upon it.</P>

      <P>On that point I have already said I could not accept Deputy O'Kelly's amendment.  I do not want to limit either debate or the amendments any more than is absolutely necessary.  Of course Deputies are under a certain disability that they have to consider amendments without notice.  Perhaps it would be better for Deputies, and even for the Chair, if we had more time.  But I am quite clear that Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is in principle the same as Deputy Hogan's, except that it is narrower, and I have to rule Deputy O'Kelly's amendment out practically on the same ground as I ruled out Deputy Hogan's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <P>Take me as making a very strong protest against the arbitrary action of the Chair in ruling out a matter which, if there was time, would have got very serious consideration from the Chair. Amendments which are sent in in the ordinary way are naturally considered, and the Chair gets legal advice if necessary in connection with them.  That is the Chair's own look-out.  At any rate, the Chair gives serious consideration to matters of this kind.  It is very <Col N="2245" /> serious to take from the courts of this country any jurisdiction in a matter of this kind.  I know the Chair is in as difficult a position as we are, owing to no notice being given of amendments of this kind, and I think the Chair would be wise in allowing the House to vote upon this very important matter.  If there is any doubt in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's mind about this matter&mdash;and I do not know whether there is or not&mdash;I think the safest course, if I might humbly advise the Chair, would be to let the House take upon itself the responsibility, and not to ask the Chair to take that responsibility, which is an unfair responsibility to ask the Chair in the circumstances to assume.  I think it would be safer for the House and the country generally if the Chair would put that responsibility upon the House and not assume so serious a position itself.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has raised a serious point, and accordingly I now ask leave to move under Standing Order 63 to report progress in order to report to the Dáil that a question has arisen in Committee as to whether the jurisdiction of the High Courts as set forth in Article 65 of the Constitution will be affected or is <Col N="2246" /> affected by Section 2 of this Bill and the Title to the Bill, which sets forth that the findings of the Board of Assessors shall be deemed always to have been final, conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever.  Deputy Hogan has raised the point as to whether tribunals, in that instance, might be held to be the courts set up under the Constitution.  Deputy O'Kelly has gone further, and in order to safeguard the powers of the High Court in the matter has suggested the insertion after the words &ldquo;all persons and tribunals whatsoever&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;save and except the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You, sir, have ruled that you cannot accept such an amendment because you feel that the House has already decided on the principle of the Bill, and that the findings of this Board of Assessors would be binding even on the High Court.  That, I take it, would be the effect of your ruling if Deputy O'Kelly cannot insert in the section words that will save the powers of the High Court. Then I take it that your opinion is that the House has already accepted the principle that the findings of the Board of Assessors are to bind even the High Court.  As I pointed out, the question as to the jurisdiction of the High Court to re-open these matters was never referred to in the debate on the Second Reading because it did not occur to any person until Deputy Hogan raised the point that it possibly might arise.  Against that we have your ruling, which shows that you feel that the jurisdiction of the High Court would be affected by the passage of this Bill, because if Deputy O'Kelly's amendment were not against the principle of the Bill the powers of the High Court would not be affected, but if it is against the principle of the Bill obviously the appeal to the jurisdiction of the High Court would be affected.  As I pointed out already, a learned judge in the High Court has very severely criticised the practice of amending the Constitution by a side wind.  When dealing with the prosecution brought under the Treason Act in 1927 <Col N="2247" /> he stated that the Constitution should not be amended except by an Act brought in specifically for that purpose.  If the ruling of the Chair in this instance is right&mdash;if any amendment that would reserve to the High Court its existing jurisdiction is contrary to the principle of the Bill, then Article 65 of the Constitution is amended, and that is a very serious matter.  For that reason I am asking permission to move that, as a question has arisen in Committee as to whether the jurisdiction of the High Court as set forth in Article 65 of the Constitution is affected or prejudiced by Section 2 of the Bill the Dáil be asked to reconsider the matter and to give a decision for the guidance of the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by Deputy MacEntee. It was made clear during the course of the debate that this Bill was expressly for the purpose of making clearer what was the present existing law.  It was contended continually by two Ministers that there was no change being made in the law but that it was simply clearing up a point that was at issue.  All the Ministers had to go on was the opinion of their Counsel, the Attorney General, and an opinion is not a decision.  They choose not to arrange as they might have done by agreement to bring the matter before a judge.  It is constantly done.  A friendly action could have been <Col N="2248" /> brought by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  By agreement the matter could have been submitted to a judge and the law finally tested by a case, but that course was not taken.  The course adopted was to make the existing law clearer by a further Act.  Now I take it that in the minds of the Ministry they did not think in any way that they were passing an Act which is repugnant to the Constitution as it at present exists.  Now we have discovered that it may be repugnant on at least two points.  The most important of these is the interference with the judiciary. I think that this is not a mere matter for amusement.  This is not a matter merely of obstruction.  The whole question of the Bill is a very serious one.  Men who at an earlier stage took a conscientious view of this matter, who in this House disassociated themselves from voting on this Bill at an earlier stage as men who have some regard for their honour, should not at this stage wash their hands of the Bill and vote automatically simply because we are going into the Committee Stage.  I suggest it is the duty of everyone in this House to consider this as a big constitutional issue and not merely as a sort of matter of detail which can be dismissed with a smile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the following question of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries yesterday afternoon:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the sporting rights on the Sandford Estate, Castlerea, Co. Roscommon, have been recently let by the Land Commission to the senior officer of that Department in Co. Roscommon, and to an officer of the Department of Local Government and Public Health; if so, will he state the rent offered and accepted, whether any public advertisement that the lands were to be let was published, and, if not, what procedure was adopted to ensure that the letting was made to the best public advantage, and further, whether he is aware <Col N="2251" /> that for the last eighteen years the shooting on this estate was free.</P>
    <P>I got the following answer which really was not an answer to my question at all.  I asked about the Sandford Estate and the reply referred to the Wills Estate.  This was the reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The shooting over the untenanted land on the Ed. W.S. Wills Estate, Co. Roscommon, was leased by the Land Commission to Mr. C.F. Kelly for a period of 20 years from 1st April, 1924, at an annual rent of £1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is supposed to be an answer to the first part of my question; also to the part as to what rent was offered and accepted.  I got no answer whatever as to whether any public advertisements were issued. The answer goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Kelly is the sole lessee of these rights.  Except for the seasons 1921 to 1923 the shooting over this estate had been let annually since the lands were acquired by the Congested Districts Board in 1914.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a supplementary question by me, said that the only shooting rights that were available were on this Sandford Estate, although in the written answer he said there were shooting rights on this other estate called the Wills Estate.  He said that if any mistake was made, it was made by me and not by himself.  I can quite understand the Parliamentary Secretary, not being in the constituency, getting mixed up in these two estates.  If a mistake were made it was made by him.  There is a very important principle involved in this matter.  The official in question is the person who reports everything in connection with land to headquarters in Dublin.  He was familiar with all the proceedings in connection with the acquisition of this estate and knew what price the Congested Districts Board paid for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, referred to a certain house he has acquired.  This gentleman <Col N="2252" /> wrote to a higher officer in the Land Commission and put his own valuation on this particular house and property which he was bidding for himself and got it for a song.  He actually asked to have credited to the estate timber sold to the Congested Districts Board to the value of between £240 and £340; also another £100 worth of timber sold in the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply I got deals with another estate.  I think I can deal with the written reply I got from the Parliamentary Secretary. The position is involved in this way that there are two neighbouring estates in Roscommon.  It is well-known that Mr. Kelly got the sporting rights as a result of a letter from a Land Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I will quote that letter in which the sporting rights were granted for 1,250 acres at £1 per annum for twenty years.  The sporting rights in the estate which is mentioned in my question, or at least the sporting rights in the Sandford Estate were simply left in abeyance.  The landlord, when he sold out to the Land Commission, left the country, and since then&mdash;that is, for about eighteen years&mdash;the people of the Castlerea district have been shooting freely over those lands.  Last summer, about June or July, there was an order served on two people. They were picked out because they were supposed to be soft people, two ex-R.I.C. pensioners, and they were warned that they were trespassing on this Sandford Estate over which they had been shooting for years. They were told to get off the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> They were inclined to get off, but their neighbours advised them to stand fast.  They were brought to the court and an order was made restraining them from shooting on those lands for the future.  That is what actually happened.  I have not got any answer at all from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I intend to give him time to give me the answer I require.</P>
    <P>I am glad the President has remained in the House.  This is a matter of the utmost public importance. It means that a Land Commissioner, that a high official of the Land Commission, the man on whom the full responsibility of the work of that body in the County Roscommon devolved, was actually able to get the sporting rights of 1,250 acres of land in that underhand manner, and without any advertisement being issued.  The position now is that he has also got the shooting rights over the Sandford estate.  I looked at the &ldquo;Dublin Gazette&rdquo; this afternoon to find out what the area of the Sandford estate was.  I find from the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; of the 25th July, 1911, that the record number 9,193 C.D.B. estate, Thomas George Wills-Sandford, comprises, according to the schedule published in that paper, 1,300 acres, and the other estate, the Wills estate, which Mr. Kelly also has, comprises, according to the same &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; 1,600 acres.  I understand that of these 1,600 acres the sporting rights of only 1,250 acres have been given to this gentleman. It amounts to this, that he has got the sporting rights of the whole countryside for one pound a year.</P>
    <P>Now there were in the Castlerea district seventy-two gun licences of £2 each taken out by sporting men there.  That means £140 a year to the Revenue for gun licences alone in that district.  I have been informed by the people of the district that if there had been an advertisement issued about the sale of these sporting rights these people would certainly bid.  I do not know what they would pay.  I have been asking people who are sportsmen and they say that if these men were prepared <Col N="2254" /> to pay £2 a year for a gun licence they would not object to pay £1 a year extra to have the right of shooting on this big estate.  That is to say that in that area £70 a year could be got for these shooting rights if there had been done in this matter what in all fairness should have been done and the result would be that the tenants who bought that land under the Purchase Act would be relieved to that amount.  The tenants would be relieved or else the money would go to the Treasury in some way.  That has not been done.  The result is that in all there is a loss of £210 per annum.  Why I say that is that if this thing is persisted in the people who have taken out gun licences, and who now have no places in which to shoot will in the future cease to take out these licences. Four people have dropped their licences this year and if this thing is allowed to stand probably several others of them will also drop taking out gun licences and all this because one man has been able to buy the sporting rights of the whole place for £1 per annum.  In all, the State is going to lose something about £140.  I suppose they will lose at least £120 a year and there would have been another £70 for the sporting rights.  The thing has become very serious.  This is principally bog land.  The people there take grazing for their cattle.  Since this injunction was got against these people I am informed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was stopped by the gamekeeper and told that if he brought the dog into that land any more he would find himself in the court too.  It is quite possible that the Government and that the Parliamentary Secretary were not aware that this thing took place.

      <P>What has happened is this: the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are going to stand over the action of two public officials coming along and grabbing the shooting on two estates amounting to 3,000 acres, and driving off these estates people who have been shooting there for the last eighteen years.  It may be said that everybody had the right to bid for these sporting rights.  I admit that.  I say that the people who had been enjoying those rights for the last eighteen years should have a chance of bidding for the shooting, so that a great benefit to the estate might have been got.  Instead of that we have the underhand method of the official in charge of this very estate and other estates in the county grabbing the shooting rights for himself.  I am sorry that the time for raising this matter on the adjournment was cut short by the division that took place after 10.30. I might mention that there are 694 tenants, roughly 700 people, on the two estates.  They are affected one way or another.  If they bring a dog in to hunt cattle home they are liable to be stopped by a gamekeeper and told that they are trespassing.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the protest made by Deputy Boland against the principle of a Government Department acting in such a manner as the Land Commission have done in this instance.  It is not at all conducive to giving a sense of security or giving any kind of belief in the fairness of the Land Commission, that that body should in such circumstances give the shooting rights over certain property to its chief official in the County Roscommon and to a highly-placed official of the Local Government Department.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate what rent was paid for these shooting <Col N="2256" /> rights under the C.D. Board.  We would like to know if the rent in these days was greater than £1 per annum.  Will he state why the two officials who now have the shooting rights are not called upon to pay the same rent as was paid for the shooting rights heretofore?</P>

      <P>The answer to Deputy Boland's question was drafted on the assumption that it referred to a letting of sporting rights made by the Land Commission to Mr. Kelly on the Sandford Wills estate.  It transpired, however, in the supplementary question asked by the Deputy that the rights to which he referred were on the Wills Sandford estate.  There are two estates, one belonging to a man named Sandford Wills and the other to a man named Wills Sandford.  The confusion arose obviously through the close similarity of the names.  It is quite obvious from the wording of the question that the estate to which the Deputy refers is the Wills Sandford estate.  The sporting rights on that estate were at no time the property of the Land Commission; therefore, no letting was or could have been made by them at any time.  The estate was sold under the 1903 Act. It was a direct sale between the owner and the tenants.  The tenants agreed that the sporting rights should be reserved to the owner and subsequently when the demesne lands were sold it was also agreed that the sporting rights should be reserved.  I have succeeded in getting this information after a most exhaustive search through the records of the Land Commission.  It appears however that the vendor never took any steps to preserve the game rights and he recently sold those rights to three gentlemen in Co. Roscommon, one of whom is Mr. Kelly.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  There are two other men apparently interested in these sporting rights as well as Mr. Kelly.  Whatever action was taken against the people in Castlerea in connection with the sporting rights on a particular game reserve, which is rented at the present time by Mr. Kelly and others, was taken at the instance of these men, and the Land Commission has nothing whatsoever to do with this.  The transaction that took place was one between the vendor of the sporting rights and the three individuals concerned.  In connection with the question of sporting rights generally, during the last few years these sporting lettings are advertised as a rule in four or five papers.  They are advertised in two of the Dublin daily papers and, as well, are advertised in the &ldquo;Irish Field,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Irish Statesman&rdquo; and the &ldquo;English Field.&rdquo;</P>

There is another estate to which the Deputy referred on which Mr. Kelly has sporting rights, too.  These were leased to him in 1924.  They were sporting rights which he enjoyed from 1915 under the régime of the Congested Districts Board, and he has enjoyed them continuously since. They were absolutely valueless at the time that Mr. Kelly took them over, and they were leased to him at a rental of £1 per year.</P>

    <P>It must be understood that these figures represent the amounts paid at the local offices of the Unemployment Fund situated in the respective counties, but not necessarily paid to residents in these counties since numerous offices are situated at or near the border of other counties.</P>
    <P>In addition, a sum of £6,703 was paid through associations under Section 17 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, but it is not possible to allocate this by counties.</P>
