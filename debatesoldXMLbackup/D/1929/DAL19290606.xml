      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what progress has been made in regard to the proposals for the drainage of the River Robe, Co. Mayo; and if he can state how soon he expects the actual drainage work to begin.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, from the Mayo County Council in respect of the drainage of the River Robe and tributaries. As portion of the district extends into County Galway, a petition from that county will also be required before the scheme can proceed. This petition has not yet been received by the Commissioners, although the necessity for it has been pointed out to interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the Commissioners are having an engineering survey of the district made, and the field work is now nearing completion. A good deal of office work must subsequently be done before determining the necessary works and preparing a detailed estimate.  It will then be necessary for a land valuer to inspect the district in order to ascertain exactly what lands will be improved, and to estimate the extent of the benefit.  This examination will be tedious, involving <Col N="920" /> the collection of a mass of detail, and cannot be commenced until the engineering basis of the scheme has been laid down.  The drainage scheme when prepared must be exhibited locally for the votes of the affected occupiers, and probably a public inquiry held before the scheme can be confirmed and actual work begun.  In the circumstances it does not appear likely that a start can be made this season.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been called to the resolutions passed by the Roscommon County Council at its meeting held on the 1st June, relative to the four drainage schemes&mdash;Cross River, Clogher, Feorish and Derrynadooey, Corboley and Sandfield&mdash;and whether he will now state if the proposals are in order, and if the Board of Works is prepared to start work on any or all of those schemes at once, as the present conditions are most favourable for this class of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received copies of the resolutions referred to, and note that the Roscommon County Council have now agreed to make the necessary contributions towards the cost of the schemes.  They have instructed their engineer to prepare a detailed drainage scheme for the Cross River, but, in view of the requirements of the Act, actual work cannot be begun for a considerable time.  In the Clogher and Corboley and Sandfield cases the Commissioners are advised that an engineering survey is necessary in each case before finally deciding on the estimate, and these are being put in hands.  The Sligo County Council have not yet agreed to contribute their share of the cost of the Feorish River and Derreendooey scheme, and, until they do so, no further action can be taken by the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>For the reasons indicated in my reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 29th March, 1928. no land in County Donegal has been acquired up to the present date for the purpose of State afforestation. A few areas which have been offered in the County are now under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in a reply to a question of mine on the <Col N="922" /> 29th March, stated that the Land Commission had taken over 2,000 acres of land, and that the Forestry Department would acquire 1,000 acres for afforestation purposes.  In view of the fact that 50,000 acres have been acquired for afforestation, and that out of that amount 10,000 acres have been planted with upwards of 22,000,000 trees, and that now the Minister states that nothing has been done so far as Donegal is concerned, I would ask the Minister whether he considers that Donegal has been treated fairly in view of the large amount of unemployment and emigration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forestry Branch can only buy land when it is offered to them and only when it is suitable. Suitable land has not been offered to any great extent in Donegal.  The Land Commission hold a certain amount which is regarded as being suitable for afforestation, and the Forestry Branch are in negotiation for the purchase of 1,147 acres, and also for the purchase of another estate, but it is not yet clear whether it will be suitable for forestry.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Apart from the reductions, which have been effected this year certain sub-heads show increases, and some explanation of these increases is deemed to be necessary.  Sub-head A &mdash;Salaries and Wages&mdash;increase, £343.  A warehouse establishment was fixed late in the year 1927-28, and the annual advances to the wages of this staff, added to increments of salary, account for the bulk of the extra charge.  No additions, other than one copying typist, have been made to the staff.  Sub-head G&mdash;&ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo;&mdash;increase, £500.  I have referred on a previous occasion to the fact that the additional notices inserted by the Land Commission in this journal, and the amplification of other notices from the same Department arising out of the Land Act, 1927, have added to the cost of printing.  The full effect of these changes is now being felt, and it has become necessary to make increased provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H&mdash;increase of £13,000. The expenditure here embraces the whole of the printing work on voters lists (register of electors, electors lists, claims, objections, etc., etc.).  The printing contracts for the lists in urban and county areas are normally placed for five years (the contracts which have recently expired for the urban areas printing actually ran for six years). All these contracts have now expired and new contracts to commence with the register printed in June next have been made.  These &ldquo;time&rdquo; printing contracts have this advantage, that though the expenditure involved in setting up the type for the first year is heavy, and accounts in this case for the big increase in the Estimate, there are very favourable rates for reprinting in the four years following, as the type once set up is held at the Department's disposal for the full five years.  The service for which expenditure under sub-head H is provided is only partly a State charge, as the registers of electors are not alone a record of voters at Dáil elections, but also show the Local Government electors and jurors.  The State is relieved of the bulk (4-7ths.) of the <Col N="926" /> charge, which proportion comes to the relief of the Vote as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H H&mdash;increase £900&mdash; This is a new sub-head, the amount inserted being held to be necessary if certain newspapers and periodicals printed in Irish, which are now in danger of failing, are to be enabled to continue the useful work on which they are engaged.  It is proposed to allocate the grants in proportion to the volume of printing work appearing in each Journal, other considerations being equal, where it is clearly established that a grant is necessary.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that considerable reductions have been made in certain sub-heads, and it is hoped that it will be found that the reduced provisions made for the present years, which keep closely to the expenditure in the last completed year, modified where necessary by Departmental Estimates submitted, will prove justified.  The reduction of £2,000 made in sub-head F (Oireachtas Debates) calls for mention, however, as it is largely due to the decision of the Oireachtas to forego in future the reprinted volumes of debates which in the past formed a not inconsiderable proportion of the total cost of this printing.  The automatic issue of a revised and bound edition of the debates in volume form will, therefore, disappear, the weekly debates being bound up in volumes of appropriate size as occasion demands.</P>
    <P>The anticipated appropriations-in-aid, it will be observed, show a marked increase, the bulk of which represents the added monies which it is expected will be brought to account from local authorities (supplies to local authorities for registration purposes, increase, £8,150). representing the added charges these authorities will bear as a result of the increase in printing under sub-head H of the Vote.  The increase expected under the head of supplies to Repaying Departments is due to the fact that the more important repaying services, such as the Electricity Board, Agricultural <Col N="927" /> Credit Corporation, Currency Commission, etc., and the Repayment Services to Education by way of paper for printing Secondary School Texts in Irish and General Readers in Irish, and supplies to Preparatory Colleges will have reached their full normal requirements in the present year.</P>
    <P>The commission (£2,000) is not alone the commission on supplies from Stationery Office stock referred to in the preceding paragraph but also includes that received in respect of the much larger items of Printing and Binding and special purchases, &amp;c., for all Repayment Services, payment for which is charged to &ldquo;suspense&rdquo; and therefore does not appear in Stationery Office Vote. (This commission is a not altogether negligible relief to Stationery Office Staff charges.)  It will also be seen that a reduction in the Sale of Stationery Office Publications (£600) and in the premiums (£50) received from the agents for the sale of Government publications is anticipated. The premium varies with the sales and there has been a decline in sales for some little time.  This decline is partly due to a reduction in the number of Acts and the Regulations which follow from them, and also to a certain shrinkage in the number of reports of Commissions and other documents the sales of which in the years 1927/28 and previous years accounted for much of this revenue. On the other hand there is a corresponding saving in the sub-head I (Printing).</P>
    <P>Apart from the reduction which may be expected in the next few years under the printing arrangements for the registers of electors (sub-head H) it is not improbable that Stationery Office expenditure has now reached a point below which, it is believed, it would be found difficult to maintain the existing service. The activities of the public service are clearly on the increase; this is evident from the volume of new work which continues to flow to this Office. The heavy legislation of the past few years has accounted for much of this increase.  The Live Stock Breeding <Col N="928" /> Act, Dairy Produce Acts, Courts of Justice Acts, Land Acts, Housing Acts, Industrial and Commercial Property Act, and Local Government Acts, are a few examples of legislation which have considerably affected Stationery Office expenditure.  As a set-off to the expenditure thus arising, there have been many savings by standardisation both of forms and records in general use throughout the service and of Stationery Office stocks of paper and supplies, and by the extension of the field of purchase from which better prices are secured. Many economies continue to be secured in existing services with the co-operation of Departments.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the question of not providing in the coming year the Oireachtas Debates in the form in which they were hitherto supplied. I have been asked to suggest that the recent decision of the Economy Committee, which, I understand, has the approval of the Minister for Finance, not to supply bound volumes of the Dáil Debates in future does not meet with the approval of a good many Deputies, particularly those who do not live in Dublin.  The ordinary Deputy has very little opportunity during the sitting of the House of reading the Official Reports on matters upon which he desires to keep himself well informed.  It is usually when the Dáil is not in session that Deputies who take an intelligent part in the proceedings of the House require the Official Debates for the purpose of keeping themselves in touch with what is going on.  I have been asked to suggest that the bound volumes should be supplied to Deputies in future the same as previously, and I should like to hear from the Minister for Finance, or the Parliamentary Secretary, the reasons which actuated them in coming to the decision not to supply these bound volumes during the coming financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the Vote owing to the fact that I understand the Stationery Office has control <Col N="929" /> over Government advertisements. One would naturally expect, as it is the taxpayers' money that is expended on Government advertising, that the Stationery Office would give their advertisements to the newspapers which had the biggest circulation without taking into consideration the political outlook of particular newspapers.  Some time ago a question was raised in the House regarding the stopping of advertisements for the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  I understand that the Stationery Office did not do that of their own accord.  In fact, I was informed by that Department that they did it expressly at the behest of the Minister for Finance.  Some time ago Deputy Carney raised the question with the Minister for Finance, and the Minister, in his reply, stated that it was owing to the fact that the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; was printed and had its headquarters in the Six Counties.  He also mentioned that it was the policy of the Government not to insert advertisements in newspapers printed in the Six Counties. A few weeks ago I put down a question to the Minister for Finance asking for a return of the newspapers receiving Government advertisements, and the Minister supplied me with a list.  I challenge him now as to the accuracy of that list, and would point out to him that, while he took the advertisements from the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; the advertisements were handed over to another paper in Derry, and these advertisements appeared in that paper after the Minister had made that reply to Deputy Carney.  I should like to go into the matter more fully, and I shall do so later, but I should like to hear from the Minister now his reason for stating to Deputy Carney that it was not the intention of his Department to give any more advertisements to newspapers having headquarters in the Six Counties and, at the same time, taking the advertisements from the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; because it dared to tell the truth in regard to certain incidents that occurred, both political and otherwise.  I should also like to know from him why, when he was <Col N="930" /> replying to my question a fortnight ago, and giving a list of newspapers, he excluded, either knowingly or unknowingly, the particular paper to which I referred, and which I need not mention, because the Minister knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the item of £140 for advertising, I should like to know is that for advertising Government publications? In regard to that matter, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what the Stationery Office is doing to make the reports that are being published widely known. There must be a very big reading public for a number of these reports such as the reports of the Banking Commission, of the Traffic Committee, of the Local Government Department, and of the Economic Committee in particular.  I am sure all these would get many thousands of readers if they were widely known. It seems to me that £140 in advertising would not make them very widely known, and we should like to know whether any other agencies are being utilised for this purpose, whether school teachers or the post offices, or any other of the semi-Government concerns, are being circularised so as to bring these publications under their notice.  In the debate on education here there was a lot of talk about continuation schools and about the necessity for seeing that the best advantage was got from the adult population for the four and a half millions spent on education.  To people of a certain temperament it is evident that reports such as I have referred to are one of the most valuable means of education, and it would be a great pity if the people who desire to see these things and read them were not aware of their publication.  It would be a mistake to think that everyone who is politically-minded is in the Oireachtas.  There are a great many throughout the country who would read these reports with a great deal more care and with a more critical mind than Deputies have an opportunity of doing.  If the Stationery Office is in trade, we ought to know <Col N="931" /> that it is availing of the opportunity that the best trading establishments are availing of to push their goods. We would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us if anything special is being done in that respect.  Deputy Cassidy has, in my opinion, brought forward a very serious matter, and we shall have to wait until the Minister replies before deciding whether or not we shall vote against this Estimate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cassidy has raised a matter on this Vote which was raised by me before by way of a question to the Minister for Finance.  It is a very serious matter because at that time I told the Minister that he was using public moneys for the purpose of blackmailing a newspaper which happened to have the misfortune, or the good fortune, to criticise his actions.  The paper I refer to is the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; prior to the action taken by the Minister for Finance in depriving it of advertisements that were formerly inserted in that paper, criticised the actions of the Minister for Finance in regard to the Six Counties.  Certain things were expected from the Minister for Finance because he belongs to the Six Counties, and this newspaper criticised the Minister's action in connection with the Six Counties as a whole.  Some time after that the advertisements were stopped and the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; was penalised by the Minister on account of the action it had taken.  Whether it was due to that, or not, I cannot say because the people of the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; are not quite certain themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a letter here from the Managing-Director of the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  He is prepared to prove before any tribunal, that a certain gentleman who formerly was director of the Journal had a quarrel with the rest of the directors and made a threat to the effect that he would have the Government advertisements stopped from the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo; I do not want to refer to that gentleman by name in this House, but he <Col N="932" /> is a member of the Oireachtas.  He is a Senator and he made a threat to the directors, and they are prepared to prove it, that he said, on leaving them, that he would have the advertisements stopped from the &ldquo;Journal.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>You have all sorts of people paying into the treasury, and if the Minister thinks, for a moment, that he is going to use the treasury and dip his hands into it in order to subsidise or to support a Unionist paper in the Six Counties, as against a Nationalist paper, the Minister is making the mistake of his life.  I asked a simple question and the Minister in his reply told me he was not compelled to give an advertisement to any newspaper in the Six Counties.  Of course, he is not compelled to do so, but, at the same time, when the Minister was cutting off advertisements from the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; he was giving them to a Unionist paper in Derry.  I would like to know what answer the Minister has to make to that.  He was not compelled to give advertisements to a Unionist paper in Derry if he was <Col N="933" /> not compelled to give them to the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  But why cut off a newspaper which circulates largely in Donegal, in the Saorstát, and give them to a Unionist paper which does not?  Of course, the old saying is: &ldquo;a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind.&rdquo;  Whether that influenced the Minister or not I do not know.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister, in the future, going to adopt the same attitude in regard to any newspaper that does not agree with his particular views as he has done with the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo;?  Are the newspapers in this country, if they have guts enough to come out and say certain things against the Minister if they think he is wrong, to be penalised, and is public money to be used like a club to beat them down?  The Minister should make himself very clear in his reply, and if he is not more accurate in his reply now than when he replied to me some time ago he will hear more about it.</P>

      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary concludes, would the Minister for Finance reply to the question I put to him when I asked him a week or a fortnight ago for a list of publications that received Government advertisements and why it was that one particular newspaper was withheld from that particular list either knowingly or unknowingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the answer to the question put by Deputy Cassidy, that answer was prepared in the usual way and, I presume, was accurate.  I have no reason to doubt that it was accurate. If Deputy Cassidy has any reason to doubt it he should put down another question.  With reference to the general question of advertising.  I have already stated that the policy is to give no advertisements, in the ordinary way, to papers other than those published in the Saorstát.  That is sound policy, I think.  The papers published here give employment here and pay taxation here, and in consequence the general rule should <Col N="934" /> be as it is, that advertising should be reserved to those journals.</P>
      <P>Occasionally it may be necessary to advertise outside the Saorstát. Occasionally, for instance, it may be necessary to advertise in a technical journal, or there may be some special case where the Department makes application to have advertisements issued in an outside paper. Apart from such special cases, there has been no recent advertising outside the Saorstát, and it is not proposed to make any special effort to spend money on the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;</P>

He could very easily get that information between the time when this matter was raised and when he rose to speak.  There is evidently something being withheld. There is evidently some reason for not telling the truth on this occasion.</P>

On what grounds are advertisements being given to newspapers?  Will the Minister answer Deputy Cassidy's point?  Will he say why the advertisements in this case were withdrawn from the &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; which has its headquarters in the Six Counties, and why Government advertisements are still appearing in a journal which has a far smaller circulation in County Donegal?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well happen that occasionally advertisements will be published in a paper outside the Saorstát in the case of certain purchases or for certain appointments. I believe in the case of vacancies, for instance, for a doctor, that it is customary to advertise in some British medical journals, and for a like reason advertisements such as that may occasionally appear in a paper outside the Saorstát.  A Department <Col N="937" /> may have some special reason&mdash;it might not be a general reason, such as in the case of doctors&mdash;for asking to have the advertisement inserted in a paper outside the Saorstát.  In such a case the advertisement will be issued to a paper outside the Saorstát. There may have been one such particular advertisement, for all I know, in some Derry paper since I gave the answer to which Deputy Cassidy referred, but you may take it that there would be no advertisement in the ordinary course issued to papers outside the Saorstát.  There will be no such thing as giving them advertisements every week or every second week or every month in the future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of politics let me repeat what I said so that Deputies may appreciate it. I would not agree that the Government is entitled to take very much notice of the politics of a paper published inside the Saorstát.  Of course if the papers were really advocating violence or something like that I think that then a paper of that sort ought not to get any public advertisements, but if the paper is a constitutional type of paper, whatever its politics are, then very little notice should be taken of it and the Departments should be allowed to issue advertisements to it practically at their discretion departmentally.  So far as papers outside the Saorstát are concerned, it seems to me that the position is very different.  Take the particular case of the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo; It is, I think, very doubtful that it should ever have got advertisements in the ordinary course. There is no doubt that it has a certain substantial circulation in the Saorstát, but even that fact is a bare justification for giving it advertisements. I certainly would not continue to give that or any such paper published outside the Saorstát advertisements if it is politically objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

      <P>They are supposed to give attention or consideration to the circulation of the newspapers. The choice of papers in which to issue advertisements is normally left to the Department concerned, and in any particular area there may be a number of factors which may have to be taken into account. It may be that you may have a bigger paper, the circulation of which may cover almost the same area that is covered by another paper in another town in that area, and it may be preferable to publish advertisements in the smaller paper. There is a variety of reasons which operate in these matters, and it is left to the discretion of the Department concerned.  The Department is expected to pay attention to the circulation that a newspaper has in the area.</P>

If we suffer from anything it is from too much advertisements, for the Debates and Orders that are published probably get too much publicity in the Press.  The result is that unless people are specially interested, such as lawyers and officials, people do not look for these reports.  The ordinary public are not interested in purchasing these publications.  There really would not be any great point in going to any great expenditure in advertising those publications.</P>

      <P>This year we are asking for a sum of about £40,000 for the District Court service or almost £9,000 less than last year. The decreased provision is accounted for in the following way.  The abolition of the office of Registar of District Court Clerks has resulted in the transfer of the functions of that office to the Department of Justice and it is considered that the salaries of the headquarters staff of the District Court Branch should properly be borne on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice and not as last year on the Vote for the District Court.  There will be no saving <Col N="943" /> in the running expenses of the District Court Branch this year, but the fact that that item has been taken out of the District Court Vote naturally reduces the amount for which we have estimated in respect of that Vote.  A substantial saving is, however, anticipated in the cost of Deputy District Justices.  The provision under this head has been decreased by £3,600, which decrease has been made possible by the appointment of two permanent Assistant Justices which it is hoped will obviate the necessity of appointing Deputy Justices during the vacation period and during the illness of the permanent Justices as formerly.  We do not expect, however, to save the whole sum of £3,600, for the salaries of the two Assistant Justices (£1,600) are not included in this Vote; but they will be a charge on the Central Fund.  At the same time it will be seen that a very substantial saving is anticipated.  The travelling expenses of the two Assistant Justices will, it is believed, be considerably lower than the expenses incurred by Deputies under the system which has heretofore obtained and in consequence we are budgeting for some £1,200 less under this head for the coming year; you will see that in item B, page 121.  The provision for the travelling and subsistence allowances of the permanent Justices has also been substantially decreased by the sum of £1,000.  The decreased provision is accounted for by the fact that the commuted allowances payable to Justices were revised last year and the increases in the allowances payable did not prove to be as high as had been anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to learn that although the jurisdiction of the District Court is far greater than the jurisdiction of the old Petty Sessions Court and the office business consequently much heavier, the cost of running the system has been reduced rather than increased apart from the fall in bonus.  It will be observed that the total salaries of District Court clerks outside the Dublin Metropolitan area amount at present to £29,715, covering 155 District <Col N="944" /> Court clerks, an average salary of about £4 a week per clerk.  This is an inclusive figure, there being no separate cost of living bonus in these cases.  The actual salaries of the individual clerks vary, of course, very much: there are one or two who have a net salary of from £7 to £8 a week after paying expenses (these are whole-time clerks serving half a dozen courts each or serving very important courts such as Limerick City), while at the other end of the scale there are clerks on a £1 a week serving small courts in remote country places who need not devote more than one day a week or even less to their duties.  Under Section 62 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, there is power to establish as pensionable Civil Servants such of these clerks as are whole-time, but up to the present this has been done in only one case.  Such other clerks as are clearly whole-time and are giving satisfaction will be established in due course.</P>

      <P>It is pleasing to learn that there is a saving of some £9,000 and that the appointment of two assistant justices has resulted in a saving of some £2,000.  I have heard complaints that criminal cases are crowding out the litigation of ordinary civilians in many cases and that the courts have been adjourned for very trivial reasons.  From time to time people are brought in long distances and compelled to bring witnesses and then the case is adjourned to the next court.  I wonder has the Minister heard anything of such complaints and will he have them looked into.</P>

      <P>I would like more information arising out of what the Minister said in connection with District Court clerks.  I think the position of these people is not at all satisfactory.  It is uncertain. <Col N="945" /> They were appointed as a result, I think, of the first Measure we passed here setting up these District Courts.  They were appointed more or less haphazardly in no regular formal way.  I think in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, there was a section which set the position right and gave authority to the Minister for Finance to establish these clerks if and when he thought fit, and now the Minister says after five years only in one case has a District Court clerk been established and given a certificate, I take it, as a Civil Servant.  I do not think that is a satisfactory position.  I think some effort ought to be made to set up a regular scale of salary for them and if they are whole-time officers they ought to be established as such. Can the Minister give us any reason for the delay in dealing with the matter about which there is some complaint, I can tell the Minister, on the part of many of those clerks? It is five years now since the Courts of Justice Act was passed.  At the rate of one in five years, I wonder when does he hope to have his hundred clerks or so dealt with.</P>

      <P>As far as Deputy Fahy's point is concerned, of course criminal business must take precedence of civil business, but I do not know of any court in which criminal business takes up such a large amount of time that the civil business cannot be carried on.  As far as the adjournment of civil cases is concerned no complaints have reached me.  Assuming for a moment that it is a fact, I would have nothing to do with it.  The justice is complete master of his own court. If the justice did adjourn a case unreasonably I have no control over him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made a point with regard to District Court clerks. A very great number of district clerks were appointed together.  The old Petty Sessions clerks were all dismissed and new clerks were put into their places.  Some of these were, and others were not, very suited to their positions and there had to be changes.  For the future, <Col N="946" /> as the Deputy knows, these appointments will be made by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The old clerks were simply put in, as they had to be, very hurriedly.  The whole-time men, when they have proved themselves satisfactory, will be put upon a permanent basis.  We are anxious to have a long and continued trial to see if they are, in fact, satisfactory before they are established.  An individual may be very good for a year or two and then go off.  We want to see if they are satisfactory, but I anticipate that in the immediate future they will be put on a permanent basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £36,156 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for such of the Salaries and <Col N="947" /> Expenses of the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice as are not charged on the Central Fund (No. 27 of 1926).</P>
    <P>This Estimate shows a net sum of £54,256 as the total sum required for payment of the salaries, including the cost of living bonus, of all the officers of the Courts at present functioning at the Castle and in the District Probate Registries, a sum of about £6,000 being appropriate to the officers attached to the Chief Justice (Lunacy, Minor and other matters), a sum of slightly less than £2,000 being appropriate to the officers of the Supreme Court, and the balance&mdash;the great bulk of the Estimate&mdash;being appropriate to the officers of the High Court, who are divided in this Estimate into groups corresponding to the several offices set up by the Court Officers Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>It will immediately occur to anyone who looks through the Estimate that the salaries actually to be voted for many officers are in excess of the salary appropriate to the office.  For example, in paragraph (11) on page 124, under the heading of the Office of Registrar of the Supreme Court, the salary of the post is shown in brackets as £600 rising by annual increments of £25 to a maximum of £800, but the salary actually to be voted is shown as £1,000, that is, the officer is being paid £200 more than the maximum salary of the office. The explanation of the apparent discrepancy referred to is that the officer in question is an officer of the old Supreme Court of Judicature whose former salary was £1,000 and who is still paid that salary although it is in excess of the salary of his new office.  It was provided by the Court Officers Act, 1926, Section 63, sub-section (4), that subject to certain qualifications such as age or health, every officer of the Supreme Court should be offered employment in the new Court without diminution of salary.  Practically the entire staff of the new Court were officers of the former Court and so long as these officers remain in the service the cost of the staff will be higher than it <Col N="948" /> would be if we had recruited the Court staff by new appointments.</P>
    <P>Although, as has been explained above, the amount of this Estimate is larger than it would normally be, it nevertheless represents a remark able decrease as compared with the cost of the Supreme Court staff under the old régime.  We are asking for about £58,000; the cost in 1921 was over £140,000.  Of this relatively enormous decrease a very large amount is due to the fall in the cost of living bonus, but even taking basic salaries, that is, ignoring the bonus altogether, the cost in 1921 was £76,000, and the cost now is less than £40,000, and this latter cost includes £3,000 or £4,000&mdash;the cost of the Lunacy Office&mdash;which did not appear at all in the 1921 Estimate and which now appears as part of the cost of the Office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice.  It is, of course, true that the 1921 Estimate was an Estimate for all Ireland, but the setting up of a separate High Court in Belfast did not in point of fact reduce the cost of the Dublin courts to anything like the extent which one might imagine.  I mean that it is a fallacy to say if the former court cost £76,000 the present court, considering the reduced territory served, should cost one-third less, or about £50,000, and that, therefore, the reduction to something under £40,000 is not so very striking.  That is a fallacy because it is much cheaper to run one High Court for an entire country than to run two High Courts, one for each of the divided parts.</P>
    <P>Nothing like a proportionate part of the reduction in this case has flowed directly from the fact that the six counties have been taken out of this jurisdiction; the reduction has been effected by a continuous campaign of economy none the less effective because it was not advertised in the newspapers or on the hoardings.  Officers who were past their work were invited to retire, officers of ability who could be spared were transferred to other Departments where, I may say, their services have been highly appreciated. The expensive and unsatisfactory <Col N="949" /> system of copying by hand was discarded in favour of typewriting. A similar care was exercised as regards the appointment of new officers; the former practice of importing patronage nominees into high positions has absolutely ceased; appointments have been made only when absolutely necessary, and then by promotion, and on every such promotion the scale of salary formerly paid for the higher post has been revised.  For example, when the post of Accountant became vacant it was filled by promotion, but the salary was reduced from £1,000 a year to a scale of £700 to £800.  This process will continue as the existing officers die or retire, and when this process has been completed the number of salaries of £1,000 or over in the Courts, which numbered fifteen so recently as 1925 and which now number nine, will be reduced to less than half a dozen. Except for this gradual reduction, I think there is very little, if any, further economy to be looked for in this staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The law's delays&rdquo; used to be a proverb, and I think it is exemplified here.  Last year and the year before reference was made here in the Dáil, and at some length, to the arrears of litigation in these courts.  I should like to know to what extent such arrears have been cleared up.  Economy has been preached by our Party.  It is still preached by us, but economy consistent with efficiency.  The Minister might inform the House whether the courts can, within a reasonable time, catch up with the arrears of litigation.  I think he will admit himself that the arrears are rather serious.  If the case reported to me is as reported, the Chancery Department dealing with cases of estates of people committed to mental hospitals is still a circumlocution office. The Minister, I am sure, has the files dealing with the case of a person who was so committed and who resided near Tuam.  I can give the Minister the name afterwards.  On the figures supplied to me, and they were alleged copies of auditors' <Col N="950" /> reports, and so on, the estate was worth some thousands.  The relatives of this person tried to get over the estate so that they might administer it themselves.  The business was carried on, and it was alleged that, in a period of five years, the estate dropped in value from some thousands to a few hundred pounds.  I do not know exactly what jurisdiction the Minister has in the matter, but if it be true, and the Minister has the files, that such a thing could happen, it is a matter requiring investigation.  Of course, we will be told that there is no separate Chancery lunacy division as such.  It is all the one, and is carried on in one particular court. In practice, however, it is kept as a separate division.  I would like to have some intimation from the Minister on these points.  I would also like to know from him what steps have been taken to expedite matters, and to have the arrears cleared off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen a large number of complaints about arrears of general business in the courts.  I do not think the work is in arrears, except in one particular branch of the courts.  The work of hearing Circuit Court appeals is undoubtedly in arrears.  This whole question of Circuit Court appeals has been gone into, and I think it is almost certain that a Commission of some sort will be set up to inquire into the question of the proper hearing of Circuit Court appeals.  Apart from that, I do not think there is any question of delay in the hearing of cases.  I think that they come to hearing in the High Court and in the Supreme Court reasonably quickly.  Of course, as far as the lunacy department, in regard to which the Deputy makes complaint, is concerned, that is under the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice, and if property has fallen in value I am sure it has not been through any neglect of the Chief Justice or any neglect on the part of his staff.  The Deputy knows, and everybody knows, that land property and that sort of thing has deteriorated very much in value.  Farms, for instance, <Col N="951" /> have fallen very heavily in value. Ex-parte statements by interested persons are not always, of course, as the Deputy knows, correct, but I think that I ought to say that as far as I know&mdash;and I do know something about it&mdash;the work of the lunacy department is very carefully done at present.  The Chief Justice is a man of the very greatest care.</P>

      <P>This statement was made about the lunacy department, and I thought it was only right to answer it.  Now as far as complaints are concerned, there were complaints made to my Department of delays in the examiner's office.  There were three complaints made, and in every single one of them the complaint was groundless. There had been certain delays in the examiner's office.  I completely admit that things got hung up in the examiner's office, but that is being recast.  Unfortunately, during the year a very able official in that office, Mr. Ellerker, died, and another gentleman, another able official, has retired from the examiner's office, but it is being recast.  It is under the care now of another clever and experienced official, and I believe the examiner's office will have no arrears at all at the beginning of the long vacation.</P>

      <P>These two offices, the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds, are under the same chief officer, the Registrar of Titles.  The Estimates for both offices were, until recently, included in the Estimate for the Supreme Court of Justice to which they were nominally attached, an arrangement which made it necessary for the enquirer to go through several tedious processes of addition, subtraction, and division before he could say how much the Supreme Court itself cost, and how much was attributable to the other two offices. The figures are now shown separately. There is little in the details of this Estimate which, I think, will cause any discussion, but perhaps Deputies would like to know something about the Registry of Deeds office.  It is an old office which was founded in the year 1708.  It keeps an index of all deeds that are registered&mdash;all deeds, conveyances, and wills which are made dealing with manors, lands, tenements, or hereditaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the local registration of titles office is almost entirely dealing with land purchased under the Land Acts.  In that case the registration is compulsory.  In <Col N="953" /> other cases persons can register their lands voluntarily as they like. There are two offices under the local registration of titles.  There is the central and there is also the district office in the districts.  In all cases, I think, except three, it is the county registrar who looks after the work.  We are considering whether we might not amalgamate, or possibly do away with the local registries altogether.  There is a good deal to be said on both sides, and the matter is receiving consideration, but we have not arrived at the final determination yet.</P>

I have found a case where it takes five or six months before the owner's name is changed.  The recording of a name of a new owner seems to take a longer time than is necessary.  I would also like to know how the arrangement between the Land Commission and the Registry Office is working, and whether there is any duplication there.  Another point is, if my information is correct, that the Registry of Deeds Office was reformed to a certain extent since 1922.  It is said the new arrangement is not working well.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on that point.</P>

I see no reason why a folio should not be entered up, I mean a plain, simple folio, before several months <Col N="954" /> have elapsed.  If the Deputy sends me any particulars I will ask the Chief Registrar to inquire into the matter.

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £34,635 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1930, chun Tuarastail agus Liúntaisí agus Costaisí Oifigeacha Cúirte Cuarda agus Udarásanna Clárathachta Aitiúla áirithe agus chun costaisí Ath-fhéachainte Liostaí Vótálaithe agus Coisteoirí (54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 66, Alt. 7; Uimh. 10 de 1924, Alt. 45; Uimh. 27 de 1926, Alt. 66; agus Uimh. 15 de 1928, Alt. 9).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £34,635 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for the Salaries, Allowances and Expenses of Circuit Court Officers, and certain Local Registering Authorities and the expense of Revision of Voters and Jurors Lists (54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 66., Sec. 7; No. 10 of 1924, Sec. 45; No. 27 of 1926, Sec. 66; and No. 15 of 1928, Sec. 9).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are here asking for a gross sum of £73,000, less £14,000 Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;that is, a net sum of £59,000 to cover all the expenses of carrying on the office business of the Circuit Court and certain other expenses (such as the judges' travelling expenses) which are really connected <Col N="955" /> with the judges rather than with the offices, but which, not being charged on the Central Fund, must be provided here.  As regards the salary list, the first item is the remuneration of the county registrars. Under the Court Officers Act, 1926, the office of Clerk of the Crown and Peace was abolished and the new office of county registrar substituted therefor.  The difference between these two officers is that the county registrar is a civil servant who must retire when he reaches a certain age (70); he is paid a fixed salary and he surrenders to the Exchequer all fees received by him, whereas the Clerk of the Crown and Peace held office for life and received, in addition to his salary, certain fees in connection mainly with electoral work. Of the former Clerks of the Crown and Peace all but six or seven voluntarily declined re-employment as county registrars, and of those who accepted such employment two have since retired and one has been dismissed, so that the great majority of the county registrars are new appointees, and their salaries are considerably lower than the salaries paid to their predecessors.  After the salaries of the county registrars the next most serious item in the Estimate is the salaries of their staffs. Prior to the Court Officers Act, 1926, these staffs were the private employees of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace, who made his own bargain with them and could increase or decrease the staff, or their salaries, and engage and dismiss men at pleasure.</P>
    <P>The State paid to the Clerk of the Crown and Peace a clerical allowance towards the cost of staff, but this allowance was not intended to and did not, in fact, cover the entire cost of staff, nor was the State interested in seeing how the clerical allowance was distributed amongst the staff.  Since the Court Officers Act came into operation in September, 1926, the State has assumed direct liability for the salaries of these staffs the salaries paid by the State being the same as were formerly paid&mdash;that is, the State <Col N="956" /> ascertained the actual salary formerly paid to each man, whether it came from clerical allowance or from fees, or out of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace's own pocket, and the total amount was fixed provisionally as the man's salary.  Here and there were cases where it appeared the clerks were grossly underpaid, and in these cases the salaries were brought up and made a reasonable and decent living wage. The result is, of course, that the cost to the State of these clerks has risen considerably, firstly, because the clerical allowance formerly paid by the State was not sufficient to pay the salaries actually paid by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace, and, secondly, because the salaries so paid were sometimes so inadequate that we obtained the consent of the Minister for Finance for their increase. As against this increase we have benefited in most counties by the reduction in the salary of the head of the office and by the surrender to the Exchequer of the fees formerly retained by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State under the old regime of the entire office system of the County Court was about £63,000, a figure somewhat in excess of what is now being asked for, and it must be remembered, in this connection, that the present Circuit Court has taken over a considerable amount of business formerly transacted in the High Court, and that the item of £3,270 for stenography, to use a most horrible, modern word which I loathe, is an entirely new charge not incurred under the former system. The only other very large figure in the Estimate is that at A.3 on page 132.  Summons-servers are paid a retaining fee of £20 a year, and there are necessarily a great many of them &mdash;about 500.  In the same item Deputies will observe that court messengers are mentioned.  Most court messengers are the private employees of the under-sheriff, and draw no salary from the State, but there are two classes of court messengers who do receive salaries from the State. When a court messenger happens to be also a summons-server he is paid <Col N="957" /> an additional retaining fee of £20. These cases are comparatively few (20 altogether) and the arrangement is merely a continuation of one which was in operation under the old regime; and, secondly, in three counties where the under-sheriff has died or retired, and where in consequence the county registrar is now responsible for the execution of court orders, we are now employing and paying out of State funds whole-time court messengers. The counties so affected are Waterford, Wexford and Offaly.  The rate of pay is £3 a week (without &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;).  We anticipate an income of £750 in this connection.  In sub-head F. we anticipate an income of £11,500 by the surrender of fees paid to County Registrars in connection with the preparation and revision of Jurors' Lists and the register of voters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention again to the unsatisfactory arrangements for the holding of Circuit Courts in Cork County. This matter was before the House previously, and it would probably have been the subject of investigation if the Rules of the Circuit Court had been adopted.  Owing, however, to what happened the matter is still in abeyance.  I would like to have the Minister's assurance that he is prepared, when a suitable opportunity arises, to remedy the state of affairs that exists there.  The Circuit Court in Cork is generally held in the city, with the exception of courts occasionally held in Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry.  In Bandon the building in which the old County Court sat has been reconstructed and is in every way suitable for a Circuit Court.  It is not merely on the question of accommodation that this matter arises but owing to the hardships which exist, because of the failure of the authorities to provide courts there.  Attention has been called time and again to the hardships inflicted on jurors by having to travel to Cork City.  That fact was demonstrated, I think, to the satisfaction of the judge who sat some time ago.  It is certainly a hardship <Col N="958" /> that men who are asked to act as jurors have to go to Cork City which in some cases is 48 miles distance, while a suitable building for a Circuit Court is available in the district. The Minister has stated previously, and he will probably again say that the Circuit Courts are responsible for a largely increased jurisdiction as compared with the old County Courts and that they can hardly be compared with them.  The failure to provide suitable arrangements in this portion of the county and also in East Cork is a hardship on the people concerned.  I raise the matter again in the hope that the Minister will give some indication regarding his policy in this matter, or are we to assume that the whole matter may be regarded as closed and that the wishes of the people have been entirely disregarded by the Minister responsible?</P>

      <P>I would also draw attention to the conditions existing in Mayo.  People have to travel from Ballinlough to Castlebar to attend courts which were previously held in Claremorris and Ballinrobe. I hope that the Minister will arrange to have courts held in these districts again.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say how far the congestion, about which we had to complain some years ago in Dublin, in the Circuit Court business has been cleared off, and whether all arrears have been dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with Deputy Good's point first.  I may say that there was a considerable amount of arrears of business in Dublin, but there are two, and occasionally three, judges engaged in clearing off the business.  At present there are three judges working, and though the business is not cleared off it is being considerably reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would have to put a question <Col N="959" /> to me upon that matter, because that is really a question as to whether it would be necessary to appoint more judges.  My own view is that the three judges who are now working will be able to clear off the remaining business.  One of the assistant Circuit Judges, who is unattached, was, unfortunately, ill and a deputy had to be appointed.  In regard to what Deputy Nally said about Mayo, and Deputy Murphy about Cork, I should point out that that is not a matter under my control.  The question of deciding the places where sittings of the Circuit Court are to take place is settled by the Rule-making Committee.  It is no use asking what my policy on the matter is, as my policy does not affect the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly think so in this matter.  What the Deputy is doing is suggesting that the Rule-making Committee should fix the places for the sittings of the Circuit Court.  The Deputy and Deputy Nally stated that the Rule-making Committee had acted unwisely in not allocating more sittings to certain districts.  The Rule-making Committee do not come under this Vote.  I do not appoint the sittings of the Circuit Court or arrange where they are to take place. As I say, it is the Rule-making Committee that decides where in each county the Circuit Judge shall sit.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy is now on a different line of country.  The Deputy apparently has criminal cases in his mind. These are sent on for trial by a District <Col N="960" /> Justice and, if sent to a Circuit Court, will be tried there, except on the application of the Attorney-General or on the application of the prisoner they are sent to the Criminal Court.</P>

      <P>The Committee prepared, and went to an enormous amount of trouble in preparing, a set of rules which I thought were very good, but the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad did not agree.  The rules were laid on the Table of the House and it was contended that they were too elaborate and should be withdrawn. They were withdrawn.  I have asked the Rule-making Committee to draft another set of rules and they are doing so.  When these rules have been drafted they will in due course be laid on the Tables of both Houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no change practically in the Vote in this Office.  There is a slight reduction in the Estimate.  The work of the office since 1922 has been almost altogether confined to the examination of papers salved from the wreckage of the office after the burning and explosion in 1922 and the reception and filing away, temporarily, of records which, being out of current use, are being got rid of by the various public Departments. It is important to have a clear view of the actual physical conditions at present in this office.  There are three physical structures concerned, namely: (1) the Bermingham Tower in Dublin Castle; (2) The Record Office Treasury, and (3) The Record Office itself.  The Bermingham Tower in Dublin Castle remains intact.  Its contents have not been in the slightest bit destroyed but the documents <Col N="962" /> which it contains are, for the greater part, modern and not very interesting.  The only documents which are interesting are those connected with the 1798 Rebellion. They were kept there and not transferred to the Public Record Office because they showed certain secret matters which the British Government did not want to have disclosed. There were lists of secret service agents and persons of that kind, persons thought to be on the side of the rising but who, it transpired, were not on that side, and their names were not disclosed.  These are the only papers which are in any way interesting.</P>
    <P>The Record Office consists of two buildings, one being the Treasury in which all the valuable documents, and some of them were of great historical interest indeed, were kept. Of course some of them were absolutely irreplaceable.  There were especially on the floor some very interesting &ldquo;show documents,&rdquo; such as the original letters of Owen Roe O'Neill and Cromwell.  There was an outer room, and a few things which were not very valuable were kept there.  A few of the valuable documents out of the Treasury were in actual use at that time and had been placed in the outer office.  They happened to escape destruction, but a great number of deeds and other things which were in the cellars were burned.  After the explosion took place, a considerable number of documents were blown up and fragments of a few of them were given back, some of them from places very far away from the Courts, but nothing like as many as were expected.</P>

      <P>The new Manuscripts Commission are really looking after that matter.  They have made a general appeal to <Col N="963" /> everybody to furnish copies or originals of everything that might be of historical interest.  The matter is being gone into by that Commission. They have not actually reached the Record Office yet.  The Record Office is now engaged in filing documents, and the Manuscripts Commission are looking after all the matters to which Deputy Fahy refers.  The Minister for Education recently gave an answer to a question&mdash;I think it was from the Deputy himself&mdash;showing the measure of response, which in some respects was unsatisfactory.  Some solicitors, however, gave a very considerable amount of help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross Vote for the Department of Agriculture is £559,884, and the net as shown on the Estimate is £408,474.  This net figure is obtained by taking the amount of the appropriations-in-aid&mdash;namely, £151,410 from the gross figure of £559,884.  These appropriations-in-aid include receipts from rents, sale of agricultural produce, students' fees, repayment of loans and fees paid under various Acts, such as the Dairy Produce Act.  They also include grants amounting to £58,650 from the Local Taxation Account, the Church Temporalities Fund and Estate Duties.  This figure of £58,650 should be added to the net figure of £408,000 odd to get the correct figure.  That would make the net total for the Department £467,124. That is the figure Deputies must take into account in order to get a correct view of expenditure.  A general idea as to how this amount is spent may be obtained by grouping particular sub-heads and giving <Col N="965" /> round figures which are approximately accurate.  Sub-heads A, B, C and D may be grouped together under the heading of expenses of headquarters' staff.  B is for travelling expenses, C for incidental expenses, and D for telegram and telephone expenses.  The important sub-head is sub-head A.</P>
    <P>The Vote under these sub-heads amounts to £124,397 and represents almost entirely the salaries and travelling expenses of the headquarters' staff. The headquarters' staff includes not only the administrative, but the general inspectorate and technical staff of the Department, with such incidental expenses as are not clearly attributable to particular headings of the Department's work.  So that the cost of the headquarters' staff, which includes not only administrative staff, but the general inspectorate and technical staff, is £124,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads E (1), E (2), E (3), E (4), F (2), F (3), F (4), F (5), F (6), K (2), L, M (1), M (2), M (3) may be grouped under the heading of educational services. They cost £114,329 gross and about £110,779 net.  We should add to these, however, sub-head F (1), being the six Agricultural Institutes of the Department, costing £15,000 net.  If you add these together you will get a total for education of approximately £125,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads H (1) and H (2), amounting to £79,785, may be grouped together as grants to County Committees of Agriculture for their educational, livestock and other schemes.  These sums are paid as grants into a fund called the Joint Fund, which includes not only these grants, but the amount raised by rate by the county councils for agricultural purposes.  In 1928-29 the contribution from rates amounted to about £49,500.  This year it will be about £47,000, as against the amount provided by the Department of £79,785.  This was the amount provided by taxation.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads G (1), Improvement of <Col N="966" /> Flax Growing; G (2), Improvement of Milk Production; G (3), Improvement of Live Stock; I, Special Agricultural Schemes in Congested Districts; K (1), Agricultural Societies and Shows, and M (4), Loans for Agricultural Purposes, amounting in all to £120,113 gross, or £78,213 net, may be regarded as in respect of work done directly by the Department analogous to that administered by the Department through the County Committees of Agriculture. As will be seen from an examination of the sub-heads, this money is spent mainly on the improvement of live stock and live stock products, by giving extra premiums for bulls and boars; by leasing bulls and stock pigs; by selling bulls, pigs and horses at reduced prices for stock purposes; by paying a proportion of the expenses of the cow-testing associations, and by lending money for the purchase of stock animals and agricultural implements.  The work done by the County Committees of Agriculture in connection with live stock is on similar lines.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (5)&mdash;Loans to Co-operative Creamery Societies.  This amounts to £4,000, and is intended to meet outstanding claims in respect of loans for the building of creameries in districts in which creameries have not hitherto existed. This scheme is now wound up save for outstanding commitments, and further applications can be dealt with by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (6)&mdash;Purchase of Creameries, £35,000.  This is intended to finance the purchase of additional proprietary creameries and to conclude the purchase of the Condensed Milk Company's properties, some details of which have not yet been finally cleared up. In addition to that company's creameries, thirty-six additional creameries have been purchased. The total number of creameries purchased to date is 150.  If you deduct that figure of thirty-six, which is the number of creameries that do not belong to the Condensed Milk Company, you will get the number purchased from the Condensed Milk <Col N="967" /> Company&mdash;that is to say, 114 creameries.  Of the 150, sixty-one have been closed as redundant; forty have been transferred as operative premises to co-operative societies, and forty-nine, temporarily retained, are being worked in six groups.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads N (1), N (2), N (3), N (4), O (1), O (2), O (3), O (4), O (5), O (6) may be grouped together under the general heading of &ldquo;Control.&rdquo; They deal with the Diseases of Animals Acts, Horse Breeding Act, 1918, Weeds and Seeds Acts, Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Acts, Destructive Insects and Pests Act, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and finally the three new Acts relating to agriculture, viz., the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, the Dairy Produce Act, and the Live Stock Breeding Act.  The cost of these controlled services is £50,554 gross, or about £30,354 net.  Of this £30,354, the three new Acts cost £26,918 gross, or £7,918 net.  The largest deficit is in connection with the Dairy Produce Act.  That is to say, that the net cost of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, the Dairy Produce Act, and the Live Stock Breeding Act is, roughly speaking, £8,000. These three Acts control the production of butter, eggs and milk, and the net cost to the State of these three Acts is about £8,000.  I do not think I need pay them any testimonials at this stage.  I suggest that they are well worth the money when you compare that with the amount spent in other services from which you do not get anything like similar results.</P>
    <P>Summing up the cost of these various services administered by the Department they are approximately: headquarters' staff £124,000; direct educational services £126,000; County Committee Schemes and Supplementary Schemes&mdash;that is to say, schemes that are carried out directly by the County Committees of Agriculture or analagous schemes which we ourselves carry out in connection with live stock, £158,000; buildings and purchase of creameries £39,000; control <Col N="968" /> services&mdash;Veterinary Acts; Live Stock Breeding Act; Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act; Dairy Produce Act; Weeds and Seeds Act; Destructive Insects and Pests Act, etc., £30,000, making a total of, roughly, £467,000.</P>
    <P>These groupings are to some extent arbitrary.  For instance the headquarters' staff includes not only clerical but technical officers and in the latter category are included technical officers who spent most of their time in the country.  Under the heading of general and technical outdoor staff there are a number who spend most if not all of their time in the country and these alone cost about £42,000.  Again it is extremely difficult to draw a clear distinction between educational and other schemes. The cost of direct educational schemes administered by the Department is set out as £126,000 and work of the County Committee of Agriculture and schemes of a similar nature, which cost approximately £158,000 is under a separate heading.  These County Committee and Supplementary Schemes are, to a considerable extent, concerned with live stock and live stock products, but they are, also, to some extent, educational. They include part of the cost of instructors of the County Committees of Agriculture and the whole cost of the inspectors and overseers of the Department.  The duties of these officers are not only to administer the live stock schemes but also to carry out the experimental work in connection with the cultivation of potatoes, flax and crops of all other kinds in addition to conducting manurial experiments, feeding experiments, winter agricultural class, and to act as advisers of any and every farmer in their district who wished to requisition their services.</P>
    <P>Again the agricultural institutes are grouped as educational.  These institutes are to a very large extent educational, but in addition the live stock bred on the farm attached are used to supplement the live stock schemes which are provided for under a separate sub-head.  Then again it might be said that the <Col N="969" /> Botanic Gardens or the contribution to the I.A.O.S. should not be grouped under the heading educational and that the services which are paid for out of these sub-heads could be more properly grouped with some other services or as separate services.  This is a matter of opinion.  My concern is, in the first instance, to try and analyse expenditure in a general way and under convenient and easily remembered headings.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture is staffed as follows: there are roughly 240 administrative officers, 260 technical officers, including agricultural overseers, assistant overseers, flax instructors, cow-testing instructors, and potato demonstrators, about 260 wage-earners employed in connection with the various institutes at the ports, etc., making a total of 760. In addition there are 152 officers employed by Committees of Agriculture and, also, certain temporary men employed for short periods each year in connection with the operation of Acts such as the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Weeds and Seeds Act, etc.  Of the 152 County Committee officers about 29 are paid in whole by the Department and the remainder are paid partly out of a joint fund composed of about £80,000 paid out of taxation and about £40,000 paid out of rates.</P>
    <P>Educational schemes cost approximately £126,000.  Education for the farmer consists in (1) primary education, (2) technical education, (3) university agricultural education. Opinions differ as to whether agriculture should be taught in the primary schools.  It is obvious that books in a rural primary school should have a rural bias, but the main point is to see that the primary school fulfills its proper function, that is, that it teaches the pupil how to read, write and calculate.  If the primary school does all this it has done all that could be expected of it. Technical agricultural education is provided by the Department through its various institutions and schemes. University agricultural education is provided in the Universities of Cork and Dublin.  Of the sum of £125,870 <Col N="970" /> mentioned as the estimated cost of educational services £67,620 is the cost of the former or technical education and £58,250 of the latter&mdash; that is to say, of university education.</P>
    <P>Excluding provision for University education our agricultural educational schemes consist (1) in the education of boys and girls at the Department's institutes and other colleges financed out of the Department's vote; (2) the educational and advisory work done by the instructors and overseers of the Department, of which there are about 180; (3) winter classes conducted by the Agricultural Instructors, and (4) the publication and distribution of Departmental leaflets, of which about 100 are in circulation, which are revised, added to and reissued as found necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to University education, as stated last year, it was estimated that £7,250 would be required for capital expenditure in connection with the Faculty of Agriculture at University College, Dublin.  Of this amount £6,300 was paid to the college by the 31st March last.  The cost of building the extension to the Albert College to contain the advanced laboratories with the fitting up of the laboratories, accounted for half that amount; £1,120 was spent on the plant-breeding and Animal Nutrition Department; £730 on the Plant Pathology and Zoology Laboratories, and the balance on the heating, plumbing and lighting installations at the Albert College, and on farm structures a sum of £930 is still available for capital expenditure, and it is estimated that farm structures will absorb about this amount.</P>
    <P>The annual expenditure for Dublin came to £18,200 in 1928-29, but as certain posts in the faculty have yet to be filled it is expected that the expenditure for the current year will amount to £21,000, and this figure has accordingly been inserted in the Department's Estimates for 1929-30.  The original capital grant for University College, Cork, was estimated at £67,000, but it has been <Col N="971" /> found that the Dairy Institute and Creamery will cost far more than was expected, and it will be necessary to provide an extra sum of £15,000 for these buildings.  These buildings could be put up at the original figure, but it was pointed out by University College, Cork, that it was only right that the building which was to be built in the College grounds should be in conformity with the architecture of the rest of the College&mdash;a point of view which I personally agreed to and the Minister for Finance agreed to. University College, Cork, is one of the finest buildings of its kind in the country, and we considered it to be false economy to ask them to put up a cement building in a very fine University like that and in the College grounds, and we have provided £15,000 extra for that to make certain that the new buildings put up in the grounds will be worthy of the architecture of the old ones.  The total of the advances from the capital grant made by the Department to University College at the close of the last financial year came to £31,290.  Close on £10,000 is spent on the acquisition of land and the purchase of live stock and farm equipment.  Building operations accounted for the balance of the amount advanced.  The capital provision in this year's Estimate is £26,000, and £10,000 of that amount has already been paid to University College to meet expenditure on the machinery and fittings for the creamery which is now nearing completion. The annual expenditure for 1928-29 came to £6,450.  This fell short of the Estimate by £1,600 owing to the delay experienced in the building of the creamery and the fact that the staff estimated for were not therefore required.  The sum of £10,000 has been provided in this year's Estimate to meet the annual expenses of the Dairy Science Faculty, and knowing University College, Cork, I have confidence that they will be looking for that amount.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Live Stock <Col N="972" /> Schemes, those are administered either through the County Committees of Agriculture or directly by the Department.  The following figures which show the trend of our policy for the last four or five years are rather interesting.  There appears in the Estimates for this year the sum of £35,100 for these schemes.  I have gone through the various sub-heads showing the grants to the County Committees of Agriculture, sub-heads for special schemes for the congested districts, and sub-heads I mentioned in connection with milk production and made the following calculations; in the Estimates this year a sum of £35,100 is provided for live stock schemes as against £35,250 in 1928 and £33,590 in 1927.  If I went back to 1924 or 1923 when money was far less valuable I think it could be shown that the amount provided in the Estimates this year is something like 30 or 40 per cent. more than was provided in 1924.  These schemes consist in ordinary premiums issued out of the joint fund to the County Committees of Agriculture, special premiums provided by the Department and reduced and special terms given directly by the Department for bulls, boars, stallions, etc.</P>
    <P>There is provision this year for 1,559 ordinary premiums for bulls through the County Committees of Agriculture as against 1,480 in 1928; 1,325 in 1927, 1,190 in 1926 and I should say about 700 in 1925 and about 500 in 1924.  So that we have more than double the number of high class stock animals in the country and in addition there is provision for 418 special premiums as against 400 in 1928, 300 for 1927 and about 400 for 1926.</P>
    <P>With regard to boars, there is provision for 894 ordinary premium boars for this year, as against 840 for 1928, 830 for 1927, 509 for 1926, and 480 in 1925.  While I have not the figures for 1924, I believe the number is very much less than 480. There are 112 special premiums provided this year by the Department and 218 provided by the bacon curers.  There will be 1,224 premium boars in the Free State this <Col N="973" /> year.  There is an approximate total of about 2,400 boars in the Free State, and under this scheme more than half will be premium animals, practically all large White Yorks; 80 per cent. of the balance will be by premium boars.  The position with regard to pigs in this country is that practically all the pigs are large White Yorks, admittedly now the best breed.  They are all practically uniform.  Practically all the stock animals standing in the country are pedigree animals chosen for their configuration, substance, and so on.  So far as the balance is concerned, at least 80 per cent. of the animals have three or four crosses of first-class pedigree stock. The State has done as much as it could do in that regard, and it is up to the farmers themselves to do the rest.</P>
    <P>With regard to rams, our practice is that first-class mountain rams are placed on specially reduced terms in counties like Donegal, Kerry and Mayo, and we find that practice very successful.  I think there is no doubt that there is an improvement in sheep in places like Connemara, Donegal, Mayo or Kerry, to the extent of something like 7/- or 8/- a lamb.  That improvement would amount to four times what we are promised as a result of going in for an extensive policy of wheat growing.  The whole scheme in connection with sheep did not cost us more than £10,000 or £15,000 a year.</P>
    <P>In addition to these schemes, there is provision under Sub-head G (2) for £2,500 for dairy bulls, and under Sub-head (3) (d) £2,000 for stock bulls other than dairy bulls.  This provision is for high-class animals costing from £800 to £1,000 each. Under this heading two years ago, very much to the disgust of certain people, we actually paid something like £1,100 or £1,200 for Scotch bulls in the Perth sales.  We brought home one or two bulls, and since then the progeny of these bulls have been winning practically everything in the Dublin Shows.  I am quite satisfied that, so far as the farmer is concerned, those purchases were <Col N="974" /> very satisfactory, and the prizes won by the progeny of those bulls represent anything up to 200 per cent. interest on what was expended on the purchase.  There are groups of small farmers or cow-testing associations, and they cannot afford to purchase a bull up to the standard. Out of these funds, under sub-head G (3), first-class bulls, equal to those bought by the best breeders, are purchased and leased to groups of small farmers or sold at reduced prices to cow-testing associations. In the case of a leased bull, the lessee pays a reasonable leasing fee based on the cost of the bull, and the animals are changed round every three years.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is provision amounting to £2,000 to cover loss on the resale of stallions under sub-head G. 3 (a). Pedigree stallions are bought from £200 to £500 and sold from £70 to £200.  Sub-head M. (4) amounts to £39,900, of which amount £15,250 is used to make advances in connection with livestock schemes; that is, to make loans especially in congested districts.  We find it necessary to give also reduced prices and we have £35,000, of which £16,000 is used for that purpose.  I have said already that special premium and special term animals are located mainly in the congested districts, and it is found necessary, in addition to giving a premium or selling an animal at a reduced price, to give a loan to the intending purchaser in order to enable him to pay the reduced price.  In this way the livestock in a congested district are kept up to the standard of the rest of the country.  The operation of these schemes consists in providing at one end the very best stock animals coupled with the operation of the licensing of bulls at the other end, and this ought to place our live stock in an unassailable position.  We have the Live Stock Breeding Act, and there are inspections twice a year.  These are carried out by farmers who are prominent breeders themselves and they are admittedly good judges of various types of live stock.</P>
    <P>No stock animal can be used in <Col N="975" /> this country unless he gets a licence. Our standard is high.  We have been steadily rejecting about 40 to 50 per cent. of the bulls presented.  Subjecting the rejected animals to castration has resulted in a tremendous advantage to live stock.  If you consider that for the last five years a very large number of stock animals, amounting to nearly half the number bred, have been castrated and are not being used in the country, and that a selection of about half the animals bred in the country has been made by the Department for breeding purposes, it will be seen that these are the very best animals that we can find.  If we will not license any stock animal, any bull not up to a high standard, it is clear that our standard is fairly high. That is more obvious when you learn that we have on the average rejected about 50 per cent. of the animals shown.  That has been going on for the last five years.  On the other hand, we have been getting the very best blood into the country. We have been paying big prices for the very best blood in Scotland, for beef and so on, and we have been paying the very best prices for dairy bulls and so on.  We are getting into all the herds the very best animals we can get.  Deputies should consider, in addition, that all that has cost the paltry sum of something like £30,000 or £40,000 a year.  It is not a paltry sum in one sense, but it is paltry when you compare it with the cost of other services which are not nearly so remunerative even though they may be absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>If that policy goes on for a certain time, I think we ought to aim at having this country in much the same position as Jersey and the Channel Islands, where practically every animal is pedigree.  We have practically reached that position with regard to our Shorthorns. Luckily, the problem is comparatively simple.  We had only three breeds of cattle, Shorthorns, Angus, and Herefords.  We will leave out the Kerry breeds, which are valuable, but are confined to a certain <Col N="976" /> area.  The others are admittedly the three best breeds.  In other countries, like England, they have about 30 breeds, and every breed has its partisan.  The amount of energy that people put into politics in this country is in England put into enthusiasm over different breeds of cattle.  That may be an advantage or a disadvantage, but it is a fact. The fact is that we have only three breeds, and the farmers were sensible enough to see the advantage of those breeds long before the English farmers.  Twenty years ago the officers of the Department of Agriculture here were sensible enough to see that the coming breed in regard to pigs was large White Yorks, and they bought up the very best animals of that type, because they were then cheap in England and people over there were paying vast sums for other breeds which I will not name because to do so might arouse antagonism; they are breeds now at a discount.  The result is that as regards pigs we have only one breed.  We have really a great chance in this country if we continue the policy we are carrying out, and that is the policy of administering the Live Stock Breeding Act ruthlessly and, on the other hand, getting into the country the very best animals, and putting them at the head of our herds.  We will then put our cattle, sheep and pigs in an absolutely unassailable position.</P>
    <P>If you have good first-class live stock you will have more tillage.  If you have really good beef animals it pays to feed them.  If you have a good cow giving a plentiful supply of milk it pays to feed her.  If you want to increase tillage in this country the way to go about it is to improve your live stock.  If you improve live stock and if the farmer is making more money out of his live stock, if his animals are easily fed and are giving good results from moderate feeding, he will concentrate on feeding them, and consequently he will increase his tillage. If you want to get back to ranching pure and simple, if you want to get out of tillage, if you want to prove to the farmer that the only way he <Col N="977" /> has to avoid loss is to get out of tillage, the thing to do is to neglect the live stock of the country.  If you want to develop more intensive agriculture the thing to do is to develop the live stock of the country, to get better and better breeds, and to see that the animals bred at home are improving every year.</P>
    <P>The very same thing applies to dairying.  If you want to encourage the creamery industry and if you want to encourage winter dairying you must have cows with high milking yields.  For that purpose you must choose your stock animals, concentrate and spend your money on livestock, on the very best bulls and on the development and encouragement of cow-testing associations. The farmer of the country who is not a fool and who knows the value of money is thinking of all these problems not as political problems, but as economic problems which he must solve or go bankrupt. If he has better stock he is getting more milk, and if his cows are better, if he sees that his cows are better and that he is keeping on improving year by year he will begin to see that it is to his advantage to get a few of his cows calving in the autumn.</P>
    <P>When they are heavy milkers, even though they calve in the Autumn, they will milk until the summer and in that way and as a result of that the farmer will go in for more tillage. He will find it necessary to provide food for his cows during the winter.  For that purpose, he will have to till more.  He will have the advantage of more tillage and he will be giving more employment and more money will be put in circulation.  In that way, we can get an increase in tillage.  There is no question about it.  Anybody who knows the conditions of the farmers in the country and anybody who looks around will see that the man who is tilling most is the man who has the best stock and he is the man who is giving most attention to his stock.  He is giving more attention to his breeding animals.  When we think of an agricultural policy we must base it on that farmer.  We must encourage him and try and induce other <Col N="978" /> farmers in the country to do exactly the same thing.  The way to increase tillage is to get away from grazing, to get back to mixed farming and to spend more and more money on your livestock, sheep, cattle and pigs.  When I speak of cattle I mean not only beef breeds but dairy cattle as well.</P>
    <P>Luckily, the indications are that the policy which we have been carrying out for the last four or five years is the right one.  We ought not to claim too much credit for that, because nobody can absolutely, accurately forecast the future.  You can only make a guess at it and take into account all the relevant circumstances. It might very well be that it would have paid the Argentine, for reasons which lie within its own borders and some other reasons that arise out of circumstances such as those in other countries like Canada and so on, to go in more for livestock and less for the growing of wheat and maize.  It might be for good and sufficient reasons Canada would have decided to go in for livestock, for butter and bacon, and less for the growing of corn.  But luckily the exact opposite has happened.</P>
    <P>It was the opinion of the Department, and my opinion as well, that we could always compete in these countries with Canada and the Argentine in live stock and in the production of live stock products. That was my opinion always, and it was the opinion of most people who thought over it, that gradually the Argentine would have to do less and less in the production of beef and that Canada would have to limit its production of beef, too, and be forced by economic circumstances to go in for the particular sort of economy that was most suitable to its own land and climate.  As I say, luckily our opinion has been proved to be more or less correct.  Canadian cattle are out of the market.  They can send their cattle over to England again and they can go on sending them, but they cannot compete with ours.  They never can compete with ours.  If we continue the improvement <Col N="979" /> which is already manifest in our butter trade we need not fear competition with Canadian butter. We need have no fear of competition with Canada in that direction, but we have to fear Danish competition. If we continue our improvement in live stock, we need not fear any competition from the Argentine.</P>
    <P>There has been a shrinkage of 25 per cent. in the last two years in the imports of Argentine beef and that shrinkage is due to permanent causes.  It means that the Argentine farmers, not the Parliament in the Argentine or the politicians in the Argentine, but the farmers there have come to the conclusion that beef is not paying them as well as corn.  They were a long time coming to that conclusion, but they have come to it.  They will be just as long changing their minds. The farmers there are, in fact, going in more and more for the production of maize and wheat and corn generally and they are leaving the trade in live stock products more and more to us.  We ought to take full advantage of it.  We ought to take advantage of that fully.  So far as live stock products are concerned, those people are on the run and we ought to keep them on the run.  We can do that by continuing the policy that we are carrying out.  In that way, we can keep them on the run.</P>
    <P>But in any case, it will not matter very much what we do because, as I have often tried to say, agriculture is very much above politics.  It does not matter very much here what we do.  If the State here takes up the attitude which is opposed to the general line of the farmers themselves and to the general line which the farmers themselves are taking, the State will fail.  The farmers will not co-operate.  And as we are all looking for votes we will all change our minds later on and we will begin to do what the farmers want us to do.  The best we can do is to get the farmer to do just what he is doing a little better and to do more of it.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies do not see the point of doing that for good economic reasons and because it is the <Col N="980" /> best policy, they will be the sufferers. You will not get the farmer to change his whole economy.  You will never get him to do that.  He will simply be annoyed with you.  It will mean that he will come to see that you do not know your own business, and that will happen no matter what his political views may be.  Whether he is educated or uneducated does not matter in this connection.  He and his father have been for a long time thinking of their own problems, and whilst he may not be the last thing in efficiency, nevertheless in a vague, casual sort of way he has, as the result of hard experience evolved, in general, the sort of economy on his own farm&mdash;the economy that suits his farm best, and is the sort of economy that pays best.</P>
    <P>The business of this State is to accept that and to help him to develop that.  Above all, the business of the State is to tell him: &ldquo;We can do very little for you.  We are spending £600,000 a year on you. We could spend £1,200,000 a year on you&mdash;just twice as much as we are spending&mdash;and it would be no importance whatever as compared with the improvement that would result from a little extra work and a little extra knowledge on the part of the farmers themselves.&rdquo;  That is quite true&mdash;it would be no importance whatever.  We have got to get on this question of agriculture&mdash; I mean we politicians have got to get on it, the inferiority complex. We ought to realise that the farmer is very much more important than we are; that what any farmer does for himself is very much more important than anything we can do for him.  We should look up to him when he makes a suggestion and we should carry it out and we should not be trying to force all sorts of half-baked policies on him.  We should not be trying to force on the reluctant small farmers of the country an ill-thought out unconsidered, profitless policy which will look well on paper, but which has no other merit or advantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;<Col N="981" /> As we have had some discussion here recently on the question of tillage and the growing of wheat I think it will hardly be necessary to go into that for the present, especially as I can put up a good argument as to why this Estimate should be referred back apart from the growing of wheat altogether. In any case I expect that we will be coming back to tillage at a later date, as there are motions down dealing with it.  The Minister, when introducing his Estimate, is willing to stake the name of his Department on his live stock policy and his live stock products.</P>

Listening to the speeches made by members opposite, both inside and outside this House, one would imagine that we had put every country on the run from the British market as far as butter, bacon, eggs and other live stock products were concerned, whereas, as a matter of fact, such is not the case at all.  The Minister said here that the three Acts which were introduced&mdash;those are the three Acts dealing with eggs, butter and live-stock&mdash;are costing this country something like £37,000.</P>

He claimed that we were getting bigger and better results from the expenditure of that sum than we would get from the sum which it would cost us to grow wheat.  We will deal with the wheat question another time. Suppose we take eggs, because they were the first to be dealt with.  It is about five years ago since the Act dealing with them was introduced. If we examine the big importers of <Col N="982" /> eggs into the British Market we will find that the biggest are Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and the Irish Free State.  Those are the big five, and for the year 1928 the Irish Free State got the lowest price of any of those countries.  There are other countries sending eggs into England, and they send them in the most hopeless state, in barrels and in other ways.  In any case, comparing this with other countries, we find that for the year 1928 the price for all other countries was 13/5 and the prices for the Free State 12/7.</P>

      <P>I thought it would be accepted here anyhow.  I know a person might very well say to me that the reason for this is that the Free State exports big quantities of eggs when eggs are cheap, and Denmark and other countries export bigger quantities when eggs are dear.  That might account for it.  I thought that I would go a little further and get the figures from January to April of this year which would include the dearest period. Again I find that the price of eggs <Col N="983" /> for 1928 from all other countries is 14/9 and the price of eggs from the Free State 13/10.  Even taking the month of April alone the price of eggs from all other countries is 11/2 and from the Free State 10/4.</P>

      <P>I will come to some of the Minister's statistics later on.  I want to give other statistics first. Let us go back to 1927 and 1926 and if we found we were even improving on 1927 and 1926 there would be some cause for satisfaction.  Even that is not the case.  I find if you work out the percentage price of Free State eggs as compared with the average price of eggs in the British market in 1927 they were 95.9 and in 1928 they were 96.9.  We were turning the corner there.  In 1929 they were 92.5.  We went back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it is not a good Act, but there is something else wrong if the Act is right.  The next thing the Dáil dealt with was butter.  In butter, there is certainly a big improvement since the Act was introduced.  Our biggest competitors in the British market in butter are those same countries, Denmark, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands.  Even in butter I find, for the years 1926, 1927 and 1928, that we have not reached as good an average price throughout any of those years as <Col N="984" /> any of those other countries have got in the British market.  As a matter of fact again, if we take the price realised for butter in the British market by all countries sending butter into it, we find Free State butter is not getting as good a price.  In the year 1928, the average price realised for butter by all countries was £8 10s. 3d. per cwt., and the price realised for butter from the Free State was £8 2s., which was 8/- below the average. Those are, I suppose, two of our principal live stock products.  I do not know whether the legislation which has been introduced here is beneficial or not, but, as I said before, if it is beneficial there is something else wrong and the Department of Agriculture should direct its attention to see what is wrong.</P>
      <P>I do not want anybody to come along and say to me afterwards that I am trying to belittle the products of this country.  I am not.  I am quite certain that the butter that we can produce here is as good as the butter produced by those other countries and that the eggs are as good also.  But there is something wrong in the handling of these commodities from the time they leave the producers here until they reach the consumers in Britain.  Whether it is that something is wrong in transit or that they are not marketed in the right place or at the right time.  I do not know, but I believe that the Department of Agriculture ought to see what is the matter and make things right.  The Minister, I believe, has claimed credit for a big improvement in live stock under the Live Stock Improvement Act.  It is very difficult indeed to say what the improvements are.  I think on a former occasion I quoted similar figures with regard to cattle and pigs.  I believe I quoted figures to show that Irish beef at certain times of the year was not realising as good a price on the London markets as chilled beef from the Argentine. That may not be a general thing on the British markets, but it occurred on certain occasions.</P>

      <P>Because it is a fact.  I would not say it otherwise.  The Minister's aim, as far as I can judge both from his speech to-day and from his pronouncements on other occasions, is to produce a certain type of animal.  I think his ideal is, for the present at any rate, to produce a 1,200 gallon cow.  The most serious thing I think that anybody can suffer from is that sort of monomania.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was trying to convince us on one occasion that milk production was the most profitable thing a farmer could indulge in, he gave us figures that assuming a cow yielding 600 gallons of milk was grazed on two acres and the price realised for the milk was about eightpence per gallon, the <Col N="986" /> receipts from milk would be £20.  He went on to give the cost of feeding that cow.  Even on those figures, which I hold are very favourable for the argument for milk production, the net gain of the farmer worked out at £6 17s. 6d.  The farmer had £6 17s. 6d. out of the two acres of grass.  The sum that could be got out of one acre of grass would be £3 8s. 9d.  Those calculations, which were issued from the Department of Agriculture, are based, first of all, on the 600 gallon cow, and secondly on the price of eightpence per gallon for milk.  We have been told on occasions that the average yield per cow in this country is about 500 gallons.  I think the figure given was 480.  We know also that the average price realised for milk at the creameries is somewhere about sixpence halfpenny per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that you have separated milk.  For every gallon of new milk about eighty per cent. is given back in the way of separated milk.  The whole milk is valued by the creameries, as a rule, at about tenpence per gallon.  I think the figure of eightpence per gallon for the new milk as it is sent to the creameries is putting the price a little bit too high.  The figure of 600 gallons per cow, I have no doubt, is too high for the average cow in the country at the present time.  If we were to make any allowance at all for these optimistic figures we would find if we took the average cow at 500 gallons and the average price at sevenpence halfpenny per gallon that there would be no profit whatsoever to be derived.  The Minister, of course, will claim that this is a thing they are trying to remedy.</P>

      <P>Why do they keep cows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do they do anything? Only yesterday I was talking to a farmer who is about seventy-four years of age.  I asked him what he was doing in particular on his <Col N="987" /> farm for the last couple of years.  He told me he tried everything.  He said he tried pigs one year.  He tried the rearing of calves another year.  He tried to keep more cows another year and he tried several other things.  He did not try tillage, strange to say.  Probably if he did, he would have met with the same result. He said that trying to make anything out of farming at the present time was like trying to pick a Derby winner&mdash;it was only a short time before the Derby was run that he said that to me.  That is why the Minister asks: if so, why do farmers keep cows?  As they say themselves, they might as well lose on cows as on anything else at the present time. When we go into and examine closely the figures submitted to us by the Department of Agriculture on the feeding of cows, the profit to be derived from cows and so on, and work them out they give the answer of £3 8s. 9d. an acre for grass.  We find that they can hardly be relied upon, so that I do not know if we had any method whatever of working out the cost of keeping hens, for instance, whether or not we would get any better results.  I suppose that the Department has the policy there also, as in the case of a twelve hundred gallon cow, of going in for a 300-egg hen, and probably when they reach that figure there will be money to be made on the poultry as there would be money to be made out of the 1,200-gallon cow.  In the meantime. I do not believe that there is a lot of money being made out of hens or cows&mdash;that is eggs and butter&mdash;which have been dealt with in a special way during the last four or five years. Butter and eggs were the first things dealt with.  It is very hard to get figures, as we know from the case that the Minister mentioned when he referred to lambs, but if we could get figures in regard to the export of cattle and of lambs and so on and see how they are paying, I do not know that it would be found that they are meeting with any greater success or that one could see any greater hope for the farmers of the country in <Col N="988" /> those particular lines, than has been attained in the case of butter and eggs.</P>
      <P>There is one striking thing about the figures given for butter, and that is in regard to the countries which are getting the most for butter on the British market.  Denmark, for instance, in the year 1928, got £9 4s 8d., which was by far the highest price realised on the British market. Notwithstanding the fact that Denmark is getting that price for butter she is only sending about 68 per cent. of her total export of butter to the British market.  New Zealand, which was getting £8 7s. as compared to our £8 2s., is only sending 80 per cent. of her total export of butter to the British market, while Finland, which was getting £8 14s. compared to our £8 2s., also has an alternative market for part of her butter export.  Finland sends about 90 per cent. of her export butter to the British market.  What I want to draw attention to is this that these countries that are getting a better price than we are for butter, and that are also getting a better price for their eggs&mdash;they are not getting as good a price for their bacon&mdash;are not sending all their butter to the British market.  Therefore the only conclusion we can come to is, unless, of course, these countries are fools, which is not very likely, that they are getting as good markets elsewhere as the British market.  That leads me to a statement made by the Minister some time ago which I would like very much to endorse.  He made this statement to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 31st October, 1928.  Part of his statement was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>So long as we have practically only one market for both our industrial and our agricultural exports, then we cannot regard our national economy as satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Lower down in the same statement he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the absence of an alternative market we must develop the home market.</P>
      <P>I think that is the sort of sentiment that we would like to hear from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> These particular countries that I have mentioned, although getting the top price for their butter in the British market, are yet evidently doing better, or as well at any rate, in other markets, and I would like if the Minister could possibly see that these other markets were also open to the Free State.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the number of premium bulls in the country. I do not think he gave the exact number of them, though he did give the number of boars.  He mentioned that, at the recent inspections for bulls, 40 or 50 per cent. as a rule were rejected.  It may be necessary to reject certain of those animals in order to improve the live stock of the country, but in certain parts of the country farmers do claim that they have been put to serious inconvenience and, in some cases, have suffered serious loss.  I do not know if that is true.  I think that, in some cases, the Minister was asked to investigate the circumstances to see if that was the truth, but farmers have complained that where certain bulls have been rejected, and where there are no premium bulls within a reasonable distance, that those owners of the bulls are quite free to lend them or keep them as they prefer themselves.  Where certain diseases are prevalent, such as contagious abortion, it is very difficult, in some cases, to get farmers to lend their bulls, with the result that farmers who cannot afford to keep a bull themselves have been put to serious inconvenience, and in some cases, I have been told, have suffered serious loss.  One of these men said to me that the Department was far too particular about the bulls they were passing.  In any case, this man said to me: &ldquo;Any calf at all is better than no calf,&rdquo; which implied to me that his cows were left without any calves for that year.</P>
    <P>On many occasions recently we, from this side of the House as well as Deputies from other parts of the House, have indicated the policy that we would like to see the Department of Agriculture pursue, and therefore it is scarcely necessary for me to go into it again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> The Minister said the real way to increase tillage in this country was to improve the live stock, and, in fact, he gave us to understand that all the things we would like to see happen, certainly that I would like to see happen, in farming would come from the improvement of live stock.  You would, as a consequence, have increased tillage, winter dairying, and in every way things would improve throughout the country, and you would have more employment given, and so on. I do not know if that is the case, but I am afraid it is going to bring the increase in tillage about very slowly, because I think the Minister knows, and other Deputies know, that the number of farmers who are going in for this intensive&mdash;if you like to so put it&mdash;improvement of live stock are very few.  The number of farmers who are going in for pure-bred shorthorns, pure-bred polled Angus, or pure-bred Herefords, are not so many, and if only those people who go in for the pure breed are tempted to go in for tillage in order to feed them well it will not make an appreciable difference in the amount of tillage in the country.</P>
    <P>The ordinary farmers whose live stock are being improved as a result of the Live Stock Act, and as a result of the exertions of the Department of Agriculture, do not, I think, see a very appreciable difference in the cattle they have now as compared with the cattle they had five or six years ago.  It will take 20, 30 or 40 years before there is a big difference in the breed of cattle in the country, because we must consider that farmers usually keep the cows, unless something happens to them, for twelve years, and some of them for fourteen years, so that you are not going to work this miracle quickly of changing the live stock. Certainly you are not going to make such an appreciable difference in the live stock that farmers will be tempted now to till in order to feed the cattle better than they fed them six or seven years ago.  It may be a fact that farmers are feeding cattle better now than they did ten or fifteen years ago, but it is not as a <Col N="991" /> result of an improvement in live stock.  It is, perhaps due to the educational policy of the Department.  I do not know if that has had very much effect on them, but at any rate I think they are feeding cattle better than they were.  Taking it that they are feeding their live stock better, I am afraid it is going to be a very slow process if we are going to wait until the stock are improved so much that the farmers will be induced to go in for increased tillage.  On that account, I am afraid that we are going to wait a long time before we get an appreciable increase in tillage.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that we could get into tillage by that means, but I do not think that would be a satisfactory solution of the question.  The Minister asked me why the farmers keep cows, and if I went into this tillage question again the Minister would ask, why the farmers did not do that?  That is the Minister's reply always, why does not the farmer do such and such a thing?  If anyone on this side of the House were to suggest to the Minister something that the farmers might do, the Minister would ask: Why do not the farmers do it?  The conclusion he comes to on that is that the farmer is a fool because he does not do those things.  That, of course, is not the Minister's real opinion at all, because I have seen where he has on occasions pointed out that the farmers were doing things that were very wrong, that they were doing things they should not be doing, and yet it never occurred to him, I am sure, that the farmers were fools because they were doing those things.  The farmers that had to be dealt with under the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, for instance, were doing a wrong thing in sending their eggs to the market dirty, not graded properly, and not fresh, and so on.  They were doing a wrong thing for themselves, and yet I do not think we could regard them as fools.  I do not think that the Dáil in putting that Bill through thought they were legislating for a nation of fools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The same would apply to other Acts like the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, and the Live Stock Produce Act, 1925.  When these measures were introduced in the interests of the farmer to deal with the big majority who were doing things wrong&mdash;and I daresay it is true that they were doing things wrong and wrong in their own interests&mdash; yet it never occurred to members of the Dáil at that time that they were legislating for a lot of fools.  In a statement made by the Minister here, from which I quoted before, he spoke about land that could grow wheat.  He said: &ldquo;I have seen the land myself and I know that if it were treated properly it would be productive.&rdquo;  The Minister, I am sure, said that without presuming to know more than the big majority of the farmers of the country, and yet I am quite certain that if that statement were to come from a member of our Party the conclusion the Minister would come to on that would be that we thought the farmers were fools.  If I said, &ldquo;I have seen the land myself and I know that if it were treated properly it would produce wheat,&rdquo; that would mean I know that, although the farmers who own the land do not know it.</P>
    <P>I say it does not pay a farmer to keep at present cows with an average of 500 gallons.  I am then asked, &ldquo;why does a farmer keep cows of that class&rdquo;?  I do not know that a question of that kind is a very satisfactory reply to my argument, that the keeping of such cows does not pay the farmer, particularly as I am basing my argument on figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture, who must have had reliable information at their disposal before they issued those figures.  I do not want to go into any of those other Acts which were passed for the benefit of the farmer, and under which the Minister has claimed to have done so much for agriculture, but I say that the figures of our produce on the British market are there for anybody to examine.  We have not yet reached as good a price as those other countries in Europe, although <Col N="993" /> everybody here will admit we have as good an article to sell, and there must be some reason for it.  I do not want to go further into these matters, except to say that the Department are responsible to this country in matters of that kind.  I think they have not dealt with them satisfactorily, and that I am quite justified in asking that this Vote be referred back.  The Department is costing, as the Minister has explained, about £450,000 for this year, and if the country as a whole is not improving under the Department, especially as it is practically altogether an agricultural country, I believe that we are justified in referring this Vote back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission was under discussion the Parliamentary Secretary, in giving figures with regard to arrears of rent, said that the arrears of rent on the 31st March, 1927, were £397,000, and on the 31st March, 1928, they were £424,000.  So that for 1928&mdash;and that is the last return we have got so far&mdash;the position of the farmer with regard to the payment of rent had disimproved to the extent of £27,000. Again, in answer to a question, the same Parliamentary Secretary told me that, during the year 1928, 466 holdings, covering an area of 19,682 acres, were advertised for non-payment of rent, of which the amount due was £31,000.  When we see that the farmers are getting deeper into arrears with their rent, and when we find that the number of holdings advertised for sale by the Land Commission in that year was 466, which is fairly large, considering that the Land Commission do not advertise tically every means they possibly can cally every means they possibly can use to get rent out of the people, and when we take the payment of rates into consideration we get an idea of what the real position is.  About a month ago I got a return from the Wexford County Council of the amount of rates outstanding at the end of the last financial year, which was March, and it was higher this year than it has been for a number <Col N="994" /> of years past.  I do not know how much higher it was, but it was higher, and I believe that the same thing applies to other counties.  If the farmers are getting further into arrears with their rents and further into arrears with their rates, in some cases having to be sold out by the Land Commission, if we find that the farmers are not improving their position, but, on the contrary, are disimproving under the Department of Agriculture, I think it is a very good reason for referring this Vote back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has grouped this money under certain headings.  It is very difficult to find out exactly what is the result of the Department's work in certain directions. We have an idea, of course, of what the work of the headquarters staff is, the cost of which is £124,000.  We have an idea of what the county committees do, and we know that the money that is spent on a somewhat similar service directly by the Department goes almost entirely to the improvement of live stock.  But it is very difficult to know what results or what benefit we are getting for this £125,000 which is spent on educational services.  I do not see that the ordinary farmers are getting very much benefit at all out of this education.  Whether it is that we expect bigger results in the next generation, or in ten or fifteen years' time, I do not know, but at present I do not believe the farmers are getting very much benefit from this money that is spent on education, and I suppose that we may take it for granted that the money is spent in order that the agricultural community may derive some benefit from it, because we know that it is not being spent on any sort of academic education in agriculture; the education is meant to be applied sometime in a practical way.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this particular matter comes under the heading of education, but here is a document, M. 2&mdash;Agricultural Conditions in Saorstát Eireann on 1st May, 1929, that appears to me to be absolutely useless.  Every Deputy gets a copy <Col N="995" /> of it some time after the first of each month.  I never yet could see that it was of the slightest service to anybody. It starts off by telling us the sort of weather we had last month: &ldquo;The bright, dry and generally genial weather with which the whole country was favoured during the month of March continued until the closing days of the month, over the greater part of the country uninterruptedly, and in the other parts broken only occasionally by rainfalls.&rdquo; I do not know what benefit that is to any farmer.  As a matter of fact, that document for the month of March was issued on the 1st May. The farmer gets that on the 1st May, and he reads about the weather he saw on the 1st March.  I do not think that that can be of any benefit to him.  Even though it might be wrong occasionally, if it could forecast the weather for the next month it might be of some benefit to him, because he might then regulate his work.</P>

This document also deals with abortion, and it says: &ldquo;Abortion in dairy cattle still persists in some districts, and the Department are continuing to impress upon stock owners the urgency of adopting the precautions recommended to stamp out the disease.&rdquo;  It does not say what the precautions are.  It gives no indication of what the poor farmer really should do, and it does not even tell him how he may detect the disease.  In a later part I thought I was coming to something valuable. It gives us the prices realised for the previous month.  It would possibly be of some value to the farmer to know how cattle, sheep and pigs <Col N="996" /> were selling in other parts of the country, even in the past month, but what possible use could this information be to any farmer: &ldquo;Calves under six months £2 to £4 10s.&rdquo;? How is the farmer to know whether he is to give the £2 or the £4 10s. or whether &ldquo;calves under six months&rdquo; means calves of one month or five months?  Absolutely no details are given to help the farmer.  Then it says bonhams were 25/- to 50/-. Whether that means that the large White York that the Minister talks about was bringing 50/- and the other unmentionable breeds were bringing only 25/- I do not know. That document is one item in the education branch of the Department of Agriculture on which there is a sum of over £700 spent.  It appears to me to be an absolutely useless document.  I do not think that the other money which is spent on education is spent as uselessly as that. I believe that some of the branches which the Department is developing in the educational line are very useful, but I do say that the Department is not making much of an effort to get the information to the farmers.  It is learning certain things by experiment, and also, I suppose, it is obtaining information that has been gained in other countries, but I do not believe that this information is passed on to the farmers as it should be.  Therefore, the agricultural community are not benefiting as they might benefit from this money that is spent on education.</P>
      <P>As I said when commencing, I do not again want to go into the big question of tillage and wheat, because a motion has been put down dealing with tillage in general and another dealing with wheat, and it would be well to keep a little back for these subjects when they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine from the Minister's statement that he, perhaps, meant us to believe that his policy was an original one, and that it emanated from him.  I do not think that is the case.  It is a policy that has been in existence since the Department of Agriculture started. <Col N="997" /> The Minister has developed it to a certain extent, but nothing more. The policy is simply one of fat production. That is not a new policy either.  At one period, in the history of this country, when England refused to allow our exports to arrive there we are told that our people started to export what is known as salt meat, and that they did a considerable trade with the Colonies.  In those days salt meat was highly appreciated, and industries of importance sprang up, such as the making of barrels.  In that way, we have a tradition for the exportation of fats.  Butter followed that, and we had a period of really prosperous times.  That was followed after the Crimean war, owing to the cheapness of stock here and free trade in England, by a big business in livestock.</P>
      <P>The policy as propounded by the Minister, would seem to be, as far as livestock is concerned, divided between butter and beef, but somehow or other butter and beef production do not seem to agree.  The class of beast that produces butter is not generally a beef producer, and the same thing takes place the other way about.  The Minister told us that he has three breeds of cattle in this country.  That is quite true.  There are a few more breeds but they do not count.  He also said he had one breed of pigs, and his policy in connection with pigs is correct.  I doubt if his policy in the three breeds of cattle is one that is eventually going to be successful.  He has two beef production classes, the Hereford and the Polled Angus, animals which produce beef and nothing more; they are not considered by milk producers, who fall back on the Shorthorn, perhaps as the dual purpose animal, but mainly for milk.  Crookshank who was the originator of Shorthorns did not succeed exactly in getting a dual purpose beast, but he succeeded in developing an ideal beef producer, and the shorthorn is an ideal beef producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be strong on the Aberdeen Angus, so much so that he imported a considerable number of Polled Angus cattle. Some people hold that he was right, <Col N="998" /> and some people hold that he was not.  Certainly the colour is pretty and the cattle do well when well-fed and when well-bred, but for a country like this which has rather poor districts, with a poor class of cow generally in these districts, it is a well-known fact amongst breeders that whatever hopes there are of Shorthorns giving good produce there is very little from the Polled Angus.  As a result anyone with experience of fairs who gives an unbiassed opinion of the class of stock there will know that except he gets a really good class of Polled Angus beast, it is better to leave them alone.  As a result we have had, for the last three or four years, a considerable amount of real rubbish which is valueless.  The Shorthorn and the Hereford do well in this country, and as a proof of that, at the last and the previous Shows in Dublin the dominant demand was clearly expressed in favour of Hereford cattle in preference to Polled Angus.  I do not know under what conditions these cattle arrived here from Perth.  I do not know what restrictions or what precautions the Government took, but I know that within the last few years, to a certain extent, tubercular disease has appeared.  It is noteworthy amongst International breeders that, of all countries in the world that breed live stock, England suffers most severely from tubercular disease, with the result that great cattle-raising countries like the Argentine have very strict regulations regarding the importation of bulls.  Even though a bull coming from England or the Dublin Show may have a certificate from four or five veterinary surgeons, it makes no difference.  The animal is detained and kept for a fortnight.  If there is the slightest sign of a rise of temperature it is slaughtered, and whatever meat is not infected is returned to the owner.  I do not know if such precautions are taken here, but I believe that some such steps should be taken, if we are to continue the policy of importing Polled Angus cattle without sufficient examination <Col N="999" /> and without sufficient supervision.</P>
    <P>The Shorthorn is an animal that has stood the test in this country. Shorthorns are dual purposes cattle. They serve as milk producers and as beef producers.  We have as a result three crosses in a great number of cases.  We have the Shorthorn mixed up with the Hereford, and the Hereford and the Shorthorn mixed up with Polled Angus.  If we decide in the future again to become a great butter-producing country, which I believe is the trend of events, and which should be one of our industries, I fear we will have great difficulty in eliminating two strains which are not milk-producing in trying to purify the single strain of the Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us also, when talking about the production of beef, that we might not fear, to any extent, the competition of the Argentine.  He told us that the Argentine has turned out to be a wheat-growing country, and an Indian corn or maize growing country, because it was more profitable.</P>
    <P>It may be interesting to Deputies to know that it was merely by accident that the Argentine went into wheat production.  Perhaps I should not say &ldquo;by accident&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;by design.&rdquo;  It was not for the purpose of the continuation of wheat growing.  They found that in the province of Buenos Aires, which is a completely black-earth province to the extent of nearly three metres in depth, the grass usually grown, called &ldquo;lucern,&rdquo; or as it is sometimes known, &ldquo;alfalfa,&rdquo; would not grow owing to the amount of weeds and other grass that spring up.  They found that in every province of a less rich and sandy nature that lucern grass became permanent.  A German expert came along and advised them that the only way to get lucern or alfalfa to grow in Buenos Aires was to exhaust the land, and one of the best methods of doing that was a continuous cropping of wheat.  They set contracts for four years for the purpose of reducing the land for the sowing of lucern or alfalfa grass.  The land there, after <Col N="1000" /> cattle have grazed it for a number of years, gets so rich it produces other plants which destroy vegetation for feeding cattle, and it is followed up by tillage again.  It is not probable, when they have the land reduced, that they will continue to grow wheat.  They will not.  They have no manure and they will be compelled to turn to cattle production.  Competition will therefore increase.  Then there is the other point about our being able to beat Canadian competition. The Minister mentioned that.  I do not think that that is perfectly correct.  Owing to certain restrictions on foreign, principally Argentine, meat, the United States took Canadian meat.  I do not think that that policy will be pursued, and I do not think that there is anything in the Minister's statement that we are beating the Canadians.  That statement suits people who have not examined the question.  If the United States markets are again thrown open to Argentine meat you will find the Canadians again coming over here and causing competition.</P>
    <P>I do not see how it is possible for us to compete against the Argentine, even though we are nearer the market.  The Argentine Government have organisations which are not cooperative. The cattle producers are in intimate touch with the freezing works and the freezing works keep the farmers and ranchers up to date. They are in a position each morning to inform them regarding supplies, prices, and the particular class of meat required.  Their transport facilities are almost 80 per cent. superior to ours, as is their marketing system, so that the producers of meat in this country have all the handicaps.  It is evidently the intention to leave them with those handicaps.  No effort has been made to remedy the drawbacks which occur in the railway system and in the system of marketing.  One complaint you hear&mdash;and it is true&mdash;is that we are marketing most of our produce when it is plentiful instead of when it is scarce and when prices are high.  There is a reason for that. Take the marketing of beef.  The expense of having beef at that time <Col N="1001" /> is enormous.  If you market that beef in Dublin, which is the only market you have at your disposal, the result is that stall-fed cattle, for instance, in mid-winter, from December to April, are taken from warm sheds and put into trains.  There may be no sheds where they are unloaded, and next morning at day-break they are tied by the horns to iron railings without shelter during the coldest part of the day.  That is one of the strangest things that people can imagine, yet there is no effort made to remedy it.  The cattle cannot stand the cold and must deteriorate.  Then there is the method of shipping, and the transport method between the shipping and the marketing.  That is a system that should not be adopted by a country whose main policy and main source of industry are the production of cattle.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that if we had better cattle we would till more and feed more of what we grow to our livestock.  The reason that farmers do not do that is mainly the cost of production but another, and one of the most important reasons, is the want of storage.  In general, rates were so high that certain offices were allowed to fall down, or, through poverty, the farmer had not the accommodation.  Concentrated food is much more easily stored than large quantities of foodstuffs of his own growing.  He has not the capital to go in for that.  He generally gets his concentrated food on credit and sells the other food. That is one of the points that can only be relieved through a credit system.  It is true, as the Minister will tell me, that we have the Agricultural Credit Corporation and that its purpose is to give loans to farmers.  That is like most of the other things that have been done. No doubt, on paper it is excellent. The system is good so far as theory is concerned but the main difficulty and the thing that counts most and that will lead to good results has been completely forgotten or neglected&mdash;the question of distribution. Suppose it is admitted generally that close on £1,000,000 per county is needed for credit, how long will it <Col N="1002" /> take the Corporation to get £1,000,000 into each particular county and to spread that over the 26 counties? They have not solved that question of distribution.  It is impossible to reach the men who should get credit. They take very safe precautions against selecting men who are not, so far as they can find out, worthy of credit, but they take no precautions to select men who have no security but who are really worth more as producers for the State.</P>
    <P>That system will continue until some machinery is set up to discover more efficient means of distribution. The farmers of Ireland undoubtedly suffer severely through want of credit.  They have been plundered by successive Governments who have exacted practically all their profits and left them nothing to carry on or to improve their land.  For a number of years the farmer has been merely getting his cost of production. In, perhaps, a lucky year he gets more than that and is satisfied to struggle on for another few years. Just as the method of the distribution of credit has not been solved, so has no attempt been made to solve the distribution of produce.  The position as regards eggs has, no doubt, been remedied and the same remark applies to a certain extent to butter, but the question of livestock has not been tackled and we have the poorest system of transport or distribution which any country could possibly have.  It gives no chance to the producer to continue production.  His profits are all gone in expenses or deterioration and so the Irish farmer is compelled to go in to a large extent for the exportation of store cattle because he is unable to compete in the finished article owing to the damage that occurs during transport and marketing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that the fact of breeding good cattle and of having good cattle here in Ireland is going to increase tillage. Generally, good cattle are easier to improve and easier to fatten than badly bred cattle.  Therefore they will need less and as the cost of production is so very high, in fact as the system of taxation more or less protects <Col N="1003" /> the foreigner who sells here and compels the producer here to produce at a higher cost than the foreigner, I do not see that under these conditions there is any hope whatever for increased tillage.  The system will have to be changed before increased tillage can be hoped for.  As Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out, and it must be quite true, the high prices we are generally told of are not in reality as they are represented to be.  That view, as far as I understand, would agree with the story that farmers of all parts of the country will tell you.  They do not read with great delight statements that we have turned the corner. They will, perhaps, express satisfaction that some other section of the community has turned the corner and that in the near future they may follow, but I doubt very much if any section of farmers in this country will admit that they have turned the corner, that they are turning the corner, or that they are about to turn the corner.  You might lead them to believe that some section has turned the corner and that they will soon follow.  The hope that they may do so is the only thing they might express to you.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry, no doubt, is in a most disorganised and depressing condition.  The high prices that we are told of must not be as they are represented, or else the farmers are not telling the truth when they complain of the terrible depression that exists amongst them. If the present policy, which has had a run now of something like thirty-five or forty years, and which the Minister for Agriculture has enlarged and developed, is the correct policy for this country to pursue, I believe that we should at this stage be able to appraise it or be able to see some signs of its success.  I am sorry to say that, personally, I see no signs of success.  The Dublin Show has improved, and I admit candidly that the cattle I have seen there have greatly improved.  That I admit, but there we stop.  There is no improvement in the outlook of farmers down the country nor in <Col N="1004" /> their land.  They will all tell you that they cannot afford even to buy artificial manure to improve a field. In the cattle raising district the same things occur.  There is land there which for the last twenty or thirty years has not received one load of top-dressing.  The farmers will tell you candidly that it would not be worth while to top-dress it. When that state of affairs exists in the industry there must be a considerable amount of depression and of want of proper examination of the difficulties which confront people engaged in that industry.</P>

      <P>(Cork): I rise with the greatest pleasure to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on his practical, lucid, and able statement. I appeal to the House unanimously to pass the Estimate.  I was filled with dismay on listening to the two speeches that have been delivered from the other side of the House. Deputy Dr. Ryan could not find one word of laudation to say in favour of the Minister for Agriculture.  His whole story was a story of dismay for the future of our country.  He had nothing to say for what the Minister for Agriculture has accomplished, and he has accomplished wonderful things, so much so that we, standing here before an impartial tribunal, say he is advancing rapidly to success in every branch of agriculture. Deputy Ryan, have you no corner in your heart for your country?  Are you going to preach here the singsong of dismay at every meeting of the Dáil when the question of the future of the agriculture of the country is to be discussed?  I heard you last year and you have not improved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. I will address you with the greatest confidence because I believe you are most impartial.  This question of the present state of agriculture in Ireland is very serious. Deputies on the other side appear to ignore altogether the advances that have been made in all directions. According to Deputy Dr. Ryan we <Col N="1005" /> will get no price for eggs notwithstanding the fact that producers throughout the length and breadth of the Saorstát recognise that the Eggs Act introduced by the Minister for Agriculture was the greatest benefit that could be conferred on them.  The same remark would apply in regard to dairy produce and our live stock.  The Minister has endeavoured to bring the pedigree of live stock up to a very high standard. The Irish farmer need not now be a bit afraid or ashamed to turn his cattle into any fair. Deputy O'Reilly spoke of buyers from the Argentine.  Let them come. We have the cattle here for them. Let them come from all parts of the world.  As Deputy Shaw said, we have horses here that no other country can produce.</P>
      <P>Why is there this continued song of despair with regard to the future of the nation?  Agriculture is the staple and principal industry of the country.  In addition to that we have another industry which, I am sorry to say, has not come to the front in the way it should owing to the fact that we have not been able to discuss the Fisheries Bill because of the nonsensical manoeuvres that have taken place in this House for the past few weeks.  They have undoubtedly kept back the hands of the clock.  If that is the policy that they are commencing now, to tear to shreds the great work accomplished by the Minister for Agriculture, I say here, let the Minister be of good cheer.  He has the overwhelming majority of the Irish tenant farmers at his back in the grand progress he is making to bring them prosperity and happiness.</P>

      <P>I hope you will allow me, sir, to make a short statement on a matter concerning my own personal <Col N="1006" /> honour.  You are the head of the House, and you are rightly jealous of the honour and the reputation of its members.  It will be within the recollection of the House that during the debate upon the Vote for the Stationery Office certain statements were made concerning the relations of the Government with a certain paper&mdash;the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  I was not in the Chamber at the time, but when I returned I was informed that my name had been brought into the debate, and I thereupon, in order that I might be more properly and accurately informed, took steps to obtain a copy of the proceedings, and by the courtesy of the Official Reporters I have that typescript now before me.  I do not propose to trouble the House with any lengthy reading of it, but there are just one or two passages that I shall read in order that Deputies may understand exactly what is in question.  In the first place, Deputy Cassidy asked this question of the Minister: &ldquo;Will the Minister say who approached him and asked him to write to the Stationery Department requesting that Department to stop advertisements in the &lsquo;Derry Journal&rsquo;?&rdquo; Later Deputy Cassidy made this statement: &ldquo;When certain shareholders withdrew from the paper, at the behest of these shareholders the Minister withdrew the advertisements.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Carney asked: &ldquo;Will the Minister explain why these advertisements were not withdrawn until such time as Senator MacLoughlin and Deputy Hugh Law withdrew from it?&rdquo; The House will observe that there results from these three statements taken together an imputation affecting my personal honour. Deputy Cassidy asserts that at the behest of these shareholders the Minister withdrew the advertisements. Deputy Carney, of whom I am bound to say I expected better, repeats the insinuation in rather more delicate language, and goes on to name me specifically as one of these shareholders.  The suggestion quite plainly is that I first sold certain <Col N="1007" /> shares&mdash;which shares I might just perhaps mention I have held ever since the inception of the company long before 1914&mdash;and that I then, having sold them, used my personal influence, whatever it is, with the Government in order to injure the property of the remaining shareholders, including those persons to whom I sold the shares.  If it does not mean that, it means nothing.  I desire, therefore, to say in the plainest possible terms (1) that I sold the shares simply for the reason which usually dictates such transactions&mdash;namely, that at the time I had need of money and that I preferred to sell these shares rather than to dispose of certain other investments; (2) that neither directly nor indirectly, neither by myself nor through any other person, neither before the sale of the shares nor after the sale of the shares, did I have any communication whatever with the Government, with any member of the Government, with any official of the Government, either with regard to these advertisements, or the business or policy of the &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; or any matter affecting the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; from first to last; (3) that I did not even know the advertisements had been withdrawn until I saw a statement to that effect in the columns of the paper itself.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Ruttledge I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 64-67, and page 4, lines 1-3, to delete Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to delete from this so-called Juries (Protection) Bill the entire of Section 5, which provides for a conviction by a majority verdict of a jury. This section introduces an entirely new principle into the administration of criminal law in this country. Heretofore, it was necessary, in order to secure a conviction at a trial, to get an unanimous verdict of twelve jurymen.  If this section remains in the Bill, and the Bill becomes an Act, that unanimous verdict will no longer be necessary and a majority verdict of nine jurymen will be sufficient for a conviction. The principle underlying the old system was that a man was innocent of any crime, or innocent of the crime of which he might be charged at his trial, until twelve impartial persons empanelled as a jury were convinced on the evidence that he was guilty.  Now, we are going to make provision that will enable a man charged with some crime and tried for that crime to be found guilty and convicted, although no less than three of the jurymen who listen to the evidence and give their verdict on oath are convinced from the evidence that the individual was innocent of the crime.  The introduction of this principle in a Bill of this kind is, in our opinion, not merely nationally unwise, but is likely to create a certain amount of disrespect for the courts and the verdicts of the courts.  If a Bill is <Col N="1009" /> required to make provision for the protection of jurymen, let it be introduced as such.  If there is need for certain amendment in the administration of the criminal law, let a Bill to amend the criminal law be introduced as such.  But when we have a Bill masquerading as a Bill to provide protection for jurymen, but in the majority of its provisions having no relation whatever to the protection of jurymen, then we must conclude that the Executive Council are trying to do something by means of a trick which they would not otherwise attempt.  The provisions of the section have nothing whatever to do with the protection of jurymen.  In the discussion upon the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Bill this section was not defended from that point of view at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My memory is as good as yours.  The Minister introduced this section as an improvement of the criminal law, and he informed us that, although at the instigation of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; the Bill was to be only a temporary measure, we would probably like this section so much in operation that at the end of the period proposed in the last section we would be coming forward and demanding from him that the Bill be made a permanent measure. Deputies should realise, in the first place, that this section will apply not to certain classes of crimes only, or to those charged with certain crimes only.  It will apply in the case of every man charged with any offence who comes forward for trial after the Bill becomes law. if, in fact, it does become law.  Every citizen in the State might possibly at some time be charged, wrongfully perhaps, with some offence, and such a citizen, no matter what the charge <Col N="1010" /> against him is, when he comes for trial, will be tried in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, and a majority verdict of the jury will be sufficient to secure his conviction.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage an amendment dealing with this section was discussed, but owing to the motion which the democratic Government opposite put down and passed in order to prevent discussion and amendment of this Bill that amendment did not go to a vote, nor was the discussion on it completed.  We hope to give Deputies an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon this one particular point now. The Bill secured its Second Reading, as Deputies will remember, not upon its merits but from speeches made from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches denouncing certain crimes that occurred in this city which they seem to believe it was their sole prerogative to denounce, although there was no party in this House who did not denounce them with equal vehemence and equal strength.  The Bill has never been discussed upon its merits.  We do not hope for discussion of the Bill on its merits before it passes through, but surely we do hope to get discussion narrowed down to some outstanding points of danger in the Bill, and this is one of them.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that it was accepted by speakers on both sides of the House that it is better that a number of guilty men should go free than that one innocent man should be wrongly punished.  There have been quite a number of miscarriages of justice under the old system, and if it were possible to have miscarriages under the old system, wherein a unanimous verdict was necessary, how much more possible will it be to have such miscarriages of justice if a majority verdict will suffice for conviction? The principle embodied in the section is one that we cannot accept. We believe the effect of its passage will be that there will not be in the future even the same degree of public confidence in the verdicts of juries which it could be said existed in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> Deputy O'Connell has an amendment down to limit this section to crimes other than those in which the capital penalty might be inflicted. Even if Deputies opposite feel that they are committed to the principle of majority verdict in certain classes of trials, we think they should recognise there is a very special case to be made against applying the provisions of this section to trials as a result of which the capital penalty might be inflicted.  If an innocent man is charged with some crime and as a result of the passing of this Bill, is convicted and sent to prison for five or ten years, there is the hope that before he dies he would be able to prove his innocence and secure reparation.  But if, as a result of the passing of this Bill, an innocent man goes to the gallows and is hanged, you cannot repair the injury done him after he is dead and gone.  Innocent men have been hanged in the past even when a unanimous verdict was necessary. How much more likely is it that an innocent man may be sentenced to death and executed under the provisions of this section?  I am sure there is no member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, not even the Minister for Justice, despite the rhinoceros hide that he is developing, can contemplate with an easy conscience the prospect of a man being executed on evidence on which three of the twelve jurymen believe the person is innocent. We know when there is a reasonable doubt as to guilt arising from the evidence at a particular trial, even though the jury brings in a verdict of guilty; there is public agitation for a reprieve and petitions are organised to get the prerogative of mercy exercised.  How much more likely is it that there will be public distrust in the verdicts of juries arrived at under this section?  And how much more likely is it that there will be this agitation and organising of these petitions in order to prevent the verdict of the court, in such circumstances, being carried into execution?</P>
    <P>I am sure if members of the <Col N="1012" /> Cumann na nGaedheal Party spoke their minds on this matter to the Minister for Justice they would be able to induce him, if not by their eloquence then at least by their votes, to alter this section as suggested in Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  We are opposed to the principle of majority verdicts in any trial.  We think it degrading the whole system of trial by jury and liable to make its operation farcical. But even though we cannot succeed in convincing Deputies opposite that we are right in that attitude we hope to be able to convince some of them that majority verdicts should not operate in cases of trials where the capital penalty might be imposed. I think Deputies will realise there is a strong case to be made out against applying this section to trials in connection with political offences.  Persons charged with sedition, treason, or misprision of treason are in a different category altogether to those who are charged with more objectionable criminal offences.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the situation that exists in this country or our recent history.  Political divisions here cut very deep, and at the best of times it is very hard to get an impartial jury to try a man for a political offence.  The average individual takes a keen interest in politics as a rule and he cannot altogether divest himself of his political bias when sworn as a juryman and it is not unlikely that political bias will influence him in his decision. And in view of the fact that it is difficult to get an impartial jury in political offences we think in trials relating to these offences unanimous verdict should prevail, and we think that the introduction of the majority verdict in such a case is likely to result in a great number of miscarriages of justice.  That would apply no matter what way the jury would decide.  If there is a man guilty of an offence and because it is difficult to get an impartial jury he is found not guilty, that is in a sense as objectionable as to have an innocent man found guilty, and it is in order to ensure that persons charged with <Col N="1013" /> an offence will get a fair trial on the evidence that we are introducing this amendment and asking the House to delete this section.</P>
    <P>We believe this section is introduced not to ensure a fair trial but to facilitate the Government in the particular campaign they are now engaged in&mdash;a campaign of misrepresentation of the situation existing in this country for their own political ends.  There is no party in this House has a greater desire to see respect for law and the machinery of the administration of the law existing in this country than we have.  We think that by the introduction of this Bill and its passage through this House in the manner it has been steam-rolled through without adequate discussion or adequate opportunity of amendment, respect for the law and for the courts of law will be considerably impaired in this country.  I do not think it would be possible for any fair-minded man to feel that justice was being done if they saw a man brought to the gallows as a result of a trial held under the provisions of this Bill.  They would not, I think, take a majority verdict of a packed jury on the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know if we would be in order in discussing this section in relation to other sections of the Bill, but I think I could point out that the Minister has taken powers to ensure that there will be, in relation to these juries, every opportunity given to the State to ensure that only the friends of the prosecution will be empanelled.  Every such opportunity will be given and the rights of the prisoner will be curtailed, and despite these additional powers given to the State, powers to pack juries, they are, nevertheless, not prepared to rest their case upon the unanimous verdict of the jury.  In order to provide against any miscarriage of their plans, or the introduction of one or two impartial members to the jury, this section providing for majority <Col N="1014" /> verdicts is included in the Bill.  We hope the Dáil will reject it.  We hope that if they will not accept our amendment they will accept the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Connell.  We think elementary justice demands it.  If the Government have got out of the panic which they were in when this Bill was hurled at the House, it may be possible that representations from members of Cumann na nGaedheal will induce them to agree to the deletion of the section.</P>

I prefer at this stage to confine my remarks to the particular amendment that appears in my name.  I suppose I am at liberty to do so and that the two questions will be put separately.

      <P>Deputy Lemass devoted a very considerable portion of his speech to an advocacy of Deputy O'Connell's amendment. According to your ruling now, and <Col N="1015" /> because of the attitude of Deputy O'Connell, I will not at the present moment deal with Deputy Lemass's argument in so far as he dealt with the question of capital punishment as a separate and distinct matter from the deletion of the entire section. It is rather interesting to know that Deputy Lemass informed us in the House that there were some good things in this Bill.  His Party suggested that every section should be deleted from the Bill with two exceptions.  This is one of the exceptions. I discover that Deputy Lemass is now supporting the deletion of this section.  I wonder which of the good things which Deputy Lemass thinks are in the Bill he is voting against, because he did inform us that the Bill contained some good provisions?</P>

      <P>Some good provision is not the Title.  The Deputy cannot slip out in that fashion.  He stated clearly and distinctly there were some good things in the Bill, and now it appears that the Deputy, for Party exigencies, is going to vote against the things that he considers himself to be good, or has already voted against them. Let us consider the arguments as far as they deal with his own amendment. He said there was nothing at all in this section which made for the protection of jurymen, and he made the somewhat astonishing statement &mdash;I hope he was not in the House when I and the Minister for Finance spoke&mdash;that no attempt had been made to uphold the insertion of this section in the Bill because it ensured the safety of jurymen.  The very opposite has been the case.  We pointed out clearly and distinctly that this section is a great safeguard to jurymen.  We pointed out that the persons who wish to assassinate jurymen will desire above all things to assassinate these jurymen who will have found their confederates in crime guilty.  If there is a majority verdict they will not know what members of the jury found <Col N="1016" /> their confederate guilty.  This Bill makes it extremely difficult for them to get the names of the jurymen who have done their duty and who have found guilty persons guilty.  That is a difficulty which they will have to face.  It will take a great deal of energy and luck to enable them to succeed in surmounting the difficulty. Even if they have surmounted it, and if they do discover the names of the jurymen who were on the jury that found their confederate guilty, they still will have the difficulty of knowing how many of those jurymen brought in the verdict of guilty, and they will have considerable trouble in discovering their names.  This section is a real protection to jurymen.  Deputy O'Connell said one person, if there was one person dissenting, would declare to his neighbours: &ldquo;I was on that jury and I dissented.&rdquo; Do you think the average man is in touch with the average would-be assassin?  I do not.  The average juryman is not in touch with him, and there will be no question of jurymen approaching would-be assassins and saying to them: &ldquo;Do not assassinate me, because I found this person not guilty; I was for finding him not guilty.&rdquo;  There is no such likelihood at all, nor is it likely; in fact, it is certain it will not happen, that would-be assassins will go around and say to various jurymen: &ldquo;How did you vote?&rdquo; To begin with, there would be the fear of detection, and secondly, they might not always receive a completely truthful answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a great protection to jurymen.  Deputy Lemass says it should not apply to crimes of sedition, or that it should not apply where members of this association are charged with murder.  I do not know whether he applies it to that or not, but these are the very cases in which jurymen do require protection. In fact these are the only cases in which jurymen do require protection.  The protection of jurymen at the present moment necessitates that a provision of this nature should be inserted in this Bill. <Col N="1017" /> Deputy Lemass made one of the most extraordinary statements&mdash; that the people would not be inclined to take a majority verdict of a packed jury.  The people would not be inclined and ought not to accept not merely the majority verdict, but any verdict of a packed jury.</P>
    <P>Why Deputy Lemass thinks that people should differentiate between a unanimous verdict and a majority verdict of a packed jury I do not know.  It is a metaphysical distinction with which perhaps a very acute and subtle instinct might be able to cope, but I know it is a distinction that is a great deal too subtle for me to follow.  I should imagine that if there were a packed jury it would be a unanimous verdict. However, that is beside the question, and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    <P>There has never been, and never will be under this administration or any administration that I believe will ever rule in this State, a packed jury.  No administration now, and I believe no administration that will rule in this State, will ever desire anything else except this one thing, that justice will be done fairly, properly and impartially between the people of the State and those charged with crime.  It never has been suggested that juries were packed by this administration. Never.  And the wildest charges which have been brought against this administration by the most malevolently minded persons never included any charges of jury packing. No such charges have been made because they did see how absolutely absurd and hopeless they would be, and consequently they never ventured to put them forward. Deputy Lemass says that the best safeguard of the prisoners should be twelve impartial men; that there cannot be justice and confidence in a verdict unless it is the unanimous verdict of twelve impartial men.  I have dealt with that argument again and again.  That argument is rooted in British tradition and in nothing else whatever.</P>
    <P>It is not the tradition of the law <Col N="1018" /> of any other country or a feature of the jurisprudence of any other country except those countries whose laws are founded on British law.  To say that any countries in which a unanimous verdict is not required, to say that in countries like Scotland the prisoner is unjustly tried or wrongly convicted is absolutely wrong.  To say that nobody should regard as impartial or just, as between the State and the individual, the laws administered in Scotland and Germany is, to my mind, absolutely absurd.</P>
    <P>It is only persons entirely hide-bound, as Deputy Lemass professed to be for the purposes of this argument, in British tradition could make that statement; by his implication he has professed himself to be hide-bound in British tradition. No one else would have used such an argument.  The Deputy declares that it was impossible to take a vote on this Bill the other night.  He said the Vote was not taken because the administration did not give time to take a vote on it.  The Deputy's memory is very short.  A vote would have been taken upon that motion the other night had it not been that a Deputy in the front bench of the Party opposite moved a vote of closure in order that time might be wasted.  At any rate the result was that time was wasted.  That was the reason the division was not taken.  Had it not been for Deputy MacEntee's intervention there would have been a division on Deputy O'Connell's motion.</P>

      <P>No, I am not; I am answering the arguments used by Deputy Lemass as far as his arguments are put forward.  I stated definitely and clearly that I <Col N="1019" /> was going to make one remark, namely, that the Slater case, to which Deputy O'Connell referred, was a case in which the verdict had been set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal, and that if there had been a Court of Criminal Appeal in Scotland at the date on which that verdict of &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; had been found the sentence would equally have been set aside then.  We have, at the present moment in this country, the safeguard of a Court of Criminal Appeal, which was not possessed by prisoners at the time when the British system of a unanimous jury had grown up or was growing up.  The Deputy says that his Party has a great respect for law and for the machinery of the law.  I am glad to hear the Deputy saying that.  But I wish the rank and file of the Party, and the front bench of the Party opposite, would make a convert of their leader to that view, because the speech which Deputy de Valera made in this House, in which he expressed the view that jurymen were justified in amending the law by finding false <Col N="1020" /> verdicts, does not show that there is great respect for the law or for the machinery of the law inhabiting the brain cells of Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, line 65, after the word &lsquo;offence&rsquo; to insert the words &lsquo;other than a crime for which the penalty of death may be inflicted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I am anxious that we should have an opportunity of having a fair discussion on all the amendments on the Paper to-day, I do not want to deal at any great length, or indeed at all, with the arguments I advanced on the last occasion, when I had this amendment on the Paper.  The amendment which I have down which seeks to exclude from this majority-verdict section cases in which the death penalty would be involved is one that, I think, should not be decided lightly by members of this House.  They are taking a great responsibility in giving a decision upon this matter.  The big point that I see in favour of my amendment is that this is a temporary measure.  It no longer purports to be a reform of the criminal law.  It is a measure now admittedly being taken to deal with a special emergency that has arisen in the country.</P>
      <P>That is the position which the Government have now admitted to be the case.  I feel very strongly that this is not the time a measure of this kind should be introduced that makes such a drastic change as is proposed in this measure whereby a man may be convicted, sentenced to death and executed, while three members of the jury who have heard all the evidence have an honest, bona fide, conscientious belief that the case has not been fully proved against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some points made by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance in the course of their arguments which I would like to refer to very briefly.  The Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;If you get nine men who are perfectly satisfied in their own minds that there is no room for any reasonable doubt that the person charged before the court is a guilty person and has committed the crime with which he is charged, why should that not be sufficient?&rdquo; Again he says: &ldquo;If you have your nine, why should not that be adequate?&rdquo; Once again he says: &ldquo;If nine sensible ordinary citizens are of the opinion that a man is guilty, surely that ought to <Col N="1023" /> be sufficient?&rdquo; I want to make the point, it is not the number that I am concerned with.  I think it is Deputy Dr. O'Higgins who said that there is nothing sacrosanct about twelve.  It was fixed in some arbitrary way at some time or another. I quite agree.  There is nothing sacrosanct about twelve except tradition. I do not mind whether it is nine, ten, eleven or twelve.  The point I am anxious about is that there should be unity among the nine, ten, eleven or twelve.  The Minister for Finance in summing up his speech said: &ldquo;I think there is no danger, with the safeguards that exist, with the disposition of a jury not to convict in a capital offence, with the review of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the review that will afterwards take place by the Executive, of a person being sent to the gallows for an offence of which he is not guilty.&rdquo;  Let us take those points&mdash;the safeguards that exist, the disposition of the jury not to convict, the reluctance of the jury to convict in cases where there is a capital sentence involved. I am afraid the Minister was inclined to lay too much stress on that point, and attach too much importance to it altogether.  I am afraid that the Minister for Justice was straying perilously near the attitude which the Minister for Justice says was taken up by Deputy de Valera. I take it it is the duty of a juryman who carries out his duties conscientiously to convict if he is satisfied that there is clear and definite evidence irrespective of the result that may follow.  That is the clear, obvious duty of a juryman.  If he does otherwise, he is not doing his duty. It is a well-known principle that it should be the juryman's duty not to convict if the evidence is not clear against the prisoner.  Surely the same reluctance ought to apply no matter what the result should be, the same desire ought to be present in the mind of an honest juryman not to convict a man unless he is absolutely certain the man is guilty.</P>
    <P>Take the second safeguard.  We <Col N="1024" /> have the review of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Much has been made of that point by the Minister for Justice.  I hold that this is an argument that should be left outside this altogether.  It will not apply, and will not be brought into operation in the case of a majority verdict unless it can also be brought into operation in the same circumstances with a unanimous verdict.  I am quite certain the Minister will not say it will be a ground on which to build a case before the Court of Criminal Appeal that this man was convicted only by a majority.  The Minister will not say that, I am sure. Then no additional protection is afforded, because there is now a majority verdict.</P>

I suggest it ought to be left outside it altogether.  It applies now in the case of the unanimous verdict.  It cannot be used or invoked for the protection of the criminal in the case of a majority verdict except on grounds that would apply in the case of the other verdict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the other safeguard&mdash; the review that will always take place by the Executive.  The same argument exactly applies as in the case of the Court of Criminal Appeal because I am quite certain the Minister will not attempt to say that there will be greater care exercised by the Executive Council in the case of a condemned criminal under the new system than there ought to have been and I am sure was always exercised in cases where unanimous verdicts applied.  The Minister could not possibly give a <Col N="1025" /> pledge of that kind or make any statement to that effect.  The same care must be exercised, so that the safeguards which the Minister puts forward in the nature of arguments in favour of this majority verdict in the case of a death sentence, seem to me to disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>The Slater case was mentioned. The Minister told us what happened as the result of the setting up of the Court of Criminal Appeal, but if that had been a case where the death penalty had been carried out it would be little consolation to Slater if it was found after twenty years that he had been wrongly convicted. That is the whole case I make for excluding the death sentence, the possibility of inflicting an irreparable punishment on a man who may have been improperly found guilty.  There is just that one possibility, a slight possibility I am prepared to admit.  Even if it were possible, as the Minister said once, in the next hundred years, it should be avoided.  There are many people who have strong views on the question of capital punishment.  That is another matter, of course.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the last day and to-day, to some extent, pointed out that there is nothing in this but British tradition.  He was rather inclined to twit the Fianna Fáil people for supporting this because it was founded on British tradition.  I am not afraid to say that if there are things that we have inherited from the British or anybody else that we find are sound, there is no reason why we should not adopt them, but every reason why we should adopt them.  I think the Minister would be the first to admit that of all codes of justice the British has had a longer tradition behind it of being fair and sound, built up after a long series of years and taken as a pattern by very many countries throughout the world.  Perhaps it is that other countries have not reached the stage&mdash;I do not know, of course, as I am not qualified to speak on legal history&mdash;where a unanimous verdict was in fact necessary and afterwards departed <Col N="1026" /> from.  If the Minister would tell us of any such case we would be interested to know of it, any case where, in fact, other countries had reached the stage when a unanimous verdict was necessary for the death penalty, and then changed and went back to the majority verdict.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a few instances of that.  I again stress the point that this is a temporary measure.  In the year 1931 we go back again to the unanimous verdict.  The Minister, if he says otherwise, will only be speaking as a prophet, because as the Bill stands we are to go back again in 1931 to the unanimous verdict.  I suggest that we ought not to try experiments when it is a question of life or death.  We will be trying an experiment if we include in this measure the provision which my amendment seeks to delete.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept it, and if it goes to a division, I trust that members will not cast their votes lightly when there is such a very important matter at stake.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy O'Connell's amendment should meet with the unanimous approval of the House.  I am convinced that it is as easy a matter to convince twelve jurymen of the guilt of a prisoner as it is to convince nine.  Another reason why I am in favour of the amendment is, that a unanimous verdict was the law in this country previous to the Treaty.  It is the established law in Great Britain, and I have yet to learn that the people in the Free State have discarded the British law.  As Deputy O'Connell said, British law is considered to be the fairest law in the world.  If the British Government insist on a unanimous verdict before a prisoner is found guilty, I think it is only right and fair that we should think twice before we change the law that has existed here up to the present.  As the Minister for Justice pointed out, this Bill will only be in operation for a few years. Might I say it is a pity the Minister found it necessary to introduce the Bill at all.  As a member of this House, I am exceedingly sorry that <Col N="1027" /> certain things that happened in this country have been responsible for the introduction of this Bill.  I am sure that all Deputies are prepared to give all the support they can to the Government to put down crime. As far as I am personally concerned, I have no traffic, and never had any, with people who commit crime.  On the other hand, I think it is asking too much of Deputies who do not belong to either of the great Parties to swallow every provision contained in this Bill.  As has been pointed out, the fact of three men out of twelve not being convinced of the guilt of a prisoner will, I think, be a bone of contention as to whether the sentence imposed was just or unjust.  I would appeal to the Minister to allow, if at all possible, this amendment of Deputy O'Connell's to pass, and to hope for the best.  I believe that time will perhaps do a lot more in bringing that section of our people to realise their position than the introduction of a Bill such as this will do.  I believe that, after all, the spirit of true Christianity must assert itself in the minds of that section, and I have no doubt that the Minister, if he agrees to accept the amendment, will have no reason to regret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, I cannot see why it should not be as easy a matter to convince twelve jurymen of the guilt of a prisoner charged with a particular crime as it would be to convince nine.  I hope that, with good-will prevailing, the Minister may not have occasion to put all the provisions in this Bill into effect.  I feel very strongly in being asked to depart from what has been the established law in this country for centuries past.  That law has given general satisfaction, and it lays down that before a person is condemned to death a unanimous verdict must be obtained from the jury.  At the moment I am inclined to stand by that, seeing that it has been the law here and that there is no reason, as far as I can see, for departing from it now.  It has worked well in England and <Col N="1028" /> worked equally well in this country. I have no doubt but that there can be, and ought to be, twelve jurymen found in the Free State who would be honest enough and who would have the moral courage to do their duty and bring in a true verdict and have that verdict unanimous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell replied to my remarks the other night, but he replied to contentions which I really did not make.  I did not suggest that additional safeguards were being provided with the setting up of the majority verdict.  What I did say was that the formal and informal safeguards were so ample that even with the majority verdict there was no danger of a man being sent to the gallows for a crime of which he was not guilty.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is undoubtedly a great safeguard, and it is a new safeguard.  The Court of Criminal Appeal was not established here until about three years ago.  It is not one of the things that we have always had.  It means that trials have to be very carefully conducted, and that great attention has to be paid, not merely to seeing that there is no substantial injustice done, but that there are no technical informalities: that nothing is allowed to weigh against the prisoner in the slightest that should not be allowed to weigh against him.  It means, as I have said, that trials have to be conducted with extreme care.  Now it is the duty of jurymen to convict on the evidence, irrespective of what the results of the conviction may be. All of us know that there can hardly ever be a case in which there is not an element of doubt.  Scarcely ever could you have a prisoner before a court and have no element of doubt as to his guilt.  There will be some element of doubt. He might tell some story which might be true, although the weight of evidence is against it, and you might say that where a prisoner does not dispense with a jury trial altogether by entering a plea of guilty, there is a doubt in every case.  What the juryman has to do <Col N="1029" /> is to weigh up the evidence to see if there is a reasonable doubt, and if there is to give the prisoner the benefit of it.  But, if a juryman were to say to himself, &ldquo;I will not agree to a verdict of guilty in this case if there is any doubt whatever possible,&rdquo; then you could have no convictions.  The possibility of error which a juryman would put out of his mind if the most that might happen to the prisoner was to get, say, three years' penal servitude, would weigh with him very much when it is likely that the prisoner will, if convicted, be put to death.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a reluctance on the part of jurymen to convict in capital cases.  The evidence has to be stronger in capital cases than in other cases.  The evidence that would produce a conviction where the sentence would be three years' penal servitude would have no chance of securing a conviction where conviction would mean the death sentence.  It seems to me that while Deputy O'Connell says that this Bill has become merely a Bill to deal with an existing difficulty he then proceeds to forget the existing difficulty, and to forget the circumstances that have caused this Bill to be introduced.  He says that if there are three jurors who have an honest, bona fide and conscientious belief that the prisoner before them is not guilty then that prisoner ought not to be convicted.  What we are dealing with is a case where a conviction will not be given, and where a conviction will be refused for other reasons.  We are dealing with a case where jurors have been subject to a good deal of terrorism, to a campaign of terrorism in its less acute aspect, lasting over a period of years, and culminating in the shooting of a juror at his door.  What we want to do is to end that campaign of terrorism.  Police measures are taken to deal with it.  We want to make it impossible for the terrorism to succeed in its object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who last spoke said that we should hope for the best and that time will do its healing work.  Time will do its healing work if it is given a chance, but it <Col N="1030" /> will not do its healing work if terrorism can be successful and is allowed to spread its demoralising effects.  What we want is to make it impossible for terrorism to be successful, and that is better than the punishment of the terrorists.  The real object of punishment is to prevent a repetition of the crime.  A better way of preventing crime is to make it impossible for criminals to get the results they desire rather than the detection and punishment of those who do it.  We ought not to make it easier for a man to escape punishment if he commits murder than if he commits a lesser offence. I said the other night, and I think I may repeat it, that while it may be fairly easy to terrorise one man out of twelve it is more than four times as difficult to terrorise four men out of twelve.  In any group there will be one or two timorous people, but you do not very often meet any group of people in whom as many as one-third could be called cowardly or be easily terrorised or intimidated.  The position is that in order to prevent a prisoner being found guilty who ought to be found guilty four men have to be terrorised, and I think thereby the campaign of terrorism is going to be brought to an end.  Deputy O'Connell said that he did not care about the number twelve, that the number twelve was arbitrarily fixed what he wanted was unanimity, and that there was no special virtue in the number twelve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that.  I was quoting what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was quoting with approval.  The Deputy said he did not care whether the number was ten, eleven or twelve if there was unanimity.  He said&mdash;I took his words down&mdash;&ldquo;It is unanimity I want.&rdquo;  There is not, as I said the other night, unanimity under the present system.  It frequently happens that a man is tried not by twelve, but by a series of trials by thirty-six jurors.  The fact that he has to be tried by thirty-six jurors shows that there is not unanimity&mdash;that <Col N="1031" /> in two cases there has not been unanimity.  It might happen that more than a fourth of the thirty-six might have been amongst those who declined to find the prisoner guilty.  Though Deputy O'Connell says he attaches no special importance to twelve, he actually is attaching special importance to the number.  There are quite a number of Deputies&mdash;we have them in the Labour Benches, and I think they practically include all the members on the Labour Benches, along with Deputy Coburn, who has just taken the line now&mdash;who say they will support the Government in all measures necessary to put down crime.  When measures are introduced for that purpose they say these measures are not reasonable. Since there has been a Labour Party in the Dáil that has been their consistent attitude.  They have been all right in their professions, but so far as their votes are concerned they are all wrong.  So far as I know, they have seldom given a vote for any of the measures that were necessary.  Perhaps if they had been more ready to support those measures that support would have been useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure differs from many of the measures we have introduced, because in most of the measures that have been introduced we have sought powers to do certain things in cases proved necessary.  Here we are actually amending the law and the amendments will come into operation.  I think the fault of some of our past measures was that they simply held out a threat which was not to be put into operation, and that there was a tendency for people outside who were engaged in these conspiracies against the State to lie low for a time and then when the measure was repealed and a certain length of time had elapsed, and it seemed unlikely that measures so stringent as some of those which had been enacted would be put into operation, they proceeded to act in some particular way.  Now we are proposing to make what is really a <Col N="1032" /> very moderate change, a change mostly in routine procedure.  One substantial alteration of the existing law is the majority verdict. When various Deputies referred to British law they were using too wide a term.  A majority verdict is the principle of the English law.  The Scottish system has, from anything I have ever heard, worked quite as well as the English system, and it is a system which is just of as much advantage to the prisoner in ordinary circumstances as against him. If it sometimes leads to a conviction where there might be a disagreement, it often leads to a discharge where the prisoner might have been kept on in custody.</P>
    <P>But the real thing we have to remember about this is that the occasion of it, whatever may be the fate of it at the end of two years&mdash;and I hope that most of the provisions, with perhaps some slight modifications, will be embodied permanently in the law of the land&mdash;is a difficulty and a certain public danger which has arisen, and we should not alter the Bill now to make it less likely to be effective for dealing with that difficulty and that danger.  I do suggest that to exempt from the operations of one of its sections the worst type of criminal would not be a right thing to do.  I think that there is not the shadow of possibility that any man will be convicted on a capital offence who is not guilty of a capital offence.  On the other hand, if we had to have a unanimous verdict, and if some one of the murderers whose crimes are recent were detected and brought to trial, tremendous efforts at terrorism would be put forward and would be likely to be successful.  If they were successful, terrorism would have a new lease of life.  The man who had been brought to trial, whose guilt had been clearly proved, but who got off because the jury had been terrorised, would go out and plot and encourage and execute new crimes.</P>

      <P>The speech which we have listened to was a speech, not in favour of the Bill or of this section of the Bill, but in favour of <Col N="1033" /> the abolition of the jury system. The Minister says that the main purpose of this section is to prevent the terrorism of jurors.  According to the Minister it will be more difficult to terrorise nine jurors than it would be to terrorise twelve.  We are against this section and against the Bill, because we do not believe that it will have the effect of putting an end to that terrorism which the Minister speaks of and which we all know exists.  The Minister talked of this amendment and of this section as if the only effect of the Bill was to change the jury from twelve to nine, as if, when the Bill becomes law, the jury will be empanelled in the same way, and that the prisoner and his counsel will have the same rights of challenging jurors as before the introduction of the Bill.  I think you have got to look not only at this section but at the Bill as a whole, and I do not believe that the Minister himself or any member of the Government thinks that he will put an end to this terrorism by this measure.  The Minister is certainly not going to improve the position, or get the people of the country behind the Government in their efforts to put down terrorism and crime, by making veiled charges of cowardice and of shirking their responsibilities against the Labour Party and members of it.  I say it here, and I am prepared to say it outside, that the Labour Party have always stood up to their responsibilities in this House and in this country when the terrorism was much greater than it is to-day.</P>

The Labour Party refused&mdash;and time has proved that they were quite right in doing so&mdash;to give their support to very many measures brought in by the Government.

      <P>If the Bills which were introduced and which the Minister challenges us now with not having supported had the effect that they were intended to have, there would be no necessity for this Bill.  I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I do say that we are dealing with a very serious matter, serious from the point of view of the murder of jurors and from the point of view of the terrorism which is being attempted against the jury system, an attack upon the whole jury system, but serious also from the point of view of seeing that no innocent man is condemned to death, and it is our duty, while doing all we can to protect the lives of citizens who are doing their duty as citizens, to see that no innocent citizen loses his life as the result of a change in the law which we consider is for the worse.  The members of this Party have at all times, both in this House and on public platforms outside, denounced terrorism and denounced murder.  They have taken their part in the government of this State, and they came in to do so against the wishes of both sides of the House; they came into this Parliament to assert the right of the people to decide who was to rule the country, who were to be their elected representatives, and the Minister ought not to forget that. When the Government brought in this Bill Deputy O'Connell told him that this Party was prepared to support a much stronger measure altogether than this Bill for dealing with the present conspiracy.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this subject, though it is a very important subject indeed. I might repeat a remark I made the other night, speaking on, I think, the Second Reading of this Juries (Protection) Bill, as it is called.  I said that the propositions in the Bill went to the very fundamentals of the law system of this country as we have known it and as it has been adopted here.  I believe that the system of law in England&mdash;and I have some little acquaintance with the systems of law in other countries in Europe and outside it&mdash;for the Englishman is as fair a thing as there is.  I believe that the Englishman gets justice in his own courts.  I do not say that we in Ireland, as we knew English law administered here, got justice, but I do say, from living in England and watching things as they happen there, and from living in other countries, that from my experience of the English people's legal code the administration of law in England is as fair as, and probably fairer than any other system I have had experience of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other remark that I will make, and I want to address it particularly to the Minister for Finance. I am sorry he is gone.  It is not my fault that he is not here to hear it, but I hope that he will read it.  I noticed his enthusiasm for the reduction in the number of jurymen necessary to convict in a capital offence or in any offence.  I think he would be, from my knowledge of him, even more enthusiastic if they did away with juries altogether. <Col N="1036" /> He is out for radical changes, and judging from my knowledge of him, I believe he would be more satisfied if he could do as he did before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We ought to be very careful and to walk very warily and slowly in introducing such a radical change in the law, which would leave it open, having regard to the state of the country, for any man, no matter who he is, poor or rich, no matter what his estate or caste is, to be executed by mistake, or executed at a time of high feeling, when otherwise he might escape capital punishment.</P>

      <P>I do not purpose dealing with the contemptible attack which has been made on the Minister for Finance.  I think that attacks of that nature, coming from the source from which that one came, can be very safely treated with the contempt which they deserve.  As far as the rest of the Deputy's speech is concerned, it was simply mere words.  Deputy O'Connell objected to points which the Minister for Finance had made in a previous discussion.  He said that there was not more reluctance to convict on a capital charge than upon an ordinary charge.  To a certain extent he is correct.  He is correct that evidence in both cases is required in theory to put a case beyond reasonable doubt, and that it is quite sufficient in murder to put a case beyond reasonable doubt. It is quite possible if you had what I might call mechanical jurymen, persons completely free from all human emotions, simply intellects and nothing else, that verdicts would be in fact the same on capital charges as on ordinary charges. But you can never get rid of the human element, and, in fact, whatever it may be in theory, it has <Col N="1038" /> always worked out that juries do require, though in theory they do not need to require, more evidence in capital cases, and there is more reluctance in capital cases, in fact, in finding convictions than there is in other cases.  That is what does actually happen in real life, whatever theoretically ought to happen.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Court of Criminal Appeal does exist.  It exists exactly the same whether the number of the jury is increased or decreased, or whether you have a unanimous verdict or a majority verdict.  That is not the question at issue here.  The question at issue is: Is a majority verdict going to be unjust to a prisoner, and will it be more unjust on a capital charge?  My answer to that is, if you have nine men who are satisfied, and if you have over those a Court of Criminal Appeal&mdash; you have also the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, always exercised after consultation with the Judge&mdash;and if there was any doubt, the system will be as perfectly proof against a miscarriage of justice, against the conviction of an innocent prisoner, as any system really could be.  There is no real danger of a miscarriage of justice.  Miscarriages of justice undoubtedly will occur in very exceptional cases. There might be mistakes of identity or something of that kind, but those miscarriages are just as likely to occur if there were twelve jurors. Deputy O'Connell said that this should not apply to capital charges, because the mistake could never be rectified if there was a mistake. That is an argument which would do away with capital punishment altogether, because a jury of twelve might make a mistake.</P>

      <P>Even though the other three, for various reasons, be not satisfied, you have got the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In the case of twelve you have also got the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is quite possible&mdash;I do not know that it has happened since that Court was established&mdash;that twelve persons might make a mistake just as it conceivably could happen that nine might make a mistake.  If twelve make a mistake, Deputy O'Connell's argument comes into force, as you cannot undo an injury that has been done.  If you press his argument to its logical conclusion it means that you should have no capital punishment at all.  That may be a correct view.  Deputy O'Connell said that there are, and I know there are, certain persons who think that capital punishment should be abolished.  I do not hold that view.  I think it is required in the present circumstances. In most countries where it was given up, in France for instance, they had to go back to it.  Deputy O'Connell also said that there is no reason why we should not adopt the British tradition.  I quite agree that if it is good we should copy it.  We have had a British system of law in this country, and where it has been <Col N="1040" /> found good we accepted it, but we should not sit down in slavish veneration of any system of law.  We should consider whether a system evolved by the English people for their own purposes, and which is admirably suitable to that country, is suitable here.  It is our duty, as the legislative assembly for the Irish Free State, to make up our own minds, to see what is the best for this country, and we must not be tied down by precedents of other countries.  They may serve as useful guides.  They do serve as useful guides, and it will, no doubt, help us when arriving at a conclusion as to what is right and proper for our own country, to see what other countries are doing, but that must not be taken as the complete and final guide.  We must decide what is the proper system of law to set up in this country, and what system of procedure is most likely to do justice between the State and the individual citizen.  I submit that it is to be found in this system which we are now suggesting, and which is embodied in a temporary measure.  As I have said, it was largely in response to the suggestions made by the Deputy on Second Reading that I brought in my own amendment.  I believe that experience will show that this makes more for justice than the existing system, with its constant disagreements, and I ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is only a limited amount of time available for the discussion of the remaining amendments to the Bill, I propose to confine my remarks on this amendment to that portion of the section which deals with the recognition of the Court and the penalties to be inflicted on those who decline to recognise it.  There are many matters in this section to which we object, but this is the one point to which we object most, and therefore I intend to keep the discussion as far as I can on that one point so that we can get a decision and proceed to discuss the other amendments which are on the Paper. This portion of the section is designed to penalise a man for possessing an idea.  It is the first time that the Government has attempted to inflict penalties on individuals for possessing <Col N="1043" /> ideas contrary to their own. They are now doing it, and I think it is only a natural development. They have been following along the lines of the British Government in their coercion policy, and they will ultimately reach a stage below the lowest stage which the British Government ever reached.  If persons charged with offences come into court, are disrespectful and create disturbances there is, I think, within the existing law adequate powers to deal with them.  The passing of this section will not materially increase these powers, nor is it, I think, designed to increase these powers.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the section is the provision for dealing with those who, though not attempting to create disturbance or cause any riot in court, stand up and say they do not recognise the authority of the court. The section provides that in the event of a person refusing to recognise the authority of the court the judge shall have no discretion but shall be obliged by the terms of the Bill forthwith to sentence him to suffer a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.  As I have said, if a man refuses to recognise a court established by this State he is giving expression to a view and the expression of that view is not in itself a crime nor do I think that this Bill should attempt to make it a crime.  There is quite a number of people in this State who do not recognise its authority nor the authority of any of its institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Government could justify itself in taking action against these persons if they endeavoured to give expression to their views by taking action to overthrow the State, I do not think they are justified in sending to prison persons merely because their views, with respect to the legality of this State and the steps that were taken to establish it, differ from their own. I do not think that the Government are even anxious that the prospect of maintaining peace and order within <Col N="1044" /> the country should be increased.  I say that deliberately because I think that this section is introduced and that these powers are being acquired by the Government because they hope they can operate them to create disorder.  There is, as I said, a section in the country the members of which do not recognise the legality of the State.  You have prevented a section of the people from being represented here; you have prevented them from taking part in the political activities in the country and you are now going to prevent them expressing their own views even in the dock.  The persons composing that section of the community are not criminals.  They are not murderers.  They are people holding a particular view which they are quite entitled to hold and for which they ought not to be made subject to persecution.</P>
      <P>I have said, and I hold very strongly that this Bill was introduced not because the Government wanted to increase their power to maintain peace and stability, but because the Government want to maintain a position in this country in which they will be able to pose as the Heaven-sent leaders of the people, and the only Party capable of maintaining law.  The other day we got additional proof that that is the design of the Government.  The introduction of the Bill and its extraordinary provisions are proof of that fact.  Deputies here who may doubt the accuracy of what I am saying, have only to look at this morning's &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; and to read there the slanderous and scandalous letter which was published over the name of the Deputy Whip of the Party opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the discussion on the previous amendment that we are anxious to see respect for the law and for the instruments of the law exist among the people.  I say, however, that the Government are making it impossible for decent men to have any respect for the law or the courts in consequence of the introduction of and the attempt to pass this measure. It is very easy to destroy public confidence in the administration of justice.  One such case as the case of Seán MacBride, in which a man was held in prison for five months, and then tried and found not guilty, does more damage to public confidence in the administration of justice than the labours of the Minister for months could repair. The introduction of this Bill and its passage, as I have said, in the particular manner in which it is being passed&mdash;steam-rolled through without adequate discussion&mdash;is going still further to lessen any public confidence there may remain in the administration of justice under the Executive Council.  They have given adequate proof that political bias is the sole driving force behind them, and that so long as they can score a point against their opponents or win votes at an election they are careless as to the consequences of their action in the country. If an individual who is publicly known not to be a criminal, who is known to be a more honourable man than any member of the Executive Council, is charged with, say, uttering seditious sentiments, brought into court, and, in pursuance of the <Col N="1046" /> dictates of his conscience, states that he cannot recognise its authority, and as a result of saying so is automatically sentenced to imprisonment under this section, there are very few people even amongst those who do not hold the same views as that individual, who will have any respect for the administration of law afterwards.  I should like to point out that that individual, having done his automatic six months' imprisonment, when he comes up again, if he still adheres to his views and takes the same course, can go back to prison for another six months, and the process can be repeated for the duration of his natural life.  As I have said, a person brought into court, who takes up a disrespectful attitude, or creates a scene or disturbance, can be dealt with by the existing law.  It is not necessary that this section should be in the Bill in order to find means of dealing with him.  A person who, without creating disturbance, merely expresses his view that he cannot in conscience recognise the authority which constituted the court, is not a criminal and should not be punished as a criminal for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is not necessary in the Bill.  There is nothing in this section, at any rate, which provides for the protection of jurors.  I doubt if the Minister, astute and clever debater as he is, will be able to show how the life of one juryman will be made in one degree safer by the inclusion of this section in the Bill. On the contrary, I think that this section is likely to operate in the other direction altogether.  I, therefore, urge those who are anxious to ensure that every provision for the protection of jurymen shall be made to support the amendment which I am moving to delete the section.  If they do so, they will be making the Bill not merely better from their point of view, but better from the point of view of the administration of justice as a whole.  We know that there is very little public respect for the courts or the machinery of justice in this country at present, very largely due to the <Col N="1047" /> policy which the Minister has been following since his appointment.  It will be a very hard thing for the Minister's successor to restore respect for the law to the place it should occupy amongst the people, because of the attitude which the Minister is now taking up.  But we are anxious to make the job at least as little difficult as we can, and in order to help us in that direction, we ask the Deputies opposite to support the amendment and vote for the deletion of the section.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a good many strange speeches in this House, but I do not think I ever listened to a stranger speech than that which has fallen from Deputy Lemass.  He told us that he and his Party are anxious that respect for the law should be widespread amongst the people, and, in the same breath, he told us that a man who by his action defies the courts which are administering that law and set up under the authority of this Dáil is a person who has committed not only technically no crime, but in his view committed absolutely no offence.  He says that there are people in this country who do not recognise the legality of this State, and it is for these people that he pleads.  Is it not perfectly obvious that that refusal to recognise the legality of the State is in itself the very essence of sedition?</P>

      <P>I shall avail of the opportunity to speak now on this amendment in order to put forward the arguments for my own amendment, as otherwise I may have to wait until after the division on Deputy Lemass's amendment, and may not have an opportunity of speaking.  I have set out the words <Col N="1048" /> which I object to in this particular section, and the Minister will note that I am not asking that the portion dealing with disrespect should be cut out.  I am confining my amendment entirely to the words &ldquo;refusal to recognise the court.&rdquo; Deputy Law talked of what sedition is.  I always understood, and I have often heard it declared both inside and outside this House by members and supporters of the Government, that a man was free to go on a public platform or anywhere else, and say that he was not satisfied with the form of government established in this country; that he was anxious to have a Republic set up, or it may be a dictatorship or an absolute monarchy, or any other form of government he wished.</P>
      <P>He is free to hold that opinion, and he is free to express it, but he is not free to say in court that he holds that opinion.  That is my reading of the section.  He is not free to say that he does not recognise the law, or that he does not recognise the court.  When I mentioned my objection to this section to some people they said: &ldquo;We must have respect for the law.&rdquo;  By all means let us have respect for the law and for the courts.  But in the very manner in which this section is drafted the Minister has shown that it is not disrespect, because it is segregated from disrespect.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Whenever a person charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court with any crime or offence at any stage of his trial in such court on such charge by any act or omission displays gross disrespect to the court or refuses to recognise the authority or jurisdiction of the court ... or in any other way acts disrespectfully towards the court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is to be judged as disrespect to the court why make the distinction?  Is it a crime for a man to hold a certain view or opinion? Is it a special offence to say that he holds that view?  A man may hold an opinion, a queer, quaint, fantastic, eccentric opinion, and express that opinion, but he is subject <Col N="1049" /> to the law and must obey the law, and so long as he obeys the law and is a law-abiding man I hold he is entitled to hold that opinion and express it.  The Minister will not say that is not so.  Here we are making a new offence.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I assume the man committed a crime.  If he committed a crime he is subject to the law.  If he says he does not recognise the court that should have no effect on the court which says, &ldquo;We do not care three straws whether you recognise our authority or not; we have authority and are going to exercise it and punish you if you are proved guilty.&rdquo;  That is the position at the present time.  Will the Minister tell us how this particular offence which is created in this Bill is going to protect juries, because this is a Juries Protection Bill?  He will not change a man's opinion by punishing him for it.  He will continue to hold that opinion, it may be assumed.  Let us assume a man holds <Col N="1050" /> an opinion, and holds it very strongly without expressing it.  He is not punished for that.  I fail to see how this is anything else than a punishment for a political opinion or a political view held by a person and expressed as his particular view in court.  I think, so far as I am concerned, if a man acts disrespectfully or contumaciously towards a court of law the court has power to punish him, but merely for a man to say he does not recognise these institutions set up and refuses to give evidence or take any part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has not stated on Second Reading, or on any other stage of the Bill, what particular danger there is, what particular reasons he has for including this in a measure for the protection of juries, or for any other purpose whatsoever.  It seems to me it is a most extraordinary provision, and no matter how the Minister may argue it I do not see how he can get away from the fact that this is punishment for holding and expressing a particular political view, and so far as it does that I certainly think it ought not to be included in a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I may say that this other provision, for which I have also an amendment down, and which is included in this section that Deputy <Col N="1051" /> Lemass wishes to delete, is open to grave objection.  The judge will have no discretion when the prisoner says, no matter how respectfully he says it, no matter even if he prefaces his remarks with the words &ldquo;May it please your lordship,&rdquo; but to sentence him forthwith.  There is no question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may in his discretion,&rdquo; as I suggest there should be.  He shall forthwith sentence him.  I put it to the Minister that that is going entirely too far, and that that is not going to do any good.  That very kind of thing is the thing that will lead to disrespect for our institutions, and whatever may be said about the section Deputy Lemass seeks to delete, taken as a whole, I cannot conceive any argument that can be effectively used for including that particular sentence that I am anxious to delete or that should take from a judge the discretion that he ought to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>I want to be very brief. I agree that Deputy O'Connell has put his finger on the point when he said that what is happening here is the manufacture of a new crime, and a new crime of this particular quality that it involves perpetual punishment.  It is a crime which can be manufactured for a man outside himself.  All that the Executive Council need do, or all that any misguided representative of their police force need do, is to make a list of all the people whom they do not think will recognise the court, and by just doing that they automatically, under this Bill, condemn any such person to perpetual imprisonment.  Now, that is the real fact.  A man is in a certain state of mind.  The Executive know that if they do a certain act they will create a condition in relation to him, in relation to the court, which will create a crime for which he can be perpetually imprisoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just heard two most astonishing speeches.  These were the speeches by Deputies O'Connell and Lemass. While those Deputies worked themselves up into great indignation <Col N="1052" /> against this section, neither of them seemed to have gone to the trouble of reading the section, or, if they have read it, although the wording of the section is very clear, they brought themselves to make misleading statements to the House as to what the section contains.  Indeed, I cannot understand how they brought themselves to make such misleading statements.  Deputy Lemass a few moments ago talked about the anxiety of himself and his Party to see the law, the courts and the institutions of this State properly respected in this country. A moment afterwards he says he thinks it is quite right that a certain person should say openly in court words in contempt of that court, and that that court had no right and no jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>How that is showing respect for the court and how the court should brook that insult to it and to the entire State, I do not know.  Deputy Lemass spoke about persons who refused to recognise the legality of the State. There are certain persons who refuse to recognise the State.  We know there are certain persons who are in a great state of confusion of mind on this matter and who do not know whether the State is legal or illegal. When asked that question these persons proceed to quibble very much. We know where to find these persons. We find them on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  But there are certain persons who are quite determined that this State and the legality of this State, founded as it is upon the voiced opinions of the majority of the Irish people, shall be recognised all through this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said there were many high-minded persons who refused to recognise the court.  He said there were high-minded persons whose sense of patriotism will not allow them to recognise the court.  I do not know that such persons exist. Those who up to this have refused to recognise the court do not seem to <Col N="1053" /> have any of those very high ideals about which Deputy Lemass talked. For instance, the last example we had of these was the considerable number of five or six prisoners refusing to recognise the court.  Having refused to recognise one court they recognise another court, and they applied for a writ of habeas corpus. Then, when they could apply to get bail the leader of that group instructed the others not to get bail. He, anyhow, did not get bail himself, and the others not applying for bail the leader himself makes application through the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy Prison that he might be allowed out on parole.  What is the difference between being allowed out on parole and getting bail?  It is the difference between getting a favour from this terrible tyrannical Government, and getting what he was entitled to by the laws passed by this tyrannical Government.  The only difference is that in the one instance there is a pecuniary sum fixed in the case of getting bail, which sum, if the bail is broken, will have to be paid. In the other there is no bond to be estreated.  That is the only difference. There can be no difference between recognising the court and the authority which sets up the court.  Of course, the high-minded leader in this instance, if he got parole, would be free, but conscience would bind his unfortunate followers. That is one example of these very high-minded, high-souled, noble young men who will not recognise the court.</P>

      <P>I said no such thing.  What I said was that Deputy O'Connell thought that persons should be entitled to express their opinions.  I said that they should be entitled to express their opinions about the formation of a Government by lawful means, but they are not entitled to express their opinions that the Government of this country should be changed by illegal means.</P>

      <P>They are not entitled to insult the courts of this State.  The Deputy wants to know why they should be punished for refusing to recognise the court. Because it is an insult to the court; because it is an insult to these courts set up by the Oireachtas elected by the majority of the people of this country.  These courts are the lawful and legitimate courts of the State, and because they are the courts of this State they must be recognised by every citizen in this State.  These persons can be mute of malice if they like; for being mute of malice they are not to be punished, but they are to be punished for openly insulting the court and informing the court that it has no jurisdiction to try them, that it is an illegal court.  In these cases they are committing contempt <Col N="1055" /> of court and they are insulting the institutions of this State publicly and openly.  Deputy Lemass is really rather an enigma to me.  I cannot really understand Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasions the Deputy shows such astuteness and on other occasions such extraordinary simplicity.  The Deputy says that the court will sentence the prisoner to six months automatically, and Deputy O'Connell says pretty much the same thing about an automatic sentence of six months.  There is no automatic sentence of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the section says is that the person guilty of an offence against the court shall forthwith be sentenced by the judge to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months.  There is nothing in that section saying to the judge, &ldquo;You must sentence him to six months' imprisonment.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass knows that, and everybody who has read the section knows it.  The judge may say, &ldquo;I sentence you to imprisonment until the rising of the court,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I sentence you for a day or a week.&rdquo; That is as clear as daylight, and if Deputy Lemass had read the section he would see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  He said an automatic six months.  What does the Deputy mean by that, unless it is that the judge must pass that sentence whether he likes it or not?  Certainly, what the Deputy conveyed to the House, or must have meant to convey, was that the judge had no discretion and that he had to sentence the prisoner to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>He must, of course, sentence him, but he can sentence him to any period, not necessarily six months.  It is just the same as in the case where the law sets out: &ldquo;If so and so commits a certain offence he shall be liable to imprisonment for six months,&rdquo; or something of that kind.  The accused person need not get the whole six months, and in this case it is exactly the same.  The judge will take all the facts and circumstances into consideration.  It is absurd to suggest that it should not be an offence in the very face of a court to tell that court that it has no right and no jurisdiction, and to do so wantonly and deliberately.  We are told that conscience may prevent an accused person from recognising the court.  Conscience never makes any of them refuse to cross-examine witnesses or to call witnesses of their own.  If it does, it very seldom happens, and it is always in the most absolutely clear cases.  Perhaps I should not have said always, but it happens again and again that persons who refuse to recognise the court at one moment proceed the next moment to recognise it as a tribunal, and they very often take part in the proceedings either personally or through a solicitor or counsel.</P>
