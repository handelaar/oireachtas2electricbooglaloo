      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that P. Mooney, a one-armed man, who served for thirty years as a postman in the Kildangan-Monasterevan district, has been compelled to retire from the service owing to heart trouble, and is receiving no pension or grant of any kind; and, if so, whether in view of all the facts of the case the Minister will consider if something cannot be done for this man to enable him to make a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Mooney was employed as a part-time auxiliary postman until July last, when he ceased duty owing to his physical incapacity for further service.  The nature of such employment gave him no claim to any award under the <Col N="1610" /> Superannuation Acts, and I regret that there is no fund at my disposal from which he is eligible for a grant. It is understood that he is in receipt of National Health Insurance benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the answer, there is naturally a very strong feeling in that district where this man has been known so long against allowing him to go penniless after giving his full time to this work, because he has had to walk all these years from Monasterevan and back in the evening delivering letters.  It has been a full-time job, although he is called an auxiliary postman, and it would be exceedingly hard if something is not done for this man.</P>

I asked the Parliamentary Secretary in this question if he will state the cause of delay in dealing with this farm.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered that.

The farm is subject to a Land Commission annuity, and the owner refuses to sell to the Land Commission unless given another farm in exchange, and consequently there is a certain amount of difficulty in acquiring this farm.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider the advisability of appointing a Commission to examine the whole income tax code with a view of endeavouring to remove certain hardships under which taxpayers are suffering, and who would investigate and suggest the best means whereby the whole procedure in regard to income tax returns could be simplified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As already indicated by me in the Dáil on the 24th April and 12th June of this year, I am of opinion that income tax simplification in the Saorstát is necessary.  A Departmental Committee is now at work on the drafting of a simplified code and it is hoped that it will have completed its labours at a comparatively early date.  As the subject is so highly technical I am afraid no good purpose would be served by appointing a Commission until the Departmental Committee has completed its work.  When the Departmental Committee has reported and the matter comes before the Dáil, I shall <Col N="1618" /> be prepared to consider the question of appointing a Commission if such a course seems necessary.  If, however, the Deputy will be good enough to communicate to me the particular hardships which he has in mind, I shall be prepared to have them specially considered without waiting for the report of the Departmental Committee.  The simplification of income tax forms generally is dependent on the simplification of the Acts.  Consequently, until a new code of income tax law is available, it would not be possible to make any radical changes in the existing forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider the advisability of introducing proposals for legislation to amend the income tax law as follows: (a) by repealing Section 165 of the Income Tax Act, 1915, which gives absolute power to the Revenue Commissioners to issue warrants for the arrest and detention of defaulting taxpayers, the length of the detention being at the pleasure of the Commissioners, without any right of appeal to the Minister or the court; and (b) to amend Rule 85 of the District Court Rules (and the Acts authorising same), whereby a special form of decree in revenue cases is provided by altering the form of decree made under said Rule so as to exclude the provisions for arrest and detention for an indefinite period at the pleasure of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to (a) the powers conferred upon the Special Commissioners of Income Tax under Section 165 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, are applied only in a few cases of wilful default in which the taxpayer is well able to pay, but cannot be brought under the ordinary powers of recovery.  In fact, only nine cases have been dealt with under this section since April, 1923. In seven of these cases the tax was paid at once; in one case it was paid on the third day after arrest; in the remaining case the defaulter was imprisoned for a month, and then released when evidence was produced that he had squandered his means. <Col N="1619" /> In practically every case the person arrested was known to be about to leave the country to avoid payment.</P>
      <P>With regard to (b), if the power of arrest were to be discontinued in cases of decrees for income tax in the District Courts, the collection of tax would be impossible in many cases, where neither the Collector of Taxes nor the Sheriff could recover the duty by distraint though the taxpayer would be well able to pay. In the past these powers have, through misunderstanding, been applied in some cases in which the person affected, though undoubtedly liable, had become unable to pay the amount due.  While it would not be advisable to make the suggested alterations in procedure, it has been arranged that in future every case involving arrest will be specially examined by the Revenue Commissioners, and the Deputy may rest assured that in no case will a defaulter be arrested if he is genuinely unable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under that clause the Revenue Department have issued warrants for the arrest of persons who offered to pay what appeared to be reasonable instalments of the amount claimed, and will the Minister instruct the Department to accept payments by reasonable instalments where it would impose hardships upon the persons to pay the whole amount in a lump sum?</P>

I think I know something of the case the Deputy had in mind in asking the question, and if the offer of instalments was not accepted in that case, it was due to a misunderstanding, the offer having been made not to the Revenue official, but to the Sheriff.</P>

I may point out, however, for the Deputy's information that the State grant given in this case was similar in character to those given in other cases and was based on such measure of relief as was calculated to limit the charges <Col N="1622" /> on the occupiers of the lands drained or improved to such amounts as they might fairly be expected to bear economically.

    <Title>Public Business. - Housing (Gaeltacht) Bill, 1929&mdash;Second Stage (resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The observations of nearly all the Deputies have been directed to a criticism of the Schedule of the Bill defining the area of the Gaeltacht, within which the Bill will be operative.  I have been pressed, on one hand, to extend the area and, on the other hand, to restrict it.  The principle adopted is that recommended by the Gaeltacht Commission for the general delimitation of the Gaeltacht <Col N="1624" /> after very careful examination of all the implications involved. That was what was adopted by the Government in the White Paper.  I am quite conscious that there is much to be said for both points of view, but I think that the Schedule is probably the best compromise that one could arrive at as between the conflicting points of view.  If those who wish to see the area restricted would read the Bill carefully they would find in sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 11 that assistance is in the first place confined to Irish-speaking homes.  The other governing clause in connection with valuation will confine the matter, I think, nearly as much as they could possibly desire.  In framing the Schedule I did not think it right that any area that would ordinarily be entitled to inclusion in the Gaeltacht should be excluded, but again in reference to sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 11 the effect will be that the practical operations of the Bill will be confined to a much smaller and much more limited number of district electoral divisions than might be imagined from the Schedule itself.  Deputy Séan O'Kelly counted the number of electoral divisions and divided the sum of £250,000 by what he found, namely, 600.  He then went on to make the case that the amount available for each electoral area would be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overriding clauses, especially Section 11, will operate towards confining very considerable areas in which the Housing Bill will be effective, and instead of the six hundred in the Schedule I should say that probably not more than 100 of the areas mentioned will be affected.  It is likely, for instance, that the three-fifths clause will affect only about fifty electoral areas.  I think it was Deputy Tierney suggested that the parish area would be preferable to the electoral area.  We were in the position that we wanted to find some basis for which there were figures available.  There are no figures available as far as the Irish-speaking population in parishes is concerned, but there is as far as the population <Col N="1625" /> in electoral areas is concerned&mdash;the census of 1926.  We based it on the electoral area only because of that reason.  It was also said by some Deputies that very many districts which are Irish-speaking do not appear in the Schedule.  I think it was Deputy Jasper Wolfe mentioned the case of Schull.  I went to the trouble of looking up the census in the case of Schull, and I found that the proportion of Irish speakers is returned as 13.1 per cent., which is considerably below the 25 per cent. required.  The Deputy said, perhaps jocosely, that this might lead to a spurt in the use of the Irish language in districts of that kind.  We would welcome that.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, I think, gives me power to add further district electoral divisions to the Schedule under the regulations: &ldquo;The Minister may by order, whenever he considers it expedient so to do, on account of local variations in the numbers or distribution of Irish-speaking persons, amend the Schedule to this Act by adding thereto any district electoral division,&rdquo; etc.  If what Deputy Wolfe fears or hopes may happen, I will have the power to add that district to the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe's fears would be the correct term, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Law referred to the fact that certain small pockets existed in the Gaeltacht which might be outside the areas referred to in Section 11 (4), that is, those places to which the three-fifths might apply. He said there might be many of these which would be quite as bad as some of the places to which that particular sub-section might apply. That might be, but after all the remaining two-fifths will probably apply to those very areas.  Further exception was taken to the Schedule by several Deputies in that it did not include some areas where housing conditions might be bad, but in which the Irish language is not spoken, and they expressed the view that the Schedule should be based on the economic situation of a given area rather than on the language situation. Of course, the specific purpose of the Bill is to deal with the Gaeltacht, <Col N="1626" /> housing in the Gaeltacht, and therefore it is not really open to me to include any areas outside the Gaeltacht within the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that one could gather from the speeches yesterday afternoon that it is common ground here, that certain special activities and certain special actions should be taken as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, and I think it is better that these should not be complicated by, say, a similar situation outside the Gaeltacht, no matter how desirous it might be to deal with it.  It was said with, I think, a considerable amount of force that the needs of labourers for improved dwellings should be considered.  A Bill to deal with that subject, I should say, would have a completely different form from this Bill. It would have very few points of resemblance to this Bill.  In the first place the machinery would have to be put in force through the local bodies, the county councils, and, as I say, the provisions of such a Bill would be entirely different.  I do not want to show any lack of sympathy with the objects expressed by Deputies who mentioned that.  In fact I was rather strongly impressed with the case put up by Deputy Goulding, that there is land which has been acquired in the past by rural district councils which is available for labourers as sites for houses, and that there might be in some Bill a provision made to enable labourers of their own volition and by their own labour to build houses on those sites.  It is not actually relevant to the Bill, but I think it is an extremely good point.  It is a point to which I intend to draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government. It is a point that is worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases of fishermen were mentioned. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent fishermen utilising it.  If there is a fisherman who is in a position to erect a house which would be his own property in substitution for an existing house which is insanitary and unfit for habitation, this Bill certainly does not preclude him from <Col N="1627" /> its operation, but I would like to stress that it would not be open, say, to a landlord who would let a house to a fisherman or somebody else on a weekly or a monthly tenancy to get a loan under this Act, because that would be entirely foreign to the whole idea of the Act, and such person can utilise other Acts which are general to the other parts of the country.  I think Deputy Clery, Deputy Dr. Tubridy, and some other Deputies mentioned the erection of accommodation for cattle and the erection of hay barns.  That question was considered, and I might say that this whole Bill was considered, by a sub-committee of the Inter-Departmental Committee, which is dealing with the economic situation in the Gaeltacht.  Nearly every one of the points mentioned have been considered by them.  The Bill, I might say, was the result of their deliberations extending over several months. In connection with the hay barn question and the cattle or cowhouses proposal there are existing facilities by way of loans, not by way of grants I admit, for this purpose from the Board of Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is making a mistake.  I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation has taken over that work from the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, and this will come to one of Deputy Moore's points, we anticipate that where new houses are being built the old houses will occasionally be used for cow houses.  I might, since I have dealt with that point, say that the idea behind the provision of Section 6 (3) which Deputy Moore raised with regard to demolition was to prevent the old houses being utilised by other persons coming in and so prevent the perpetuation of the problem.  We are rather enticing them to destroy the old houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the provision for a workroom was raised.  There is no such provision in the Bill, but we <Col N="1628" /> feel that under the provisions of the Bill a person desirous of making a special workroom can do so with the money which will be available. Many persons questioned what I have said&mdash;perhaps I did not make it very clear&mdash;as to the granting of the loan.  When I said that the granting of loans would be regarded more as an emergency measure than the normal procedure what I had in mind was that we were loth to saddle people in the Gaeltacht with perhaps a repayment burden which they could not pay rather than that we had any idea of trying to cut them off from any of the facilities under the Act.  It is notorious of course, that at the moment they find it difficult enough to meet the obligations they have to meet half-yearly or yearly, as the case may be, in the way of rates, Land Commission annuities and so on.  The placing of any further burden on them by way of loan may not be to their advantage.  That is the only consideration which will govern us in the giving of the loans as to the capability of the person to repay them.</P>
    <P>I was rather glad to hear from Deputy Moore also the suggestion of the cluster rather than the isolated house.  That is a thing we have in our minds, but it is a thing which perhaps is not quite as easy as one might imagine.  There may be many difficulties first of all as to the willingness of the people concerned to go into the cluster, and secondly, perhaps some further arrangement with regard to the land immediately abutting the house where they would be living.  It would be advisable from many points of view, and especially from one particular one which we have been considering, that of afforestation, or of having a sheltered belt around the houses.  It would be much easier to deal with the question of a sheltered belt if you had a group of houses than if you had isolated houses. Anyhow, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent that, and we are keeping it in mind.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that use should be made of local assistance <Col N="1629" /> in the administration of the Bill.  I happen to know that the work of the particular parish councils&mdash;I think they were so called under the C.D.B. &mdash;was not exactly free from criticism. I am perfectly aware of the fact that assistance of the kind is desirable and is, of course, in the main, particularly helpful for a task of this kind which works in so very much with, say, the operations of the local doctor, the schoolmaster or the clergy.  Their co-operation in a matter of this kind is, of course, easily recognisable by anybody.  We are not losing sight of that, and, in fact, as far as the clergy are concerned we have been in many matters consulting them, and have got very gladly from them very useful help.</P>
    <P>There were references made to bouquets.  The bouquets must be an imagination of the Fianna Fáil Party, because, candidly, I did not hear any one of them from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who presumably know very well that Ministers normally do not look for bouquets when they are bringing forward what is an ordinary matter of course.  I do not look for bouquets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only persons who referred to bouquets were members on the opposite benches, who felt from reading through the Bill that bouquets would be thrown which actually were not thrown.  They thought of bouquets which were not thrown.  The only bouquets thrown, or rather I should say wreaths, which were laid by the Fianna Fáil Party were laid on the grave of the old C.D.B.  I do not say a word against the old C.D.B.  The old C.D.B. did a great deal of work, and a great deal of the work of my Department <Col N="1630" /> must be built on information collected by the old C.D.B.  They must follow the lines the old C.D.B. followed.  But the fact is this Bill is to provide for persons who were not touched by the old C.D.B., because they were so submerged, and the problem was so frightfully difficult to tackle, that they passed them over and dealt with a slightly easier but very useful problem, the striping of land in the case of persons just a little better than the persons being dealt with in this Bill.  They did not actually get down to the particular persons this Bill is designed to deal with.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the question of the purchasing of material for building in the Gaeltacht; that is a question which can be easily considered, but the question will arise as to the price at which you can get your material. There is a provision in the Bill, as you know, for combined purchasing. If the particular applicant so desires, and if it will be to his benefit, the Department will help him, especially where there is a group in a particular area having houses built.  It will probably be a great deal to their benefit that the Department should arrange for the supply of material. They will probably get it at a cheaper rate, and be able to see that the standard of the stuff was up to the required mark.  Outside that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent persons buying their stuff in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jasper Wolfe referred to the question of the transport of materials to the islands.  Whenever I say anything at all it is said that is another one of the promises of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  I was nearly making a promise to Deputy Wolfe that he can, quite safely I hope, in a very short time go and see his constituents in Cape Clear.  Arrangements are being provided for Cape Clear especially and some other islands off the mainland from the point of view of transport.</P>

    <P>Another point that was made was that the Bill made no provision to enable local authorities to contribute to the cost of the scheme.  I might say, first of all, that it is a particular <Col N="1631" /> type of Bill.  &ldquo;An rud is annamh is iongantach.&rdquo;  I should say the one person who got that point the most explicitly was Deputy Flinn.  It is a Bill which essentially looks for the co-operation of the person who is desiring the house.  He is doing a great portion of the building himself.  He is looking for the stone, doing the carting, and the ordinary work practically of the building of the house until it comes to the necessity for getting the handy man.  I do not know how many weeks he will be required. The Bill is different in that way from any other Housing Bill.  It is not one that looks to the local authority.  It is essentially a kind of co-operation between the man who seeks the house and the Government who lends the money for the particular things, until he reaches the position when he wants the door and the window frames and the placing of these things.  Furthermore, we felt that local authorities are sufficiently burdened at the moment with many other commitments.  We felt, taking into consideration exactly what I have said in regard to the co-operation of the person desiring the house to be built, that the Bill would meet the situation without the local authority.</P>

    <P>Deputy Clery raised the question of administration.  No part of the £250,000 will go towards administration. The administration may be the work of several different departments. The agricultural overseers, for instance, are purely a matter for the Department of Agriculture and will, in the ordinary way, be in the Department's Vote.  This £250,000 is to be devoted entirely to the loans and grants.  The whole sum will be <Col N="1632" /> available for the purposes of the Bill.</P>

I think that these particulars ought to be in some form in the House records.  As far as I understood it, the bought materials and the cost of transport comes to £130.  Hired labour is £5.

He said it might only apply to 50 of the areas.  We are in the position that we do not know what areas.  We have not got the census figures, and we do not know what areas are classed as Irish-speaking, so it will be extremely difficult for us to put in amendments until the Minister can circulate information showing us the areas where the 21/- valuation will arise, and the areas that can be classed as Irish-speaking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we felt that was a fair basis on which you could get at the really submerged.  If you take 30/-, which was the figure on which the old C.D.B. worked, you would take in a much wider area, many portions of which could easily avail of existing Housing Acts.  We are trying to get down to the person who had never been able to avail of any Acts heretofore, including the Labourers Acts.  They were excluded from the Labourers Acts because these Acts were confined to persons who had not more than one <Col N="1634" /> acre of land.  Most of the persons to whom this Bill will apply have more than one acre of land.  They were not touched by the former Housing Acts, and the former Housing Acts may apply to some of the persons Deputy Derrig refers to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made that perfectly clear.  My only responsibility for the Schedule was to take from the census any place that is 25 per cent. Irish-speaking.  Galway was omitted by mistake.  There were two other areas, one surrounding Maynooth College, and the other Rockwell College, which were brought to 25 per cent. Irish-speaking by the fact that every student in the Colleges was Irish-speaking.</P>

So long as I have the feeling that it is being spent wisely and that we are dealing with the persons with whom I want to deal, the more quickly the money is spent the more I will like it.  A sum of £250,000 will be made available by the Government.  If we are able to spend it quickly, well and good, but I want to make sure that we are going to touch the persons I have set out to deal with.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to take any steps after these houses have been built to see that <Col N="1635" /> they are not allowed to be mortgaged? Does he intend to take any precaution to see that the houses are not allowed to pass out of the hands of tenants into the hands of landlords? I believe if that ultimately took place it would defeat the whole object of the Bill.  If, after the houses are built, a tenant gets into debt he might be inclined to mortgage the premises or he might sell them to the landlord who might then put in a tenant at an exorbitant rent.  Does he intend to make any effort to prohibit such a thing happening?</P>

Deputy Davin has referred to the handy-man.  Deputy Davin does not seem to know that there does actually exist in the West of Cork and Kerry, in Connemara and Donegal&mdash;I know it from childhood&mdash;a type of person who is quite a handy mason and who is able to put in windows and doors, erect roofs and the rest of it.

      <P>With regard to item 3, the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, I would like if the Minister would kindly give us some information as to the purpose of that Act.  The description of it seems rather ambiguous. It reads: &ldquo;To enable the sanitary authorities to carry out improvement schemes for providing houses for agricultural labourers.&rdquo; That does not convey much to the average Deputy, and it should be worth while to have some information upon it.  With regard to the Motor Car Act, I think that if the Minister's description of some of the sections be correct the House should not pass it.  I would have a conscientious objection to voting for a Bill that proposes to punish a man who refuses to give a false name and address.  I cannot believe that such an Act ever went through the British Parliament, bad and all as they may be over there.  I cannot believe that the Bill is quite as bad as the Minister represents it.  With regard to some of the other provisions, it looks rather curious to be passing a Bill here to continue the speed limit when the Minister for Justice has issued instructions that the speed limit is not to be observed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago. The Minister has admitted it in this House.  I wonder was the Minister for Local Government and Public <Col N="1639" /> Health a party to that or was he consulted about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The speed limit was suspended.  There are some other provisions in this Bill, too, that are rather foolish to enact.  For instance, a person under 17 years of age is disqualified from obtaining a licence for driving a motor car.  The Minister must be pretty well aware that a good proportion of the motor cars in the country are driven by youths under 17, yet here we are going through the formality of enacting that licences be not issued to persons under 17, while every day in the week we know that such licences are issued.  There is another foolish provision in the Act, too, and that is that a police constable is, under one of the sections, empowered to demand the production of a driving licence.  It is quite unreasonable to expect people to have their driving licences with them always, and such a law is only an irritant.  A great many foolish prosecutions have taken place as regards that provision. When the Act is being revised, as I understand is to be done soon, I do not think that provision should be left in.  I suggest to the Minister also, with regard to the forthcoming Bill, that the rules governing the use of trade licences are unsatisfactory inasmuch as they are extremely vague.  The law, both in Great Britain and in this country, causes great discontent amongst those concerned: in fact, they cannot find out what the law is at all.  There have been several decisions given in the English courts on the question, but there has never been any finality reached.  I think the Minister would be well advised to look into that matter before he brings forward the new Bill to deal with all these questions of licences and registration of motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further matter to which I want to call attention in connection with this Bill.  Item 11, dealing with Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) <Col N="1640" /> Act, enables the Minister for Transport to authorise so and so.  I thought we had discovered during the past few weeks that &ldquo;The Minister for Transport&rdquo; is a useless term in this country.  Does not that totally invalidate the Act?  I thought it had been found that nobody was named in the Adaptation of Enactments Act to take the place of the Minister for Transport, and that, consequently, we have an Act the provisions of which cannot be applied.  We shall be glad to have the Minister's explanation. With regard to item 12, I would be glad if the Minister would make a statement about it. It deals with an Act enabling land to be acquired compulsorily by the State for the local authorities.  Does that only apply in connection with relief grants?</P>
    <P>I have already made a complaint as to the working of the Combined Purchasing Act, and I hope the Minister will be able to deal with it. I can assure him that the matter I mentioned is causing great dissatisfaction all over the country.  The shopkeepers are complaining that a great deal of trade to which they are entitled is being lost to them through the officers of local authorities purchasing certain requirements for their private purposes through the Combined Purchasing Department. They feel that the Act, even at its best and worked in an entirely proper way, is not equitable to them, inasmuch as it deprives them of an opportunity of contracting for the sale of goods which ordinarily should be their right.  But as it is worked in many places they feel it is worked even more to their detriment than was intended.  I think that the Minister should be prepared to give us a guarantee that these abuses will cease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought up some cases with regard to the Combined Purchasing Department here on a previous occasion.  At that time the Minister for Finance told me that it was better that that matter should be dealt with on the Committee Stage. I also asked the Minister for Local Government if he got a list of the <Col N="1641" /> complaints received from the South Cork Board of Assistance during the past 12 months with regard to goods not being up to quality.  The Trade Department seems to be more or less a dead letter as far as the Central or Combined Purchasing Committee is concerned.  It is bad enough to have all those contracts up here in Dublin while the rates are being paid by the people in Cork, but it is far worse when you have shoddy supplied by those contractors.  In nine cases out of ten the material supplied is not up to sample.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few specific cases here in proof of my contention.  On 24th September, 1929, the South Cork Board of Assistance got this from the Trade Department when they complained that the goods supplied were not up to the specification:&mdash;&ldquo;Sample is not considered up to specification; acceptance is, however, recommended.&rdquo;  Though the sample was not up to specification the Trade Department recommended its acceptance anyway.  I have a whole list of those cases here and in every one of them, or in practically every one of them, the Trade Department recommended the acceptance of the goods though the material was not up to the standard. Those contractors forward samples. They have to enter into competition with other contractors to be put on the trade list.  The next thing that happens is that the contractor supplies inferior quality goods, and the contractor who supplies decent goods at fair prices is cut out in favour of the contractor who supplies the shoddy.  It is absolutely useless, the storekeeper reports, sending samples to the Trades Department.  The samples are kept there for six or seven months before any reply is sent.  This is one example of it: &ldquo;1,003 yards of grey shirting received November 28th, 1927; sample sent November 29th, 1927.  No report received and second sample sent June 1st, 1928, seven months afterwards: goods taken into stock on the 12th June,&rdquo; without any report having been received whether the goods are up to specification or <Col N="1642" /> not.  This is another case: &ldquo;Seven pieces of union satin ticken received 18th November, 1927.  Sample sent 26th November, 1927.  No report received.  Second sample sent 1st June, 1928.  No report yet received (that was 25th July, 1928), and the goods still held up.&rdquo;  How the Minister expects any institution could carry on with that condition of affairs prevailing I cannot understand. If, in connection with goods contracted for in November, we cannot have a statement from the Trades Department as to whether or not they are up to specification up to the following July, then it would be better for the Minister for Local Government to scrap the Trades Department altogether and not be putting the burden on the shoulders of the taxpayers, as it has proved to be both worthless and useless, as shown by these reports. That is a condition of affairs which the Minister should look into and put an end to.  The official responsible for that state of affairs should be got rid of&mdash;I do not care who he is.  All these reports for the fortnightly meetings are in the same strain.  On practically every occasion the material received was not up to the standard.  If we are going to have contractors taking contracts and supplying goods of an inferior quality, and at the last moment we have a recommendation from the Trades Department that we had better accept the goods, then it is time that we should know where we are.</P>
    <P>This is another report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the half-year ended 30th September, 1928, Walpole Brothers made five deliveries of grey calico, totalling nearly 2,500 yards.  The whole on test was inferior stuff, and was rejected. On October 25th we received another consignment unidentifiable by any marks until the invoice came later.  It seems useless to make a fifth test of their goods.  Please instruct.  Order:&mdash; Sample to be forwarded to Trade Department for report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> The Storekeeper also reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The 8 pieces white twill sheeting twice rejected by the Board, and later, through the advocacy of Mr. Meagher, Trades Department, ordered to be accepted, have now been received.  We have examined them and find that they are now not single pieces, but fragments.  It emerged from Mr. Meagher's arguments in favour of the acceptance of these goods that when the delivery was returned from here the contractors sent samples for test to Belfast; that as a result of this test they communicated with the Trades Department, and that the latter sent an inspector to take further samples.  Between the jigs and the reels there must have been a good deal of material taken off for testing purposes.  The contractors, however, in their letter to me returning these goods, say they returned them at the original lengths.  That is to say, we are expected to pay for all the sampling (Belfast and Dublin) which has taken place, as well as for the sample we sent forward ourselves.  I suggest now that the stocktaker who is at present in the House be asked to measure these goods, that his figures be taken, and that only for these and for the half yard sent for sample by us should we pay.  Order:&mdash; Adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the officials of the Trades Department come down and urge the acceptance of goods which are not up to standard, it shows exactly where the shoe is pinching.  One of the arguments used for the combined purchasing scheme was that it did away with any favouritism towards local contractors.  But if the favouritism, or what some people would call corrupt practices, is going to be transferred from the local body in Cork to the Trades Department in Dublin, I would sooner see the local body getting anything that is going.  I am afraid that is what it amounts to.  The Trades <Col N="1644" /> Department have proved to be absolutely inefficient.  When a sample is sent to them and they can give no report for ten months, it is time that the Minister who is responsible should either scrap the Department altogether or get rid of the officials responsible for that state of affairs.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Moore's question with regard to the Labourers Act, 1883, Deputies know that local bodies can buy land and build labourers' cottages on it.  The Act of 1883, although a temporary Act, is the foundation of their power to do so, and the yearly continuance of that Act continues these fundamental powers and continues all the amending Acts to that particular Act.  So that, except we continue the Labourers Act of 1883 in the Expiring Laws Bill every year, we do away with the whole foundation upon which labourers' cottages can be built in rural areas.  The question might naturally arise as to why, if the Act itself is a satisfactory one, it is not made permanent.  We got it over here in 1922 after nineteen years of impermanence and I am not aware that there is any very serious difficulty either in getting the work done or in the administration by reason of the fact that it is not a permanent Act.  No doubt in time, if it is necessary, the Act will be replaced by a permanent Act, but I do not think that any point arises as to why we should not continue the Act under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Motor Car Act of 1903 is in practically the same position.  I hope before we rise for the Recess to introduce a Traffic Bill that will dispose of the necessity for having this Act appearing in the Expiring Laws Bill next year.  When that Bill is before the House, all the points raised by Deputy Moore and others from time to time can be raised, but if there is any particular point in the administration of the traffic law as it exists at present that requires to be discussed, I think in all fairness it would be more satisfactory to discuss it on a motion, or to raise it in some other way.  To attempt to discuss <Col N="1645" /> small points in traffic administration without adequate notice is very difficult, and, I suggest, on the eve of the introduction of a Bill which will codify and put into a satisfactory condition our traffic law based on modern conditions and on the consideration that has been given to the matter by the Traffic Committee, would not be very profitable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, and asked what was the idea of continuing it.  I do not know that it is particularly required, but except there is some case made for dropping the Act and doing away with the powers that local bodies have under it, I do not see any reason for dropping it at present.  It gives local bodies limited powers to acquire land for the construction of houses and for the building of roads by relief schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was whether this is a power that could ordinarily be exercised only in connection with relief grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an Act to provide for the spending of State moneys provided definitely for relief works in which power was given to local authorities specially in connection with that Act.  It enabled them to acquire land in an easier and a quicker way than it would have been possible to acquire it under the ordinary law, which involves perhaps rather elaborate inquiries; that is the only advantage in it.  At present there is no money provided by the State for this particular purpose, and there was no intention to provide any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised on the Harbours Tribunal is one that the Deputy will probably find out in connection with recent legislation bearing upon the Minister for Transport.  The Adaptation of Enactments Act provided that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take the place of the Minister for Transport in respect of certain Statutes, but I think the difficulty before the House recently was upon an agreement which had <Col N="1646" /> been entered into between two parties, and that in that agreement, which was not a Statute, the Minister for Transport was mentioned. It was felt by the private parties who wanted to solve the matter that a Statute was necessary for them.  But it did not appear correct at any rate that we could stretch the Adaptation of Enactments Act which applied to the Minister for Transport in Statutes to the agreement as between more or less private persons.</P>
    <P>The combined purchasing position, as far as I can understand Deputy Moore's point, is that local traders take exception to employees of local bodies buying goods from firms which appear on the Combined Purchasing List.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no details of any abuse before me in connection with that matter. I think the Deputy complained on previous occasions, but as I say I have no details before me and I think it would be very difficult to provide machinery by which a person, because he was an employee of a local body, should be prevented buying wherever he wanted to buy.  I do admit that there are dangers in the way where employees of local bodies can get favours from persons that are supplying goods to the local bodies but I think that that danger would be quite as existent if goods were supplied by the local traders as by a contractor.  We can hardly impose upon a contractor that if he comes on the Combined Purchasing List he shall not engage in any private business with other persons.  I think that, except instances could be brought to our notice that assured us very definitely that there was abuse in it, it would be very difficult for either the Minister or the members of the local body who control that staff to interfere.  The firms that get upon the Combined Purchasing List are firms that get there by competitive tenders, their tenders being submitted to a special committee representative of the different <Col N="1647" /> classes of the local bodies that go into these tenders and make recommendations to the Minister for Local Government as to who shall be put upon the list.  In so far as the question of getting on the list arises it will be impossible for an employee of a local body to influence the getting on the list any particular contractor.  The only danger there is, that the local contractor who is giving favours to employees of the local board might be tempted to send inferior articles to that institution; but in that case he has to run the gauntlet of the inspector of the Combined Purchasing Department who inspects the stores of the different institutions from time to time, takes samples of the goods, and has them tested and examined.  So I do not know there is very great danger and I have never had evidence before me that there has been an abuse of the smallest kind.  If there is very great likelihood of danger I would like to have it pointed out.  If there has been any volume of abuse I would like to have details, but in the absence of one or the other I do not see that I am called upon to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry's resurrected allegations as to delays in dealing with samples, have already been disposed of.  Deputy Corry has suggested that material was sent up in a particular month, say November, and that nothing was heard about it until June, and then that additional samples had to be sent up again in June.  Deputy Corry is a member of this House and he is also a member of the Board for which he speaks.  It is astounding that from the month of November until June he should be silent on a matter like that with the whole Question Paper in front of him from day to day.  He resurrects allegations that as far as I know have been completely disposed of in correspondence with the South Cork Board of Health by absolute and specific reference to specific dates.  I would suggest to Deputy Corry that he should look at the correspondence of the South Cork Board of Health on the matter and if he still feels <Col N="1648" /> that we have something on our conscience I would like him to examine his own conscience as to why he has been silent all this time.  The combined purchasing system has from time to time been condemned generally and its administration has been condemned, but in spite of the fact that the purchases under the combined purchasing system probably exceed £700,000 a year&mdash;in spite of that, and of the large number of institutions that deal with combined purchasing I do not think that I have had a single question put up to me during the last twelve months arising out of any case of dissatisfaction or friction as between the local bodies and the Department here.  I am speaking now from recollection, but I doubt if that is so.  The South Cork Board of Health during the year ending 31st March, 1929, purchased £9,066 worth of goods.  I do not think that I have been asked a single question about any difficulty in connection with that matter. There have been difficulties, but they have not been brought up here. They might have been brought up any day that the Dáil was sitting except Friday.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister mean that every difference of opinion between his Department and a local body should be made the subject of question and answer here? If he does, I will guarantee that I will have at least fourteen questions every day.  I do not want to be occupying the time of the Dáil uselessly and I have long ago given up hope of getting a reasonable answer from the Minister's Department, and the South Cork Board of Assistance have also given up hope long ago of getting fair play from the Department. Statements were made that a period of eight months had been allowed to elapse from the time the material was sent up until a reply was received.  The Minister asked me some time ago about my conscience and I ask him now about his.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is discussing the matter in its broadest generalities to invite the Minister to consider all cases that have been the subject of correspondence between the Cork Board of Health and the Department within the last twelve months.  During the last twelve months there have been twenty-one samples received from the Cork Board of Health, and of these the Department were only able to recommend that four be rejected.  The regulations that govern the working of the Combined Purchasing Act are printed in English and Irish and have often been referred to here.  I would refer the Deputy again to Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8, which make it perfectly clear to either an English or Irish speaking body that if they get materials which are not up to standard they can go and get the stuff elsewhere, and can tell the contractor to come and take his stuff, or they can accept the stuff and pay a reduced price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> The prices of samples are taken annually by the inspectors of the Combined Purchasing Department, and where doubt exists, or where it is clear to the inspectors and advisors of the Department that stuff has been accepted that is not up to the standard, bodies are informed as to what reduction should be made in the prices that they are going to pay.  I have a list before me in which dozens of samples have been taken.  The local bodies were instructed not to pay more than a certain price, being a reduction of so much per cent., or a reduction of so many shillings and so many pence in respect of a particular article or particular type of goods.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, out of 21 samples of textiles, four were recommended for rejection by the Department.  I do not know whether in any of these cases a cut in price was recommended.  So far as I know there was no cut in price recommended.  I know that there have been occasions on which the Cork Board have been persuaded that the action of the Department was right in recommending acceptance. Every member of that body except the Deputy was persuaded. If the Deputy comes up against a case like that he can do so either by question or by letter to me.  The merits of the case can then be gone into.  The combined purchasing system which, on the purchase of road materials, bitumen and tar, saved £15,000 last year, is too valuable a weapon in the hands of the local authorities to have either its value obscured or the prestige of its machinery damaged by general complaints that create an atmosphere of discontent <Col N="1651" /> and suspicion, complaints such as Deputy Corry makes, and which, in his own words, amount to charges of corrupt practices against the Department.  If the Deputy is sincere in making the best possible purchases for local bodies or for using the machinery available, he will take his sticks one by one, help to break them, and assist me to do the same.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that of 21 samples, 4 were rejected.  If he could give the number of samples not up to standard we could get more satisfactory conclusions.  The report I read a few minutes ago states that eight pieces of white twill sheeting were twice rejected by the Board, but later, through the advocacy of an official of the Department, were ordered to be accepted. That will show the length to which the Department will go.  Here was material which the Board reported was not up to sample and which was rejected on two occasions by them, but an official was sent down from the Department, and he urged the Board to accept it, even though he admitted that the material was not up to sample.</P>

      <P>The objection is that I, as a member of that local body, have my duties down there in Cork on that local body to carry out.  I do not believe in bringing these duties up here every day in the week. If I did, I promise you that I would keep the Minister going.  If I had to bring up every complaint as to the administration of his Department I would keep him going every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and keep him going every night in addition, on the motion for the adjournment. The case I make against his Department is that we advertise for goods when we want them.  Two or three thousand yards of stuff arrived down there, and it was six or seven months before a report was received from his <Col N="1652" /> Department stating whether the goods were up to sample or not.  In the meantime, the goods were required, and they had to be taken into stock whether they were up to sample or not.  The goods had to be accepted because of the laziness, or something else, in his Department which did not allow of the stuff being tested or of a report being sent down.  There is something wrong with his Department when that is allowed to occur.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Corry has made one point which the Minister has not attempted to answer, and it might be well to give attention to it.  With regard to the delay, Deputy Corry has given a specific instance showing that there was at least one case of a sample being sent up from the South Cork Board of Health to the Central Purchasing Department.  They were not tested for six months, and the Board got no reply as to the reliability of that sample, as to whether that sample was up to standard or not.  Is it a fact there was such delay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it very much.  I stated very definitely in reply to the general remarks of Deputy Corry that he was resurrecting allegations of delay which had been completely disposed of in correspondence from my Department to the South Cork Board of Health on this specific point.  I invite the Deputy to refer to the correspondence between the Department and the Board of Health.  If he has any reason then for thinking that the correspondence does not cover the case that he is bringing up, let him bring up that case to me.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows as well as I or anybody who has any knowledge of the official concerned, that that man is a particularly valuable public servant, and a very efficient official.  I refer to the storekeeper of the South Cork Board of Health.  If he made a statement of <Col N="1653" /> that kind in his report to the Board, I would accept his statement over that of any official I know of.  There is no official of the Minister's Department or any Department whose word I would be more ready to accept.  If there is a statement in a report made by that officer of the nature to which Deputy Corry referred, I think there must be something in it, and it deserves to be inquired into.  Further, I would say, despite the Minister's lecture to Deputy Corry, that he was quite right in bringing up a matter here, now or at any time a year hence, if he thinks he has a case to bring up. He is quite within his right when an opportunity of this kind occurs, and when the Department is under discussion, in bringing up a case and in having a matter of this kind ventilated.</P>

      <P>My anxiety is to improve the method of doing things on the part of some members on the other side of the House.  I am suggesting that it is simply running away from doing the thing at the right moment, and running away from giving a chance to those concerned of looking at the facts as they are, to leave a matter over from November, 1928 to June, 1929, in the first instance, as Deputy Corry admits he has done, and to leave it further over from June, 1929, until November, 1929, in the second instance, before attempting to look at facts straight in the face. I do not accept Deputy O'Kelly's personal estimate of the different people who inhabit the country.  I am prepared to examine cases that are put before me and to examine them in every detail.</P>

      <P>He also stated that there are many cases where officials <Col N="1654" /> of the Department have recommended the acceptance of the goods at reduced prices.  Does the Minister approve of that practice?  Is it not a very dangerous practice to follow up?  If that is a matter of policy, that is in itself a wrong policy to be adopted by the Department. I have experience of public bodies for many years and it has always been my experience, where the contractors were local traders and where goods were not up to sample, that the goods were either sent back or they were purchased elsewhere at the contractor's expense, but there was never a case in which a compromise was come to.  That practice of compromising on the question of samples is a most dangerous one, whether in the case of goods supplied by local contractors or those supplied under the combined purchasing system.  I suppose this law will be extended for another period, but I would strongly recommend to the Minister that the practice which he says has been going on under his Department, of allowing a compromise on goods obviously not up to standard, should cease and that he should instruct his officials in future where contractors are not fulfilling the terms of their contract that the goods should be returned and that the Board should purchase other goods at the contractor's expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite support the attitude which Deputy O'Hanlon takes up in connection with this particular matter.  To a very large extent we are endeavouring to encourage local authorities to act strictly along the lines of Sections 5 and 6 according to which they will not accept goods that are not up to standard.  This, however, has to be borne in mind at times in connection with this matter.  One of the things that the Combined Purchasing Department set out to do was to encourage Irish manufacture.  In many cases we get textiles and woollens of Irish manufacture from Irish firms, and when you come across cases where there is a slight difference between the sample and the standard of the stuff that is sent <Col N="1655" /> in to the local authority by a manufacturer there was a margin of discretion, which in the initial stages of putting this Act into operation and in the initial stages when Irish manufacturers were getting on their feet, was allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, however, say that where discrimination is exercised in nine cases out of ten discrimination is exercised in respect of the locally purchased article rather than the article purchased from a manufacturer.  In nearly every article I have mentioned in the sheets before me, where the acceptance at a slight reduction is made, it is in the case where a local authority has purchased locally instead of going to the contractor, but as I say, generally speaking, I support Deputy O'Hanlon's attitude in the matter, and more and more the Department is working towards that end.  We are entering into arrangements with contractors to organise purchasing by local authorities in the way that will be best for the local body, and best for the contractors themselves, and we do expect that the contractors will live up to their samples.  We are doing our best to see that they do it.  There are occasions in which discretion may be dictated by the circumstances. But these cases must become more and more limited, I feel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned that in some cases where discretion has been used, it has been given for the purpose of encouraging Irish manufacture.  That on its face value looks a rather laudable thing to do, but on the other hand, does the Minister imagine that by allowing Irish manufacturers to produce articles which are not up to sample that he is doing something for the purpose of encouraging Irish manufacture?  On the contrary, is he not getting Irish manufacturers into a very bad <Col N="1656" /> groove by letting them manufacture materials not up to sample and allowing them to get away with it? That is not encouraging Irish manufacture. It is not making the Irish manufacturers honest traders.  As long as there is a possibility of his Department allowing the acceptance of goods not up to sample, whether they are Irish or not, the manufacturer will always try and get away with it.  He made no distinction between local traders tendering and manufacturers in this question of discrimination, and I was pleased to hear from the Minister that he takes my view.  I think he may go the whole hog, and in future say where goods are supplied, they must either be up to sample or will be rejected by his Department and the local body.</P>

      <Col N="1657" /> I do not know whether that is common with the department.  I think it is not common.  I would say if it were we would have heard a good deal about it.  Here is a case, and it has been put to the Minister two or three times, and it is brushed aside, and Deputy Corry, he says in his usual lecturing way, ought to have brought it here before.  He may try the schoolmaster elsewhere; it will not go down here.  Deputy Corry is right in bringing that, no matter when it happened, before this House and asking for the courtesy of an explanation.  To be treated in a schoolmasterly fashion is not good enough.  Either this fact is correct or it is not.  Personally speaking, I am all for this combined purchasing department, and my anxiety in helping Deputy Corry or anybody else to investigate a case of this kind is to see that these things will not happen.  It is not good enough if these facts are as set out here.</P>

Therefore, I infer silence means that it is correct.  It is correct, but if it is correct it ought not to happen, and it is with a view to asking the Minister to tighten matters of that kind up and to increase efficiency and confidence in that Department that I would ask him to investigate that matter.

      <P>I am afraid I will have to give up schoolmastering, the schoolmastering of people who take themselves so seriously as to rise, at twenty minutes to five on the 28th November, 1929, and to ask, I suppose, each of two persons three times within the last twenty-five minutes what about what happened on such-a-date in November, 1927, as if nothing happened after it until June, 1928.  Here, I understood, as a matter of fact, that Deputy Corry was raising the matter about seven months after the June he mentioned, <Col N="1658" /> but I see that it is about nineteen months.  I will give up schoolmastering and will be prepared to deal with cases of complaints which are put up to me.</P>
      <P>I would, however, ask Deputy Corry, who takes such an interest in this matter, to do what I suggest Deputy Corry would do if he is interested in this November, 1927 matter, to see the correspondence that possibly followed the raising of this matter with the Department.</P>

      <P>I have a case here on the 14/8/'29, which shows that the same game is still being continued by his Department.  This is the case.  If the Minister thinks he has got rid of the official concerned, he has not got rid of him yet.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This complaint of Messrs. Usher &amp; Co. is a legitimate one. Payment is held up because only a part delivery of the goods has been approved and taken into stock.  One delivery each of Grey Drugget and Bengal Stripe still awaits decision under test.  One sample of these materials was sent on March 7th.  Another was asked for and sent on May 1st. No decision has yet been received from the Trade Department.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision was yet arrived at on the 14/8/'29.  The Minister seems to be insulted because we suggest that there should be any suspicion attached to his Department, but that raises the suspicion in regard to the Department and a very legitimate one, the suspicion that the reason why the report was not sent down on these tests was in order that our local body would be compelled through necessity to take in those articles without having to report at all.  That is the whole bottom of it. We advertise for every article when we want it and we are eight months before we can take it into stock because apparently the contractor has pull or influence enough with the Department to prevent a report <Col N="1659" /> being sent down for five or six months.  When he accuses local bodies of corrupt practices, I tell him to clean his own house.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Local Suppliers' Advisory Committee that is set up under the Act, I would like the Minister to say whether it is changed from time to time or has it been the same from the time of its inception.  Can we have the names of that committee? Further, with regard to the reply which he gave yesterday that fish was not one of the commodities dealt with under the Combined Purchasing Act, I would like to know if that is final or is there any chance of its being considered?  It would appear that there is a great opportunity under the machinery of the Combined Purchasing Act for helping the fishermen.  Nobody will deny, I think, that they require help. It is quite clear, of course, that the difficulty of a regular supply is there.  Everyone admits that.  But, at least there is room for a partial success in the matter.  There are certain fishing ports where if there was a contract offered the men would be more than glad to see that the contract was fulfilled.  Everybody knows that the fisheries are dying very fast and that very extreme measures will have to be taken to save them.  This is not the occasion, I suppose, to go into it fully, but at least I would like to know from the Minister whether there is any chance of this matter being reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point I raised a while ago, I am afraid the Minister entirely misunderstood me.  The point was simply this, that supplies were needed for an institution.  They are contracted for under the Combined Purchasing Act.  The secretary, say, of that institution wants similar goods for his own household and he uses the privilege of the contract to get his private supplies. The Minister may think that is purely imaginary, but his own Department, to my own knowledge, confessed that such abuses have <Col N="1660" /> occurred and apologised for them. Though I have heard of no definite cases for the past year, I can tell him that no week passes without my getting complaints that that sort of thing is going on.  I, like Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly, am entirely in favour of the principle of combined purchasing, but it would do a lot to popularise it if the shopkeepers could be free from that anxiety or grievance that they are being deprived of certain trade in addition to the trade that is being done properly under the Act.  They feel, however, that they are being deprived of other trade by irregular means.</P>

I could ask to have it further considered by the committee and by the Department. There is no point in mentioning the names of the committee here.  It changes from time to time, according to the wishes of the bodies that are represented upon it, the county councils, the municipal councils, and the General Council of County Councils.</P>

I have given him particulars of a case sent forward on March 7th, 1929, and no report was received up to the 14th August, 1929. If he would give us an explanation of how that occurred we would be very grateful.  In another case the storekeeper states:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The handling of samples of clothing materials for test continues to be hopelessly inefficient. We are now awaiting reports on samples sent forward May 1st&mdash;<Col N="1661" /> two samples (second lot), June 5th &mdash;6 samples.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were waiting for one report from May 1st until July 10th, 1929, and for another report from March 7th until 14th August, 1929.  If the Minister could explain that delay in his Department perhaps we would be able to get a little further.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the same Act, there is a question of the Alien Restrictions Act which has been renewed from year to year.  It is an Act which goes behind the establishment of the Dáil.  I asked for details about the legislation which had been promised dealing with the naturalisation of aliens.  The answer I got to the question was that the Minister for Justice did not seem to think that the one Act could deal with the two. I would like to know whether the legislation that is going to be brought in will cover not only the restriction of aliens coming into the country but will also deal with those conditions under which aliens will be able to become naturalised <Col N="1662" /> citizens of the country.  I think the Minister for Finance intended to deal with this matter.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government could tell us?</P>

      <P>May I ask a question with regard to the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923?  The Memorandum issued in connection with this Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act mainly provides for the validation of the County Schemes of poor relief.  It is necessary to continue it pending a more comprehensive re-organisation of the law relating to the relief of the poor.  The report of the Commission appointed to inquire into the laws affecting the sick and destitute poor and the insane poor has been considered and proposals for legislation of a permanent nature will be introduced. A note on this Act is attached.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he has any idea when such legislation will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of matters arising out of the report which the Deputy spoke about that are being dealt with administratively. If there is any particular point that the Deputy requires special information about, if he will put down a question I will have it answered.  On the general question of the code, the codifying of the whole poor law is engaging the attention of the Department at the present moment.  A very considerable amount of work has been done in connection with it.  I mentioned, I think in the Seanad last year, that that was being done.  A certain amount of progress has been made since, but I am not able to report progress to the extent that I could suggest a particular date or <Col N="1663" /> give a general idea as to when legislation may be introduced.  I realise that the permanent Act dealing with the Poor Law is an Act that is urgently necessary, and I am having the work, as far as that Act is concerned, speeded forward as best I can.  If, in the meantime, there are any particular aspects of the report that the Deputy would like to have information about, I will get that information for him if he will be good enough to put me a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter the Executive Council have not committed themselves to the acceptance of any of the recommendations of the Commission.  What has been explained is that the actuary who had to cover the ground of the report as to the conditions upon which any scheme could be set up has asked for a certain amount of information and I think there are something like a dozen headings of the information he has asked for that are still dependent in one way or another upon information that can come only from further examination of the Census returns of 1926.  In so far as it is possible to speed up that information it is being done, but it would be impossible for the Executive Council either to commit themselves to a policy on the matter or to prepare their proposals without the actuarial report which we cannot satisfactorily have without the information we are waiting for from the Census returns.</P>

      <P>The Act that is being continued is simply an Act which prevents aliens entering the country <Col N="1664" /> and remaining here, except with licence.  It is operated jointly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Justice, through the police or other sources, has to satisfy himself as to the general character and desirability of aliens. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has the duty of seeing whether, in view of employment conditions here and the work which the alien coming in proposes to engage in, it is justifiable to allow him to enter and remain.</P>
      <P>The question of naturalisation is a different one; it is under active consideration at the moment.  As a matter of fact, it was being very actively dealt with at one period and was dropped a year ago.  It is proposed that the legislation will cover all the means by which a person may acquire citizenship here; that is to say, that as regards an alien actually in the country and not a citizen, or an alien who may at some future time come to the country, it will specify a period of residence before application can be entertained and the conditions under which the application will be granted.  I remember in the early stages, 2½ or 3 years ago, that there was a discussion about one of the points raised before us relating to the period of years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The purpose of the amendment is that in the case of destitute people and unemployed people in need of assistance some provision should be made for paying any rent they may owe.  In many cases where such people will come within whatever regulations may be made subsequent to the passing of this Bill, and will be so enabled to get assistance, it will happen that sometimes they will be tenants of houses or of rooms and, being absolutely destitute, they will be unable to pay the rent of any dwellings they occupy.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable the relieving officer, or whoever will be administering the Act on behalf of the Commissioners, to pay the tenant's landlord or the tenant himself the amount that will meet the rent due.</P>
    <P>I wonder the Minister has not already considered this point.  I thought it was only necessary to draw his attention to it by way of amendment.  He must realise that a great many of the people to whom relief will be given will be absolutely unable to pay their rents.  If we are to relieve distress let us do it properly. There is no use in giving food tickets if those unfortunate people are in danger of being thrown out of their little dwellings.  Unless some such provision as I suggest is made, not only will many of the landlords have to pay the extra rates which will go to relieve distress, but also they will have to suffer loss arising out of rents unpaid because of the necessity to which I have referred.  I am afraid unless the Minister meets me in some way that I will have to press the amendment to a division.</P>

That is the only kind of restriction in that particular way that has been put upon them.  It is not proposed in any way to restrict the Dublin Union Commissioners in dealing with this particular matter&mdash;to restrict them entirely to giving relief in kind.  The tendency will be, as far as possible, because of the circumstances of the City, for this relief to be given in kind.  It is the intention to give it in kind.  The relief is intended to be as adequate as possible, and the Commissioners will have complete discretion as to the extent to which it will be given in cash.</P>

On the last day the discussion arose as to the interpretation of Deputy Morrissey's amendment to this particular section.  There were some of us who believed that the wording of Deputy Morrissey's amendment for which we voted was not sufficiently clear.  With a view to satisfying our own minds in the matter as to what the interpretation of that amendment was or the idea behind it, we have put down this amendment now here.  Our intention was that that should be one amendment &mdash;that is, amendments 2 and 4 should be one amendment, and that the two parts should come together. However, I do not suppose it matters <Col N="1668" /> very much.  I now move the first part of it&mdash;that is, amendment 2.  The second part of the amendment contains in principle the same idea and embodies the same principle as Deputy Morrissey's, but our amendment does, at any rate, make the matter more specific and perhaps more clear and definite than Deputy Morrissey's amendment.

      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment. I would ask the House if this amendment is accepted what effect it will have upon the problem of finding work in general for the unemployed? If this amendment is accepted it will, in my opinion, render the administration of relief work almost impossible. It will create a continual source of friction between those obtaining this work and those administering the Act.  It will lessen the power of control over the relief work.  Now if relief work is to be carried out successfully, effective control is absolutely necessary.  It will tend to make the Commissioners very careful as to what particular kind of relief work they will embark upon, and it will circumscribe the kind of relief work that will be given.  It has been stated in this House that the difficulties of relief work are particularly great, and I think we ought to be very careful not to increase the difficulties of the Commissioners in this matter.  On looking through the report of the speech delivered by Deputy de Valera, I find that it has been suggested that the payment of the trade union rate of wages is absolutely essential.  Now I am not one who wants to do anything injurious to the trade unions in this country.  I am perfectly aware of the amount of good that has arisen from the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>But so far as giving relief to the unemployed of the City is concerned, we must ask the House before we pass this amendment to consider whether it will help the unfortunate unemployed or whether <Col N="1669" /> it will hinder the giving of relief to them.  How can you draw a parallel between a member of an ordinary trade union in full capacity and in possession of full physical powers and the ordinary person who will receive unemployment relief?  The average loss, I am informed, upon relief scheme work is generally computed at 40 per cent.  If you embody this amendment it can only have one effect and that effect will be to increase the ratio of loss.  If you increase the ratio of loss the fact is that you reduce the volume of work&mdash;you reduce the amount of work that will be given out for the relief of unemployment.  Now, the smaller the loss upon relief work the more lengthy period of time can be given for the carrying out of the work.</P>
      <P>I know of thousands of unemployed in the city who would prefer to perform work of any kind rather than receive this dole.  I am conversant with the history of unemployment in the City of Dublin and can recall what happened on the occasion of the Dublin Tramway strike in 1913 when relief in kind was given out by one of the unions in the city.  I knew numbers of men who would not accept that relief.  I anticipate a similar consequence ensuing now if this amendment is passed.  There are men in this city who prefer work to charity, and that type of man is worthy of the encouragement and consideration of this House.  If you pass this amendment you are not encouraging this type of man to come forward and perform relief work.  It has been universally agreed that it is preferable to find work for the unemployed rather than to give them a dole. The rank and file of the Party on this side of the House who represent Dublin constituencies are pressing the Ministers to give State aid towards the relief of unemployment in Dublin, so that the volume of relief work could be increased here in the city.</P>

Now when we impressed upon the Minister the necessity for a State contribution towards relief in Dublin, the first objection we had was that we would have all those stipulations about trade union rates of wages and a thousand and one restrictions of that kind, and a lot of such things, so that the carrying out of this would be impossible.</P>

Now everybody knows that where a member of a trade union is given employment he must be at a hundred per cent. standard of efficiency or his employer will not keep him.  What would be the capacity of those persons who will receive work under these relief schemes?  That capacity varies in output from 30 per cent. to 50 per cent., and this fact is recognised by the Commissioners carrying out relief works.  They generally issue orders that for the first few weeks this unfortunate type of citizen is not to be rushed in the work.  He is to be given an opportunity and when that stage is passed he may be expected to give a larger volume of work than at first.  I think that is a reasonable and a very charitable way in which to look upon the administration of relief schemes.  The problem before this House is to find work for the type of man who is not physically fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is to find work for a particular type of man between whom and the ordinary trade union worker no parallel can be drawn.  The ordinary man out for work is physically strong and fit and a hefty individual.  When the unfortunate 30 per cent. man comes along what happens to him?  He is generally left aside.  Some of the unemployed are only able to give 30 per cent. output.  What I want to ask the Labour Party and the mover of the amendment is: is it the intention that that particular type of man should be cast aside and receive no work?  If this amendment is passed, that will be the result of it&mdash; the unfortunate physically unfit will be rejected and the stronger type of individual will get preference for the work.  I am speaking of what occurred in practice and not what we have in this amendment.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the greatly-abused old Dublin Corporation had a particular system of dealing with this particular type of problem.  I am sure the mover of the amendment knows that the Corporation at one time had what they called a Distress Committee which paid a wage according to the type of individual with whom they had to deal.  They did not pay, and could not pay, nor could it be reasonably expected that they should pay, what the amendment calls for&mdash;a trade union rate of wage.  If the amendment, as now framed, is adopted, the fear that I have is that the physically unfit will be injured.  I fear that the volume of work given under relief schemes will be diminished and that the type of person whom we are anxious to help under this Bill will be hurt to such a degree that in fact the net effect of the relief scheme work may be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we who represent the city of Dublin want is as large a volume of this work to be distributed as possible. I suggest to Deputy O'Kelly <Col N="1672" /> that if he considers the amendment and takes into consideration the experience he has had on the Distress Committee of the old Corporation he will be bound to come to the conclusion that this amendment is quite impossible and that it will do a great deal more harm and will certainly do no good.</P>

I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as the Labour Party are concerned, what they ask for is work and not relief.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>One can say many things proper to the Bill without even considering Dublin.  The amendment seeks to provide that when engaging labour for the works contemplated in the Bill, the persons employed shall be engaged at the usual rates of pay.  In other words, it does not mean that a man is to be kept for six days per week.  The work will go round by giving a person three days per week at the recognised rate.  Deputy Byrne spoke of the man who is not physically fit, and in the next breath he spoke of the fifty per cent. man who, in the course of a few days, becomes a hundred per cent. man.</P>

      <P>Not in these terms, but that is what was inferred.  The Deputy said that a ganger who employs a number of men will pick out a number of very physically fit men. Surely in measures of this kind somebody other than a person physically fit is contemplated.  There are thousands in Dublin at present who, owing to unemployment and lack of feeding, etc., are not physically fit.  Does Deputy Byrne suggest that, because these unfortunate men have been reduced to that state of not being physically fit, their labour should be exploited for this purpose? That is the position taken up by Deputy Byrne.</P>

All that is asked for in the amendment is that these men be paid a decent rate of wages, and not be asked to come along, as suggested by Deputy Byrne in a veiled manner, and work under certain &ldquo;Coolie&rdquo; conditions.  That is what was running through the mind of Deputy Byrne when he made this suggestion.  I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.  In the first place, while Deputy Anthony appears to support it, and suggests that the amendment makes it clear that people who work at this particular sort of work will have to be paid the usual rate of wages current for the work in the district, the amendment does not secure that at all.  The amendment secures nothing.  If you take the amendment and work it out on a time basis, then it secures what Deputy Anthony speaks about, and what Deputy de Valera spoke about the other day.  But if you take the amendment and interpret it on a work basis, then it means a very different thing.  However, the position, as explained by me on the Committee Stage, is that the types of persons employed on this particular class of work are known by experience to be only fifty or sixty per cent. efficient, as compared with the ordinary type of labourer recruited by a ganger, and I cannot restrict the Commissioners or the local authorities carrying out the Bill, to the extent that they cannot go ahead with any relief schemes except they pay the persons seeking relief the normal wages in the district for the work.  To do that would bring about the situation that there would be no relief works undertaken.  I have explained that for the last twelve months or more there have been sixty-five men engaged originally at 30/- a week and subsequently at 35/- a week, who would not be engaged at all if they had to be paid at the rate of wages that certain labour party representatives in the city wanted to dictate prior to the Christmas of 1928.  They would <Col N="1675" /> not, and they could not, have been employed without unnecessary waste of public money.  That work carried out since the beginning of this year would not have been got through.</P>
      <P>All sections of the House have agreed that if it was possible to provide on the fringes of the out-door relief provided by means of this particular Bill for work, either for testing the <i>bona fides</i> of the applicants for relief or for the sake of keeping men occupied and keeping up their morale, and keeping them ready for absorption in normal employment when it comes about, that work ought to be found.  One of my objects in refusing this amendment, which in reality means nothing, and which can be interpreted in any way at all by anyone operating the Bill, is that to put in an amendment such as this would restrict the possibility of the Commissioners being able to organise any class of work.  I think that would be more than undesirable. Deputies have the actual practical sample of work in front of them which the Commissioners themselves will do, if they can, and of the type of wages they will pay if they can, and they can express themselves as satisfied or dissatisfied.  If they are dissatisfied then they can vote for this amendment if they think it means nothing.  But if they are satisfied in any way that the men that are employed are much better off in that way, than if they were drawing relief, then they will leave the sub-section stand as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the speech of Deputy Byrne and the speech of the Minister for Local Government, I have come to the conclusion that Deputy Byrne never knew, and that the Minister has forgotten the purpose of this Bill.  It is not a Bill to provide work or relief work even.  It is a Bill empowering the local authorities in Dublin to give outdoor relief to the able-bodied destitute poor.  I cannot see how the Minister's argument is relevant to the amendment at all. The Bill provides, and all parties are agreed, that persons receiving out-door <Col N="1676" /> relief under this Bill should be asked to perform some task of work as a test of their genuineness.  The idea behind that particular provision of the Bill is that a work test would prevent persons getting outdoor relief who were not genuinely destitute unemployed poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that matter came to be considered in the House certain Deputies, including Deputies on these benches, thought that the powers given to boards of guardians under the Bill might be used in a manner very detrimental to the public interest. It has been pointed out here before that the administration of the powers given by this Bill will not lie with the Minister or this House.  It may not lie during the full period in which the Bill is in operation with anybody now existing.  We cannot say in whose hands the administration of the powers given by the Bill will be.  It is quite possible that some authority will come into existence that will use the powers of the Bill for the purpose of depressing the general wage rates in this city or getting specific tasks done at a smaller cost than would be involved if ordinary labour had to be employed for the performance of these tasks.  The amendment, therefore, that Deputy Kelly suggests seeks to provide that the actual fulfilment of the work required from a person in receipt of relief shall bear some relation to the value of the relief given, as a full week's work would bear to the full week's pay current for that work, and that, also, the work on which the person is engaged shall be additional work undertaken for the purpose of providing employment in the area of the board of guardians concerned, and such as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in a work of similar character.  I cannot understand how anybody could object to the insertion of safeguards of that kind in the Bill. Surely it would be most undesirable that the labours of the destitute poor should be used for the purpose of depressing the ordinary wage rates.  It will be agreed that it would be equally undesirable that the labour of such persons should be used in <Col N="1677" /> such a manner as would deprive other people of the full time employment which they either have at present or could reasonably expect under certain projected schemes.  The Minister himself has an amendment on the paper to provide as Deputy Kelly's amendment provides that work shall be of a character undertaken for providing additional employment. That is a step forward from the position taken up by the Minister when the Bill was originally introduced.  It does meet one of the possible dangers we foresaw, but it does not meet them all.  I do not see how the effectiveness of the relief that can be given under it will be impaired in any way if the other safeguard suggested by Deputy O'Kelly was inserted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 might be altered if the Minister's objection to it is a valid one.  The amendment does think of the amount of relief given in relation to the work done. The Minister seems to think that it should deal with the amount of relief given to the time spent upon the work.  That is only a minor point. It was merely the difficulty of getting words that would convey our idea that prevented us putting in the question at the time.  The amendment therefore does definitely provide against relief labour being used in order to depress general wage rates.  Persons who may be employed upon these particular tasks or works may be as the Minister said only 50 or 60 per cent. as efficient as ordinary labourers.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, there is an argument for leaving the amendment as worded by Deputy O'Kelly and not as the Minister suggested. The Minister also said that the passing of the amendment would restrict the Commissioners so much that they could not go ahead with relief schemes.  There is nothing in the Bill, nor in any amendment, to prevent the Commissioners going ahead with such schemes.  The Bill deals with the giving of outdoor relief to the destitute poor, and the schemes altogether distinct from the Bill for the relief of unemployment in Dublin <Col N="1678" /> County or in any county can be proceeded with without relation to this Bill.  No one wishes to restrict the Commissioners or the City Council who, we hope, will shortly replace them, from proceeding with a scheme to relieve unemployment.  I cannot see what that has to do with this Bill which deals with the giving of outdoor relief to the destitute poor, subject to their performing a work test.  It may be that the Minister is correct in saying that persons employed in certain relief schemes in Dublin at 30/- a week could not have been employed if the suggestion put forward by the Labour Party had been listened to.  But is it intended that the value of outdoor relief which will be given to able-bodied destitute poor in Dublin will amount to 30/- a week?  I hope that it will but I doubt it very much.  I also doubt very much if it is the intention of the Commissioners, or board of guardians who will be administering the Act to give relief to that extent.</P>
    <P>I cannot see, therefore, in what way the Minister's argument is pertinent to the case.  The City Commissioners will be quite at liberty, are at liberty and will always be at liberty, to undertake relief schemes to relieve unemployment.  This Bill is intended to give them the same powers hitherto enjoyed by other local bodies with respect to relieving the able-bodied destitute poor, subject to their performing a work test. The only thing we wish to provide is that the provisions relating to the work test will not operate to deprive other persons of their employment, to prevent persons getting employment, or to depress existing rates of wages, and in my opinion no case has been made by anyone who has spoken against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Whatever about that, Deputy O'Kelly's amendment being the next best thing, certainly I will have much pleasure in voting for it.  Deputy Lemass touched on the real point when he stated that this is not a Bill for relief work. The trouble from the beginning of the debate on the Bill has been that the Minister has forgotten what the Bill is about, and so has Deputy J. J. Byrne.  It is quite clear that what the Minister wants to use the Bill for is to get work performed at a rate of wages much lower than the rate at which the work would be performed if the Bill were not introduced. That seems to be what is at the back of the Minister's mind. This Bill is to be used, not for the relief of the destitute poor, but in order to get work in Dublin completed at a rate of wages much lower than the rate which would have been paid if the Bill were not passed through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the amendment and in many of his speeches on the Committee Stage of the Bill, talked about the 65 men who are employed at 30/- a week. He asked what we had to say about 30/- or 35/- a week.  There is nothing in the Bill about 30/- or 35/-.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel those who will have to administer it to pay 15/- a week, and the Minister knows that better than any Deputy in the House.  We have no guarantee if the Bill is passed that those who will be employed on relief work will get even 30/- a week, and the Minister does not know whether they will or not.  The Minister also stated that those men were getting 30/- a week because they <Col N="1680" /> were not able to give the output which men who are physically fit would give, and that after a certain threat had been made the output was increased and wages were also increased from 30/- to 35/- a week. The Minister assumed that it was because of the threat the output was increased.  Is it not quite possible that it was because of the fact that the men who were getting even 30/- a week could get nourishment somewhat better than that they could get whilst idle?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt in my mind that if those men were in the condition which the Minister stated, after a few weeks receiving 35/-, the output would be greater than when they were receiving 30/- a week.  The Minister put forward in this Bill, and in reply to the amendment, a principle to which I think this House should not agree, the survival of the fittest, that only those who are 100 per cent. fit are to be employed and that those who are not 100 per cent. physically fit shall not be employed until the people who are perfectly fit shall be all absorbed.  What would be the position in the country if every empolyer were to act on that principle?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister who is to decide whether a man is physically fit or not.  Have the Commissioners to call in a medical officer of health, and is each applicant to be examined by the medical officer of health as to whether he is 60, 80, or 100 per cent. fit; and, if so, if the wages are to be determined by the physical fitness of the man to be employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just another point I would like to make in connection with this Bill.  It is said that under this Bill about 5,000 persons will qualify for relief.  That means that to only a very small percentage of those who will qualify under the Bill can the work test be applied.  Then the question arises, whether it is to be a work test, to see whether the men are genuinely employed on certain work, or whether it is to be used as an instrument to force down wages and worsen conditions.  As far as we are concerned, I may say that our only anxiety in connection with the measure is to see that it is not going <Col N="1682" /> to be used unfairly as a weapon to force down wages and conditions, that it will not be used to put out of employment men who are at the moment in employment, working under fair conditions and at a fair wage, in order to have them supplanted by men who will be working under this Bill at wages which could not be called fair, and under conditions such as would not satisfy us as being fair.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I think that Deputy O'Kelly's amendment would secure that.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us any reasons or did not explain why he could not accept the amendment.  He did not explain what was wrong with it.  He said that he would not accept it, and that it would not achieve what it purported to achieve, but he did not say why.  With Deputy Lemass I would like to remind the Minister that this is a Bill to relieve the destitute of Dublin, and not a Bill to relieve unemployment. As a matter of fact, the work test is not the main principle of the Bill. but is only a secondary concern, and it should be used only to ensure that those who are unemployed and receive outdoor relief are genuine cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, line 11, after the word `utility' to insert the words `undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the Committee Stage that I would put in this amendment. Deputy Lemass on the Committee Stage suggested that it might go into sub-section (1) of Section 4 rather than where I am putting it. As I say, this class of relief is given in other parts of the country except Dublin city and Dublin county, and the rules and regulations governing the matter are issued in the County Board of Health Assistance Order, 1924.  In Section 6 of this Order, on page 3, the provision is contained that &ldquo;the Board of Health may at their discretion require such person as a condition of the granting of such assistance to perform such suitable task or work as the Board may determine so long as such person shall continue to receive home assistance.&rdquo;  The nature of such a task is usually some work associated with the outdoor maintenance of the ground around the institutions of the Board, and in the first place I feel it is undesirable to remove from the Commissioners of the Union any work of that particular <Col N="1685" /> class, and prevent them utilising that work as a kind of test work for persons in Dublin that will get this particular outdoor relief. It may restrict them if we put in in sub-section (1) a provision that such work should be undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.  No doubt it would be actually providing additional employment, but I see no reason for differentiating in the terms between work that might be performed of that nature in the Dublin Union or any of the other Dublin Institutions and work that is performed round any county home or county hospital in the country, and that is done within the terms of Section 6 of the instructions I' have referred to.  For that reason, I am putting in the amendment into sub-section (2) (a), as already suggested.  If we read the amendment that is down in Deputy O'Kelly's name, it perhaps can be discussed with my amendment because they deal with the one matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was proposing about that was: the Minister's amendment covers the first half of Deputy O'Kelly's amendment down to the word &ldquo;employment,&rdquo; and if it is carried, it will not be possible to move Deputy O'Kelly's amendment in the form in which it appears on the Paper.  What the Chair suggests is that Deputy O'Kelly would move the second part of his amendment to the Minister's amendment, that is to say, that when the Minister has moved his amendment, the Deputy will move to add the words &ldquo;in the area of the board of guardians granting the relief and such as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in work of a similar character.&rdquo;  That will obtain a decision on such part of Deputy O'Kelly's amendment as is not now covered by the Minister, and will enable a discussion to take place on both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose Deputy O'Kelly's amendment on really two points.  The first is &ldquo;in the area of the board of guardians,&rdquo;<Col N="1686" /> because that might unnecessarily restrict the Dublin Union Commissioners who perhaps might be able to enter into a contract outside their area for the utilisation of the unemployed in the city.  For instance, it never materialised, and I do not know whether it ever will materialise, but the Dublin Union Commissioners at one time considered the possibility of giving some of the unemployed in the city, who were seeking relief, work by arranging that they could do some work on what is called the Merrion estate, which might be outside their area.  There did appear a possibility that some road-making might be undertaken on the Merrion estate and discussions took place with the person controlling the Merrion estate with the object of doing work that would be of advantage to the development of that particular site for housing and would be also of advantage to the unemployed in the city in the matter of giving them employment.  Nothing developed from that, and I cannot see at present that there is any great prospect of anything developing.  To put in &ldquo;the area of the board of guardians&rdquo; might hamper the local bodies that would be seeking to organise work of this particular kind.  The difficulty of organising any amount of work is so great that I would not put any restriction that might in any way prevent any work being done that might otherwise be done.  For that reason, I oppose the restriction in the area of the board of guardians. With regard to the other part of his amendment that says &ldquo;and such as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in work of a similar character,&rdquo; I think that is sufficently safeguarded by the wording of my amendment, which is undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Words, as I pointed out before, are not going to safeguard anything in this particular matter, particularly words of that particular kind which may be interpreted in that particular way.  If we stipulate <Col N="1687" /> that any work undertaken under sub-section (2) of Section 4 shall be work of public utility undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment, I think, in so far as words in legislation can safeguard anything, the fears of the Deputy will be fully safeguarded against, while, as I repeatedly said before, these words will not do anything material to help the provision of work, which is really the thing we are desirous of doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with your ruling, I move the part of the amendment in my name that might be said to follow on the Minister's amendment.  That is at the end of the proposed amendment to add the words &ldquo;in the area of the board of guardians granting the relief and such as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in work of a similar character.&rdquo;  As I said earlier, my intention was to have all this in one amendment. The second part seems to be only a corollary to number 2 amendment. Although there may be a question of redundancy of idea in the phraseology of the last phrase of amendment 4, if we consider it in connection with the earlier phrase, &ldquo;work undertaken for the provision of additional employment,&rdquo; I think it is a necessary safeguard in case there might be any likelihood of the relief work being used even accidentally to disemploy people who are already employed.  In some cases, I think it is likely to arise that there will be a temptation to use people who might be got at a cheaper rate on certain work to the disadvantage of people who have to be paid ordinary wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any more need be said on the matter.  A good deal that was said on number 2 amendment applies to the amendment now under discussion.  If the Minister were prepared to accept the second part of the amendment, leaving out &ldquo;in the area of the board of guardians,&rdquo; I would be prepared to meet him.  Perhaps there is something in what he said in regard to the undesirability of restricting the area. <Col N="1688" /> I would be prepared in that case to accept the last phrase: &ldquo;such work as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in work of a similar character.&rdquo;  If the Minister would accept that we may not have a vote on the matter.  Otherwise we must have a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may give an example to the Minister of the danger which the amendment would provide against.  It would clarify matters.  The Minister mentioned the question of the Merrion estate and the possibility of relief labour being employed on the building of roads in the development of that estate.  Supposing the persons in charge of that estate had already a small number of men employed building roads and they were not proceeding very rapidly with the work, notwithstanding the whole-time employment of a number of individuals, and that then this Bill was passed and they realised the possibility of contracting with the Union Commissioners for the performance of the work by them with relief labour, the actual carrying out of that contract would deprive of their employment men whom the authorities in charge of the Merrion estate have at the moment building the roads.  I am only taking that as an example.  There is a possibility there that men may lose their employment, even accidentally, as Deputy O'Kelly said, in consequence of the use of relief labour.  The amendment is to provide against that danger.  I cannot see how the actual addition of these words to the Minister's own amendment could restrict the Commissioners in any way or prevent them using relief labour to the fullest extent possible. They do, however, definitely provide against the possibility of a danger which, I am sure, the Commissioners and the Minister are anxious to avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we change slightly the example given by the Deputy we may see the danger of it. Assuming there were even one or two persons employed in the area and that their position would affect <Col N="1689" /> a hundred or a hundred and fifty men, who would be deprived of employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Assume there are two or three people there.  It might mean a vigorous opposition being put up to a relief scheme, and the Commissioners being put in the position that if they deprive any persons of employment they are creating a relief problem for themselves. So I say it is sufficiently implied there what the idea is of providing additional employment.  If it did mean disemploying one or two persons, and I do not see how it could, in order to start a big relief scheme for one hundred or one hundred and fifty men those charged with the responsibility for considering the relief position in the city may easily have to take the decision that would provide for the employment in a different way of persons that might be disemployed, I do not contemplate any disemployment, but I do not want to tie up the persons that are operating this by any kind of fictitious claims of unemployment being created as a result of their action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the amendment is to be altered in so far as the phrase about the area of the board of guardians is concerned? I think there is a very strong case for altering the amendment in that respect.  We were told here some months ago that there was an InterDepartmental Committee to sit on the question of coastal erosion. There may be already, for all I know, a report available on that subject. In any case, presumably, there will be a report in time.  If the report were to recommend that certain work was to be taken in hand at once, was urgent, or was at all events desirable, it could easily be that work of that kind could be undertaken by a board of guardians and, of course, it would be additional work for the purpose of providing employment.  It would be a pity, therefore, if any amendment passed now were to restrict the board of guardians from allowing men to share in work of that kind.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;To add at the end of the proposed amendment the words ` in the area of the board of guardians granting the relief and such as will not deprive of their employment persons employed in work of a similar character.' &rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 17, to insert before Section 5 the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where relief under this Act is granted by a board of guardians to any person, and such person is not required as a condition of the granting of such relief to perform a task of work under the foregoing section the board may, if they shall so think fit, declare such relief or the cost thereof to be given by way of loan and any such relief or the cost thereof so declared to be given by way of loan shall be recoverable as a debt due to the board from the person to whom such relief shall have been granted or considered as granted under the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts, 1838 to 1914, as amended by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to meet the wishes of the House as expressed on a particular amendment that was before them in Committee.  It makes it permissive on the board of guardians to arrange, where they think the case warrants it, that the amount of relief given may be given by way of loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  The powers set <Col N="1693" /> out under it are powers that should not be given in this Bill.  I appreciate the point that the Minister is making, that there are certain numbers of people who are not anxious to be a charge on public funds if they have an opportunity afterwards of discharging their liabilities; but under the law at the moment there is nothing to prevent a person of the type referred to in this amendment repaying to the guardians or the Commissioners any money received in the way of home assistance.</P>
      <P>Now at least an amendment of this kind should contain a safeguard covering the concurrence of the person in receipt of relief in this arrangement.  I certainly think it very undesirable that the wide powers that are to be conferred on the Commissioners or the local authorities in respect of this section should be conferred on them.  Even with the safeguards that I have mentioned I think there would still be danger.  Because if the Commissioners or the guardians have to ask people applying for relief if in the event of its being granted they are prepared to repay it, I hold that people in such circumstances would be prepared to make that promise though there would be no hope of making good that promise.  There is nothing whatever to prevent a certain type of people that the Minister has in mind making repayment of the home assistance received in this respect.  I am satisfied from the mentality of the Commissioners that we have seen up and down the country that it would be very dangerous to give power of that kind into their hands.  I oppose the amendment and I hope the House will reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case which the Minister made for an amendment of this kind during the discussion on the Committee Stage seems to be convincing at first sight.  Nevertheless we think that the passing of the amendment in the form in which it now appears is leaving the way open to possible dangers which the Minister may not foresee.  I am referring <Col N="1694" /> to the danger that there might be discrimination between the applicant who is prepared to consent to the relief being regarded as a loan and the applicant who is not so prepared. I want the relief to be given without any question of its being repaid at all.  If the Minister thinks that there are cases of people who because of their feelings of pride or for any other reason, would object to taking outdoor relief except as a loan, it should be, I think, possible to get an amendment that would meet such cases.  Such an amendment, involved that the amount given could not be regarded as a loan unless the recipients agreed to its being so regarded. It seems to me, if the amendment passes in its present form, that there will be a temptation, at any rate to those administering the Act, to ask persons applying for relief to agree to the amounts given being regarded as a loan.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Murphy has pointed out, persons applying for relief will be ignorant of their rights and will agree in any case knowing that the loan can never be recovered from them or that they never will be likely to be in a position to repay it. Some hardship might result in the future if a board of guardians or the Commissioners administering this Act were to take action against individuals to recover the amount given to these individuals.  There is also the point of view that I have given expression to&mdash;that there might be discrimination between those applying for relief&mdash;that the amendment, at any rate, opens a way to discrimination between those willing to regard the money given as a loan and those who want it as a grant.  I do not think that the situation which the Minister has tried to provide for in this amendment is sufficiently serious to justify the amendment at all.  I think that those persons who want outdoor relief, but who want it as a loan, can be persuaded to take it as a grant if they can possibly get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very impracticable amendment.  Does the Minister think that the ordinary <Col N="1695" /> labouring man with 30/- to 35/- a week is going to pay back out of that small sum when he gets employment the sum of 15/- that he got the previous week?  That is what it amounts to.  The only other eventuality is that he becomes a millionaire. That is very unlikely.  Deputy Lemass spoke about the impracticability of proceeding against those people.  You will have a whole crop of very unnecessary legal expenses for bringing those labourers to court to recover the 15/- which, I think, is the maximum you can give them.  I see no cause for this amendment, and I do not understand the mentality behind it.  If outdoor relief is given, it is spent.  Well and good if the man can get wages the following week, or month, or year.  He wants every penny of that, and more, to sustain himself and his family without giving the 15/- back to the guardians.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that I put in a section in which this particular class of relief was to be given as a loan to apply generally.  This amendment provides that it may, at the discretion of the guardians, be regarded and treated as a loan and be recoverable. The principle of putting it within the discretion of the guardians to mark any relief given by them as a loan, and putting them in the position of being able to recover the money paid out as relief in the ordinary way, is enshrined and is intrinsic to the Poor Law Relief Act as long as poor relief has existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no argument, if you like, but it is a fact. Another fact is, that it has more or less passed out of use.  I propose to put it in this particular Bill, distinguishing or bringing forward the possibility and the power of regarding the matter as relief where the guardians so consider it, so that it may be brought to the notice of <Col N="1696" /> those people in the first place who hesitate to associate themselves in any way with seeking relief that they can have relief by way of loan; in the second place, to give the guardians power, where they suspect undisclosed means on the part of an applicant for relief, to give that relief, but that they shall be able to recover it as a debt in cases where the suspicion happens subsequently to be confirmed.  There is no question of being parsimonious in the matter of marking down this particular class of relief as a loan.  The House has decided against that general principle.  There is the idea to make it easy for the class of person I have referred to and to give the guardians full discretion in the matter.  Just as they have full discretion as to the assigning of relief as a loan, they have also full discretion in pursuing any case that they think should be pursued, or leaving it unpursued.  The persons who are going to administer this Act are persons dealing with the relief of the poor, who deal with their work in a suitable spirit, so that I do not think the danger that the Deputy suggests will lie in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the question as to whether the amount given should be regarded as a loan should not be in the discretion of the guardians, but should be in the discretion of the person receiving the relief.  That is all that is intended to be provided, although I took it from one sentence of the Minister that the board of guardians propose to exercise power under this section in almost every case in view of the possibility only of the persons applying being millionairs and having a golden stocking at home.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 57, to delete the figures &ldquo;1931&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1932.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The 1923 Bill extending the powers to give this particular class of relief as well as other matters contained in the Bill is only a temporary measure.  This Bill brings Dublin and Dublin County into the same line as other counties in the matter of outdoor relief.  It is a temporary measure to the extent that the 1923 Bill was a temporary measure.  When the year 1931 was put into this Bill here I had the hope that the consolidating measure replacing the Temporary Provisions Act, 1923, would have been passed into law before the end of the coming year.  Now because I have a doubt in my own mind as to getting as far as that with the consolidating measure necessary, I am suggesting here that the year 1932 should be inserted instead of the year 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The only redeeming feature about this Bill was that it was only to last for a period of eighteen months.  That was stressed by the Minister on a number of occasions.  Now we find that the Bill is to last for a further year.  We were chastised in the first instance with whips and now, as ratepayers, we are going to be chastised with scorpions.  I would urge on the Minister, in view of the serious situation which will be created in the city and suburbs by the passing of the Bill and the curtailment of employment that will ensue, that he should not at this stage, at all events, extend that serious situation one moment longer than necessary.  If it should unfortunately happen that at the end of eighteen months it is found necessary to extend the period we could then consider the matter; but, as the Bill stands, I say that it is in the interests of the House, of the city, and of the country that it should only have jurisdiction for the shortest possible period.  I would urge on the Minister to go into the matter further, withdraw the amendment at this stage, and let it be considered later if it is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>I am in substantial agreement with what Deputy Good has stated and I hope that the Minister will give it his careful consideration. The Bill at present has some merits and is, perhaps, the best that can be done for its immediate purpose, but the sooner it ceases to operate in its present form the better.  There is no reason, as Deputy Good suggested, why, if there is cause for its extension, it should not be done at a later period. I hope that the Minister will take the matter into consideration and agree to adopt this suggestion.  There are many ratepayers, on whom the provisions of the Bill will fall, who are almost as poor as the people for whom relief is intended and who cannot see how they are going to meet this increased taxation.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Dr. Hennessy and Deputy Good.  The one thing is that around the Bill there is a mass of conjecture. There is not, and I do not think that there can be, any certainty in estimating the cost of working the Bill. The only thing that tells us what the cost will be and how the rates to be levied will fall on the area of charge is a year or eighteen months' experience of its working.  The principle of the Bill has been adopted and I do not think that Labour Deputies need fear that once the principle has been adopted it will be abandoned.  It may be desirable to review the operations of the Bill in a comparatively short time after its passing, and I suggest that the period of eighteen months fixed in the Bill is a reasonable interval.  I hope that the Minister will not press the amendment, but give us eighteen months to see how the Bill is working and how the area of charge is supporting the burden which is being pressed upon it.  Within eighteen months we shall probably have the Greater Dublin Bill and we shall be in a better position to review the whole problem of destitution in the city and townships and, when we have that information, it will not take very long, if a case is made for it, to pass a further Bill if necessary, but let us not extend the period of this Bill until we have proof that it is necessary.</P>

      <P>I also join in appealing to the Minister not to extend the period of the Bill.  The Bill was accepted by the citizens in the hope that it was purely a temporary measure.  It was first to end in 1931, but now the period is proposed to be extended to 1932.  Deputies representing the City of Dublin were actuated in their strong opposition to the Bill by the belief that once the principle of the Bill was introduced it had come to stay.  We do not object to the principle of relieving the destitute poor, but to the principle of relieving them under circumstances arising under this Bill. We have our duty to the destitute poor of the city, but I am afraid that <Col N="1702" /> our interests are not sufficiently protected under this Bill to make us believe that we are going to do our duty in that respect and in that respect only.  I believe that this Bill, like Sinbad the Sailor and the Old Man of the Sea, will be very difficult to shake off the necks of the ratepayers of Dublin.  I would like to put one important point to the Minister. Will the unemployed receive benefits in the coming Christmas? As the measure stands, it has got to go to the Seanad.  Will the Seanad have adjourned by the time it reaches that Chamber, and, when it is dealt with there, what time will have elapsed?  After that, it may be necessary to report the Bill back to the Dáil.  Where will the Dáil be at that particular stage?  Will the poor people for whose relief charity is being provided get relief this Christmas?</P>

Why all this solicitude for not extending the Bill to 1932?  Why all this wonderful last-minute repentance on the part of Deputy Byrne?

      <P>I rise to join in the appeal to the Minister, and I do so on the ground that for the first time in this debate we have heard something that denotes that there is a future before the City of Dublin.  Up to the present all the speeches against the measure were based on the fact that Dublin was going down the hill, and that the poor of the twenty-six counties were flocking in here to submerge the city altogether.  As a Deputy from the South of Ireland, I wish to say that none of our destitute poor come to Dublin.  There may be an odd painter or carpenter or labourer who may come along here, but when they come up it is stated that there is no room for them.  There is nothing for them in the eyes of certain citizens of the city but to starve them back again to the country.  I congratulate the Minister on his pluck in coming to the rescue of the poor, and I will stand to the hilt in support of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read a report of a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, a body which consists of the leading and the wealthy merchants of the city.  One of them, Sir Thomas Robinson, went so far as to say that not a shilling in the £ would be levied on the ratepayers of Dublin to safeguard the interests of those who are down and out and in dire distress.  He was followed by the Chairman of the Pembroke Urban Council and Mr. Jacob.  They all denounced the Bill because of the fact, as they allege, that it was the submerged from the twenty-six counties who invaded Dublin.  All I have to say to these gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce is that while they send out every Monday morning an army of travellers to scour the twenty-six counties for orders and for money, they never consider the fact of having a poor man from the country amongst them, nor are they prepared <Col N="1704" /> to give any consideration to him.  I wish to state here distinctly that we in the rest of the Free State have no ambition to boycott Dublin.  We love Dublin, and we are proud of it, and we are delighted that it is extending. Anyone coming up here and looking around Dublin will find that it is extending in all directions. The Minister is perfectly right, if in 18 months he withdraws the Bill because there is a future of prosperity for the city, notwithstanding what these gentlemen say about its future.</P>
    <P>We down in the twenty-six counties realise that we have a certain power, if the boycott was put on against us, if there was a rope drawn around the whole city, and if the banner were raised by the citizens of Dublin, &ldquo;We will accept all the twenty-six counties have to give us when the people come up on business to spend their money.&rdquo;  When people down the country are married they come up and spend their money and their honeymoon in Dublin, but where, I ask, do the leading citizens of Dublin go on their honeymoon? Do they go down to the South to hear the Bells of Shandon, or do they go down to the beauty spots along the coast-line of Waterford, Cork and Kerry?  No, they fly across to the Riviera.  There is no place whatever in the Saorstát good enough for these wealthy citizens of Dublin in which to spend their honeymoon in the Saorstát.  As far as we are concerned, we are determined to have fair play, and it is a slander and a libel to say that the 5,000 families amongst the Dublin citizens who, it is said, are suffering from starvation, are 5,000 families that came to the city from other parts of the twenty-six counties.  We repudiate that, and we also repudiate the allegation &mdash;and I speak as a member of the Board of Health of West Cork which has a jurisdiction over six Unions&mdash; that we have ever let down the poor. Only last year we paid an additional sum of £2,000 in home assistance.  We never questioned them as to where they were born.  They never stood in want of justice from the boards of health throughout the twenty-six counties.  They came gallantly to <Col N="1705" /> the assistance of these people and saved them from starvation.</P>
    <P>I hope the citizens of Dublin will stand solidly behind the Minister and repudiate the Chamber of Commerce. The citizens as a whole have acted well in this matter.  There was no public meeting, or no repudiation of the Minister or of the Bill from the mass of people.  Neither was there any resolution from the Chamber of Commerce when Commissioners were appointed to administer the affairs of the city.  These Commissioners by their ability have reduced the rates considerably.  Was there a resolution then from the Chamber of Commerce, or did they thank the Government? No, they concealed their hostility until the moment when the Government came forward to feed the destitute and the poor.  All I have to say to these gentlemen is, that there is a greater law than the law of the Dáil, and that is the Divine commandment which says: &ldquo;Out of your wealth, feed the hungry, and clothe the naked.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with our eloquent colleague from Cork and fully endorse what he says in regard to the necessity of feeding the poor. I happen also to be a ratepayer, not perhaps a very large one, in the city of Dublin, and no more than anybody else, especially persons with a little wealth I do not relish having to pay an extra £30, £40, or £50 as an addition to the rates that will come about as a result of the passing of the Bill.  In all probability the addition will amount to that per year.  However, I see the necessity for this Bill and I support the amendment of the Minister because I see no immediate prospect of improvement in the situation of the unemployed in the city.  As other Deputies have said if there is a change inside a year the Minister, seeing that change, will have an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the House by way of a Bill or otherwise, reducing the proposed expense on the ratepayers of Dublin.  I, as one of the representatives of the ratepayers of Dublin, cannot vote for a Bill of this kind without serious consideration.  That <Col N="1706" /> applies to every Deputy in the House, but particularly to those who represent the city of Dublin, but we have got to weigh up on the other side the starving people that we are up against every day of the week.</P>
      <P>There is not a Deputy in this House from Dublin but knows of the awful conditions that exist here in this city.  They must every day in the week have their post box filled with claims of one kind or another for subscriptions to one benevolent society or another.  I have certainly never known things to be worse. They have been bad enough in the past, but I doubt if they have been as bad as I know them to be now, judging by the claims made on me at any rate.  Despite the fact that there is admittedly a feeling of hostility amongst some of the ratepayers towards this Bill, I certainly, as one who has some feeling of Christianity left, feel that it is my duty to pass this Bill and to impose extra taxation on the ratepayers so that the starving&mdash;the word &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; is not enough&mdash;and the naked poor of Dublin are fed and clothed.  I do not believe that the need would be as great as it is if we as citizens and as Irishmen did our duty.  Many of us do not do it.  Many of those who are most prominent in protesting against the passing of the Bill do not, I am convinced, do their duty. I have got resolutions from public bodies in the city of Dublin protesting against the imposition that this Bill will put on the rates of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that if one had the power to send an inspector to one of these meetings and examine the clothes that these people wore they would find that a very small percentage of them employed Dublin tailors, or Irish workers who manufacture Irish cloth to clothe them. That is my honest belief, and if they did their duty in that way and got, as I believe they would get, as good value in Dublin and in Irish materials and bought Irish boots made in Dublin, they would help to employ some of the hundreds of boot-makers in the city without having the compulsion of the extra tax we have to impose on them as a result <Col N="1707" /> of the impoverished condition of our industries.  That is the position in Dublin.  The same thing applies in the home, and now, as we are approaching the Christmas season, it is no harm to remind citizens of this, that we are not doing our duties as citizens.  I say that to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and other such bodies.</P>

Not only have those organised and unorganised bodies which I have heard protesting not done their duty, but I say that we would not have the necessity for this Bill or have it rushed on us in an unexpected way if the Commissioners of Dublin, who in the last five years have held posts formerly held by the boards of guardians, had been doing their duty.  This Bill would be unnecessary if they had been doing their duty.</P>

I have sympathy with the struggling industries around Dublin and the struggling shopkeepers of all kinds, on whom a big burden will be placed.  But some of those who have directly or indirectly sent protests to me are merely agents in this country.

      <P>I may be straying, but I think at this moment that it is no harm to emphasise this point in view of the protest made against the amendment.  I will bring my remarks into line with the amendment by saying that if Irish industries were supported there would be perhaps, at a not very far distant date, an opportunity for review, but unless serious steps are taken by the whole body of the citizens there will be no chance of this Bill being withdrawn in 1932 or 1933.  That is what I would like to stress.  We are not doing our duty as we ought to do it.  If we did, there would not be such poverty and hunger in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Chairman of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, I read a speech of his a few days ago in the paper, and he commented on the fact that even in the City of Cork there was widespread ignorance on the part of the citizens of Cork of the industries and what was produced by them.  Not only did they inadequately support the industries, but they did not know of the industries. I do not know whether that is true of Dublin or not, but we certainly are not doing our duty, and if any word of mine has weight, I say one of the ways to end the necessity for a Bill of this kind is for citizens to do their duty by the industries as citizens and ratepayers. I do not enjoy having to pay the large sum I will have to pay out of my slender resources, but I would sooner do that than have my conscience pricking me for many a long <Col N="1709" /> day and many a long night by knowing that there are thousands of people who have been without a meal for many days in the week and without proper covering during the cold winter.</P>

      <P>What interests me entirely in this amendment is the use of Parliamentary time.  As I think in all parts of the House we accept it that once we are bringing Dublin city and country into line with the rest of the country in making this particular class of relief to the able-bodied available, then there is no going back.  I think that being generally agreed, there perhaps ought not to be any difficulty about this amendment.  As I say, my only interest in the matter is the taking up of Parliamentary time.  We have seen how much time this particular Bill has taken.  I hope before the Dáil rises to ask for leave to introduce a Bill dealing with the future government of Dublin and to circulate the measure itself as soon as possible after that, but in ample time to enable us to approach a discussion when we reassemble after Christmas. As I said, I also hoped we would have a consolidating measure that might be in time to pick up the general situation before this particular Bill drops.  But having it generally understood, there is no going back on the question of the type of relief going to be made available in the City and County of Dublin in this particular measure, and taking it in view of the terrible fears and scares that have been stirred up about this particular measure, I would not object to leaving the Bill as it stands, with March, 1931, in, because we would either have to continue this measure, if it is possible, under the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill next year or deal with it over again, probably in a one-clause continuing Bill that would bring the whole matter before the Oireachtas again.  I sympathise with people who are asking that that would be the case and, perhaps, in the circumstances, Deputy O'Kelly would sympathise with their point of view too. <Col N="1710" /> It simply means that we would get this measure extended, if necessary, before 31st March, 1931, with a further taking up of the time of the House in discussing the matter.  We will have a lot more information by that time as to what the incidence of this burden will be on the different areas.  Perhaps it could be more satisfactorily approached if the House was willing to take the risk of having to spend more time in a discussion of the measure before the 31st March, 1931.  So perhaps Deputies would agree that I might withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I appeal to the two Deputies to show a better spirit in the matter than they have shown.  This matter has been discussed at very great length.  It is a very important problem from the point of view of the City of Dublin. It is a question of fixing a date, and that may require further discussion in this House.  Although I do not commit myself to saying it, I hope that the consolidating measure will be passed before the 31st March, 1931.  If not it will be brought forward on the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill or in a special clause. I am in the position that I have to say that it is impossible from my point of view to estimate the probable cost of this measure.</P>
      <P>I suggested that the cost would be nothing like the costs that have been suggested.  I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House would be willing to co-operate in dealing with such an important problem.  I think they all realise the scare that has been raised over this particular measure, very unnecessarily and very inadvisably, in my opinion.  If it will help to allay the scare by allowing the date here 1931, instead of 1932, it may even of itself do some good. If it does bring up a discussion of this matter before the 31st March, 1931, nothing would be lost by that.</P>

      <P>I do not think the <Col N="1712" /> Minister has actually made a case for withdrawing the amendment.  He made a case for retaining it, in so far as he said that in a certain eventuality it possibly would be necessary for him again to come to this House with a similar measure, and have upon that measure the same discussion and occupy the same Parliamentary time.  The plea he has made is that if we consent to the withdrawal of this amendment the fears that at present exercise a certain body of the citizens &mdash; not the whole body of the citizens by any means &mdash; are going to be allayed.  The only thing that is going to allay these fears, if they are genuine fears, which I seriously doubt, is actual experience, and not the question of whether 1931 or 1932 remains in the Bill.  It is actual experience of the working of this Act that is going to allay these fears.  It is going to demonstrate to the citizens that it may be cheaper to give this relief in a regular way than in the present irregular fashion.  It may be cheaper to provide normal work with the moneys that will be expended under this Bill than to continue to pauperise these people who are at present unemployed by private doles and charity.  I do not think the Minister has made any case for the withdrawal of the amendment.  I would suggest to him that the motives which exercised him in putting this amendment down are still strong, notwithstanding the appeals which have been made to him from his own benches, and that he ought to put this amendment and, if necessary, carry it.  He has carried other amendments which were much less acceptable to both sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I appeal to Deputies who are opposed to the withdrawal of this amendment to reconsider the matter.  It really is not a waste of time at all, if it is necessary to bring this before the House again.  It is most important that we should have an opportunity at as early a date as possible to consider the various reactions of a Bill like this and the heavy charges it imposes. Instead of being a waste of <Col N="1713" /> time, it is one of the most important ways in which we could possibly spend our time.  We all know how easy it would be to put an extending Bill before the House again if the necessity exists, as I am afraid it will exist.  If there is a necessity for a short extending Bill, and for considering the reactions of this measure, <Col N="1714" /> surely it is not a waste of time.  I urge on Deputies to withdraw their opposition to the withdrawal of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to the remarks I made on the last occasion when this Bill was before the Dáil.  Deputies should seriously ask themselves in connection with this matter what exact functions has the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office in this regard.  That is the whole question.  It is not a question of what the law is or is not at the present moment.  Whether we are lawyers or not, we are not supposed to give legal opinions in the House.  That is a matter for another body.  As far as the Government are concerned, the proper authority to advise the Government as to what is the legal position, is well known.  In this case, the other issues are far and away more important than the legal issues.  The real question is what is to be the function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in a matter of this sort.  In order to arrive at any sort of a reasonable conclusion on that question it would be well in the first instance to find out, in so far as we can, what exactly the Comptroller and Auditor-General thinks his functions ought to be.  We can find out that and we must assume that he has thought out his position.  Deputies need only read the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts to find out that.  I have here the report of the 22nd November, 1928, and on page 179 I, read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. McGrath: We get a printed document upon which is stated the man's rank and service.</P>
      <P>I may say that it is on those two factors that the pension is computed.</P>
      <P>You can make out a pension on these two factors, but why a man is given a rank or why it was decided that he had a certain number of years' service, the Audit Office has no means of checking that.</P>
      <P>That makes a certain position clear. The Comptroller and Auditor-General thinks he ought to decide in this regard what the rank is and what the years of service are, the years of service given by the particular person holding the particular rank.  He must know; he must examine and find out for himself and satisfy himself that a particular applicant was of such a rank and had so many years' service.  I will quote Deputy MacEntee because Mr. McGrath answers him: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee: I take the position to be this: that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would <Col N="1717" /> like, in cases where a rank is ascribed to a certain individual, to get certain facts to satisfy him that that rank has been rightfully ascribed to the individual by the Board of Assessors?</P>
    <P>Mr. McGrath: That is the position.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting statements in the same sense from the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but Deputies can examine those statements for themselves.  I can only say that I have read the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee with some care and there are no statements that in any way contradict the ones I have read.  They are a fair summary of the claims made in this regard.  It comes to this, that in the opinion of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor-General these files should be returned to the Comptroller and Auditor-General in order to satisfy him on two factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy Davin's point.  At any rate we are not going into that.  That is irrelevant.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General's claims are here clearly expressed &mdash; that he should examine the files in order to ascertain two facts; to ascertain for himself after examination the rank and years' service of the particular applicant for a pension. Now there can be no doubt whatever that these are the claims made.  That is exactly the function that the Board of Assessors was supposed to carry out.  In deciding whether the applicant was entitled to a pension only two facts had to be found, first, the years' service, and second the rank of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And the nature and duration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if Deputy Davin has to interrupt he ought to make an intelligent interruption. These two facts have to be found and &ldquo;the nature and duration&rdquo; adds nothing to them.  The two things to be found are the years' service and the rank.  That was the duty of the Board of Assessors that was set up for the purpose of assessing the pension.  That is the particular function which the Comptroller and Auditor-General specifically claims.  Now there can be no doubt whatever about that.  How were decisions come to in regard to those two facts?  On evidence. What sort of evidence?  First of all there was the written application from the applicant for a pension. This was accompanied by a reference to a certain individual who also filled up on demand, if he wished, a certain form answering certain questions.  That was the written evidence.  That evidence, of course, was in favour of the applicant except in very rare cases.  Was the <Col N="1719" /> Board of Assessors satisfied with that evidence?  They were not.  The major portion of the evidence and the rebutting evidence was oral evidence.  What was all that evidence directed to prove or to disprove? Two things.  The rank and the years' of service so that in coming to their conclusions this Board of Assessors had to take into account and give full weight not only to the written evidence which was the least important part of the evidence but to the oral evidence that came before them. That was far and away the most important part of the evidence.  It contained all the rebutting evidence, the evidence against granting the pension.  The Board of Assessors came to a decision.  I am not dealing at all with the question of secrecy, the question that the witnesses got an undertaking that their evidence would be treated secretly.  There is obviously very good reason why certain evidence in these cases should be secret.  I am not relying on that.  Not at all.  I am merely pointing out that to come to their conclusions this Board of Assessors obtained a certain limited amount and only a certain limited amount of affirmative written evidence, but that the main evidence on which their decisions, either to give or to refuse the pension, was based, was oral evidence.  And what was all that evidence collected to prove?  What was all that evidence taken for? For what purpose?  To decide two things and two things only, the rank and the years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, then, does the claim of the Comptroller and Auditor-General amount to?  What exactly does he want?  He wants to decide and to see the evidence on these two points. He wants to see the evidence on the whole case and to decide for himself. Either he wants that, or these proceedings are a complete farce. Does the Dáil suggest that it was ever the intention to set up a body, whether you call it judicial or not, with powers to make inquiries and to take evidence on oath, and that its findings afterwards should be questioned <Col N="1720" /> in that way by the Comptroller and Auditor-General; that it was anticipated by any member of any party that after that inquiry had concluded its labours, after the members of it had heard all the oral and written evidence, pro and con, and after they had come to decisions, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should go over exactly the same procedure again?  Because that was the claim that was made, if it means anything.  I say it was not contemplated and that it would be quite impossible.  It would amount to this, that in this country for some reason or another, arising some say out of the Constitution, it is outside the power of the Dáil, or of the Government authorised by the Dáil, to establish a judicial body, or alternatively, a body to take evidence on oath and to come to certain decisions involving compensation without having a rehearing of the case by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>The Constitution has been attacked from a great many points, but it has never been suggested that any such implications are within the Constitution. I would like if Deputies would address themselves to the net point here and say what exactly they want, what powers they want to give to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and to what purpose?  If you are to take his own statement and his own claims I have said what they mean. What other powers can he have? Are we to be asked to produce for him the applications, and for what purpose?  Is it in order to decide that certain people should not get pensions?</P>

Is he to decide that money shall not be spent on the evidence of the written applications and on the queries filled in in writing?  Is he to decide on that without hearing all the evidence, the oral evidence as well as the written evidence &mdash; the evidence in point towards showing that money should not be paid?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose that there is a Board set up consisting of three members, and that the sittings of the Board extend over a period of eight or nine months, it is almost inevitable that one member of the Board would occasionally be absent, but what difference does that make? None whatever.  That is inevitable in the case of every judicial body. The Deputy is not so innocent as to suggest that the Supreme Court is always filled.  In the nature of the case, if a body like that is sitting for a long time it is inevitable that occasionally, for one reason or another, a member might be absent during one sitting of the Board, or for more than one sitting or for a period.  That is the reason why there are three members, apart from the fact that there ought to be a majority.  But that is absolutely irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has made a great point, namely, that there was a note of the evidence taken in long hand.  Does the Deputy's point come to this, that the Comptroller and <Col N="1723" /> Auditor-General is to get a note of the evidence taken in long hand, and on that to reverse the decision of the Board?  If that is his suggestion, it is the sort of silly suggestion that I would expect from Deputy MacEntee, but anybody who has had any experience knows perfectly well that in cases where certain decisions have to be come to, where there is evidence pro and con, that you are at a great disadvantage in coming to a decision unless you have the witnesses before you, and are able to come to your own conclusions as to their character and reliability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the same true of the tribunal, the personality of the witnesses, and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the suggestion is that not only the applications and references, but the notes of the evidence should be given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, then it must mean this: that he is to read the applications and references as well as the notes of the evidence, and is to come to his own decisions on that.  That is what it amounts to. As I was pointing out, anybody who has had any experience of tribunals knows perfectly well that any judicial person coming to a judicial decision on merely written evidence and without any opportunity of seeing his witnesses and judging as to their character and reliability, is at a great disadvantage compared with a tribunal that has all these advantages. If that suggestion was seriously meant, the point, apparently, is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General who cannot see the witnesses and who cannot form any estimate from their conduct as to their character and reliability is to examine the notes, he is to examine the reference, and he is, if he is to carry out his functions where he thinks proper, to disagree with and to over-rule the decisions of the court that had all those advantages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to appeals under certain conditions, and whether it does or not the Deputy will now have to keep to the point. There is no doubt whatever that a judicial body, which has had the advantage of having the witnesses before them, and in that way being able to come to their own conclusions as to the character and reliability of the witnesses, is in a very much better position to come to sound decisions on the evidence which they put forward than any other body which at a later date has only the advantage of the written note of what they said.  There can be no question about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet in this particular case it is suggested that a person with all these disadvantages if he has any functions is to overrule the decisions of a body, a semi-judicial body, entitled to take evidence on oath, and that has had the evidence to enable them to come to a proper decision, and which the Comptroller and Auditor-General has not.  It goes deeper.  If it applies in this case, it applies to every tribunal set up. There is no reason why an exception should be made in this case. Deputies have pretended that we are making an exception.  We are not; we are making no exception.  None whatever.  Wherever the facts are similar, wherever it is necessary to set up a judicial tribunal to arrive at conclusions on oral evidence which ends in a decree being given for money, the Comptroller and Auditor-General could have no function in the way of re-trying the case.  In no country outside of Bolivia would it be suggested that such a proceeding would be anything but extremely foolish.</P>

We are advised by the Attorney-General that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no right to see the files.  He thinks he has.  We wish to clarify the position.  I do not profess to be a better legal adviser than the Attorney-General, but supposing there had been a mistake in the drafting, and that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had the right to hear these cases, to hear evidence, nobody knows better than Deputy Davin that when the original Bill was going through the Dáil it was not contemplated that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have power to call up witnesses and re-try the cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That question from Deputy Lemass is an admission of my contention that the real case here is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be empowered to re-try all the cases.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General from an examination of the records found that a certain applicant had not been out in Easter Week, and that he was given an Easter Week pension what would his functions be? His functions would be to call all the evidence, all the oral evidence that went towards showing whether he was or was not out in Easter Week. Does the Deputy suggest that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be entitled to come to a definite decision on the question of whether A.B. was in arms in Easter Week without hearing any oral evidence that the man would like to bring forward because the records did not show he was?  That is the contention.  As a matter of fact the question has no relation to realities. Deputy Lemass knows that as well as I do and so does Deputy MacEntee, if he knows anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that so far as the applications were concerned they were water tight.  Nobody is likely to understate his case in his application. Applications, so far as they <Col N="1727" /> are evidence at all, in a great many cases are evidence that the particular applicants are entitled to much bigger pensions.  Deputies must know perfectly well that is so, that an applicant in an application does not understate his case.  The real problem of the tribunal was to get rebutting evidence as against the applications, so that the Deputy's question has no relation to the realities of the case.  Even if it was found that on the application form there was no reference to Easter Week service, and that a pension had been given in respect of Easter Week, it would be the duty of any judicial person who knew that other evidence has been admitted and received in that case to look for the other evidence.  There is no other way of trying the case.  If Deputies have definitely abandoned the position that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should re-try all the cases and hear all the evidence again, then they are driven back on this, that he should have the opportunity of going through the written evidence of two kinds &mdash; one, the applications and references sent in by the applicants themselves, and the references; and, secondly, the notes of the oral evidence.  Is that the position?  I dealt with that. Is it the position that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be entitled to overrule a body who has had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and the opportunity of judging of their reliability? If that is the position, if we accept that in regard to this case, we should accept it in regard to any analogous cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Connell, who is not present to-day, who made the point, which is quite relevant enough, on the last occasion that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has certain functions in regard to the pensions of civil servants.  Of course he has, but it is not necessary to set up a tribunal to decide what a Civil Service pension shall be.  All the evidence for computing a Civil Service pension is there on the records, <Col N="1728" /> and it is a simple calculation. It is on the records when a civil servant entered the service, was established and when he left.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General can find out that more easily than he can find out most things.  No oral evidence is necessary, and no witnesses are sworn on one side or another.  There is no analogy between the two cases. There is far more difficulty owing to the nature of the case in assessing liability for pensions in cases of this sort that we have been discussing, than in assessing the pensions of civil servants whose service is on the files and is known.  There is much more difficulty in the one case than in the other.  It was necessary to set up a judicial tribunal to hear all the evidence in these cases.</P>

I have heard a great many silly proposals made in this House from the benches opposite.  They all come from there. But the proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should spend his time examining all the <Col N="1730" /> proceedings of a semi-judicial tribunal, examining witnesses and giving decisions in regard to matters that have already been judicially decided, after evidence has been heard on both sides, is about the silliest of all.  Deputies in all parts of the House, except on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches have been drifting from point to point.  Their first point, as far as they meant anything except just talk, was that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should examine all the files and, presumably, examine all the witnesses.</P>

      <P>They next came to the point that he should examine all the records, and for what purpose? Just for want of something better to do.  Is he to come to decisions on them?  If he is, is he to come to decisions on partial evidence?  Is that suggested?  The next point is that he should examine not only all the records but the notes of evidence. For what purpose?  To come to decisions on them.  Deputies may be quite clear on our position in the matter.  Whenever it is necessary, whenever there are similar circumstances, whenever a question of this sort involving the payment of money has to be decided and it can only be decided after the hearing of evidence pro and con, we will, if we are responsible, set up a judicial body, and the work of that judicial body will not be duplicated by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  We are not going to put ourselves in that futile position, and neither, I think I may prophesy, will any future Government of this country.  We need have no qualms of conscience in this matter.  There is no necessity to prove our financial integrity.  We are a fairly young State and as a Government we are not very long in office, but we have established this thing definitely, and nobody in this country at this stage, anyway, no <Col N="1731" /> matter how malevolent or ill-conditioned he or she may be, can suggest for one moment that the financial procedure adopted by this Government is not above suspicion &mdash; nobody &mdash; or that the administration of any Minister in his office is not above suspicion.  That suggestion can never be made by anyone here.</P>

I do not believe that any Deputy, no matter how foolish, no matter how lacking in experience of public affairs he might be, was serious in putting forward that contention, and that is the contention being put forward.</P>

The Minister has made a number of statements without a shred of evidence, without a shred of precedent, without a shred of citation from any Act of Parliament, from the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee or any other committee, or from any Government regulation to support him in a single statement.  The only important statement that he made had the kybosh put upon it by the President; that was the statement that since oral evidence was given before this Board of Assessors the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not, in the nature of things, audit that evidence, and the President pointed out that the evidence was duly transcribed, a record of it has been taken, and it is in the archives of the Board of Assessors, and therefore that evidence is available, and it ought to be available, for the Comptroller and Auditor-General if only the Government would stick to the Act under which that officer was appointed.  We have often been told here from the Ministerial Bench that civil servants ought not to be attacked, that it was unfair to attack an official who could not defend himself.  But here is the Minister for Agriculture making an attack upon the prestige, upon the dignity, and upon the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is not here to defend himself.</P>

      <P>We are asked to go through a farce, he said.  This is the farce the Minister for Agriculture speaks of that the House has been treated to.  What else is it but a farce &mdash; this green Bill?  It is a farce because the orders, the duties and the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are being usurped by the Minister for Finance, and by the Executive Council, and because they refuse to accord to him the facilities that under the law of this land he is entitled to exercise.  What does the claim of the Comptroller and Auditor-General amount to?  The claim of the Comptroller and Auditor-General amounts to this, that he demands to have access to all documents, to all information, to all vouchers upon which these awards are based.  There is no use drawing the red herring into the discussion that the method in which the tribunal carried on its proceedings has nothing whatever to do with the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is what is his own opinion, and no refutation of it has come here.  Statements have been made that the Attorney-General has advised the State that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is outside his rights in demanding this, but no statement has been produced from the Attorney-General.  Unfortunately the Attorney-General is not a member of this House.  He is not here to state the legal position, and the Minister for Agriculture knows so little about the legal position that he has taken up the time of the House with a long rigmarole of strictness and abuse of everybody leading to nothing in particular.  Are we asked to go through a farce?  What are we deciding?  What are the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to be in this matter? Whoever suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was to see and examine witnesses?  Did the Comptroller and Auditor-General suggest that?  Did anyone on this side of the House suggest it?  Did the Labour Party suggest it?  I never heard of such a preposterous suggestion. To think that that kind of <Col N="1736" /> thing will go down with the House at this hour of the day is really treating even the back benchers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party with too much contempt.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General should see withnesses and examine them.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is to see witness and examine them! The Comptroller and Auditor-General is to overrule the decisions of a court!  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is to do no such thing. His functions are laid down in Article 62 of the Constitution.  Repeal that Article of the Constitution, repeal the Exchequer and Audit Acts of 1866 and of 1921, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act of 1923.  If you repeal these Acts you can talk about passing this Bill into law.  What you are doing at present is simply putting the <i>ipse dixit</i> of some Minister like the Minister for Agriculture, who knows nothing whatever about this question, who has never taken the time nor the trouble to study it, over and above the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who has been placed in his position by this Dáil, who is the servant of this Dáil, and not of the Government, whose function it is to see that moneys are spent, that due accounts shall be rendered to him for all such moneys, to see how moneys are spent and spent in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Article 62 of the Constitution says: &mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to Act on behalf of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.</P>
      <P>Is Article 62 of the Constitution to hold, or is the speech of the Minister for Agriculture to hold?  The Exchequer and Audit Department Act of 1921, Section 1, says: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Appropriation Account shall be examined by the Comptroller <Col N="1737" /> and Auditor-General on behalf of the House of Commons, and in the examination of such accounts the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall satisfy himself that the money expended has been applied to the purpose or purposes for which the Grants made by Parliament were intended to provide, and that the expenditure conforms with the authority which governs it.</P>
    <P>Mention of the House of Commons does not matter there because that Act and all Acts defining the powers and duties of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in Great Britain were made to apply to this country under the Act of 1923, and under the Adaptation of Enactments Act. Section 28 of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act of 1866 says:</P>
    <P>In order that such examination may as far as possible proceed <i>pari passu</i> with the transactions of the several accountancy departments the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have free access, at all convenient times, to the books and accounts and other documents relating to the accounts of such departments and may require the several departments concerned to furnish him, from time to time, or at regular periods, with accounts of the transactions of such departments.</P>
    <P>Was the Comptroller and Auditor-General exercising his powers or was he not?  Was he over-stepping his powers?  Was he trying to set himself up, as the Minister for Agriculture would have us believe, as a supreme court, as a tribunal of appeal over this Board of Assessors? He was doing no such thing.  He was looking for some information that he had a right to get, that he has got in the case of old age pensioners, pensioned national teachers, Civil Service pensioners, and in the case of the ex-R.I.C.</P>

      <P>According to the Comptroller and Auditor-General in any case he has a right to audit these accounts, and what he says as an auditor is not that a list shall be presented to him of payments to certain persons who held certain ranks, or showed certain service in the Army, but that the evidence on which the awards were made shall be made available to him, that he shall have free and full access to all documents and papers in connection therewith.  It was in connection with the exercise of that right which he has in the case of all other pensioners that he tried to exercise it in this case.  Accordingly on the 7th January, 1926, the Comptroller and Auditor-General wrote to the Army Finance Officer stating:</P>
      <P>It is requested that the original applications for service pensions paid during the financial year ended 31st March, 1925, may be forwarded to this Department</P>
      <P>He simply asked for the original application.  The reply received from the Army Finance Office, dated 16th February, 1926, stated: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In accordance with the request I duly applied to the Secretary, Board of Assessors, for the original application, and received the following reply, dated 1st inst., from the Chairman: &ldquo;The Board cannot agree to forward the documents mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just in the same way as no arguments have come forward in support of the proposal that the duties and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be curtailed in this arbitrary fashion by the Executive Council, so on that occasion that officer, who was placed in a position by the Constitution of the State and by three different Acts upon the Statute Book to carry out these duties, was refused all information. He was simply told: &ldquo;You cannot have these documents.&rdquo;  No reason was given, because this Board of Assessors was such a high and <Col N="1739" /> mighty Board that it thought itself not alone superior to the ordinary courts, to the ordinary procedure, to the ordinary departmental routine, even to the Ministers, but it thought, and I hope now it will find out its mistake, that it was also superior to the Dáil&mdash;that the Dáil could not interfere and put that Board in its place.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gorman, the Army Finance Officer at the time, made a very feeble argument in favour of the Board of Assessors.  And why not? The Board of Assessors has produced no argument; the Ministers have produced no argument; the Minister for Finance, in any of his dealings with the Committee of Public Accounts, has produced no argument; and, therefore, it was only natural that this unfortunate official who was before that Committee of Public Accounts, and who had to answer to them for the transgressions of the Board of Assessors, should say: &ldquo;Under Section 3 (6) of the Act the findings of the Board of Assessors set out in their report shall in all cases be final and conclusive and binding upon the applicant.&rdquo;  As the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee pointed out, &ldquo;upon the applicant&rdquo; and upon nobody else. If they are final and conclusive and binding upon everybody, what is the necessity for this Bill?  The fact that this Bill is brought in now, and that we have to sanction the illegality of this Board of Assessors, or whoever represented it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It does not matter to me whether it is the Board of Assessors or the Army <Col N="1740" /> Finance Officer acting on their behalf. What I do say is that they at that time set themselves out as superior to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and they produced no shred of evidence or argument or reason which supported that claim.</P>

      <P>On this Bill, we are in exactly the same position.  No evidence whatever in support of the claim that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not have access to these papers has been brought forward.  The Act of Parliament has been quoted, but in a very minor particular.  It has been quoted in reference to Section 6 by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the Minister for Finance, and even in that small matter, the Minister for Agriculture showed that he had never read the Act, because it was not the Minister for Finance, but the Minister for Defence, who was referred to in that particular section. We are asked in this Bill to sanction the proceedings of that board of which we have no knowledge; of which the Minister for Agriculture, in spite of his enthusiasm, has no knowledge; of which he know so little that he does not even know whether the evidence taken and sworn, I presume, there &mdash; I do not know whether it was or not &mdash; was ever written down upon paper.  It is akin with his knowledge of the rest of the subject and with his idea of this Dáil, that he should come forward and treat us to such a miserable and preposterous setting forth of his ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper, who I am sorry is not present, when speaking on this matter pointed out that he had been a member of the Public Accounts Committee and that if there was anything he looked forward to, in case he left public life, it would be the feeling that while on that Committee he had done good work for the country.  It is an extraordinary thing that Deputy Cooper himself recognised, while a member of the Public Accounts Committee, with his <Col N="1741" /> colleagues there, that this position, if not illegal, was anomalous, and that, at any rate, an effort was being made to curtail the rights and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee which submitted the report signed by Deputy Davin on 24th February, 1928, which Deputy Davin has already read to the House, and which they may be in danger of forgetting; because when people who know nothing whatever about the Public Accounts Committee, and about the procedure, and do not even go to the trouble of ascertaining the simple facts in connection with it, get up here and treat us to the kind of stuff that the Minister for Agriculture has treated us to, we are apt to forget the simple facts of the case. The Public Accounts Committee reported: &mdash;</P>
    <P>It is undesirable to deal with a charge which recurs annually in a manner which appears to limit the powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General who is required by the terms of the Statute defining the duties and powers of his office to examine on behalf of the Dáil every Appropriation Account other than those in which a specific indication to the contrary appears on the face of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cooper was speaking here the last evening he took very great care indeed, though not anxious to prejudice the weak position which the Government hold upon the question, knowing something about this matter, and having been a member of the Public Accounts Committee, that another side of the question should be brought out in the Dáil.  He said here quite definitely two things, and these are the only two important points in his speech: that there were abnormal circumstances in connection with this matter and that, perhaps, the Labour Party were somewhat to blame because, when this Bill was originally passing through the Dáil, they did not say that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have <Col N="1742" /> the right that they now say he has. The same argument was made, as a matter of fact, by the Minister for Finance &mdash; why did not the Labour Party say so-and-so when the Bill was being passed?  The answer is there &mdash; there was no need to.  That Bill was the same as every other Pensions Bill, in connection with which the awards and the evidence upon which the awards were based, and all other matters connected therewith should have been available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. It speaks well for the Labour Party &mdash; and I give them credit for it &mdash; that they took the chief part in showing up this thing.  A decision was arrived at the year before Deputy Davin was in the Chair and the amount in the Estimate that year of £2,000 was passed by the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>It speaks well for Deputy Davin and the Labour Party that the following year they got Deputy Cooper himself to bring in this amendment or minute that I have read, because although it is in Deputy Davin's name it was Deputy Cooper brought it in.  Deputy Cooper brought in this amendment, saying that an attempt was being made to limit the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Therefore, it comes badly from Deputy Cooper at this stage to say that the Labour Party is to blame, and that the Dáil did not know its own mind &mdash; that the thing was not foreseen, that it was not clear in the Act.  That is all rubbish, all hogwash.  The Act was the same as every Act.  The Labour Party took the view that there was one Vote different to all other Votes where the Auditor-General is not allowed this right, and that is the Secret Service Vote.  We all know that; it is stated on the face of it. But there is nothing in the Bill to show that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not have the right.  Nobody has brought it forward here or would be able to show that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has not these rights.  These were denied him for the past two <Col N="1743" /> years.  Speaking the last night, Deputy Cooper thought perhaps that the position and dignity of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General might require considerable strengthening even from him, as a member of the Government Party, when he said that at no time did the Comptroller and Auditor-General exceed his functions or power.</P>
    <P>Now we are told by the Minister for Agriculture that he is trying to do so, that he is trying to set himself up as a tribunal over this Board of Assessors; that he is going to hear witnesses from all over the country. Did anybody ever hear a grosser misrepresentation of the whole business than that?  Are we to believe Deputy Cooper that the rights and prerogatives of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are being prejudiced, or are we to believe the Minister for Agriculture, who was never on the Public Accounts Committee and never took the trouble to study any of its proceedings.  It has been said that this is a court. Apart from the ground that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has these rights, that as he is an officer of the Dáil and endowed under Statutes of the Dáil with the power, it is our duty as Deputies of the Dáil to support him in asserting these powers against any Minister or against the Executive or against any officials who attempt to interfere with him.  What does the Comptroller and Auditor-General himself say.  One might have thought from the speech of the Minister for Agriculture that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had no feeling in this matter.  He has feelings.  It is no joke for an official of the Dáil who is in a special position and has special rights attached to his office, and whose position is preserved by the Constitution, to find himself moving contrary to the wishes of the Executive in power, and having to pit himself and his office year after year against the combined attacks, against the combined efforts, massed forces of the Ministry of Finance, <Col N="1744" /> the Ministry of Defence, and the whole Executive Council in this particular matter.  Therefore, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who, the Minister for Agriculture would give us the impression, was either a nonentity or a Frankenstein, is in danger of doing enormous damage unless we take steps to retard him.</P>
    <P>When the Army Finance Officer came forward with the legal arguments, such as they were, the Auditor-General made a statement.  I shall give his exact words.  I do not give them because they establish a special point in my favour, but to show that as an official the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to go before the Public Accounts Committee.  The Committee naturally have to regard things from his standpoint since we represent the Dáil and he represents the Dáil and since he only brings before us irregularities, things he thinks are not right.  We naturally have, to a certain extent, to take his standpoint.  When the Committee of Public Accounts were examining the 1924-25 Accounts through some extraordinary weakness which they made up for the following year when they signed Deputy Davin's report, they professed to see reason in the statement of the Department of Defence that these things should not be made public to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Mr. McGrath said: &ldquo;I do not want to be regarded as coming here to get the authority of the committee to go any further than the intention of the Dáil, but it is my duty to point out that this committee is agreeing that moneys voted by the Dáail shall be expended without examination of the basis of the award.&rdquo;  There precisely the Comptroller and Auditor-General had to state his position.  He was defeated upon that position for the time being.  The following year, with Deputy Davin in control, a definite minute was inserted in the report which originated with Deputy Cooper himself and that minute specifically reversed the decision of the previous year and came to the <Col N="1745" /> conclusion that the abnormal circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy has announced that a minute of the Public Accounts Committee has definitely reversed the decision of the previous Public Accounts Committee.  I think it is only fair to the Dáil that this committee which represents the whole Dáil should be exonerated from the charge that one committee definitely repudiated the decision of the previous committee.</P>

The following year the statement was inserted in the report that I have read out &mdash; I think it is not necessary to read it again.  It was inserted by Deputy Cooper and unanimously adopted, as Deputy Davin pointed out, whereas the previous year it was only passed by a majority.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Esmonde will be given an opportunity of speaking after.  I only wish to emphasise that strong as is the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="1746" /> under the Constitution and in law, and sympathetic as is the understanding with which he is treated and has to be treated by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee have to interpret the law as they find it.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has to answer questions there to account for his decisions like any other officer. He has to meet officials of the various departments, and the Committee of Public Accounts have in the long run to make up their mind whether he in his criticisms is right or wrong.  Therefore, if we weaken the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in this matter, if we say that he was wrong, if we give sanction to the proceeding of withholding these data from him, we weaken his position for the whole future.  We destroy his prestige.  We take this pillar of the State, this chief officer whom we have to look after our finances and whose duty it is to see that we are controlled, and at the behest of the Ministry we are simply throwing him into the dust. The other argument in favour of this Bill is that this precious Board of Assessors was a court, and as a court there can be no appeal from it. Apart from the rights and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General we, on this side of the House, take the opportunity to state, have stated and will continue to state, that we have no confidence in the Board and that we are not satisfied with it. Deputy Boland, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Aiken and others have given individual instances.  No opportunity is given to anybody, to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or anyone else if this Bill becomes law, to review the evidence upon which we believe these wrongful awards were made.  It would be a terrible thing, we are told, if there was any appeal from the Board of Assessors. There is an appeal from every court to the Supreme Court.  There was an appeal from the Supreme Court to the British Privy Council, and we know the effect of that.  We know that legislation was passed in this House as a result of it or legislation that was in some way connected with <Col N="1747" /> it.  There must always be an appeal from a court to a higher court.</P>
      <P>The very fact that this court sat in such abnormal circumstances &mdash; circumstances which induced Deputy Cooper, whom I am glad to see here now, to give it his benediction at the time &mdash; shows clearly that that Board was not in its nature a court.  It could not be a court.  It had not the judicial detachment, the independence of party, which must belong to a court.  Neither had its proceedings publicity.  It was constituted of three persons, two being members of the Government Party and the third being a barrister.  It sat in private, took all its evidence in private, and no part of its proceedings, so far as I know, was made public.  Does any member of the Party who hold control in the Free State at present contend that a body is a court which hears only partial evidence, which has two members of a political party of three as judges, that party always holding a majority in all cases and in all awards?  This semi-political tribunal heard only part of the evidence, and heard that part in secret under abnormal circumstances, when we had just ceased a civil war, and when one part of the old I.R.A. was on one side and another part on the other side.  The part which happened to be on my side, at any rate, was never heard.  It is not that they expect reward, but, as Deputy Boland and Deputy Lemass pointed out, their information, as has since been the case, might have been sought, might have been looked for, and might have saved the State some of this £150,000, which we believe is being mischievously squandered. Officers of the so-called Irregular Forces were called in in at least one case I know to uphold the State and save it from the extravagance into which the Minister, in their political enthusiasm, precipitated it after their great victory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no information.  We are told that this court sat in secret, hearing only part of the evidence, and belonging exclusively &mdash; I think I may say without saying anything unduly <Col N="1748" /> harsh about the tribunal&mdash;to one political party.  To say that that court is above review, and that no other court or person should ever have power to review its proceedings is an extraordinary contradiction, because if any mistakes are made, and if new facts are brought to light the Board themselves may re-open the case, but, we are told, no other body is to have that power.  What will happen if anything happens any members of the Board?  Someone will have to take their place.  Apparently, they are to continue in sæcula sæculorum, and as long as the Minister for Finance allows them, provided they see fit to accord to his wishes.  There was a case in connection with a soldier killed in a street brawl which came before the Public Accounts Committee.  In this case, on account of the attitude of the Public Accounts Committee, the Minister for Finance submitted a case to the Attorney-General, who reported back on the 26th April, 1926, Appendix 13, in the 1926-27 Report. The Attorney-General's Report on this particular case shows that this court is not by any means infallible. It can make mistakes like anyone else.  Although he himself was not anxious to be set up as a Court of Appeal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we would expect from you, and that is precisely the attitude in which you administer the affairs of your Department. It was in that attitude that you went over to Uncle Sam to preach companionship with John Bull there.  The servant girls of America were not good enough for you.  You would like to be with the big fellows.  The Department of Defence produced reasons to show why this impartial Court should not have the papers in connection with it produced to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  These are the reasons given by the Department of Defence.  The Department of Defence, you will notice, in these reasons which they allege to be sound and substantial, have not accorded this officer his rights.  They do not quote a single Act of Parliament or authority to uphold them in this struggle which they now propose to carry out victoriously.  The first argument was: &ldquo;The information contained in the documents in question was of a character that rendered it undesirable, in the public interest, that it should be made available, either now or for many years to come, to any person whatsoever. The matters which the Board investigated were of a type bearing a strong analogy to those ordinarily <Col N="1750" /> the subject of secret service, the Vote for which is specifically exempt from audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;  The point is that as the Secret Service were specifically exempt, and as the Military Service pensions were not specifically exempt from audit, they were open to audit.  There could be no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The next question is where is the analogy to the Secret Service?  We could develop a political argument on this side to show that there is a political analogy if we wanted to in that case.  But in the case of the Secret Service, where the Government may be carrying on espionage against another Government, which may be important for it in future, to say that the details of that should be placed on the same basis as evidence in connection with services for which pensions are granted to a large number of persons whose names, activities, and addresses are known, is absurd.  How is it claimed that these matters are secret, that it would not be in the public interest to give details of them to the Comptroller and Auditor-General?  It has been emphasised by Deputy Lemass and other Deputies that the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not want to publish these facts at all. All the Comptroller and Auditor-General wants is to assure himself that these payments are right, that these people are entitled to the money and that the vouchers and documents in connection with them are available.  If there is nothing irregular about it what is the objection to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General?  Nothing is reported by him except something which he thinks is contrary to the wishes of the Dáil and the law of the land.  Therefore, I think there are no documents that cannot be given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or to members of the Committee, if necessary, about the records and activities of these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many of these pensioners have left the country and Deputy Cooper stated that perhaps they might be made amenable in other <Col N="1751" /> States for their activities.  If the British Government can still prosecute men for activities that were carried out before the Truce, I am astonished, if we are in a friendly state with England and if all the delightful things which the Minister for Defence has been saying about the English in America is only slightly true.</P>
    <P>The next point is &ldquo;that stringent assurances that their statements and evidence would be regarded as confidential were given by the Board to applicants and witnesses in order to enable the Board to secure the evidence to arrive at its reports.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The second point is &ldquo;that stringent assurances that their statements and evidence would be regarded as confidential were given by the Board to applicants and witnesses in order to enable the Board to secure the evidence necessary to arrive at its reports.&rdquo;  Assurances were necessary!  In the words of Deputy Cooper when he was speaking here the last night they exceeded their powers as the Auditor-General at no time exceeded his powers.  The Board of Assessors at the very commencement of their operations did something which they had no power to do, particularly if they were, as is now argued, a court whose decisions must go down as irrevocable, and cannot be ever challenged.  They gave stringent assurances that the evidence would be confidential.  That apparently is only natural, in view of the great number of pensioners from Meath, for example, in proportion to the small amount of work which was done in Co. Meath.  It is only natural that the Government would not like that the evidence upon which these pensions were given would be published or made available, even to the Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is &ldquo;that from the nature of the investigation which the Board of Assessors was called upon to make, difficult questions of fact would have arisen in the interpretation of pre-Truce military service; that only a Board of very specially qualified persons could ascertain these facts; and that accordingly its findings on such facts should not be <Col N="1754" /> open to review by any other authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Board examined and came to a decision about questions which had happened many years before. They came to these decisions without having the evidence at their disposal of certain people like Deputy Boland or Deputy Lemass who could have given them evidence.  There can be no question or doubt that they had not complete evidence in these cases.  There can be no question or doubt that they exceeded their duty and power in making their court secret, and further there can be no question or doubt that they were actuated by political motives, because they belonged to one party which had just been at strife with the other party, and it is only human nature that they should have a certain attitude towards the people on the other side, and that they should determine that these people or anybody associated with them could never get a pension or should never in fact be called upon in this matter particularly if it were a case of giving evidence to prove that some staunch and tried supporter of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in Co. Meath had a rather weak military record.  It is only natural that evidence coming from people on this side of the House in a matter like that should not be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>You are proud of them; in any case the Minister is not going to apologise to anybody for giving those pensions.  This is beside the point.  As Deputy Boland said, the Government have a perfect right to divide the spoils to suit <Col N="1755" /> themselves.  What we ask and what we are going to see as far as in us lies is that they carry out the regulations which they themselves have laid down in the Constitution, in the Acts of Parliament, and in the procedure of the Public Accounts Committee for carrying out the rules of the game.  The Government Party no doubt have a certain amount of diffidence in this matter.  We on this side of the House, if the Minister for Agriculture will credit us with such a thing as diffidence, have as a matter of fact diffidence.</P>
      <P>We feel it a rather strange anomaly that a matter of this kind, involving pensions to a large number of people, should be decided in a House &mdash; the pensions being granted by a court the majority of which consisted of members of that party&mdash; by a Party which at present includes seven pensioners.  It would be an extraordinary thing if we could expect argument, reason, logic or law from a Government that is placed in the extraordinary position the Government are in, that when a by-election happens the only man they can get is a man with a pension.  In a short time pensioners will be set apart as a definite privileged class in this country, like the priests in ancient Egypt, and they will carry on the government <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the opinion of the country.  The country has quite a different point of view about it, and the country, at least, imagines that we will not sanction the acts of the Board of Assessors, that we will not repeal, because that is what it amounts to, the Acts and the clause of the Constitution which conferred those powers on the Comptroller and Auditor-General who has endeavoured to exercise them, and which the Government or their henchmen have refused to allow him to exercise.  At least, let the Government carry out the rules if they have nothing to be afraid of or nothing to be ashamed of.  If, as I suspect, a good many of the Ministers would be quite glad to get rid of the pensioners if they <Col N="1756" /> could only get the opportunity, now is the time to do it.</P>

      <P>May I make a personal explanation?  Deputy Derrig attacked me, knowing I cannot reply, having already spoken.  I only want to correct him on one point.  The report of the Public Accounts Committee in 1927 was drawn up by the chairman, who was then leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil.  Before it was issued he was taken ill, and I was appointed by the Committee as acting chairman to sign that report. I think there are Deputies here who remember it.  It is the report of the Committee as a whole.  As an individual, I am prepared to stand over my signature.  I do not repudiate it. It was not my personal report, but that of the Committee as a whole, and it was not drafted by me in the terms in which it was made public. I am entitled to say that.</P>

      <P>I listened to this debate with a certain amount of disappointment. I am interested to a certain extent in Government accountancy, and I thought the Opposition in this debate would bring out weighty arguments as to why certain classes of expenditure should be scrutinised by the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The arguments produced by the Opposition showed no sound reasons why any document should be shown to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Wild insinuations, vague charges, calling of names to the personnel of the Board, were the chief weapons of attack.  True it is that the Labour Party expressed and showed a sincere anxiety lest a precedent be established in this case.  Well, respect for precedent is not peculiar to any particular part of this House, and I submit to the Labour Party that in following the path laid down by this particular Bill we are more correctly following the established path laid down by precedent than by opposing <Col N="1757" /> this particular Bill.  Two classes of expenditure have generally and uniformly been exempt from serutiny and re-investigation by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General &mdash; (1)  awards or expenditure made as a result of the verdict of a judicial tribunal having heard written and oral evidence, and (2)  expenditure that can generally be regarded as of a highly confidential nature. Now the expenditure under the Military Service Pensions Act comes very genuinely under both heads. Everyone in this House knows that it would not be in the public interest to rake up the details and specific activities of individuals in the period to which this particular Act applies. No matter what their attitude is with regard to this Bill, deep down in their hearts they know that is a fact.  When the main Bill was going through this House all parties in the House at the time, being nearer then to the events I referred to, knew and felt that it would be undesirable to make public the detailed activities of individuals.  That is shown by the very formation of the Military Service Pensions Bill.  That Bill was not the only Pensions Bill passed by the Dáil.  Two other Pensions Bills were passed, but in neither of the other Bills was a statutory board brought into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In both other Bills the Committee working under the Minister was left to assess the pensions so that the arrangements were open to investigation by the Finance Department and the Comptroller and Auditor-General. In this particular Bill, unlike the other two, a statutory board was established by Dáil Eireann.  Are we now to believe that the Labour Party who at that time were the main opposition party here and who were an alert and hard working party, so suddenly lost their alertness that they were asleep when that particular statutory board was established?  It never occurred to them to ask the reason why.  They will not say now that it was not understood at the time that these documents should not come before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That question, <Col N="1758" /> every time it was put, was met by another question.  Not one of the Labour Party has so far stood up and said that it was the intention of the House at the time the Military Service Pensions Bill was passing that the documents should be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Davin who referred to the Comptroller and Auditor-General as the official of the whole House.  This board was just as much the instrument of this House as the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It was the instrument of the whole House, appointed to carry out a particular mission on behalf of the House.  It differed from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the fact that it was better qualified and more accomplished to carry out this peculiar investigation.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party are now &mdash; and well the Labour Party know it&mdash;in the position of attempting to strangle their own legitimate child.  We can count on the other members who were present at the time that Bill was passed to see that the promises which were either made or implied at the time are honoured now.  It has been stated that the object of the people opposing this Bill is merely that the documents, etc., should be brought before the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that it is not the intention that those documents should be made public. Deputies on all sides of this House <Col N="1759" /> know that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has got to report to the Public Accounts Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee, in turn, have got to report back to this House, and that year after year that particular report is made the subject of rather large headings in the daily papers.  Do they want us to believe that there is going to be a departure from that if the Public Accounts Committee deal with this particular subject?  If it is referred to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee it will naturally appear in the Press. That will not be in the public interest.  It will reawaken bitterness, re-open old wounds, and open again the sores and anguish of people who lost dear friends and relatives.  Deputies may smile, but that is serious from a public point of view.  No national good would be done by such a development, no good whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It is implied that the Comptroller and Auditor-General at the present moment has not any documents in relation to this particular expenditure. He has all the documents that are necessary for an ordinary financial audit.  The board made its assessments in terms of service and rank.  These are passed to him and he sees that the expenditure under this Act corresponds with the documents. He has everything necessary for a full financial audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Aiken suggested that the Government was using this particular Bill in order to buy political support for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That particular speech, from beginning to end, was thoroughly unworthy.  It was a speech that certainly will neither enhance the reputation of the speaker nor the prestige of his party.  From that suggestion he drifted to calling certain members of the Board toadies and political hacks.  As long as Parliamentary procedure is adhered to in any country, members of the Parliament will be asked to serve on boards appointed by that Parliament, and individuals asked to serve on such <Col N="1760" /> boards should not only be respected by the Parliament as a whole, but protected by the whole of that House from attack of an unfair kind. Suggestions were made that the Government utilised public funds to buy political support.  There is not a man, woman or child in Ireland that will believe that.  There is not one on these benches, not even Deputy Corry in his innocence, who believes that statement.  You have a Government there of poor men who, if they continue in office, will die poor men.  Members who occupied these benches and who have died, have died poor, and very poor men, and when the history of the first Government of the Irish Free State is written by impartial pens, all men will pay homage to the first Government of the Irish Free State, a Government of poor men financially and incorruptible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, in order to drive home a rather blunt-nosed argument, referred to this House as the Parliament elected by the people.  At the time the main Act was passed this House was none the less the Parliament elected by the people, although at the time the Deputy called it by other names.  I would submit that terms such as &ldquo;toadies&rdquo; and &ldquo;political hacks&rdquo; refer more aptly to those who changed their minds on major questions with such ease and facility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, in the course of his remarks, told us that this question was really a question of the division of the spoils of war, that the spoils of war, after all, go to the victors, and that he did not complain. In the particular war the Deputy referred to all the spoils did not go to the victors.  A substantial portion of the spoils went to the vanquished, and when there is a general demand from the Fianna Fáil Party that all public funds should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, then we may possibly change our mind with regard to the sincerity of their attitude on this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to treat this Bill from one or two aspects which <Col N="1761" /> I think have not been touched upon before.  If they have been touched upon they have not been emphasised sufficiently.  I am not going to dwell very long on the question raised as to the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  As far as I understand the constitutional position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, he does not judge the case, neither does he come to a decision. He leaves it to the Dáil and to the Committee of Public Accounts to proceed as they may deem fit.  The real position, so far as we are concerned, is, I submit, that we must maintain the authority of the Dáil over all classes of expenditure.</P>
      <P>I submit, also, that the granting of pensions is expenditure; and to the logically-minded Minister for Agriculture I hope that that will at least make some appeal. The Act, certainly, does impose certain conditions attaching to the granting of pensions. The Dáil must be perfectly satisfied that these conditions are fulfilled. I listened with very great attention, as I always do, to the Minister for Agriculture.  I recognise that he is a most able opponent and a clever and industrious Minister. I am going to throw that bouquet at him, because I have a very great regard for him in many ways outside the Dáil altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind that. I am prepared to take my share of brick-bats just as well as bouquets. In this case where the Minister for Agriculture has used the term of auditing and, so closely and so well, defined the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, I want to submit to him in return that the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are not altogether concerned with adding up long tots. In commercial life the auditor is entitled to call for papers and documents relating to any expenditure; and I regret, for reasons that I need not state now, that the Minister was rather unhappy in his definition of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's duties.  Now, I come to <Col N="1762" /> the Board of Assessors.  This Board of Assessors was attached to the Ministry, and was appointed by the Minister.  It is a fact, at least that is my information, that one Minister was a member of that Board of Assessors.  I think it was Deputy Derrig who spoke of the lack of political detachment.  There was no political detachment there, where two members of the Board of Assessors were members of a certain political party in the Dáil.  They could not be regarded in any circumstances as a legal tribunal.  They certainly could not be regarded as an impartial or legal tribunal.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins as to the attitude of the Labour Party.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke of the action of the Labour Party in support of the original Military Service Pensions Bill when passing through the Dáil.  When supporting the old Act the Labour Party never contemplated that the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as representing this House should be restricted in any way.  I have access to the report of 1927 and 1928 of the Public Accounts Committee, and I find quoted even there that never did the Dáil contemplate voting money for the payment of pensions under the Act, which payments would not be subject to audit.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance exercises supervision over expenditure, but that Department is not the final interpreter of the law in this case. That is a peculiar anomaly, and I suggest that there is no analogous case in other countries to justify its continuance here.  I do not now suggest that we should not do something new here and that we should always follow precedents.  Precedent was suggested by Deputy O'Higgins as if we were religiously to follow precedents all the time until <i>saecula saeculorum.</i>  But I want to suggest that if a precedent is bad, then we should scrap precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began by saying that I wanted to deal with this whole matter or to approach this whole question in a manner in which I do not believe it has been approached during the <Col N="1763" /> present session.  In saying that I do not want to be misinterpreted or misunderstood by anybody in this House.  I take off my hat and I salute every man who died for Ireland.  I take off my hat and salute every man who came to the rescue of this State when it was in peril, when the State was threatened by Irregulars or any other force which was operating against the establishment of the State at that time.  I want to say that, because I do not want to be misunderstood.  I say that because no matter how honest a man may be his words may be distorted and his meanings misinterpreted.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I have every regard and respect for the men who joined up in 1922 and after to save this country.  Were it not for these men I believe we would not be sitting or speaking in this House to-day. Having said that I want to say I do believe at the same time and I know it that there are thousands of men and women in this country to-day, people who have the greatest respect for the establishment of law and order and people who have the greatest respect for the present Government, but who believe in their hearts and souls that we are paying too much away in the form of pensions and gratuities even to those who have served the country in one capacity or another.  I want to submit with all due respect to certain Deputies of this House that no argument, no logical or sound arguments, can be adduced to give you any reason why this State should pension young and competent young men who can and who should be at work to-day producing something in this country.  Why the State should continue to pay pensions which are altogether out of proportion to the services rendered and altogether out of proportion to the capacity of this country to pay are matters that these people cannot understand.</P>

I mention no names.  We have even in this House, sir, men whom I respect very much for the services that they have rendered, but is there any country in the world, even Great Britain, which, during the war or after, did so reward her soldiers who had to face dangers far and away greater than our soldiers had to face?

I do suggest that his constitutional position should be such as to enable him to read through all the papers and make suggestions.  I think the Minister for Agriculture will at least admit this, that, owing to the nature of his training and his qualifications, the Comptroller and Auditor-General knows what is right and what is wrong, and he will be able to give a definite decision on any case submitted to him, if he is supplied with a précis or a verbatim note or a long-hand note of the evidence submitted to the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few Deputies here and all they can do is mumble.  You never hear them doing anything except speaking under their hands or, as the Frenchman would put it, up their sleeves &mdash; and they do it very badly at that &mdash; or else they are raising points of order that are not points of order, and the whole thing results in distorting sane and properly-delivered speeches.  I heard Deputy O'Higgins speaking about the present Government and referring to them as poor men.  The Deputy was allowed to wander and I am rather surprised that the Chair did not haul him up in the same way as I have been hauled up.  Although I am opposed to the present Government I want to join in the tribute to them.  I know they are all poor men like myself.</P>
      <P>I want to say in relation to the whole position that the tragedy of these military pensions is that there are many young men with long pensionable lives in front of them who got pensions and there is a considerable doubt all over the country as to whether they deserve those pensions. I am not one of those people who will quote cases without being able to give authentic details in regard to them.  I do not like to injure anybody, but I can submit evidence of at least one case in Cork of a man who never joined the Volunteers &mdash; and I was one of the earliest Volunteers &mdash; and had no military service until 1921.  He was then found in possession of an old, disused revolver which would require the combined brains of the best gunsmiths in Woolwich Arsenal to make it fire. He was caught with this old Queen Anne, absolutely obsolete, weapon in his possession and he gloriously went to gaol and came out a martyr. Like the Minister for Agriculture, when he was in gaol he got three square meals a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He poses as a martyr.  We have hundreds of these martyrs in the country, these wonderful people whom we know very well.  I know quite well why some of them got <Col N="1767" /> pensions.  I am not going to suggest that it was because of their affiliation to one party or another, although I am very, very suspicious. However, I will be very charitable-minded and I will say that it was a mere coincidence that in the last two elections they had to release two men serving with the armed forces of the State.  It was, I should say, a remarkable coincidence.  I am still a doubting Thomas that it was merely a remarkable coincidence, though it would take very, very little to disturb that doubtful feeling.  It is remarkable that in the last two by-elections they had to release my friend Deputy O'Higgins, for whom I have the very greatest respect, and also a Major-General, for whom I have great respect too, from service in the Army of the State.  Not alone have they released them from Army service in this poor country &mdash; I do not like to say unfortunate country, because it is not, as we could all get a living here if we tried &mdash; and brought them into the Dáil, but they have also given gratuities in both cases.  I do not want to be taken as one of the people who talk about the salaries that Ministers are getting or the salaries that anybody else may be getting, but I want to say that I consider it an outrage on this poor country to liberate from Army service fine, hefty young men, give them good jobs after that, and saddle the country with a large amount of money by way of a gratuity and pension for life of £300 a year.  Yerra, my God, who would not join the National Army after that?</P>

      <P>For some reason or another there was an intervention of a week between the two occasions on which the Minister for Agriculture spoke on this Bill.  I shall not go into the reasons for that delay now. However, as Deputy Anthony says, we have our suspicions.  Speaking to-day, the Minister for Agriculture said that Deputies should ask themselves what are the functions of the <Col N="1768" /> Comptroller and Auditor-General. There is no need to do that, because everybody knows that his business is to examine every Appropriation Account.  Army pensions are Appropriation Accounts.  Therefore, it is his business to examine them, and it is not the duty of any Deputy in this House to prove that this official who safeguards this House has a right to investigate documents in connection with any Act passed by this House which involves the payment of money, because that right is there, unless it is expressly stated to the contrary in any Act when it is being passed.  It is not stated in this measure that he has not the right. Therefore, he must have the right in connection with this Bill to investigate all documents relating to military pensions.  It is quite obvious that the Minister for Agriculture had not made up his brief before he addressed the House this evening. His first case was that it would be impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to judge the cases properly, as the chief evidence upon which pensions are given happens to be oral evidence, which the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not avail of until the President informed him that a long-hand note was taken of all the oral evidence given.  I was aware of that, because I gave evidence myself before the Board of Assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked what is the particular necessity for allowing the Comptroller and Auditor-General to make investigations in connection with this Bill?  There is a necessity, and the necessity is greater in connection with this Bill than in regard to any other measure that was ever passed through this House.  We know the circumstances under which those pensions were given.  Without passing any aspersions on the honesty of those who constituted the Board, it will be admitted that every one of them belonged to one political party and that quite unconsciously they would be biased.  There is even among Cumann na nGaedheal followers in this country a suspicion that people have got pensions who were not entitled to them.  It is stated in the Co. Galway and, as far <Col N="1769" /> as I can see it is true, that every Centre of the I.R.B. in that county, with the exception of two who happened to be Republicans, has got a pension, although they never fired a shot in their lives except from a fowling piece at wild fowl.  These are facts.  You have the same thing in Co. Meath.  Every Centre of the I.R.B. in that county got a pension. As was revealed in certain debates that took place in this House&mdash;debates which Deputy Dr. O'Higgins might look up&mdash;there was a connection between a member of that board and the I.R.B., and I do not suppose the board would be quite impartial in allotting pensions to members of a society with which they were once, and we do not know how recently, closely connected.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly much reason for questioning in connection with this Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture beaten on that point went on to other points.  They are afraid of publishing the facts.  Who asked that they should be published?  The Comptroller and Auditor-General would investigate these documents. There is a verbatim report taken of the oral evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General does not bring before that committee any accounts which he thinks are just and, correct, but he does bring before it such items as he thinks should not have been passed. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said, would it not be a dreadful thing if they were published.  I say would it not be a dreadful thing for this House if they were not published.  Is it not our duty then to see that things that are illegally passed, or at least that are very questionable, should be put before the Public Accounts Committee and before this Dáil so that moneys may not be mis-spent or that moneys appropriated for one purpose are not given for another purpose? I think it is very essential that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have full power to investigate the documents, and to bring before our attention cases which he thinks should not have been passed.  That is not publicity. <Col N="1770" /> As regards other cases what publicity are they afraid of?  Are those who got pensions for their service to the country ashamed of their service or the amount of pensions they got? I know that some of them are. Questions have been asked in this House by members of our Party as to what particular men got pensions in the Co. Galway?  I could mention to the House the cases of three men who were so ashamed of letting their neighbours know that they had got pensions for doing nothing that they did not go outside their own doors for nearly three weeks.  These are facts.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that there are two classes of cases exempt from inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, namely, the verdicts of judicial tribunals and expenditure of a highly confidential nature.  The Deputy told us that military service comes under both.  I fail to see how it does.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the evidence can be regarded of a highly confidential nature in view of the fact that it is seen by a Board consisting of four men.  Is it insinuated for a moment that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not as well able to keep a secret as any one of these four men, or that he is going to reveal to anyone the particular reasons for which a man deservedly got a pension?  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General is convinced from reading the documents that a man should not have got a pension, and that the evidence is not conclusive and did not justify the Board in awarding a pension, would it not be quite right for him to reveal that to this House and see that the facts are revealed?  As to the statement that the Board of Assessors were the instruments of this House, they were, I suppose, in a manner.  I ask the House for a moment to consider the circumstances in which the court was held.  It was held in a military barracks, in which you were inspected about four times before you were allowed to go in and give evidence.  That did not look very much like an impartial tribunal, or one that the country would have <Col N="1771" /> much confidence in.  I had about 20 men coming to me to vouch for service which they never rendered because they said the State would pay. I refused to do that.  As a matter of fact, I gave evidence before that court to the effect that, as far as I knew, they had given no such service. There are men in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who told me they had a similar experience.  Considering the times and the circumstances and the secrecy of the court, I am convinced that in many cases people were weak enough to sign such documents and allow men to get pensions, men who never deserved them, men who had not given the service which they were pretending they had rendered to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise, on the motion on the adjournment, a question relating to a drainage scheme in Co. Roscommon. I put the following question to the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whether he is aware that the Roscommon County Council, in September, 1925, petitioned the Board of Works for a drainage scheme for the Hind River and its tributaries under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925; if he will state the reason why this petition was not acceded to, the work having been done under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924; further, if the Minister is aware that if the steps provided for in the 1925 Act to consult the rated occupiers affected had been taken the project would have been turned down; whether in view of this and the hardship inflicted on the people, the Minister will reconsider the decision to contribute only 25 per cent. of the cost from State funds and allow the 75 per cent.; also, if he will take the necessary steps to have the period of repayment extended from 10 to 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave me the following reply:&mdash;The answer to the first <Col N="1772" /> part of the question is in the affirmative. As to the second part, the Commissioners of Public Works decided against the petition for the reason that the area affected was practically the same as that included in the existing Hind River drainage district and the works of restoration being carried out under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, eliminated the necessity for the formation of a new drainage district.  The third part of the question is hypothetical, but no hardship has been inflicted on the occupiers of land; as to the remainder of the question nothing can now be done as the Charging Order has been enrolled in the Central Office of the High Court of Justice, and cannot be altered.</P>
    <P>I consider that answer is most unsatisfactory. The people in Roscommon County petitioned to have this carried out under the Drainage Act of 1925.  The petition was forwarded to the Commissioners of Public Works, and the result was that an engineer was sent down. Notwithstanding public opinion in the matter in County Roscommon, instead of the scheme being done under the Act of 1925, under which there are greater benefits, the engineer reported that the work should be done under the Act of 1924.  The consequences of the wishes of the people in County Roscommon not being acceded to, meant that hardship was inflicted on them. The drainage schemes were undertaken at the cost of £4,462.  That included a Government grant of £1,115 10s., leaving to be assessed on the area in which the money was to be expended, £3,346 10s.  This was an old drainage scheme undoubtedly. It was under the control, as such schemes are, of the Drainage Board.  They were able to keep the river in a good state at a cost of about £60 a year.  My information is that the Commissioners of Public Works actually had men engaged at one part of the river on this scheme without informing the Drainage Board of the fact.  This work was undertaken in 1926, and we all know what the political situation was then. <Col N="1773" /> I make no insinuation, but the belief in the district was&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Brennan will bear me out in this&mdash;that the major portion of the cost was to be borne by the State, and advantage was naturally taken of this scheme because of the unemployment that was in the district.  Most of the people, I am credibly informed, believed that there was to be a free grant, but they found out to their cost that that was not to be so.</P>
    <P>I am also informed, and I believe accurately, that in the area in which the cost has been levied, the holdings or farms were exempt from the old drainage rates.  The landlord, in the first instance, paid the drainage rate, and the Land Commission after him.  These people are now being roped in and assessed for the cost of this work about which they were not consulted.</P>
    <P>I got a letter from the Commissioners of Public Works stating that the cost per acre amounted to 1/7d. One of the people affected informed me that there is included in the area of charge a considerable area of red bog and very bad land, which will bear a small proportion of this rate, and which I am informed could bear only about one-twentieth of the rate. I ask the Government to give the maximum allowed under the Act of 1924, seeing that they refused to have the work done under the Act of 1925.  I am asking for 75 per cent. under the Act of 1924.  That cannot be done unless the Act is amended, but at least the maximum under the Act of 1924, which is 50 per cent., should be allowed.  An Act was passed enabling these people to say whether they would have the scheme or not.  I submit it is most unfair to put power of the sort I have referred to into the hands of a public official so that he can override the wishes of the people.  I have also been told that this order has been enrolled in the High Court of Justice, and that the charges set out here are final, binding, and cannot be altered.  As the law stands I suppose that is so.  There is another scheme in the same district, called Ballybay, which cost £100.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> I believe that as the law stands at present nothing can be done.  I submit that the question of amending the Act should be considered so that this enrolling order may not be final and binding.  There should be some method of getting away from that. I am informed, and I believe rightly, that an impossible burden is being placed on the people as a result of this drainage scheme.  I have had statements from people who have been charged with the drainage rate whose lands are adjoining the Shannon and could not be improved by the scheme.  For about six months of the year these lands are flooded, and yet the owners of them are asked to pay not alone the ordinary drainage rate but an added one put on to them by a Government Department, which acted without consulting the wishes of the people who have knowledge extending over generations, and who know the habits of the rivers much better than an engineer who merely pays a casual visit could.  Until the new system of pumping is put into execution as regards the Shannon it would be impossible to give any relief from flooding.  It is an outrageous state of affairs that people who are prepared to prove that they have gained nothing by this drainage scheme are going to be so heavily assessed.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the whole question and ask the Minister for Finance to do what he is entitled to do under the Act, and to do something, if necessary by amendment of the Act, to vary the order so as to grant relief to people who have been victimised in this way.  They certainly should get the rights under the Act of 1925.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly a very serious hardship is being inflicted on the people affected by this scheme, and other people in the County Roscommon as well.  Similar work was carried out in Elphin district, and in the Suck, Ballybay, and Croghan districts; but a greater hardship is being inflicted in connection with the Hind River scheme than in the other schemes for the reason that the <Col N="1775" /> period of repayment of the loan in that case is only ten years while in the case of the Suck district it is 20 years, and in the case of Elphin it is 15 years.  In addition, in the case of the River Suck there is a free grant of 30 per cent. of the cost, the repayment of the remainder of the cost being spread over a period of twenty years.  In the case of Elphin there was a free grant of 33? per cent., and the period of repayment was 15 years.  In the case of the Hind River there was a free grant of 25 per cent. and the repayment was spread over a period of only 10 years.  Taken from that angle, I think these people for whom Deputy Boland has spoken have been badly treated.  I do not know exactly to whom the blame attaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the people affected consider that when the County Council was informed about this work, it should have protested against its execution.  The County Council was notified about the work on the 14th August 1926, but no ordinary meeting of the Council was held until the following October.  The matter came before the County Council on the 23rd October for the first time, and at that time probably three-quarters of the work had been done, so that there was no opportunity given anybody, as far as I know, to protest against the expenditure of money on the work, or to suggest that an additional period of ten years should be given for a repayment, or that a larger percentage of the money should be given as a grant.  I do not know if the Board of Works published any notice, even in the local Press, prior to the 23rd October, which would have given those affected by the work on the Hind River an idea of the repayment they would have to make, but I know that it was evident on the 23rd October, when the matter came before the County Council, that the benefit of the work being done on the Hind River and its tributaries would not in any way correspond to the expenditure.  I will read from a report in a Roscommon paper what <Col N="1776" /> happened at the meeting of the Country Council:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Department wrote that a sum of £4,000 is to be expended on the Hind River district, of which the Government will pay £1,000. It was proposed to carry out a general restoration scheme which would entail a charge of 2/8 an acre on lands affected or £3,000 in all.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the meeting said here was work now proceeding, and all the Council had to do was to collect the cost.  He must say from observation that if there was £4,000 spent on the river there would not be £2,000 value given.</P>
    <P>That was the first time the matter came before the County Council, and I have no knowledge that prior to that any notice was published in the local Press or anywhere else.  I do not know if the Drainage Board was informed, or if those who were to benefit by the work were informed that it would entail a charge of 2/8 an acre on land affected. Deputy Boland pointed out that originally an application was sent to the County Council by these people to have the work done under the 1925 Act.  That was sent forward by the County Council, but the Board of Works, seemingly because it was not a new drainage district and the work was not intended to bring in any new land, decided that it could not be done under the 1925 Act, but could only be done under the 1924 Act.  That cut out the County Council absolutely as it had no jurisdiction good, bad or indifferent.  If those people have to pay 2/8 an acre for land which has not by any means benefited by the work, and if they were not informed prior to the work being started, I certainly think they are entitled to some relief.  I do not think it is fair for any Government Department to adopt this attitude, to carry out certain work and then to charge people they consider benefited with the cost, although the people themselves consider that they have not benefited.  It was stated that the charging order could not be altered.  If that is so and apparently <Col N="1777" /> it is, I wonder could anything be done even at this late stage towards increasing the grant.  As I pointed out only 25 per cent. of the cost was given in this case, whereas 30 per cent. and 33? per cent. was given in other cases.  I might also mention with regard to Elphin district that notification was served on the County Council when this work was being done that the period of repayment was ten years.  Later apparently the Board of Works came to the conclusion that additional money would have to be spent there, and the County Council was again notified that £2,000 extra would be spent and that the period for repayment would be extended from ten to fifteen years.  If the time could be extended in that case perhaps it could be extended in this case.  I do not know if the order was in force.  There is no doubt that what Deputy Boland stated was quite correct with regard to people who have not alone not received any benefit from the work but whose land has been drowned and who still have to pay.  People on the banks of the Shannon were originally included in the award.  They were paying the old drainage rate. The Board of Works certainly relieved a small percentage of the people and got away a great amount of water.  However, that affected the people further down the river and the position now is that people whose lands have benefited and others who have not benefited by the work have got to pay equally. I know that another grave hardship has been inflicted.  When the charging order came down, and when the County Council saw what was being done, a fuss was made and the Board of Works was asked to extend the period for repayment to 35 years. A considerable amount of correspondence passed between the County Council and the Board of Works. I am afraid I cannot pay a tribute to the Board of Works for the manner in which they reply to correspondence. The result has been that two years' arrears have accrued on the people, and at the moment they are being asked to pay, not a half <Col N="1778" /> year's drainage rate, but four half years' rate plus two maintenance rates.  Certain provision has been made by the County Council to try to lighten the burden in certain respects but, on the whole, the people have been badly hit and I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could suggest any means of remedying their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Deputies who have spoken seem to realise that it is impossible to do anything in this matter now as the charging order is already enrolled. With regard to Deputy Boland's point about an amending Act, I do not think that that would be a feasible course to adopt.  After all, there must be some finality in this matter.  This Act passed the Dáil and was, I think, very well received by all parties in the Dáil at the time, and very good work has been carried out under it.  The Act has practically served its purpose now, and nearly all those old drainage districts which had been allowed to get into a bad state have been restored, so that there would be no point in amending the Act at this stage.  In any case I do not see the necessity for it.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that in this case the original application to the Office of Public Works was for a drainage works under the Act of 1925, but this being purely a question of restoration it did not fit in with the 1925 Act, and we had to restore it under the Act of 1924.  There also seems to be some misunderstanding as to the basis on which grants are paid when this Act was put into operation.  It is not a question of a twenty-five per cent., a thirty-five per cent, or a fifty per cent. grant. The idea was to make those schemes economic, and if twenty-five per cent. would make a scheme economic we pay only twenty-five per cent.; if fifty per cent. is required to make it economic we are prepared to pay fifty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case twenty-five per cent. is sufficient, and that twenty-five per cent. amounted to fifty per cent. of an increase in value <Col N="1779" /> as a result of the original drainage scheme.  That is the idea that we aim at in all these restoration schemes.  The two Deputies who have spoken have commented very strongly on this matter, but it is a remarkable fact that we have had no complaints from the parties who are supposed to be benefited.  We had one complaint very early, while the work was being carried out, but we found on investigation that the charge that was made was unfounded, and, in fact, four of the people whose names had been signed to the complaint, when questioned about it, had no knowledge that their names had been signed to it at all.  If there is a grievance I am surprised that it was not brought to our notice before.  If a complaint can be made against any authority I should say that the County Council is the one to blame.  They had an opportunity of making a contribution, if they wished, but the only information we got from them was that they were not going to make a contribution.  They did not complain about the fact that the Act was being put into operation, but as soon as it was put into operation we heard complaints.  That happened in other cases, and we are not surprised at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the value of the land benefited by the scheme, is not that only an estimate?  Should it not be a rule that there should be some examination after a scheme had been in operation for a couple of years?  I submit that nobody would be able to estimate accurately at the time the amount of benefit that will be provided, and there should be some procedure by which the estimate of the valuer would be checked.  I submit that there is a case for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the question of valuation in these cases is always a difficult one.  All we can do is to get the most highly-skilled men we possibly can for this purpose. But you cannot carry out a <Col N="1780" /> drainage scheme without having a valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that what the probable increase in value is, is only an estimate.  Is it not proper to suggest that there should be some check on that afterwards to see if the estimate is justified? because, after all, if people are going to be charged on the basis of a fifty per cent. increase in value of their land there should be some approximation about that before that charge is made.  When the scheme had been in operation for a couple of years the original estimate should be checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how that could be done.  After all, the people who make these valuations know exactly what the effect of the work on the land drained is going to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not hold up the charge indefinitely for two or three years like that, and then put all the extra cost, which would have been piling up during these years, on the people whose lands are benefited. Unfortunately, that happened in this case, because of the fact that the County Council was not active at the time.  On the whole, I cannot see that any case has been made out for reconsidering this matter, and even if there was a case, there is no possibility of doing it.</P>

      <P>In view of what I have stated with regard to the date of the County Council meeting, how does the Parliamentary Secretary make out that the County Council, if anybody, is responsible for this condition of affairs?  In the first place, the County Council was not asked its opinion at all.  It was simply notified that the work was going to be undertaken by the Board of Works, and before the County Council meeting was held three-fourths of the work had been done.</P>

      <P>It was not very important from the County Council point of view.  There was the Elphin scheme, the Ballybay scheme, the Hind river and the Suck river, and in addition to them, there were applications for about forty-five new schemes.  If the County Council had agreed to make a contribution to any one of them, they would have had to make it to all of them, and they came to the very proper conclusion that they would not make a contribution to any of them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interfere in this matter because I want to give time to the Parliamentary Secretary to reply, but as it has been stated that the people did not want this drainage scheme, I would like to say that early in 1926, as soon as the Drainage Act had been passed, I was pressed by a number of people in that area to try to get this work done.  The fact that a petition was sent up shows that the people desired that the work should be done.  I also had correspondence with people in the area with regard to the matter, and I would like to quote one letter that was sent to me.  It is from a person who cannot have any idea of having political capital made out of it&mdash;the County Surveyor of Roscommon. In the course of his letter he says: &ldquo;I am quite convinced that this work is very urgently needed.  I know the damage that is done by the flooding, and for a comparatively small amount of money, by sinking portion of this river all the flooding could be obviated and work of a permanently useful nature would be done.  There are large numbers of men around Roscommon unemployed at the present time, as is shown by the numbers daily applying to me for work, and they could all be absorbed in doing this work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was pressure of that sort <Col N="1782" /> brought to bear on the Board of Works to endeavour to get this work done.  I do not think it is altogether fair to say that the County Council can be absolved if there was any objection to be made.  Notification was sent to the County Council in August, and no meeting was held until October.  It is well known that special meetings are held frequently, and a special meeting can easily be called on the signatures of the chairman and the secretary.  I do not think there is any great point in that. I do not believe that any change would have been made, because the County Council would not have given any assistance in the matter, but, at the same time, they would not have prevented the work from being carried out.  With regard to the benefit that has been done, there are altogether 297 people affected, and while a small number will be dissatisfied, undoubtedly the greater number have been benefited.  As a matter of fact, I saw a report in the local Press of a meeting that was held in connection with it, and they were all inclined to complain about it.  One man complained that so effectively was the drainage carried out that he had to carry water to his cattle for the greater part of the summer.  That shows that it was effective, and I do not believe that all that has been said about the matter is altogether true.  I believe that benefits have accrued to the area from the drainage.</P>
