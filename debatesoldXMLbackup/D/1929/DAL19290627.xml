      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Revenue authorities refused to grant exemption from entertainment tax to a committee of local residents at Aghada, Co. Cork, for a concert, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to a fund for rendering the place attractive for visitors, a purpose purely philanthroplc, and whether he will see that the tax paid will be refunded to the Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that exemption from payment of entertainments duty was refused in respect of a concert held in aid of the Aghada Improvement Fund.</P>
      <P>In his application for the grant of exemption the honorary secretary of the Aghada Improvement Committee stated that the objects of the Committee, which is composed of a group of local residents, were &ldquo;to render the surroundings more attractive by the provision of seats for visitors and a general cleaning up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If an entertainment is to be entitled to relief on philanthropic or charitable grounds, the following conditions must be fulfilled:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The proceeds must be devoted to purposes which are unmistakably philanthropic or charitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The promoters of the entertainment must be disinterested&mdash; that is, they must not be in a position <Col N="1850" /> to benefit directly or indirectly from the expenditure of the proceeds of the entertainment.</P>
    <P>The Collector of Customs and Excise at Cork, whose duty it was to deal with this application, was not satisfied, after inquiry into the circumstances, that the conditions for exemption were fulfilled, and the application was refused by him accordingly.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am unable to authorise refund of the duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state which of these conditions was infringed?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Both, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the committee consisted of the parish priest, the curate and five local residents who had nothing whatsoever to gain financially by any development which would be done in Aghada district and that it was done purely to render the place somewhat attractive to tourists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how a thing like that could be regarded as philanthropic or charitable.  Even supposing for the moment that nobody could indirectly benefit and that no shopkeepers or anyone who would benefit by the attraction of tourists was on the committee, it is a definite business proposition for the district and it is not philanthropic or charitable work.  I do not think that the encouragement of tourists could be put upon that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know that these visitors do not remain for any extended period and that there is no financial benefit arising out of their visits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of argument I shall admit that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to do so at short notice, but I do not think that we can regard work of tourist development as work that is either philanthropy or charity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the honorary secretary, Aghada Development Committee, purchased from the Collector of Customs and Excise, Cork, stamped tickets, the total tax on which amounted to £5 16s. 8d.; that he returned to the collector unsold tickets, the tax on which amounted to £2 9s. 7d.; that instead of receiving same he got a cheque for £1 14s. 8d.; whether he will state why the deduction of 14s. 11d. was made, and will he instruct the collector to refund this amount to the honorary secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the particulars stated in the question. Under Section 12 of the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891 (which by Section 2 (3) of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, is made applicable to the stamps used for denoting entertainments duty), the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, make an allowance in certain circumstances for unused stamps.</P>
      <P>The deduction of 14/11 referred to by the Deputy was made in respect of a broken series of entertainments duty tickets which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, were not eligible for allowance.</P>
      <P>I am unable to authorise a refund of the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the usual regulations governing these matters provide that the tickets must be torn in halves? These tickets were handed up without being torn and they were clearly unused tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a regulation or practice in the administration of this particular duty to safeguard that, and as a rule allowance is only made where the tickets have been taken off a pad in serial order and where stamps presented for allowance afterwards are in serial order and represent the remains of a pad. Where not in serial order the general view is that there is doubt as to whether they were used or not and the practice is not to allow for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners are using their powers in this matter is certainly nothing short of a scandal.  I beg to give notice that I shall raise this question on the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will state what steps, if any, have been taken for the care and upkeep of the graves of I.R.A. men executed during the Anglo-Irish War and buried in Cork Male Prison; whether he will state if steps will be taken for their removal to consecrated ground, or will the remains be handed over to the relatives of those men.</P>

      <P>The graves of 13 men who were executed in Cork and buried in the grounds of Cork Prison in the year 1921 are kept in good order.</P>
      <P>The question of the exhumation of the bodies and their transfer to relatives for re-interment was the subject of careful consideration by the Executive Council some years ago, when the conclusion was reluctantly reached that, having regard to the time that had elapsed and the circumstances attending the burials, exhumation was quite impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has seen these graves recently.  I know I made two attempts to see them, and on each occasion was prevented; but I have certain knowledge that the graves are absolutely uncared.  I have very definite knowledge of that fact; and I also wish to complain of the manner in which the relatives of the deceased are treated.  Last week&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is prepared to examine the possibility of establishing (1) a potato chip factory; and (2) a glucose factory in Cooley district, Co. Louth; further, to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to establish in the coming autumn an experimental farm in the same district for the purpose of carrying out experiments in the growing of peas, beans, strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, currants, apples, and other fruits and vegetables, also in all-year-round dairy farming; and further, whether, in view of the special circumstances obtaining in the district, he is prepared to make arrangements for the advancement of loans, to be repaid in instalments after two years, to farmers who will plant one-quarter acre and upwards of these crops in their own farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in yesterday's discussion on the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, the Department have not overlooked the fact that farmers in the Cooley district are at present largely dependent upon one crop&mdash;i.e., potatoes. The Department have, therefore, on several occasions investigated the possibility of the utilisation of potatoes for industrial purposes; of the growing of alternative crops, and also the development of some branch of stock-farming in that district. The matters referred to in the Deputy's question will be further considered in the light of such additional information as can be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>When may we expect a scheme from the Minister in connection with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not promised a scheme.  A scheme in regard to what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme regarding the establishment of a potato chip <Col N="1855" /> factory, a glucose factory, or an experimental farm, or the giving of loans to farmers to grow the crops indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me or the Department of Agriculture to establish a factory.  We can assist in costings and so on, but it is for the private capital of the citizens of the country or someone else to start a factory.  There was some talk of starting a glucose factory, and the pioneers were sent to the Cooley district, but they chose another place instead.  The Department of Agriculture cannot establish a factory in Cooley and carry it on in a commercial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not indicated that I intended it to be carried on by the Department of Agriculture. Does not the Minister think that in that district he might do something for their main crop, just as he is doing for dairy farming in Limerick and places like that?  Could not the Minister find out through his staff what is the best to be done, and then put up a scheme for the co-operative development of that in the district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible to discuss this matter by way of question and answer.  We discussed it at some length yesterday, and I indicated what we could do.  So far as establishing a factory for the utilisation of potatoes not sold in the English market is concerned, we have done all that we can do in drawing the attention of people intending to go in for establishing some sort of factory to deal with potatoes in any way, that Cooley is the best district in Ireland for it. They have investigated that, and yet they propose to establish a factory elsewhere.  We also propose to keep in touch with the results obtained by commercial concerns in utilising potatoes for purposes of potato flour or glucose, and if we see that there are any results that would warrant the establishment of a factory in Cooley, and that we can encourage that, we are ready to do <Col N="1856" /> it, but we cannot go in directly and build a factory, put up capital and run the factory afterwards.  With regard to alternative crops, we have two or three instructors there who have gone to some trouble to get farmers in that district to change their method of farming from the state of affairs which they are in at present, where they are dependent on one crop, and we will continue that, but we cannot do any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that something more is required than an itinerant instructor going around, as in the present year alone there are £12,000 in rates outstanding in that district?  Does he not think that an experimental farm would meet the necessity much better than an itinerant instructor going around?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe an experimental farm would take the matter one step further.  We have five or six such farms, where we are experimenting in the various problems mentioned by the Deputy in the question.  It does not matter whether such a farm is in Clonakilty or North Louth, the results can go all over the country.  I do not see that an experimental farm in Louth growing raspberries and strawberries can carry the matter any further. The costings in regard to the growing of raspberries and strawberries, and other crops which the Deputy mentioned, are well known, and they are at the disposal of the farmers, and what advantage another experimental farm would be I fail to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think, as almost 90 per cent. of the district is tilled, it is particularly suitable for an experimental farm, especially for crops that require a great amount of labour in their culture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as I have pointed out, four or five such farms, where we are doing all the experiments necessary in tillage crops, and the results obtained can go to Louth, even though the experimental farms are not in Louth.  I do not see the <Col N="1857" /> necessity for any such farm in County Louth&mdash;in fact I think we have too many such farms.</P>

Twenty-three and a half acres were sold in lots to large farmers and business men in the Six Counties.  I can give the names of these persons. They were: Weir and Co., auctioneer and large farmers, Strabane (3 acres); R. J. Smith, shopkeeper and large farmer, Strabane (10 acres); J.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>This farm is subject to a Land Commission annuity, and if we took it over we would have to offer an alternative farm somewhere else.  I realise that the farm is situated in a good farming and tillage district, but there is really no congestion in the area except in the <Col N="1858" /> sense that it is in one of the congested counties.  It is accommodation land and has been used for many years by residents in the towns of Lifford and Strabane.  It is let to a number of people at very high prices, and if we acquire the land it would not, in my opinion, be of benefit to people who would use it or to small holders in the area.</P>

      <P>May I intervene just to say that the Deputy is going to raise a matter about which he knows very little?  I suggest that in a matter of this kind he ought at least see the Minister privately before he raises the question.

It was a question of the dependents of some of those men who are now buried there, the parents of whom are drawing home assistance from the South Cork Board.  I was told to go and see the Minister.  I went to the Department, but got no satisfaction.  This is a handy way of evading the issue.</P>

This is a matter in which a number of people, relatives of these executed men, are concerned.  The only interest which I have in the matter is that it is a difficult one to discuss in the Dáil.  Its discussion in the Dáil might possibly hurt some people's feelings, and no one here desires to do that.  I suggest to the Deputy that if he is anxious to raise the matter this evening he should see the Minister in the interval, or he should adopt Deputy Davin's suggestion, visit the prison, and then take whatever steps he may think necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite satisfied to allow the matter stand over, but for the fact that last week an old man of eighty-three years, the aged father of one of these men, went to the gate of the jail to see where his son was buried, but he was refused admission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be rather a delicate matter to discuss the removal of the remains.  If we did so it might hurt the feelings of some Deputies here.  I think that Deputy Corry should consult the Executive Council about this matter. as I fully realise the difficulties concerning the remains of men interred for a considerable time in Cork County Prison.  I also wish to refer to the question of remains in Cork Military Prison.  While I wish that <Col N="1861" /> those remains could, if at all possible, be removed, I realise the difficulty of doing so at present.  With all due credit to the Colonel of the Military Barracks in Cork I must say that he took particularly good care in seeing after the grave of my brother and in also erecting a headstone there.  I do not think that it would be advisable to discuss such matters in the House, and I would suggest that the best way out of it would be to have a consultation with the Executive Council so that some means might be devised of having the remains removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Corry is raising this question simply to air himself or with a view to making charges.  I think that his desire is to have these graves properly kept.  If that be the idea, surely the better method of approach would be to see the Minister.  If he is dissatisfied after seeing the Minister, then obviously it is a matter to be raised here.  The other two matters which are raised in the single question are very important, and they should not be the subject of discussion in this House.  They do not lend themselves to discussion here, and I think it would be very painful to relatives and friends of the deceased men if they were made the subject of discussion here.</P>

Although that is the case, it has been generally possible to find a method of settling the matter between Deputies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> Question No. 1 in the name of Deputy Corry was on the Order Paper some time ago and the question of how it should be raised arose. Deputy Corry at that time also expressed a desire to raise the matter on the adjournment.  Therefore, since this question has been raised previously and not regarding it as an unsuitable subject to be raised on the adjournment, I am prepared to give Deputy Corry an opportunity of raising it to-night.  There are two other questions-that to be raised by Deputy Aiken with regard to the subject matter of question No. 5, and the question which Deputy White wishes to raise.  There has already been some discussion in regard to the subject matter of question No. 5.  I would therefore take Deputy White's question on the adjournment to-morrow, if he is satisfied, or on next Wednesday, if he prefers it to to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first two amendments on the Paper in the name of Deputy MacEntee, each of them raises an important question, and concerns matters which, it seems to me, should have arisen on the Committee Stage. As a general rule, the Chair is adverse to the idea of raising an important new matter on the Report Stage.  That is particularly the case in regard to Finance Bills.  I am not prepared to accept amendments such as these two amendments, which raise completely new and important matters, at this particular stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that these amendments should have been brought in on the Committee Stage of the Bill, but I would like to point out to you, A Chinn Comhairle, that I did raise the matter on either Financial Resolution No. 1 or No. 2, on <Col N="1863" /> which the Bill is based.  In view of that I would suggest that possibly I might be allowed to speak to the amendments even if they are not put from the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point, as I understand it, is that he referred to these matters in debate.  Of course the Chair could not accept notice such as that, and can only take cognisance of amendments tabled in the usual way.  The view, as I have already explained, is that an amendment should not be offered on the Report Stage which raises an important new matter. Such amendments should be offered in Committee.  If these amendments arose out of other amendments proposed in Committee, or out of matters consequential on proceedings in Committee, they would be on a different footing.  I am afraid it is impossible to allow the Deputy to discuss an amendment if the amendment is out of order, and if no question can be put upon it.  It is a fundamental rule that there must be something before the House, or a Committee of the whole House, before debate can arise.  Therefore I am sorry that I cannot allow the Deputy to discuss the matter now if it would not be, in fact, in order to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment follows certain remarks of Deputy Good.  It provides that the officer of Customs and Excise shall remove these documents only if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting fraud.  I think this goes as far to meet Deputy Good's point as it is reasonably possible to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1864" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this amendment does meet the objection which we raised to the removal of documents, we are glad to see that the Minister for Finance has introduced an amendment more or less to limit the powers of the officer in regard to their removal.  I think there was another important matter which we raised upon the Committee Stage of the Bill.  That was as to who was to have the right of option to make a copy or to have the original document.  In sub-section (2) of Section 31 we have the following statement:</P>
      <P>Whenever an officer of Customs and Excise removes a document under this section he shall on demand made by the person from whom he obtains such document at any time when such document is detained under this section either (at the election of such officer) furnish to such person a copy of such document or allow such person to inspect and take a copy of such document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that as the original document in this matter belongs to the person inconvenienced, if not aggrieved, by its removal he should have the right of election, that it should rest with him to say as to whether the officer shall furnish a copy or whether he himself shall inspect the document and take a copy.  There is quite a possibility that there may be cases where he should prefer that rather than another person inside the Department of Finance having access to the document, he himself might make a copy.  On the other hand, it might be very inconvenient for him to make a copy, and in that case he might be quite content to ask the Revenue Commissioners to make a copy for him and supply it to him. I submit, on the ground of fundamental equity, since the document in effect belongs to the person from whose office it was taken and is not the property of the Revenue Commissioners, that the person who owns the document is the person who should be least inconvenienced and that, therefore, he should have, <Col N="1865" /> as I have suggested, the right of option in the matter, and not the officer of revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in this case ordinarily no difficulty would arise.  The person would be allowed to get the copy or to take it.  These documents are seized where, as we have put in the section and as it was before, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting fraud.  As a matter of fact, it may be taken that the position is even stronger.  It is because not only are there reasonable grounds for suspecting, but the officer has substantial evidence.  While we do not want to inconvenience the person to whom the documents belong any more than is necessary, although he is going to be prosecuted, still it is not desirable to put him in the position where he might hinder the investigation of the documents or might deliberately delay the investigation of the documents. For instance, a man might demand a document, take a copy of it, and take a considerable time in copying it.  He might take one document after another.  He might delay unduly. As I said the other day, time is an element in all those prosecutions. As a rule, there is a six-months' limit.  I have known cases where very special steps had to be taken to rush out summonses.  I know of a recent case where extreme steps had to be taken&mdash;there was only a day left&mdash;to get the summonses out in time.  I think that in 99 per cent. of the cases no question would arise.  I would be afraid if an election were given to the person rather than to the officer occasionally you would have people who would avail of it really to prevent a prosecution taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words before the Bill passes through its final stage with particular reference to the tariff on woollens.  I want to suggest that some of the woollen manufacturers in this country are not fulfilling the obligations which were implied, when many of us in this House supported a tariff on woollens.  Personally I never contemplated, in supporting a tariff on woollens in or outside this House, that some at least of these millers would have gone behind the obligations which are implied in their evidence before the Commission.  In paragraph 107, which relates to the possible effects of a tariff on the manufacture of yarn, we find what is perhaps more than a suggestion.  It is stated that the Commissioners felt that their report would be incomplete if it did not contain a reference to the question of imported &ldquo;tops&rdquo; and yarns.  It goes on to say that the millers, in their evidence, indicated that they were then manufacturing 85 per cent. of the yarns used in the finished product, but we find since the tariff was imposed that many of those millers are importing their yarn from France, Belgium and England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is a very appropriate addendum to the report by no less a person than Professor Whelehan.  I think we are all agreed that he is a very able economist, and has been very useful, if perhaps at times academic. At the same time he is a recognised authority on matters of this kind.  He adds in his report&mdash;I am not going to use his own words&mdash;that it is of the first importance that the production of yarn should be stimulated and recognised.  What I want <Col N="1867" /> to point out is that it was also stressed in the report of the Commission that, though the production of woollens was very largely increased, the yarn industry in itself would give even more employment than the manufacture of the finished product.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that many of the millers who have been protected are importing their yarn from France, Belgium and England.  It will considerably alter my relation to the whole question of tariffs if the Executive Council do not take this matter up with the woollen manufacturers in this country.  We had, within recent weeks, evidence of certain reactions after the passing of this tariff on woollens.  We have the question of the ready-made industry adversely affected by certain changes in our fiscal policy, and I am going to ask the House to be very slow in future&mdash;I am speaking as one who has taken some little interest in the whole question of tariffs&mdash;in putting on any tariff without having fully considered it in all its implications and ramifications.  The effect of the woollen tariff which I supported has been, up to the present at any rate, rather disappointing.  We have a large number of people who were engaged in the spinning industry put out of employment who I, at least, thought would have been fully employed when I supported the tariff.  For that reason I am going to be very slow in future in supporting any tariff, however attractive it may appear, if it is going to have the result that this tariff has had.  The moment the tariff was imposed on woollens, which I supported, the reactions were felt in the ready-made business, but a reaction which I consider far more serious is the reaction it had on the spinners engaged in those mills.  We had a declaration from the persons who sought the tariff, and succeeded in getting it, that they were able to spin 85 per cent. of the yarn used in connection with the industry, but we find to-day that many of those persons who were engaged in the <Col N="1868" /> spinning industry are now unemployed.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House&mdash;I am speaking now in my personal character and not on behalf of my Party&mdash;that we will have to subject every other application of this kind, whether recommended by the Tariff Commission or not, to a very careful analysis before we will commit ourselves to any further tariff, because I find, in the operation of this tariff, it may have meant for a few individuals much overtime and employment, but for many others it meant unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I always prefer to stick close to facts.  I could give a rough estimate, but I prefer not to I will give the correct figures to the Deputy when he requires them.  I do not make wild statements.  I am always very accurate in any statements I make, particularly when I am concerned with an industry of this kind.  If it is necessary and <Col N="1869" /> convenient for the House I will quote from the message I got from my own district without mentioning any particular mill.  The letter states: &ldquo;As you are aware, the industry has been protected, the workers have advocated tariffs in the hope that they would be provided with a means of livelihood and decent conditions of labour.&rdquo;  I am not giving it exactly word for word. I will hand this letter to Deputy Flinn if he requires it. &ldquo;We find instead of being an advantage to those who give their services it has been the direct opposite.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to remark that this is a man who has not got an Oxford education and his diction is not very perfect.  You cannot blame me.  He states: &ldquo;I will give you a few concrete cases.&rdquo;  He mentions a certain mill equipped with the most up-to-date carding and spinning machinery capable of preparing the major portion of the yarn utilised in the manufacture of their cloths.  But the millers are importing the bulk of the yarn from Belgium, France and England, whilst our local workers are unemployed and thrown on the unemployment list.  He goes on to speak about Church holidays and things of that kind, with which I do not concern myself very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; at all about it.  I am only concerned with the position of the operatives, materially if you like.  I am not quite so concerned with their spiritual interests.  I rely mainly on the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, particularly paragraphs 108 and 109.  Paragraph 108 states: &ldquo;The combing of wool (i.e., the making of &lsquo;tops&rsquo;), the preparation of wool for carding, its carding and the spinning of yarns from &lsquo;tops,&rsquo; or carded wool, give considerable employment.  It has, indeed, been estimated that in some cases the manufacture of a certain quantity of raw wool into yarn affords as much employment as do the processes which the resultant yarn subsequently <Col N="1870" /> undergoes in its manufacture into the finished tissue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Report goes on to say, in paragraph 109: &ldquo;Since one of the chief objects of the protection of an industry is to afford employment, we consider that, prima facie, it would only be equitable to afford a greater measure of protection to those manufacturers who perform all processes, from the raw wool to the finished cloth, and who thus give the greatest amount of employment, than to those who do no sorting, scouring, combing, or carding and spinning, or who do not sort, scour, comb or card and spin all the wool they require for weaving, and who therefore, relative to their output of finished fabrics, employ much fewer workers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another sentence taken out of paragraph 110 would be most appropriate as emphasising one of the points already made.  &ldquo;Though it will not be an easy matter for our home manufacturers to compete with the Yorkshire wool-combers and spinners, it may be advisable in the general interests for them to endeavour to secure, in the near future, the establishment in this country of combing and spinning plants of a capacity to supply the normal home demand for worsted yarns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I consider the most valuable contribution to this report on the application for a tariff on worsteds and woollens is made by Professor Whelehan. &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of the first importance that the production of the yarns at home should be stimulated and recognised. If the matter is left in its present inconclusive state there is nothing to prevent the industry from relying more and more on imported yarns, and developing the industrial weaving to the greater detriment of yarn spinning.&rdquo;  His final sentence is: &ldquo;This investigation should be undertaken immediately, so that the Tariff Commission may have the benefit of its result should the review of the question which this addendum would contemplate be made effective.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress the last few words in Professor Whelehan's addendum: <Col N="1871" />&ldquo;This investigation should be undertaken immediately so that the Tariff Commission may have the benefit of its results should the review of the question which this addendum contemplates be made effective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He, therefore, indicates that it is essential, in his view, at any rate, that a review of the question should be immediately undertaken in order to have this tariff have the effect which was contemplated, not alone by some of those engaged in the industry, but by me and many others who voted for the tariff.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the position as it appears to me, and as it appears to many others who have given any thought whatsoever to the question of tariffs, under Section 23 of this Bill, I felt I was in order&mdash;I do not believe the Ceann Comhairle would have allowed me to proceed unless I was&mdash;in drawing attention to this matter in the hope that the Irish millers who at present are able to manufacture their own yarns, but who do not, will do so.  They are doing so.  Possibly they are aiming at greater profits and at making themselves richer and their customers somewhat poorer.  Because of that fact I suggest that a review of the whole position should be undertaken at an early date to see how far this has brought about the position contemplated in the report&mdash; namely, larger numbers of people employed in the industry, and also to see how far they have gone in the direction which they themselves suggested they were able to undertake&mdash; namely, that they could manufacture 85 per cent. of the yarn used in the worsteds and woollens made at home, That is my only contribution to this discussion.  I do hope that the Minister will take serious notice of what I have said on account of the unemployment created under this tariff.</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister for Finance would, for the purpose of this debate, ascertain whether there is any evidence in the possession of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there has <Col N="1872" /> been a reduction or an increase in the number of people engaged in spinning and carding.  If he could get that information it would help us.</P>

      <P>It is not my purpose to intervene in this debate except to draw attention to a statement which was made during the discussion upon the Committee Stage by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with reference to a certain member of the Seanad.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce attributed a statement to that member of the Seanad which was to the effect that when the firm of which he is a member associated itself with an application for a particular tariff this particular member of the Seanad stated that he did so although he was a life-long free trader and believed that the effect of the protection would inevitably be to raise the price of the protected article to the full limit of the protection given.</P>
      <P>That statement was a particularly serious one for the member of the Seanad in question, in the first place because he has been associated with the Fianna Fáil Party and has declared himself a supporter of the Fianna Fáil policy of protection, and in the second place because it might be believed that the firm of which he was a member might be endeavouring to give practical effect to the prophecy which he is alleged to have made.  I asked the member of the Seanad concerned whether he made that statement, and he informed me that he did not and that the Minister was drawing on his imagination when he stated that he did.  I think it is only fair that that statement should be made by me now.  I am making it with his authority and at his request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the gentleman is in public life and is associated with the Fianna Fáil Party is where the importance of the statement comes in.  With regard to the statement made by Deputy Anthony, I do not feel that I could take the information given to him by his informant in this matter as necessarily accurate, nor do I think that he should rush in here to condemn the Irish woollen millers as a body because of circumstances which are alleged to have arisen in one particular mill.  It is of the first importance that the production of yarns at home should be stimulated.  If the Irish woollen millers are acting in the manner which Deputy Anthony speaks of, that is, if they are dismissing the yarn-spinners in their employment for the purpose of enabling them to import foreign yarn, then a situation will have arisen which will necessitate action to be taken.  But I am not prepared to agree that that statement represents the real facts in the case.  Nor do I think that it should be assumed to be the case even if such a set of circumstances has arisen in one particular mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Deputy Anthony warns us, of course, that he would be very slow before he supports any other application of a tariff is a matter of minor importance.  There has been no general rush in the matter of tariffs and, particularly, no rush in this matter of woollen tariffs. This tariff was under consideration by the Tariff Commission for two and a half years before the Report was submitted to this House.  Then, after the expiration of two and a half years, it was found that they were unable to produce a Report which they could stand over when the matter was referred back to them for further particulars.  If there had been less delay and less hesitancy about applying a tariff to Irish industries there would be, I am certain, <Col N="1874" /> a very different situation facing us to that with which we are faced now. I hope that the Minister for Finance will secure from the Minister for Industry and Commerce the information which Deputy Flinn asked for, so that we will know whether there has been a diminution in the number of hands engaged in spinning in the Irish mills or that the quantity of the yarn imported has shown a very substantial increase since the tariff was imposed.  If the statements made by Deputy Anthony are not correct, it is desirable that they should be contradicted definitely and as soon as possible.  If the statements are correct, then there has arisen a situation with which the Tariff Commission and the Dáil should be asked to deal.</P>

      <P>With regard to the statement made by Deputy Anthony in connection with the spinning of yarn in Irish woollen mills, I am aware that he has a letter here from a certain gentleman in connection with one mill.  As for one very large mill with which I am well acquainted, that is, the Athlone Woollen Mill, I can tell the House that the wool brought to that mill is combed and spun into yarn in their own machines and by their own hands, so that the spinning department is working full time.  I would say that this particular mill almost makes 100 per cent. of the yarns it uses.  The statement made by Deputy Anthony does not therefore refer to the Athlone Woollen Mills, with which I am acquainted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all glad to learn that even if Deputy Anthony's statement were well-founded, it refers only to a particular and possibly an isolated case. Before we pass this Fourth Stage of the Finance Bill, I think it only right to direct the attention of the House to the fact that over twenty sections of the Bill concern themselves with income tax and with the various means under which it may be assessed and collected.  With regard to that, I think before the Bill goes through and becomes law we <Col N="1875" /> should have some assurance from the Minister for Finance that the method which has hitherto been adopted to collect what has been euphemistically called arrears of income-tax, will be mitigated somewhat. I do not want to be taken as saying that I should wipe out all the arrears; but I do feel that there were certain definite periods in this country during which income-tax was withheld from the then authorities which should receive special consideration in the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that in 1919, in pursuance of the then de jure Government, and in pursuance of the policy which that Government had adopted either by overt act or by direct proclamation and publication, the impression was conveyed to the people of this country, who stood for the independence of this country, that it would be a patriotic act to withhold from the British Income-Tax Authorities any tax which they up to that time had been collecting. Arising out of that, a considerable number of people did withhold income-tax. I am not going to argue that everyone who withheld income-tax was actuated by motives of the purest patriotism.  Possibly in many of the cases some selfish element was behind the idea; but others did it through patriotic duty.  It was a patriotic duty in the case of men particularly, who could be made amenable for the withholding of the income-tax; men upon whom penalties might easily be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, at this late stage it is not possible to segregate into one or other of the two categories the people who withheld income tax&mdash;to divide them between the sheep and the goats&mdash;the men who were pure patriots and the men who were purely selfish.  Arising out of that situation, when the change of régime took place in this country, the Income Tax Department carried on as a going concern, carried on as the successors of the British at Dublin Castle, and endeavoured to collect all the income tax in respect <Col N="1876" /> of which assessments had been made. That had been continuing for a number of years upon more or less normal lines.  I think, however, that the speech which the Minister for Finance made when introducing his Budget for the year 1928 seemed to foreshadow, and actually did foreshadow, a rather intensified campaign in this direction.  In the course of that speech he said:</P>
    <P>For this coming year we propose to get a substantial part of the extra income required by a resort to expedients which will give us revenue for one year only. We intend to speed up the collection of the abnormal arrears of income tax.</P>
    <P>The ordinary methods which before that had secured some sort of lip service were now thrown over and a new department in the office of the Revenue Commissioners seems to have been set up.  A form of criminal investigation was instituted &mdash;a form of income tax inquisition. I think&mdash;and&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Department was manned by three of the senior officials of the Revenue Commission, possibly assisted by some of the staff of the Minister's own Department.  These men proceeded in this way: they secured from the income tax offices all the available returns of taxpayers for several years, including all the British years.  Owing to the action taken by the Irish Republican Army in 1919 they were not able to get all the papers which would cover the whole of the preceding years.  They did get whatever papers they could, and whenever these papers seemed to indicate that a taxpayer had evaded payment of the tax to the British&mdash;I would like to emphasise that point&mdash;a letter was sent to that taxpayer which seems to have been more or less in set and formal terms. I will give a typical case.  A taxpayer made incorrect returns to the British, omitting all dividends and under-declaring the income of his business.  As from the inception of the Free State, this taxpayer returned all his British dividends, and <Col N="1877" /> as these showed a very substantial increase over the British returns in the hands of the special investigation department of the Revenue Commission, a letter was received by the taxpayer more or less in the following terms:</P>
    <P>A personal interview is necessary with you in connection with the incorrect returns of your income made by you for a number of years.  Unless you are prepared to facilitate us in securing correct details of your capital at 1st January, 1914, and all your profits for each year since, we shall have to institute penalty proceedings against you.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the point that this man admittedly withheld income tax from the British authorities, but he dealt honestly with the authorities of the Irish Free State.  His very honesty in this matter was the man's own undoing.  Because he did make the returns, admitting a larger income in the years subsequent to 1922, he received a letter in the terms which I have recited to you demanding that he should furnish correct details of his capital at 1st January, 1914, and all his profits for each subsequent year.  When as a result of that letter the taxpayer in question called upon the officer in Dublin Castle, he was informed that the investigation department required that a special investigation should be made into his affairs by a firm of auditors to be named by one of the three investigators, one of the three officers of the Revenue Commission.</P>
    <P>I think that was rather unfair.  I do not think it is right or equitable that in the case where the taxpayer stands on the one hand as against the tax-collecting authority on the other hand, the tax collector should have the right to appoint an investigator, because quite obviously the continuance of that investigator's appointment must depend upon the satisfaction which he gives to his master.  If there is to be an investigation of a taxpayer's books so as to establish justice as between him and the Revenue authorities, that investigation <Col N="1878" /> ought to be carried out by some independent person.  After the investigation had been made, what happens to the taxpayer?  He is required first of all to pay over to the Revenue all debts found not to have been paid to Great Britain, and then he is required to pay the interest on the debts as from the date when they first became due to the date upon which they were finally paid.  Over and above all that, he is required to pay a sum by way of mitigation of penalties for not having paid the British promptly.</P>
    <P>Various other expedients as well as this audited investigation have been adopted.  Certificates are demanded from taxpayers showing certified returns of bank accounts for all years from 1914 onwards.  Statements of capital before and after the war are asked for.  Threats are used setting out that if the taxpayer refuses to give the investigators whatever papers they want the whole matter will be referred to the solicitors' department to take whatever action may be advised.  Lastly, and I think most shameful of all, taxpayers have been caught in this way and asked to play the fox without the tail, to supply any information possible which will incriminate other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I would like again to point out that this violent inquisition is directed solely against those who did not or would not&mdash;I am not going to question their motives&mdash;supply England with full or any details.  At that period it was considered a cowardly thing and an unpatriotic and unjustifiable act for any citizen to facilitate the English authority in this country in any way.  These taxpayers withheld that information from the British.  I should like to say that they withheld it at their own peril and risk, and it is surely a poor return to make to them that, having carried out what were the direct instructions of the Dáil at that time and the direct policy of the Dáil at that time as exemplified by the general burnings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I say, the position now is that taxpayers are being asked to pay taxes which they did not pay to the British, to pay interest on the amount of such taxes from the date when they should have been paid to the British, and to pay penalties for not having made returns in proper time of their full incomes to the British.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the method of collecting arrears.  In connection with that, I would urge upon the Minister this point of view, that a considerable number of taxpayers at that time may have taken advantage of the situation which prevailed to withhold taxes, but circumstances have now changed very much. At that time we were going through a boom period.  Everything was inflated; money was plentiful, and people spent money easily.  Possibly a large number of people spent money which should have gone to the Exchequer of the country if there had been any authority justly entitled to collect it.  Then suddenly a change came.  After the boom period there came a period of depression, and people who would have been quite well able to pay their income tax during the boom period but who, for one reason or another, either from motives of patriotism or from purely selfish motives, withheld the tax, were suddenly faced with a demand to pay it when their ability to pay it had become much less than it was before. Now, there is that special circumstance. That special circumstance would not have arisen if it had not been for the feeling which prevailed in 1919 and in the subsequent years that the money should not be paid to the British if one could possibly avoid paying it.  If it had not been for that, people who owed income tax would have paid during the boom period rather than run the risk of incurring penalties.  When the boom period passed, they were no longer in a position to pay the large amounts which were demanded from them in respect of the boom period, and they continued to evade payment.  Possibly the position might be represented in this way, that people who could quite easily have met their obligations prior to 1922 were faced with bankruptcy if they were to fulfil these obligations in 1923, and in view of that I think that the Minister would be, on grounds of public policy, well advised to say: &ldquo;We will cut our losses&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know whether he is entitled strictly to call them his losses in respect of the years preceding 1922&mdash;&ldquo;we will <Col N="1883" /> not try to collect this money, because we do think it would create general disorganisation in the business of a number of people, and we will be quite satisfied if these people will come forward now and make a full and frank disclosure of their incomes for the present year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that it will be argued that some men have been detected in making these false returns and that some men have been compelled to pay up.  Very well.  I suppose that is their misfortune.  But I think we ought to face the position now.  There has been an amnesty for acts of physical sabotage and violence which were carried out prior to 1922.  This also might have been held, and has been justified by some, to be an act against the British. I am not arguing on that ground; I am arguing, simply on the ground of public expediency, that it would be advisable to call off the dogs, stop the inquisition and give the harassed taxpayer some little ease.  He does not get very much from the Minister for Finance, and he might get this little concession. I believe that public opinion on the matter is such that some time or other we will be compelled, to do this thing.  Possibly the next Government will be compelled to do it, but I would prefer to have it done by the present Government.  I think it would be rather regrettable if it were left for somebody else to do, because it might establish a wrong precedent, a precedent which I would be sorry to see set up.  The person who can do all this and the person who is best entitled to do it, because he has had the fullest benefit from the course which was pursued, is the present Minister for Finance.  Arising out of that, there is the other question of investments abroad.  I think the Minister should consider that position very carefully.  A number of people who withheld these moneys from the British have been very astute; they have been able to place them abroad in investments which have been more or less remunerative. They have had the best and most expert advice which they <Col N="1884" /> possibly could get to enable them to conceal these investments.</P>
    <P>At the same time I do not think they are quite happy in the situation, but they are intimidated against disclosing because of the fact that penalties will be imposed on them, even in respect of the returns they have made for the years 1923 and 1924. They have seen how those who made candid returns in 1923 were treated and the very fact that those who made returns were severely treated has intimidated the people who did not do so, and has confirmed them in the course of concealment upon which they embarked.</P>
    <P>I think it is of the utmost importance that the Minister for Finance, as a tax collector, should have the fullest possible information at his disposal as to the capital and income of particular citizens.  On the mere ground of expediency it would be wise to take a step which would secure that full disclosure.  In view of that, and in view of the fact that he is this year, or in the near future, going to float another loan, I think it would be a good opportunity to give those who have concealed their capital abroad an opportunity, first of all, of investing it without fear of the consequences in the new issue which he is about to make, and, secondly, to make a full disclosure and to start with a clean slate.</P>

      <P>I think it is advisable. I think possibly it would be hard to justify in the face of the treatment which the Government have meted out to those who have been discovered.  But the point is that the time has come when we have got to have an amnesty in this as in other matters.  There were many things done on both sides during the British struggle and during our own struggle which people might find it hard to stand over and justify.  We have wiped these out without punishment; we have granted an amnesty; and I think the Minister for Finance ought, in the present year of grace, grant an amnesty to the taxpayers.  That is <Col N="1885" /> what I am pleading for; and I think that should commend itself to the wisdom of the Dáil.  I am sure that the practical results would justify the Minister if he saw his way to take such a step.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to intervene in this internecine discussion regarding the events of 1919. What I want to ask the Minister is this: As Deputy MacEntee has said, there is a very considerable part of this Bill dealing with income tax which was not discussed at all, either on the Committee Stage or on this stage.  A great number of clauses were not discussed at all, and no explanation was given as to the meaning of the majority of them. Obviously the time is past when we should go back into many matters of detail, but I want to ask the Minister one question that is of some importance. It would seem to arise out of Section 10.  It is one of the sections which the Minister did explain, but only very cursorily.  He said: &ldquo;Section 10 is consequential.  It will avoid certain difficulties in connection with assessments where investments are changed.  All invested income will be regarded as issuing from a single source, and assessments will be made on the basis of the income of the preceding year.&rdquo;  Is that really the whole effect of that section, taken in connection with Section 11, which I think the Minister did not explain at all?  I wish the Minister would explain the effect of the words &ldquo;be deemed to issue from a single source.&rdquo;  Supposing this happens, and it is a fairly common case, that a man's total income is £800 yearly, of which £200 is drawn from investments which would be chargeable under case 3 of Schedule D. Suppose that, being obliged to pay off a bank overdraft or to make provision for some other debts, he has to sell out portion of his capital, and is not able to re-invest it.  That particular source of income has in fact disappeared.  For the sake of argument let us say that his income the following year is not £800, but £600.  I would like to know from the Minister the effect of the words &ldquo;be <Col N="1886" /> deemed to issue from a single source.&rdquo;  Is the effect of those words to make the income in the year when he is getting only £600 chargeable upon £800?  Offhand I think it is, but I would like to have an explanation from the Minister on that point.</P>

      <P>There is a small matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister. In the ordinary course of collecting income tax, the correspondence between the tax collectors and the taxpayers is conducted in private. At least all the envelopes are marked &ldquo;Private,&rdquo; and there is supposed to be no disclosure of a man's business.  But when there are disputes which eventually end in cases being taken by one party or the other to the High Court, privacy ceases, because the courts are open to the public and to reporters.  What I want to suggest to the Minister is that perhaps he will consider an amendment, or even a new clause being introduced, following clause 5 of sub-section (4) giving the right to the individual to demand that such a case when it comes before the High Court should be heard in camera rather than to have his affairs made public property.  I think that I am right in saying that in cases before the Circuit Court Judge the proceedings are heard in camera. I do not see why the Minister, after consideration, should object to having the same procedure applied to the High Court.</P>

      <P>My reason for objecting to the passing of this Bill is because it is dishonest finance.  It is because it contains incidents which are part of the logical and continuing sequence of dishonest finance. Whatever other virtue it may possess&mdash;and, frankly, I have gone through it with a microscope without finding very many evidences of virtue&mdash;it is blasted from beginning to end by the fact that it represents dishonest finance.  This Finance Bill is supposed to provide the finances towards balancing the income and the expenditure of this country for the last year.  In the ordinary way, and amongst ordinary people, <Col N="1887" /> income and expenditure have a definite and quite an ordinary meaning. For the purpose of enabling the Minister for Finance in the past to persuade himself to persuade his colleagues to deceive the people into the idea that he was balancing his Budget he has invented all sorts of new methods of defining income and expenditure.</P>
      <P>He has income which is normal and income which is abnormal; he has expenditure which is normal and expenditure which is abnormal.  I have never agreed with any one of the definitions which the Minister has taken either of normal or abnormal income or expenditure.  But we have not to stand over the difficulty at the moment of difference of definitions.  The Minister has himself never agreed one year after the other with his previous definition of what he calls normal and abnormal expenditure.  For instance, in this particular year he sold £3,000 worth of scrap from Haulbowline&mdash;£3,000 of an existing asset.  It immediately became income.  On exactly the same basis he could sell the whole of Haulbowline and regard it as income; he could sell any other property or investment which the State possesses and treat it in exactly the same way.  I find in the estimates I have here in relation to education, that no less than £247,000 in one particular year of existing securities, of existing capital assets, has been realised and treated as income. And that is only part of a continuous series of malversation and defalcation of public funds by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>We have here a case of £247,000 which was an investment in a security.  I want to make that very clear.  It was an investment in land stock.  That £247,000 of stock was sold and it was brought into income, and that £247,000 was only the end of one particular story, in which, over the period of his occupancy of the position of Minister for Finance, under that particular head alone, he has converted one and a quarter million pounds of securities into income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill provides himself with the means of dealing with Savings Certificates.  He has been gathering in millions of pounds in Savings Certificates.  He has borrowed the money; he has used it as income, and he has not made provision of any sort or kind up to the present to accumulate the interest or to have at the disposal of those whom it concerns the interest upon that money which, as Savings Certificates, he borrowed as capital and used as income. £400,000, according to his own estimate, he is in debt.  We asked him how much, and he said: &ldquo;I do not know; it would take an actuary to find out.&rdquo;  He can just make a guess at it.  If I owed him any money, my suggestion that an actuary might intervene would not, I think, be regarded as satisfactory.  I think the method of intervention would be the sheriff and a writ, and from my calculation of what the Minister for Finance does owe under the Savings Certificates, I am quite sure that if he offers £400,000 to satisfy that existing debt to those to whom it is owed, the answer will be a writ also, for even his estimation is not correct. We could pass these over if these were just casual sins imposed upon the Minister for Finance by the necessity of fooling the people this <Col N="1889" /> particular year in relation to the balancing of his Budget.  But, unfortunately, it has been part of a custom. Nearly £1,000,000 of C.D.B. money has gone the same way.  Money which was issued as capital to the Land Bank to the extent to which it was recovered&mdash;a couple of hundred thousand pounds&mdash;also became income. Imagine the financial rectitude, the standard of financial decency, which is represented by a Ministry of Finance that borrows money on Savings Certificates and does not make any attempt to provide for the interest&mdash;leaves that to its successor; that sells one and a quarter million pounds worth of stock belonging to its Educational Department, uses it as income, and leaves its successor to pay for it.  But he says: &ldquo;Under the administration of this Government that has always balanced its Budget, that has looked with infinite and fatherly care to the credit of this country, we are stable, we can borrow money.&rdquo;  He also said: &ldquo;We have an asset of £881,000 against the money we have borrowed on loan,&rdquo; and that £881,000 is, to his knowledge, a debt.  He puts down as part of the capacity of the State to borrow the fact that there is still to be put upon industry in this country, merely to make it fulfil its previous obligation, £881,000 of money, which it has not been able under his system of taxation, and under the cost of his Government, to pay and which it still has to pay into its insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Backwards and forwards, throughout the whole of this calculation, you have money which appears first as capital assets, and then appears in his returns as income.  There is another £200,000 here this year that he is getting back.  He already has told us in one part of his financial statement that it is there as capital value, and then, three or four pages further on, we find that it is included in income.  The dishonesty and the futility of this finance is what should condemn this Bill.  Take another case.  He has in his Bill this year the residuals of pre-Treaty income tax arrears.  If ever there was an asset which was non-recurrent, which ought to have been put against capital <Col N="1890" /> charges by anyone with any respect whatever for financial rectitude, it was the £5,000,000 of pre-Treaty income tax arrears which we have collected.  But no.  These non-recurrent assets were used unhesitatingly as income, and everything that he could possibly call non-recurrent expenditure is put upon capital charges, and then the capital assets which he has in his hands, whether C.D.B. money or educational money, or anything else that he can lay his hands upon, are sold year by year for the purpose of income.  That is how the Budget of the Free State up to the present has been balanced.  It is because that is the standard of financial rectitude for which the present Ministry of Finance stands, of which this present Bill is an example, and because this country cannot afford to finance itself on that despicable standard of financial rectitude, because it is good neither for reputation nor for credit, nor for income nor for commerce in this country&mdash;and because this Bill enshrines all these principles, and is a declaration to this House and the country that as long as the Minister is allowed to remain that custom and system and standard of rectitude in finance will be maintained, that I ask the House to reject this Bill.</P>

That was sent to me in 1925, with a statement signed by the three margarine manufacturers in the Free State at that time, of whom the firm of Messrs. Dowdall was one.  And the covering letter said that with this statement the writer was enclosing a copy of a letter written to Mr. Blythe, T.D., when Minister for Trade and Commerce, and some remarks followed.  That came into my Department in 1925 as part of the case to be made for a tariff on margarine, and eventually, when the question of the tariff on margarine was put before the Tariff Commission, one of the Dowdall brothers came to my Department to get a copy of the letter and sent it as part of the statement of the case to the Tariff Commission, and the other brother gave evidence on foot of that letter.

      <P>May I ask before the Minister concludes whether he has been able to obtain the information which we asked for arising out of the statement of Deputy Anthony, and showing that as a result of the woollen tariff there has been considerable disemployment of men in the spinning and carding industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Anthony's statement, I have no information as to whether there has been disemployment of the kind stated in the spinning industry in the preparation of yarn, but in any case I do not think that that can be attributed to the tariff.  I think the Deputy also should make up his mind that when a tariff is granted people who have got a tariff will, for the most part, buy in the cheapest market, irrespective of the fact that they themselves have a tariff.  Perhaps individuals amongst those who have received the advantage of a tariff may take special steps to get their requirements here, but the great majority of them will carry on as if they had no tariff at all.  I think it would be unwise for anybody to take any attitude in regard to tariffs based upon another point of view.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy MacEntee's argument on the point of arrears of income tax, I think the question of patriotism does not enter into it at all.  I am quite satisfied, and I was present at most of the Dáil Cabinet meetings, that no instructions went out from the Dáil Cabinet that people should make false returns, or even refuse to make returns, in relation to income tax.</P>

      <P>I think the thing never got to the point that Deputy de Valera suggests.  I have a recollection of certain conversations and discussions in which it was stated that people should not give the British authorities an opportunity of penalising them.  I remember it being stated that if people failed to send in returns estimated assessments would be made out against them far in excess of any sum that they would be entitled to pay.  I remember a discussion in the Cabinet where it was definitely stated people should make returns to prevent that happening. The view that was taken at that particular time was simply that people should go slowly, that they should withhold payment as long as possible, but that they should do it in such a way as not to give the authorities opportunities for penalising them.</P>

      <P>That has absolutely nothing to do with the point we are on.  There is no doubt that the policy was one of endeavouring to prevent the British getting money, but the individual had nothing in the nature of instructions, and, so far as I know, when advice was sought by an individual, the advice was that he was not to put himself in a position in which he would be penalised.  It was that he should pay at the last moment, even before the bailiffs came in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Within limits.  A number of people withheld payment, declined to make returns, or else made returns that were inaccurate, and in a great many of these cases there was a dual motive.  I have known cases where patriotic motives did not exist.  I have known cases in which people who claimed that they did not pay on the ground of patriotism, were at that time against the national movement.  In any case, when the Government of the Saorstát took over, the position was that income tax had to be collected, and there was considerable difficulty in collecting it and inducing people to make their payments. I do not think that the man who simply withheld his income tax previously for patriotic reasons had any ground for thinking that he should hold on to that for good.  The object was not that he might be enriched personally, that it was a patriotic business, but that the British Government might be deprived of the sinews of war.  When the change of Government came there was no reason why that person should regard himself as being entitled to hold on to that money which was legally payable as tax. Therefore the view that was taken was that collection should be made and the arrears brought into the Exchequer of the Saorstát.  I do not <Col N="1895" /> think that that was a hardship.  It would have been impossible to remit them.  There were large numbers of people who availed of the confusion caused by the burning of income tax offices, and who for other reasons withheld payment of the tax. It would have made future collection of taxes impossible if such taxes were not collected.  I think it must be admitted that a fairly large number of those who withheld payment or who made inaccurate returns were not actuated primarily by patriotic motives.  If there had been a remission of taxes by the Saorstát, the resistance which those people would have offered to any collection of income tax in the hope of some further remission would, I believe, have made the collection of taxes altogether impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already by way of interruption dealt with one point raised by Deputy MacEntee, that penalties were imposed because people evaded paying or made incorrect returns to the British.  My policy has been that that should not be done.  If that happened it was by way of accident or error.  The policy was entirely contrary to that, and unless the Deputy can bring me cases of that kind I must be satisfied that it was not done.  The Deputy cited an individual case, but it is hard to discuss a case when one has not heard the other side of it.  It is clear that the person to whom the Deputy referred had defrauded the Free State, as otherwise there could not have been a question of penalty.  That must have been a case in which there was a question of false returns, or something else, since the setting up of the Free State.  If such person paid his tax honestly since the Free State was set up, I do not think that there would be any means of proceeding against him.  What is commonly done is, that if a person was guilty of default in recent years, and therefore liable to penalty, the Commissioners instead of proceeding to recover the penalty would say: &ldquo;We will take all taxes due, plus some mitigated penalty, and if you pay them we will not take the penalty.&rdquo;<Col N="1896" /> It is common for people, rather than face a penalty, to go over their books and pay all the tax due during that period.  If the Commissioners were prevented from making arrangements like that it would probably be to the disadvantage of the taxpayers, as the disposition of the Commissioners would be to proceed for the payment of penalties.  If a person feels that he owes a large amount of old taxes he would probably refuse to pay, and he would pay the penalty.  The lever which the Commissioners have for getting old taxes is that there has been fraud in recent years.  I think it was in August, 1923, that an advertisement was issued in the Press stating that those who withheld particulars of income tax or otherwise understated their liability would be given an opportunity of reaching an understanding with the Revenue Commissioners, and that if that opportunity were availed of taxpayers would avoid trouble in the future.</P>

It further stated that in cases in which full disclosures had not been made by that date the penalties would be vigorously enforced.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a notice to that effect has been issued, but it did not come under the notice of the general public.  I believe a number of taxpayers, who would have been willing to make a disclosure if they saw the notice, never saw it.  It was published rather obscurelv.  It was an ordinary official notice, a standardised Government <Col N="1897" /> advertisement of a couple of inches.  My information is&mdash;and I have been at pains to verify it by making inquiries amongst income tax agents and others&mdash;that the great majority of the people who would be willing to make disclosures never saw the notice.</P>

      <P>The date of the first notice was the 2nd August and then there was a second notice on the 20th October.  Conditions were then practically normal.  It was not merely the end of the Civil War.  If the notice were published in April or May it might be said that people did not get much notice.  In any case, it was published in the daily Press.  It was not an obscure advertisement. It was not, of course, a half-page advertisement or anything like it, but it was not obscure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some headline type in it, I think.  The position was that while a number of people might not have seen the notice, a lot of people did see it, and they came voluntarily forward and made disclosures and payments.  They made payments under the threat that if they did not make them they would be subject to penalties.  The position would be that those who came forward on the face of that would find that they had simply lost their money, while those who lay low and refused to make any disclosure would have had all the tax remitted. It is some hardship on people to have to pay tax now which was due in respect of the boom years.  That is to a certain extent a hardship, but I do not think it is a thing that <Col N="1898" /> should be taken into account.  I think that nobody really heard anything that entitled him to believe that he would not have to pay, and it is a matter, I think, in which he must regard himself as at fault, if, instead of making provision to pay the tax at some later date, he spent the money.  The great majority of the people did that, but these are not the cases where big sums are demanded.</P>
      <P>I have had in one way or another a great number of cases before me of people who were obliged to pay arrears of taxes.  People who were asked to pay substantial sums of £5,000 or £6,000 or thereabouts have come to me asking that time should be given, and although I have no functions in the matter and have tried to discourage them, I have not been able to refuse to see some people.  In practically all the cases that have come before me the people had not expended the money which they should have paid in taxation. They held investments and were quite able to pay now.  In a fairly large number of cases, the sort of case that came before me, there was no real hardship on them.  They were people who had increased their investments during these boom years but who did not pay their tax, and are quite able to pay it now. The class of people who are hard hit are salaried people and people who are in arrears for comparatively small sums.  So far as investments abroad are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the Minister passes from that, I would like to ask a further question.  How far is this inquisition going back?  I have been told that it is going back to 1914 and 1911.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens in an enormous number of cases is this.  A person has been guilty of default in recent years, for two, three or four years, or any time during the past six years.  He can offer to make a full disclosure and to pay all the taxes which he withheld at any time or he can allow the Revenue Commissioners to proceed for penalties. He can take his choice of paying the <Col N="1899" /> penalties or paying up all the tax which he has withheld.  That has been the practice in connection with the revenue all along.  It was the British practice prior to the change of Government, that a person would be given an opportunity to pay the tax, plus some mitigated penalty, rather than a full penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair that a person should be asked to produce books as far back as 1911, and to show the state of his business from that year up to 1914, and even since? Take the case of the average business man.  Supposing that I were a business man and I felt that I had done nothing wrong and that no penalty should be enforced against me, I do not want to pay the penalty and I am not in a position, without putting myself to endless worry at a time when I want to be looking after my business, to produce records going back to 1911 and 1912.  I think it is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has this in favour of the taxpayer.  He commits an offence and becomes liable to a penalty.  Instead of proceeding for the full penalty, the Revenue Commissioners say: &ldquo;Very well, we will meet you: we will take one-tenth of the nominal penalty provided you pay all the tax due.&rdquo;  If the man is not prepared to pay the tax due, he has no complaint and the full penalty is inflicted.  It is evidence of good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what the offence is?  Is it an offence not to have disclosed to the Free State arrears of tax due to the British Government?  Would that be regarded as an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing somebody said, for one reason or another, that there was no obligation on him to pay tax to the British Government, and that he withheld payment and spent the money, thinking it was an <Col N="1900" /> annual charge which he had got rid of, and that then he made a return to the Free State Government and did not disclose that in these years he had not paid the British Government, would that be accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is just one case in which there might be interlocking. That is where the question of the three years' average would arise.  But take any case where there is no question of a three years' average, if he made a correct return to us, then there is no offence committed.  In a certain class of business it is rather difficult to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that from a purely practical point of view he would be more likely to get more disclosures if the menace involved in a disclosure were removed?  If a definite limit were put on the period it would remove the menace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be practicable all right to publish some such notice as I presume was published in 1923, that if a person came voluntarily now there would be no penalties. The basis in 1923 was that he made a full disclosure and paid all the tax he withheld&mdash;that is, he did not pocket the tax that was at any time due.  It is very difficult to see how any other basis can be adopted than that, whatever assurances you give people&mdash;that they pay all the tax that was due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister adopt that basis now?  Logically neither basis can be defended; you cannot get a logical solution of any human problem.  Will he take the line of making another offer to the people on the basis of their paying all they owe and no more trouble? The difficulty of the Minister is he is trying to be logical.  You cannot be logical in human affairs. Humanity is not logical, never was, and, please God, it never will be.</P>

I do believe that on a reasonable solution he will get more money than by any of his present methods. I suggest that he sees how far he can go to meet an actual and acknowledged difficulty.  It is a matter for his brain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting the tax all right.  The argument that has been put forward that we are losing tremendous sums of money which we would get does not carry any weight with me.  I have made inquiries about cases.  It was discovered from documents which had been previously withheld when all the affairs came into the light there was not this big investment outside the country that otherwise might be in the country or anything of that nature.  With regard to present methods&mdash;I think the phrase &ldquo;present methods&rdquo; has been used two or three times&mdash;in Great Britain there is an Investigation Department. If a case of fraud or great difficulty occurs there, the district inspector does not deal with it.  He has no time to deal with it.  He has such a large number of assessments to get through that he cannot spend the two, three or four days, or the week, or even a fortnight, that difficult cases sometimes require.  He sends it up to the Investigation Department to be dealt with.  We were in the position that we had not even two or three men who were necessary to form a small investigation department, and difficult cases were only dealt with in so far as they could be dealt with by the district inspectors.  It meant that in a great many cases where the district inspectors had every reason to believe that false returns were sent in they could not spare the time to probe the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened now is we have brought into our machine what they have in Great Britain, an Investigation Department, and the difficult cases now can be passed by the inspector to a group of three or four officers who are not embarrassed by the ordinary routine work and who can probe those cases.  As a matter of fact we do not go to anything like the extent that the British go&mdash;I do not like to use the word <Col N="1903" /> C.I.D. investigation&mdash;simply outside the papers that come to them, in order to get information that will enable them to elucidate these difficult cases.  As a matter of fact there is nothing in the methods which should not be in them.  If there were more staff there are probably other methods of detecting revenue frauds in the matter of income tax which would be adopted because it is thoroughly unjust that a person liable to income tax should be able to escape it.  It is unjust to his neighbours in so far as the tax is a fair tax and it has the name of being fairer than any other method of raising taxation.  It is only fair that everyone liable should be made to pay.  It is a great cause of discontent and injustice that individuals who are liable and can well afford to pay should be enabled to escape it.</P>
    <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Law the position is this, that if a man sells out his investments and spends the money he is liable to tax on last year's income on the basis of the preceding year irrespective of the fact that some of the investments may be gone.  On the other hand if he increases his investments during the year he only pays on the smaller sum.  He is charged on the basis of the preceding year whatever happens.  As the law stands if he sells his investment and buys a house is he doubly taxed?  He is not, because that would be a case of double assessment for which he would have relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

      <P>He might be got that way.  Take an extreme case: if he spends his money on a trip around the world, undoubtedly he is not allowed for that.  I will look into the matter that Deputy Murphy mentioned, the question of whether cases could be heard in camera in the High Court.  Although he mentioned it last evening it is not one which I have had an opportunity of looking into.  I do not know whether it would be practicable or desirable. As a matter of fact, when cases go to the High Court they go on a point of law really.  Very often there is not a great deal of discussion of the case outside the net point involved. I recognise, however, that there may be many cases where the whole circumstances of the business may have to be disclosed in order to have a point of law argued.  The general view is, of course, that that is undesirable. It is undesirable that the circumstances of an individual business, in so far as it has to be dealt with for income tax, should be made public.  It may be that it would be possible to have some system of hearing it in private.  However, it is a matter that would require some time to look into.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister sits down, I wish he would clear up a point.  I think Deputy de Valera said he thought officials are going back as far as 1912 looking for arrears in cases where they thought fraudulent returns were made.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The real position is that the Revenue Commissioners can only go back for six years as far as income tax is concerned, but if a man has been guilty of a fraud through that six years' period and is liable to a penalty, instead of proceeding against him for the full penalty it is a common thing for them to say: &ldquo;If you pay any tax that you are liable for and which you have withheld over the full period we will accept the tax, plus a mitigated penalty.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1929&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill is introduced for two main purposes. One of them is to provide additional capital for the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the other is to enable the Corporation more easily to make charges on lands in certain circumstances.  It was originally intended that there should be two Bills, one dealing with the financial position and the other dealing with the question of taking charges on lands.  However, it was finally decided, in order to save the time of the House, and because both Bills were dealing with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to incorporate them in one single measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is to increase the capital of the Company from £500,000 to £1,000,000, and it is proposed to divide the shares of the Corporation into two classes.  A and B shares.  The A shares will be paid a <Col N="1909" /> dividend at the rate of 5 per cent., as is the case with respect to the shares at the present moment.  So far as the B shares are concerned, a dividend will be paid on them only out of profits.  This is regarded as a desirable change.  It does not really mean anything to the Exchequer, because the present position is that if the Corporation has not the profits to pay a dividend, the Minister for Finance must, out of the Exchequer, provide the funds to pay a dividend. The money or portion of the money which he pays is then paid back to the Exchequer by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It gives a misleading appearance to the balance sheet of the Corporation, and the position in future will be that dividends will be paid only out of profits.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for a period enough income will be earned to pay the dividend on the A shares.  So far as the B shares are concerned, they will be held by the Minister for Finance. For a period no dividend will be paid; but, on the other hand, it would not be necessary for the Minister for Finance to make advances to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purpose of paying dividends on any shares.  There is a provision later on made for a reserve.  If profits admit of it a bonus in excess of 5 per cent.  may be paid on the B class of shares.  so that ultimately for the whole period the Exchequer will have got its five per cent. on the shares held by the Minister for Finance in the same way as the holders of a shares will have got five per cent. on theirs.</P>
    <P>The capital of the Corporation is being increased because certificates of charge cannot be issued to an amount equal to the total loans of the company then outstanding.  They can only be issued from time to time.  There can only be an issue after the loans have been made and mortgages obtained which will be after all, the primary security for these certificates of charge, though it is now proposed to secure them against all the assets of the company. The Agricultural Credit Corporation will finance itself to a substantial extent from time to time <Col N="1910" /> by means of advances which will be obtained from the banks, and it is in order for them to provide a better security for those advances, and more direct security, that the capital is increased.  It is proposed that only 10/- per share shall be paid up and that the remaining 10/- per share shall only be paid if and when the Corporation is being wound up.</P>
    <P>The new shares will be offered to the existing shareholders, and so far as the banks are concerned, they will take up £200,000 of the new shares.  A certain additional proportion of them will be taken up by the general public.  The remainder of the A shares will be taken by the Minister for Finance.  If all the present shareholders took shares equal to the amount which they already hold, the Minister for Finance would have to take £475,000 of B shares which will be issued.  It would take about one hundred or two thousand of the A shares.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation, as Deputies are aware, works on a very narrow margin.  The rate of interest that it charges is 6 per cent. It was arranged in consultation with the Minister that not more than 6 per cent. would be charged; if a rate like 6½ per cent. were charged of course the difficulty of carrying on the Corporation in its earlier years would be very much reduced.  If the Corporation, for instance, were to lend an additional £500,000 per annum&mdash;and I do not think that that is by any means an excessive amount, because there is something in the neighbourhood of £400,000 lent at the present time&mdash;and were to continue its operations only on the scale that enables it to lend an additional £500,000 per annum, and if it continued to charge interest at the rate of 6 per cent.  and obtained the money at about 5.2 per cent., loans issued at par will be paying 5 per cent. and there will be various charges which will, in effect, increase the interest.  If it were to obtain money at 5.2 per cent. it would in 1936 not only be paying a dividend on A. shares and on B. shares, but it would also be able to provide a bonus <Col N="1911" /> on the B. shares which would be the beginning of compensation for the period during which no dividend would have been paid on those shares.</P>
    <P>The provision for creating a reserve fund is aimed partly at facilitating the Corporation in its borrowing and, of course, as a reserve will represent a certain amount of free money it will, perhaps, at a future time go some way towards enabling the Corporation either to meet its expenses more easily, or in approved cases, to give more favourable terms to borrowers.  It is proposed to pay to the Corporation, under Section 11, a sum of £5,000 in respect of flotation expenses.  This sum really represents stamp charges and, as I have said, in view of the fact that the Corporation must work on a very narrow margin, it is felt that it ought not to be burdened with this charge.</P>
    <P>Part II. of the Bill deals with the question of enabling the Corporation to obtain charges on land in circumstances in which it cannot readily obtain them at the moment, and to relieve borrowers of difficulties and expenses which they would be obliged to face without this Bill in order to give the Corporation the security that it would require.  The Minister for Agriculture will deal with this part of the Bill at greater length.  It is felt that it is necessary to ask the House to take this Bill before the summer recess because, firstly, the financial provisions are necessary in order to enable the Corporation to get the temporary accommodation it requires in order to make the loans prior to the issue of certificates of charge, and, secondly, because there are many cases in which loans cannot be made owing to the existing difficulties which borrowers have in giving a security which the Corporation can take.  There are certain minor provisions in the Bill, but I do not think that I need deal with them at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be a Bill to make up for past faulty legislation. <Col N="1912" /> In fact, I believe that if we examined the original Agricultural Credit Act very little of it is left after the amending Act of last year and the Bill we are now considering. This is what we might call put and take legislation; they put down any foolishness they can think of in the Bill and then, after a year or two, they take out any part that does not suit.  We begin to see now that the Principal Act is really not an Act at all, but a sort of conundrum that nobody can understand, and, as is proved by this Bill, that the Corporation could certainly not work under.  There is not a single section of it left except the first, which deals with the short title, and other sections which deal with chattel mortgages.  The section which deals with chattel mortgages may remain there, because those mortgages are not workable in any case, and it does not matter what is in the sections, or whether they are wrong or right.  If we were to be honest we would also amend the short title of the original Act.  We should change it from being an Act to give credit to farmers and put in something else instead.  The fact is that it is not an Act at all.  We are all familiar with the history of that piece of legislation.  It was rushed through the House early in 1927 in preparation for a general election. It was really an Act to return the Government Party and not to give credit to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, a certain farmer candidate in June, 1927, had a poster on his car which stated: &ldquo;Cheap agricultural credit.  Vote stability.&rdquo;  Whether he has or has not got stability I am not sure, but at any rate the farmers who voted for him and for stability have not got it from the Agricultural Credit Corporation under the Act passed in 1927.  We are presented, as usual, with plenty of retrospective provisions.  We are told in every section of the Bill not only that things are so, but that things have always been so, although when we refer to the original Act we find that they are not so at all.  These retrospective provisions <Col N="1913" /> are to make up for past mistakes, with which we are getting very familiar now.  When Ministers bring in Bills and have no conception what trouble these Bills may lead them into, they come along with retrospective legislation in order to correct past mistakes.  The fact is that the Act was entirely unworkable, the Agricultural Credit Corporation found it practically impossible to give any loans without acting ultra vires in some way, and it is only fair to the Corporation and to its officials to agree to this retrospective legislation in order to make what they have done really legal.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill I do not think the Minister explained very clearly why these changes were made with regard to the payment of interest.  Of course, we can see for ourselves that it was a rather ridiculous thing to set up a company in 1927 and to put on that company the onus of paying a 5 per cent. dividend whether it had made profits or not.  If that is removed by the present Bill it is at least a move in the right direction.  The Minister also explained that it was necessary to increase the capital of the Company. The original capital was £500,000, and now it will be £1,000,000.  It should have been as clear to the Minister in 1927 as it is now that when the Corporation went to raise money by certificates of charge they would not get the full amount of the face value of the mortgages that they would lodge to raise the money.</P>
    <P>This is another change in the right direction.  The method incorporated in the 1927 Act of raising money on a specified number of these mortgages was absolutely unworkable.  I think it is recognised now that if they had at that time consulted even the office boy in the Land Registry he could have told them that it would never have worked, so that the idea of securing certificates of charge on the assets of the company is also moving in the right direction.  However, we think that we might at least have been spared having to spend our time here each year passing Acts amending the Agricultural Credit Act of 1927 if the Ministers responsible <Col N="1914" /> had been a little more careful and had sought a little more advice before hurriedly bringing in the Act of 1927.  If the Minister for Finance had got better financial advice he would then have seen that the capital of the Corporation should have been larger and he would have seen that it would be impossible to make the clauses regarding the certificates of charge workable.  Indeed, the Minister for Agriculture might have seen that he could never get the Land Registry to keep up with the work.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill which enables people who have not got their land vested to get loans from the Credit Corporation with much less trouble and at less expense than has been the case up to this. People who have not their land vested must number about 30 per cent. of the farming community, and they were practically outside the sphere of the Agricultural Credit Corporation under the original Act. This Bill will give them at least the same privileges as other farmers have.  But again that was a point that the Minister for Agriculture, who is considered by a good many Deputies to be an expert on land law, might have foreseen in 1927 if, as I said, the rush to get the Act passed before the General Election had not been so great.  It is possible that the Minister for Agriculture had not time to look at the Act when it was going through.</P>
    <P>Under that Act the Corporation was tied up by all sorts of red tape. Not only was the Act itself very narrow in its provisions, but even the articles of association, which had to be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, were narrowed down well within the terms of the Act, so that when an application came before the officials of the Corporation they were put into such a position that they were afraid, without the most minute inquiry and investigation, to make an advance.  The result was that many farmers who applied for loans had practically gone beyond recovery, so to speak, before the loans arrived. However, they did succeed in getting loans, as the Minister has said, to the <Col N="1915" /> extent of £400,000, and the wonder is that under the original Act and the articles of association the Credit Corporation could give any loans at all.</P>
    <P>We have this Bill before us; we had a Bill before us last year, and in all probability we will have other Bills before us, unless the Minister and those responsible for this Bill recognise that the Agricultural Credit Corporation has not yet been given an opportunity to speed up loans.  For instance, Section 12, I think, of the original Act prescribes the class of business or the purposes for which loans might be given.  But it is very difficult in some cases to know where the line can be drawn, and it is very difficult for the Corporation's officials to find out whether they could grant a loan in a given case or not.  For instance, it is very hard to say whether a loan could be given to pay a bill for groceries or not, and I believe that at present it is the practice not to sanction a loan to pay a bill of that sort.  Naturally they must be on the safe side within their articles of association and within the Act.  But it is rather a foolish thing to pass an Act prohibiting the Corporation from giving a loan to pay a bill of that sort, or to pay a bill, say, for the education of a farmer's son, or anything of that kind, because if a man wants to get £60 or so to pay grocery or education bills, he can, if he wishes, in order to come within the Act, sell £60 worth of cattle, pay his bills and go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for £60 to buy cattle again. He would be quite within the Act in doing that, everything would be all right, and he would probably get his money if he has good security.</P>
    <P>We are legislating to prevent the Agricultural Credit Corporation giving loans to farmers to pay household bills.  We believe, I suppose, that we are doing the right thing. We believe that by preventing farmers from paying bills of that sort we are compelling them to apply any money they get from the Corporation to farming purposes.  There is always a roundabout way for getting <Col N="1916" /> money for bills of that sort.  As a matter of fact, it would be hardly necessary for a farmer, if he were not altogether honest, to sell his cattle to pay that bill, and then to go to the Corporation for money to buy more cattle.  Possibly he could ask the Corporation to give him £60 to buy cattle and, instead of selling his own cattle to pay the bill and buying other cattle, he could, as it were, sell the cattle to himself and pay the bill with the money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that under the original Act the Corporation has lent £400,000, but when we come to consider what has been done we find that the Corporation has been dealing with a certain class in the farming community.  The man who has good credit, who can give very good security, and who only wants to borrow a very small percentage of the value of the security he can give, can go into a joint stock bank as usual, and get a loan, so that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was scarcely required for that type of man.  On the other hand, the man with no security, the man who is down and out, who has no stock, finds it very hard to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is the middle class financially, the men who owe money to the banks, who owe debts of all sorts, about whom the banks may be a bit anxious, who are handed over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and these are the people that the Corporation has dealt with so <Col N="1917" /> far.  The Government and, of course, the people behind the Government who lent the money, are in a rather peculiar position, seeing that we have bankers on the Board of the Corporation who would be very willing to sanction loans to certain people in order to have the loans due to the banks paid back.  On the other hand, we have only a minority of Government representatives on the Board, and if loans are granted too freely, or if the Corporation had to be wound up, it is the Exchequer and the taxpayers who would have to make up the deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a majority on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I was not aware of it.  To return to the particular class that I referred to, the class that had not sufficient security to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from any bank, nobody seems to have any solution of their difficulties.  I think that, at least, some attempt should be made to do something for them. There are many people with land, some of them good farmers who, through adverse circumstances and through misfortune, are now in very poor circumstances and cannot get credit anywhere.  Of course there are others in that position through their own fault.  Something should be done to help those who would make good if they got a chance. Their farms are derelict.  There is no production from the land, because, owing to certain legislation that was passed here, even if they let it to try to pay the current rates and annuities, cattle belonging to the people who might take the land would be seized, so that the land is really left derelict owing to legislation that was passed here.  Not only is there no return from the land, but these people are not paying either rates or annuities.  As a result the other people in the county have to make up for their default. The other farmers, who are in the <Col N="1918" /> majority at present, at any rate, have to carry these people on their backs, and have not only to pay their own rates and annuities, but also to pay for those whose farms are derelict.  Agriculture being in the state it is, it is very hard to see how these people can continue to pay debts due by other people as well as meeting their own liabilities. The danger is that the number of people who are down and out in the agricultural community will increase, and that things will not improve with people who are on the borderline.  I do not know if that is the policy of the Government, as it is the case with some industries, such as the flour milling, about which we have been told so often that nothing will be done until the inefficient are wiped out.  If it is the policy with farming, that nothing will be done to try to get men whose farms are derelict on their feet until the inefficient are wiped out, possibly they will not have long to wait, but it will be a very difficult job to revive the farming industry if things are left as they are much longer.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to Section 23.  That section amends Section 12 of the original Act, which deals with the purposes for which money can be lent.  I believe that unless more powers are given to the Corporation under Section 23 that we shall have, this year or next year, another amending Bill coming along. Section 28 presents another difficulty. I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture has considered what will be the position under that section. Section 28 raises the question of what will be the position if the Agricultural Credit Corporation lends money to a farmer who gets into arrears with the Land Commission and whose farm is sold out and bought for, perhaps, a nominal sum. Will the Agricultural Credit Corporation lose their mortgage?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>They will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only for permanent improvement charges as it <Col N="1919" /> stands.  What will the position be if it is another loan and if it is an ordinary mortgage?  The criticisms that people make against the Agricultural Credit Corporation are, first of all, the very slow methods that they have for dealing with loans.  That, I think, will be obviated very much under this Bill, and I believe the Corporation will be enabled to deal with applications much more quickly under it than they have been able to do up to the present.  But, as I have said, if they were given wider powers they could act more quickly still, because they would not always be afraid of acting ultra vires and of being brought before the court, where, if it were proved that they had acted ultra vires, they would lose their mortgage.  At any rate, under this Bill, in the case of people who have land unvested, the Corporation will be in a position to act much more quickly than they have been able to do up to this.</P>
      <P>Another complaint which has been made is that farmers cannot afford to pay six per cent. interest.  There is no doubt, of course, that even the best farmers in the country cannot afford to do that.  Take, for instance, the case of a farmer who has his land well stocked and who does not owe money to anybody, if he were to branch out into some additional line of agriculture, and if that necessitated his going to the bank for a loan of, say, six hundred pounds, on which he had to pay six per cent. interest, I believe that even very few of the best farmers in the country could make six per cent. from any farming operation that they might engage in at the present day.  Not only would a farmer have to pay six per cent. on the money, but he would also have to pay an amount for redemption. The result would be that he would have to pay back practically eight per cent. on this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should have been possible for the Government to have devised some scheme of providing money at a cheaper rate.  Various ways have been mentioned for doing that.  I have not studied them, and I do not know whether they are practical or <Col N="1920" /> not.  Various ways, however, were mentioned, such as savings certificates, post office savings and so on. It has been suggested that these should have been put at the disposal of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It was also argued by some that the Corporation should have been allowed to take deposits, that they be given to them at 2? or 3 per cent., and that they should be permitted to give a half per cent. more than the ordinary banks on deposits. If the Government were to guarantee those deposits, as they guarantee certificates of charge, the Corporation would possibly get a big amount of money on deposit, and they would be in a position to lend money at a lower rate of interest than six per cent.  If the Corporation is able to work at present on a one per cent. margin, the position would be, if they were allowed to receive deposits and were given a certain amount to cover the expenses for doing so, that by lending out the money again at four and a half per cent they would be better off than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The original Act of 1927 was, I believe, framed more or less on certain conclusions reached by the Banking Commission.  If we are to judge the Banking Commission by its work on this subject, I think that we ought, as soon as possible, to revise all their other findings to see if they made the same mess of other things that they made of agricultural credit.  I certainly am not opposing this Bill.  I think it is making up for a lot of the mistakes under the 1927 Act, and that it is going to give the Corporation a chance, to some extent at any rate, to lend money with more dispatch and more freely than they have been able to do so far.  But, as I have said already, unless the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture, or whoever is most concerned gives the Corporation more powers than the Bill before us proposes to give them, then I believe the Corporation will not have the freedom that they should have to give loans without asking all sorts of questions and making all sorts of inquiries which do not in any way help them in the <Col N="1921" /> matter of security.  Unless the Minister gives them those powers under the Act, then they will be compelled to come back here again within the next year or two with a further amending Bill.  When the Committee Stage of the Bill is reached I propose moving an amendment to Section 23.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not surprising to me that the Minister for Finance was so embarrassed when introducing this measure.  I do not think I ever heard him speak in this House to such disadvantage as he did when moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  I have read this Bill, and I am not at all satisfied that this patching is going to make good the defects in the Bills that have gone before it. It seemed to me that that also appeared to be the view of the Minister for Finance when speaking on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us practically no information as to what this Bill proposes to do, except to increase the capital of the Corporation from £500,000 to £1,000,000.  The Minister for Finance then gracefully retired leaving, what I may call, the terrier of the Front Bench to deal with the question after he had drawn the Opposition.  That is exactly the position in which this very important question of agricultural credit is being dealt with.  To come to the history of this whole matter, I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan that the first Bill was an election Bill and that it was designed for election purposes.  I am informed, I do not know whether rightly or wrongly, that after the election was over the Government hesitated for a very long time about bringing that Act into operation. The hesitation, I think, was due to the fact that they knew themselves that the Bill was perfectly useless, and they were between the cleftstick of justifying their statements to the electors or launching a Bill that they knew would never be of any use to assist the farmers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure following the Bill <Col N="1922" /> was worse than the method of setting up the Corporation.  Whenever they went to the public to get money to finance it they took precautions to see that the investing public of Ireland would not invest one penny in this Agricultural Credit Corporation. Their advertising was badly done.  Proper information was not given to the public as regards this gilt-edged security, and what was the result?  I asked a question from the Minister for Agriculture as to what return they got from the issue of the first prospectus, and I ascertained that they got £20,000 in the Free State.  They did not want any more.  If the public had subscribed I think the Government would have felt embarrassed, for some reason or another known to themselves.  That flotation was a complete failure not only as regards the financing of the original Act but it did a great deal of damage to the credit of the people for whom it was designed to provide. I know from my own experience that the result of the Credit Corporation Act in its working has been to injure more than to help agricultural credit, owing to the slow methods adopted by the Corporation, which may not be their fault but is possibly due to the very bad instrument which is put into their hands in the way of legislation.</P>
    <P>The result of the working out of this Act has been to destroy the credit of farmers in many parts of the country.  I am not speaking of the down-and-out farmers but of the men who have met with some losses, and they are legion since the time of the fluke.  If a man with six or seven cows loses two or three of them he has not the wherewithal to replace them, and he applies to the Agricultural Credit Corporation say, in August, but his case will certainly not be dealt with by the next spring.  That man probably has a bill in the bank.  I know several cases of men who have small bills in the banks, and who have sent in applications for loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They have been informed that loans will be granted to them, and they are going into their bank every <Col N="1923" /> month and saying, &ldquo;It is all right. Renew the bill.  I am getting money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.&rdquo; They go in the next month with the same story, and again the next month, and the manager finally says, &ldquo;Unless you have that money next month I will not renew the bill.&rdquo;  The result is that the man is placed in a terrible state and his position is jeopardised.  Men have been reduced to dire straits owing to the difficulty of getting seeds for their lands, due to the fact that they were promised loans which have not materialised.  The fact is that the Act has not worked out in the way of assisting agricultural operations.  The ordinary trader knows that if a man gets a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation there is a first charge on his land, and the consequence is that his credit in the shops is stopped.  The shopkeeper cuts off supplies to these people because he says &ldquo;the Corporation has first charge and I will give them no credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Act for that. I do not blame the attempt to organise some system of agricultural credit, but I do say that the Act is ill-conceived and used wrongly, and it should have been amended at once by the Government. They should see that the reactions from this Act would not have told against the farming community. As I pointed out before, regarding the second and first Bills, there was a failure to get money from the public, and there was a reason for that into which I do not wish to go.  The Minister for Agriculture read the amending Bill here and I have read it since.  It is a very complicated piece of legislation, and I do not think there is a man in this House who could understand it.  It is supposed to cure all the ills of the first Act, and to simplify it and to make it easy to lend money and to remedy difficulties about equities.  I wonder why this Bill is necessary if the second Bill was carefully thought out? Why did they not introduce this <Col N="1924" /> Bill as a watertight measure seeing the difficulty under which the farmers were placed as a result of the others?  The whole thing has been a chapter of blunders.  For that reason, I have grave doubts that the Bill before us now is going to remedy the situation created by the failures in the past.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Government were looking for money to finance Irish agriculture they did not care whether or not they got money to do so, but we find in our Irish papers here an advertisement to finance English agriculture.  This advertisement was from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Limited, asking the Irish people to put their money into that Corporation.  I dare say some will put it into it for the purpose of financing the British farmer, who did not put it into the Irish Corporation.  I wonder before this Bill was introduced did the Government make any inquiries in other countries as to the methods adopted to finance agriculture? There is not a country in the world at the moment&mdash;some of them have been asleep, and amongst them our own&mdash;that has not wakened up to the fact that the most important asset they have is agriculture.  No matter whether they are industrial countries or otherwise they are concentrating on the farmer.  Are this Government satisfied that they have now produced a Bill that is going to make it possible for the farmers of this country to have some little freedom in the matter of credit, or some security that their stock and every thing belonging to them will not be wiped out?</P>
    <P>This Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Limited, authorises a capital of £650,000.  There are a few clauses in this.  I do not want to weary the House by reading them, but I dare say the Minister has read them.  I do not know if he thinks his method of dealing with agricultural credit is better than the method the English have adopted, and also if he thinks they have gone about the question of getting the investing public in Ireland into backing Irish agriculture as they should. <Col N="1925" /> I would also like the Minister for Agriculture, who seems to be in charge of the Bill, to state what has happened to the flotation of the loan for the certificates of charge.  It is but a short time ago since the Agricultural Credit Corporation appealed to the investing public of this country to put their money in on the security of certificates of charge.  I know that flotation was as badly handled as the first one.  If the money was fully subscribed I will not say another word.  I would like to know from the Minister how much money has been subscribed to the last flotation.  It would surprise me very much if it came up to their expectations. It will surprise me very much if things come up to their expectations with regard to the details of this Bill.</P>

      <P>A question was raised by Deputy Ryan with regard to the difficulties the Corporation encountered in the matter of lending money for certain purposes.  No doubt there are cases where bills for groceries have been held not to be agricultural, and where bills for feeding stuffs for animals have been held to be agricultural.  I hold, from an agricultural point of view, that it is just as necessary to feed the farmer as it is to feed animals, and that, therefore, where there is a legitimate account for groceries due by the farmer&mdash;and every farmer and everybody else owed money for groceries at some time&mdash;it is just as necessary to give him the wherewithal to pay for his groceries, and it is as truly an agricultural purpose as it is to give him money to buy <Col N="1926" /> foreign cotton cake or something else to feed his animals.  There is a marked difference in the scope of this Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and that of the Irish Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I notice that this Mortgage Corporation in England is allowed to lend money up to two-thirds of the value of the security.  The Irish Agricultural Credit Corporation is limited to one half.  Fifty per cent. is all that they give, and of that 50 per cent. it might be truly said&mdash;in fact I think it has been said by the Corporation when they issued their last appeal for money&mdash;that they never issued up to 50 per cent.  They held it out as an inducement&mdash;if you can call it an inducement&mdash;to the investing public, that these certificates of charge were on land and other securities on which less than 50 per cent. was lent by the Corporation, which left the other 50 per cent. of security for those who were asked to invest.  But the strange part of it is that people who made any inquiry into this question of the ramifications and operations of the Credit Corporation were aware of the fact that the Credit Corporation has been constantly saying and giving as an excuse for not lending money that the security offered them was not good enough in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation, according to the Credit Corporation&mdash;that the large percentage of those applying for loans cannot get them, although the Corporation are ready to pass the loans, and have passed them in many cases, because there is a legal difficulty in the security.  If that is so, why do the Agricultural Credit Corporation come to the public to look for money on security which they themselves have condemned?  That was the position when they floated the last loan, or attempted to float it. For these, and other reasons which I have stated before.  I have grave doubts that the Government have approached the question of agricultural credit in a serious manner.  I believe that the only solution of it is to scrap all the Acts and Bills and start de novo with a proper system of agricultural credit.  It is the only way they can do it, and then perhaps <Col N="1927" /> they will find a better way than they followed in the past.  No amount of patching, in my opinion, will repair the serious blunders they have made in the past, and make the Acts in any way an adequate means of dealing with agricultural credit.  I do not want, at this stage, to be too critical of the Bill, but I do hope that the Government and the House generally will go into the matter very seriously. There is one aspect of it I do not like, and that is that it has been going on for almost two years, and still we have the well-known fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is not operating as it should. That is admitted on all hands, while the necessity is there for agricultural credit.  We have now a very difficult Bill to deal with, and it is going to be rushed through like the others, without proper consideration.  I do not believe, if this Bill is to be passed before the Summer Recess, that it will come out of the legislative factory a useful measure.  I would suggest that time be given to the Government and their advisers, and to the House, to go very carefully into this amending Bill.  Presumably, this will be the final Bill in connection with this question, and plenty of time should be given, so that the Government will not leave themselves open to the criticism, which they undoubtedly are open to in connection with all the moves they made up to this; and so that every Deputy who is interested in this question can examine this Bill and the other Acts that were passed, and try and put all our heads together and produce something which, in the end, will enable us to say that we have produced a measure which, in the general view of the House, is adequate to deal with the question of agricultural credit in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know what is the subtle meaning of these A and B shares.  I do not think there is anything in that, except that very possibly they have so run down the credit of the Corporation with the public that the Government have come to the conclusion now that there is no hope of getting any <Col N="1928" /> money from the public.  I believe this will be only a temporary expedient, these A and B shares and a bonus to be paid, and that it will fall to the ground afterwards.  For that reason it would be much better to give adequate time for the consideration of this Bill.  The Government should not rush the measure through but should consider scrapping the whole lot and bringing in a new Bill. I have nothing more to say, except that I hope my pessimism will not be warranted when the Bill is passed, and that the best efforts of the House will be put into this, so as to produce something useful to the people generally.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon is an optimist if he thinks that this is going to be the last Bill upon this subject.  This is, I think, the third Bill that we have dealing with agricultural credit, so that in order that the Deputy may get over the shock at once and for all, I shall tell him that there will be many more Bills dealing with the same subject in the next five or six years.  If I were not to take the criticisms which I have heard seriously I could reply to them in the language of Dr. Johnson. However, I propose to take them seriously.  We are asked why we did not prepare a proper scheme of agricultural credit in the beginning.  The answer is in the language of Dr. Johnson: &ldquo;Ignorance, pure ignorance.&rdquo; Deputy Ryan tells us that he is omniscient.  If he was consulted he would, in fact, have given us the benefit of his advice in outlining a scheme that would have been absolutely water-tight.  I notice that on some subjects, particularly on the difficult subject of the land law and finance, especially high finance, there are more experts in this House than probably in any other assembly in the world.  Anything that is to be known about agricultural credit and banking and credit generally, is all known here, and particularly on the Opposition Benches.  You have all that kind of easy, facile, superficial criticism levelled at the Government whenever any Bills dealing with any <Col N="1929" /> of these subjects in introduced.  The fact is that if Deputies had any appreciation of the intricacies of a subject like this they would realise that such superficial criticism of that sort is really out of place.</P>
      <P>I am rather proud of the first Agricultural Credit Act.  It was a model Bill.  It was copied almost faithfully by the British in their Bill. The difference between our Bill of 1927 and the British Bill is very slight and in my opinion any changes made on the other side were not for the better, but such as it is I am rather proud of it as the first Agricultural Credit Bill and I am proud of the scheme upon which it was based.  It was formulated by the Banking Commission after evidence had been given before that body by a number of bodies in the country and mainly by the Department of Agriculture.  I take to myself the credit for the evidence that was given by the Department of Agriculture and I am glad to say that most of the proposals put forward in evidence by the Department were adopted by an extremely efficient body like that particular Commission. The Chairman of the Commission was one of the best known bankers in the world.  There were two or three very able Irish bankers on the Commission&mdash;and there are some able bankers in Ireland still&mdash;and these were representatives of other interests. I realise of course that the Chairman of the Commission, Dr. Parker Willis, was a dud as compared with Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Hanlon and that he knows nothing of high finance, particularly agricultural finance.</P>

I quite <Col N="1930" /> realise all this, but the fact is that all this easy, facile criticism is just a joke and would never have been directed against this Bill by anybody who had any appreciation of the difficulties that existed in other countries and especially in Ireland with regard to agricultural credit.  If Deputies would only consider the Land Acts passed by the British Parliament &mdash;and I know they have the greatest possible respect for the British Parliament and every thing that it does &mdash;they would see the difficulties.  The English, of course, are all experts. They have passed Bills dealing with banking and they have amended them time and again.  They have passed Land Acts and they have amended them time and again.  They have passed Acts dealing with such narrow problems as income tax and they have amended them time and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The English, being a third-rate people, know that the only way to do anything practical is by the system of trial and error.  We have that same Imperial, inefficient tradition. We do not, know everything, we are not omniscient, and hence all we could do is to get the very best experts, both inside and outside, to deal with problems.  But, unfortunately, we had not the benefit of the Fianna Fáil advice at the time.  They were engaged in other highly productive enterprises at the time.  All we could do was to get the best advisers we could from all over the world, regardless of expense, and put to them our point of view.  We had in these matters to tell these people what the special problems of this country were.  They had to hear all about the conditions, and they had to bring to bear upon the problem all the special knowledge which they have in highly technical matters like finance and banking.  Then we got their reports and then our Bill was drafted and put through.  We waited then to see in practice what further addition, subtraction, multiplication and division had to be made in our Bill. That is the system which we adopted.  In fact, if we had the inspired legislators in finance like Deputies <Col N="1931" /> Ryan and Kennedy, and all the other illustrious gentlemen on the benches opposite, they would immediately have formulated a scheme of agricultural credit and banking.</P>

      <P>I shall come to the Bill.  The Deputy got fair play, and he spread himself pretty considerably, and he will have to allow me to do pretty much the same thing. However, we had not the advantage of the advice of Deputies opposite about that.  All we could do was to go to the very best experts on the question.  We had an excellent Commission. They had the views and advice of the Department of Finance and a highly efficient body like the Department of Agriculture.  We produced this scheme of agricultural credit.  The highest form of flattery is imitation, and the English scheme is practically on the same lines as ours.  I ask Deputies opposite to develop a sense of humour and give up this nonsense.  First of all, it is insincere.  We had a Bill here last year to deal with one section of the Agricultural Credit Corporation relating to registered banking.  That Bill provided that mortgages which the Corporation had on registered land should have certain priorities, and I remember spending at least two hours here arguing with Deputies opposite and trying to point out to them the necessity for the change, and explaining to them at great length the intricacies of the Land Law and of the Registration of Title Law.  I had considerable difficulty in persuading Deputy Ryan that while that particular amendment might be an advantage, nevertheless, we had foreseen all the dangers that might arise as the result of carrying that amendment.  I spent a long time trying to persuade him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway the Bill that <Col N="1932" /> we introduced last year dealt with one amendment only which, after the most mature consideration, and after seeing the original Act in operation for some time, we considered to be necessary.  With all that experience we brought forward a Bill amending one particular section or arrangement of the original Act in a certain direction giving certain priority charges on registered lands.  That Bill was opposed in debate by Deputies opposite.  It took me a very long time to explain to them first of all the intricacies of the Land Law in relation to it, secondly the necessity for it, and thirdly that we had safeguarded the position.  Now what has happened?  Deputies come along and they have the impudence to tell us across the House that this amendment should have been inserted first.  Surely they expect that I have some memory left.  I remember when we introduced the amendment Bill last year not a Deputy opposite knew the first thing about it nor understood it, and it took two hours to explain to them the provisions and the implications of it.  Now we are told they knew all about it two or three years ago and they could have done it all themselves.  If Deputies would come down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, this debate is a joke.  I have listened to all the speeches, and at least three-fourths of each of them was directed to the following points, namely, why did we not introduce a Bill in the beginning that was absolutely water-tight, and what was the necessity for this Bill if we had taken time, in the first instance, to produce a proper Bill? When I was endeavouring to deal with that flippant criticism seriously, Deputies hopped up and interrupted me.  There should be some sense of justice.  Deputies opposite indulge in facile criticism and adopt a superior tone, even an insulting one, to anyone who is ready to answer them back.  I insist on my right to answer criticism without interruption.  I want to repeat the first point.  Deputies on the opposite benches, at great length, stated that these amendments were unnecessary, and that if any real consideration were given to the original Bill no amendments would have been necessary.  Last year an amending Bill was introduced, and it took me a long time to explain its implications to Deputies opposite. They had not the first idea about it, either as to the law or the merits. Though there was no vote upon it, it was opposed in debate.  All the defects were pointed out.  That Bill was not received with anything like enthusiasm.  It is not for Deputies who received the Bill in that way now to say that they knew all about it the whole time, and that if they had had their way the matter would have been properly dealt with in the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with one point, apart from finance; that is, that the same priority shall be given to unregistered <Col N="1934" /> as to registered land. Deputy Dr. Ryan stated that if we looked up the report of the debate on the previous Bill we would see that someone asked for that.  I am sure he did.  Fianna Fáil are in the happy position that they can ask for anything.  They have not to try it out.  A Deputy on one bench opposite can ask for one thing, and another Deputy of the same Party on another bench can ask for the exact opposite.  This Bill proposes to make exactly the same provision in regard to unregistered land as was made in the last Bill in regard to registered land.  Two years ago, in my ignorance, I would not have agreed to such a suggestion.  It is quite a serious proposal.  We need not argue it, as, apparently, all Deputies are enthusiastically in favour of it, so that I can look at it from an entirely different angle now.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a very serious proposal, and one which can only be justified by sheer necessity.  It is a very serious thing to take priority for a mortgage on unregistered land. We would not do it except for the sheer necessity.  Speaking with some knowledge of land law and of agricultural credit, I agree that this particular provision in this Bill is necessary in the circumstances of the case, but I would not have agreed to it were it not for the fact that I have to some extent been in touch with the operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation during the last three years.  As I said previously, I believed that legislation in regard to agricultural credit would have to be further amended.  It must be remembered that in this country and in England&mdash;I do not know much about Continental countries as I have not much time to inquire what they are doing in France, Timbuctoo or elsewhere&mdash;agricultural credit, especially the establishment of an agricultural bank, is an entirely new thing.</P>
    <P>In this country, in any event, when we are considering the establishment of a special system of agricultural credit we must remember that we are faced with special difficulties <Col N="1935" /> here.  I have listened to Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy O'Hanlon criticising, quite legitimately if you wish, the slowness of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in making loans. Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out that they were tied in a great many ways and should get a freer hand.  Deputy O'Hanlon was of much the same opinion and said that their powers should be extended.  I would ask them to remember that there are two sides to the question.  There is the taxpayer or the investor who is putting up the money, as well as the farmer who gets it.  It is right that a national Parliament should look at the question not alone from the farmers' point of view but also from the point of view of the investor. During this discussion I did not hear a word from the point of view of the investor or the taxpayer.  There is little, apparently, to be said for the man in this country who has earned his money hard and who has saved it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that there were certain things which did not make the security a bit better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you pointed out that the Credit Corporation had to refuse loans because better security was uncertain, because legal possession was insecure, and that there was a very large class of farmers who had no security, who had neither their rent nor rates paid and, by implication, it was suggested that the Credit Corporation was the body to deal with them. Everything was said for the man who wants money, but we should occasionally think about the man who lends it.  There is little said about the man who works hard and who has earned his money, but, after all, he is the backbone of the State and we should safeguard him.  We will not get close to this problem unless Deputies realise that those two parties exist and that it is the man who puts up the money who must in the long run call the tune.  He must get a fair dividend.  We cannot borrow money at less than 5 per <Col N="1936" /> cent.  The cost of administration of the Corporation is one per cent.  The Credit Corporation is a commercial proposition and lends money at 6 per cent. but Deputy Dr. Ryan says that that is no good to the farmer. What does he suggest?  Does he suggest that the taxpayer should subsidise the farmer?  He suggested saving certificates but they could not be got at less than 5 or 5¼ per cent. He also suggested that the money put on deposit should be lent by way of long term loans.  It could not.  We considered this question at great length and from the technical advice which we got I am satisfied that the use of deposits would not to any great extent help the Agricultural Credit Corporation to lend money. That is only one aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to another aspect&mdash;the question of helping the man who has no security.  Are the Corporation to lend the money of the taxpayer or investor to a man who has no security?  I know that there is the problem of the man whose land is entirely unstocked, but I suggest that that is not a problem for the Credit Corporation.  When the Corporation are operating for some time they will be in a strategic position to advise whether there is a real problem there, so far as that particular class of person is concerned, and how it should be dealt with.  We have had no data in regard to such person up to the present.  When they have got experience in the various counties and when they know the lie of the land it may be that it will emerge that there is a problem there which should be dealt with.  Meanwhile it was never intended to deal with such a problem within the terms of the Agricultural Credit Acts.  It was intended to set up a body that would operate commercially but which would have certain advantages by reason of the fact that State credit was behind it and which would organise itself from the point of view that its first and natural purpose was to give special sorts of credit which were required for the farmer but to do it in a commercial way.  We did not contemplate that <Col N="1937" /> the State should come in with a subsidy. Once it begins to come in with a subsidy in favour of the Corporation it will have to continue it and it will become a charitable body in the long run.  Once it reaches that stage, there would be a sort of temptation in that atmosphere to lend money without security.  It will be a real charity in the sense that it will never come back.</P>
    <P>We are considering a commercial proposition.  We are considering a body established as a commercial body; we are considering its difficulties as such, and any criticism that it is not able to lend money without security, any criticism on the lines that it will not lend money at 4 per cent. and borrow it at 5 per cent. is not relevant criticism. It must be accepted that it cannot lend money at a lower rate than that at which it borrows it.  It should be accepted that the administrative costs have been reduced to a minimum and cannot be reduced lower than one per cent., and it should be accepted that it cannot lend investors and taxpayers money without security.  If the Deputies would come down from their pedestals they would probably be the people to help us in a great many necessary amendments that will be required before the Agricultural Credit Corporation is a perfect body.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan devoted a considerable amount of his speech to the problem of the man who, he said, had no security, whose lands were unstocked, who was unable to pay his rent or rates, and who was refused loans by the <Col N="1938" /> Agricultural Credit Corporation because he had no security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was saying that the Agricultural Credit Corporation had not solved the whole question of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, and it was to be solved by agricultural credit and by a body dealing with agricultural credits.  There was no point in the Deputy's remarks about that particular class unless he was criticising the operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation or criticising the Act.  However, I will leave that.  We are blamed, of course, because the Agricultural Credit Corporation failed to get money.  We are told that the first flotation was a joke, that it was not properly done. Deputy O'Hanlon made reference to the flotation recently, and he pointed out that an English mortgage bank was advertising in Irish papers for agricultural credit.  First of all, it is the Agricultural Credit Corporation which makes arrangements for its advertising in connection with the flotation of loans.  We have to get the point of view accepted in the country that when a body or an individual gets a job to do, he or they should do it.  We cannot all be butting into other people's jobs.  In countries where there is any sort of success, the theory on which they proceed is that the individual or body which is charged with a definite work should do it, and if not, that his or their services should be dispensed with.  In this country apparently nobody is to be sacked, and everybody is to go in and give a helping hand in work for which they are not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation is in charge of its own propaganda and in charge of raising its own loans.  I happen to have, for certain reasons, a considerable amount of knowledge of the arrangements <Col N="1939" /> made to float the last loan, and I say, with all deference to Deputy O'Hanlon, that they could not have been better.  There was an immense amount of care taken to bring that loan to the notice of everybody in the country.  I prefer not to tell the Deputy the amount of money which was subscribed.  I do not think it would do any good.  If Deputies have any suggestions to make as to how loans can be more successfully floated, and how propaganda and general publicity can be improved, we would be glad to have them.  We have not heard them yet, though we have not heard a certain amount of criticism.  The Department of Finance has floated National Loans with some success up to the present.  Their advice was available, and I happened to know from my own knowledge that there was a great amount of care and attention given to the flotation of the last loan.  If a great amount of money was not subscribed, I do not believe that more money could have been got in this country by even the most efficient system of publicity that Deputy O'Hanlon could suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask that while Savings Certificates are a great success, that while the National loans have been a great success, and while anything the Government, in the matter of loans, properly put before the people has been successful, could the Minister explain to me how in the case of agricultural credit you have failure written all across it, a gilt-edged security which gives a return of five per cent?  Why is it a failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are possible reasons of detail, such as the fact that the loan for the Agricultural Credit Corporation was offered at 100 at five per cent., while the National Loan was offered at 95 at five per cent.  There are other factors. There is this factor which we must face up to, that nobody regards land as a good security.  We are largely to blame ourselves.  Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned that the English <Col N="1940" /> farmer can get money easily at five per cent.  That may be a fact, and he is entitled to it, but it is probably due to the fact that if he is unable to repay the loan he does not think he is done any injustice if he is sold up.  When the Irish farmer got money, in a great many cases at three, four or five per cent., and was unable to repay the loan, there was a combination in the neighbourhood to prevent his being sold off.  I really think that the sooner we face up to the facts the better.  First of all, nobody with money will buy such land, and nobody will be allowed to buy if he desires to buy.  Thirdly, if he buys he is not exactly comfortable. That particular fact has done more to make the problem of agricultural credit a more difficult one than any other, a more difficult problem than it is in any other country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What loan does the Deputy think?  Did the Deputy ever see a bank selling out a farmer in his district?  There is no use in talking like that.  Everybody knows that land is a security that it is very hard to liquidate.  An investor is extremely logical.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is a new institution. It is generally known that the basis of credit is land, and land has not a great reputation in this country as a basis of credit.  The fact that there is a Government guarantee behind it is not adverted to, to any great extent, especially in view of the fact that there are other loans available with full British and Irish guarantees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could argue that at great length.  We want to get money for agricultural credit in this country.  No amount of advertising will get money until there is a change of mind amongst the farmers about repaying money lent and until land becomes liquid.  If Deputies would admit that and make it easier, we could get money more easily than at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember, I do not say that the farmers are tremendously well off either here or in any other country.  At the same time there is a fair amount of money in agriculture in Ireland.  There is a fair amount amongst small farmers. I regret that it is not into the Agricultural Credit Bank they put any money they have.  They come to it to look for money, but they will not invest money in it.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation gets a chance, and if it is realised that it will take some years to work up to its full efficiency, I think it can do a tremendous amount to deal with this particular problem.  Deputy O'Hanlon made one remark with which I did not agree.  He said that it made farmers less credit-worthy and that it stopped their credit.  He quoted the case of a farmer who will not get credit in shop goods because the shopkeeper knows that there must be priority.</P>
      <P>Where does that argument lead? It is simply an example of the difficulties we are up against in dealing with this extremely intricate problem. It leads to this: that we should not give this special priority to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, whereas it is admitted that the Agricultural Credit Corporation cannot function without it.  If Deputies took up both sides of the case and discussed it dispassionately and calmly and weighed it up, I would not mind. What has been happening?  One Deputy denounces us for giving them those powers, and another for not giving those powers.  That very remark Deputy O'Hanlon made shows the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misrepresented.  The point I made was that men were promised loans months ago and have not yet got them.  They promised their creditors, banks and drapers, that they would pay them when they got the loans, and their credit is stopped.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan and myself, that of farmers owing money to grocers, a lot were turned down and would not get loans because they owed money to grocers.  It is a very small thing.  A man who wants a loan of £100 may owe £10 to his grocer, but it is not worth talking of.</P>

      <P>We are not discussing the administration of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section in the Bill which tends to extend the scope, and it would be relevant. With regard to loans, I know of cases where the Agricultural Credit Corporation promised a loan to a man on his stating his title.  Afterwards the following state of things was found.  The father died three years before and administration was not taken out.  That is common all over the country.  Will anyone tell me how to solve that problem?  Can you make a loan on the security of a mortgage of land, the mortgage to be signed by a person who is not the owner?  Farmers will not take out administration when the father or mother dies.  Yet those people will come along and expect loans on the security of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the case the Deputy mentioned, I know of plenty of cases where that occurred.  Loans had been promised.  Something simple like that has turned up. They have not taken out administration. They have no title to their lands and the loan from the Corporation must be held up until administration is taken out.  If Deputies imagine anything like that is simple in this life they are mistaken. A problem dealing with a very large number of farmers is especially complicated and cannot <Col N="1943" /> be dealt with simply by a number of rules and regulations.  I did not know that there was any difference between the time loans were promised and the time in which they were actually paid.  If there was, I would like to know any particular case, because I may tell Deputies they do not always get the whole story.  There may have been extremely good reasons for holding up the loans.  Certainly, as far as I know, the loans have been given fairly quickly after agreement has been reached, but there may be cases in which the loan had to be held up for certain reasons, arising out of title, and so on.  Also Deputies should remember that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, when it was an entirely new body, had to build up its own procedure and staff, and what surprises me is that they got into their stride so quickly. I honestly believe that in five or six years' time that body will be one of the most successful institutions we established to deal with a problem more difficult than the division of land.  Everyone expects money.  It is easy to criticise the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but notwithstanding that, I believe it will prove itself to have solved the problem, if it is really soluble, if it gets time.  Up to the present it has lent about £400,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second point that the Deputy raised, namely, the question of a man going for a loan who has a bill of £10 for groceries and will not get a loan because it is not for agricultural purposes, there is a section here dealing with that point extending the powers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think it is Section 23.  Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out that, in his opinion, it was not wide enough.  I asked him the question: where will you draw the line?  He suggested himself that the Corporation should be allowed to lend money for the purpose of educating a farmer's son.  If that is so, should the Corporation be allowed to lend money to a farmer for him to buy £100 worth of Guinness's shares to be put aside for <Col N="1944" /> his daughter when she would be married?  There may be a good arguable case for extending the powers of the Corporation.  There is undoubtedly that difficulty mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, which is being solved in a round-about fashion, as is suggested by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  At present, a man sells a couple of cattle to pay the bill and he comes to look for money to buy more cattle.  Let Deputies consider this.  We will try to extend, within limits of safety, the powers of the Corporation.  There is time.  Let them consider an amendment and we can discuss it in a reasonable way.  I would like to see the Corporation put in a position to deal efficiently with most of these problems. Remember this body should be confined to agricultural credit, and that all the tendency will be to push it to deal with things other than agricultural credit, and remember, to keep it within limits, to safeguard the investor's money, it will be necessary to draw a line definitely somewhere, and I imagine myself, wherever you will draw the line you will be solving one difficulty but creating another.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is exceedingly satirical and ironical because members of the Fianna Fáil Party have the unlimited and unbounded audacity to criticise any legislation on which he has set his almighty and infallible hand.  We unfortunately are in the position here of being representatives of the people and we sympathise with the Minister for Agriculture that the legislation which he now introduces cannot so easily secure acceptance in this House as it did a few years ago. It undergoes a more severe examination. If that examination is microscopic I think the Minister should not find any fault with the Fianna Fáil Party on that count.  He has only to read the judgments, opinions and criticisms of the judiciary of his own Executive to know what they think about some of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Free State judiciary think about this legislation that the Minister is so anxious to rush through without anybody being allowed to speak about it.  Some of it, a recent book says, might be held up certainly as a beacon light, more of it ought to be held up as a warning. I think that the original Agricultural Credit Corporation Act, no matter what the Minister himself may think about it, no matter how high his opinion may be of it, considering that it was his own baby, is not the be all and the end all of agricultural credit legislation.  The Minister tells us that that Act was not alone highly successful, apparently in this country, but that it was the model for the English Agricultural Credit Act which was not passed until a subsequent year.  It does not matter to us whether it was the model or not of the English Act as actually passed.  What I say is that in regard to the administration of the two Acts there is no comparison whatever.  The English Agricultural Credit policy is administered in an entirely different way, and when we criticise legislation here we <Col N="1946" /> are criticising it with reference to its effect on the administration.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the British Government is lending the English Agricultural Credit Corporation a sum of money free of interest for sixty years; in the second place the administration of the granting of loans is being carried out through the English banks, which undoubtedly are giving far more assistance and far more support to the scheme in England than the Irish banks are giving here, although the Minister for Agriculture himself went out of his way before ever a credit corporation was set up, to eulogise the Irish banks and to say that they were going to do a lot of the work, and the Banking Commission, which is the Bible of the experts on the other side, said that if by any chance we failed to get money, as we have failed to get it apparently, for the working of our Agricultural Credit Corporation, we can certainly, with the State behind us, easily get money abroad.  If that was so, why was not the money from abroad looked for?  &ldquo;In that event,&rdquo; the Banking Commission says, &ldquo;it is to be hoped that a reasonable amount of them (that is, of the land bonds) will be purchased and held by the banks.  As the investor becomes interested in them a genuine market for such bonds can be developed, and as it develops further the banks will be able to buy more and more of them until the amount so held corresponds roughly to the volume of the savings received in agricultural districts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then it goes on to say that the time will arrive when the total amount of loans which are granted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be represented by a corresponding amount which will be invested in the Agricultural Credit Corporation by the banks, but will, in the first place, be provided to the extent that they will have got rid of a large amount of their frozen debts and of loans which they were unable to collect, and, in the second place, because the additional security they would have, and whatever prosperity was reached among the agricultural <Col N="1947" /> community as a result of the operations of the Credit Corporation itself would have, of course, strengthened and have a very good effect upon the Irish joint stock banks themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture talked about the investors, and said there is not enough attention paid to the investors.  I say the State is the investor in this case.  The State is the only person who can lose, and when the Minister comes here and advances the hypothetical investor who up to the present has refused to invest, why does he not tell us what the Irish banks have done in this matter?  Why have not they fulfilled the promises that were held out by both himself and their representatives on the Banking Commission, that when the Agricultural Credit Corporation got under way they would give the money, the only thing necessary being to get a certain amount of money in circulation through loans, and that the money apparently was to come along through the joint stock banks.  If that process is being followed out, and if it is the case that the banks are in process of reaching a stage where they are going to finance the Agricultural Credit Corporation, because they are in the first place benefiting in the way I have stated, and in the second place the banks have reasonable security&mdash;they have State security and there is a reasonable yield&mdash;there is not the slightest danger, so far as I can see, of their losing on the transaction.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance are not able to show us what the banks have done in this matter.  We cannot got liquid resources, they say.  The trouble with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, they say, is that they have their money invested in land. People do not want to invest in land. They are shy of these certificates of charge which are issued against land.  The Minister himself foresaw that when he introduced the original Corporation Act.  He said that other securities would have to be provided, and undoubtedly they will have to be provided, and the other <Col N="1948" /> backing which would enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to go into a foreign investment market and get money there, will have to be provided either by the taxpayer or by the Irish banks.  Up to the present the banks have not done their share.  The taxpayer is the man who is responsible for the whole thing. He is the man who will have to foot the bill if the Corporation goes smash.  He is the man who has to sacrifice income tax and stamp duty to pay the preliminary expenses and lose the interest on whatever money is put into it by the State, because although the taxpayer is supposed to draw interest like all the other investors up to the present, presumably there is no interest to draw.</P>
    <P>While the taxpayer, therefore, who is an investor, has to suffer the loss of the interest on the State money invested, he will have to pay the interest to the bank and to the other people for whom principal and interest are guaranteed by the State. So that this is simply a State transaction, a State institution from beginning to end.  What we want to know is why?  Because the banks do not like the Agricultural Credit Corporation to be given a fair chance to make good.  We, as well as any other party in this House, are anxious that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should make good.  The only way in which it will make good is through the men on the opposite side of this House.  Quibbling or talk about competition with the Irish banks is not going to help us.  If we feel that Irish agriculture is in a sufficiently bad position, and if we feel that big action will have to be taken by the Corporation, let us do it.  If we do not the position will become worse later on and eventually steps will have to be taken.  There is the alternative. The Agricultural Credit Corporation should have been allowed to take deposits the first day.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance came in here and proposed that that Credit Corporation should be allowed to take deposits, and then because the banks, through the <Col N="1949" /> representatives of Trinity College in this House, said they should not be, they swallowed the pill.  They allowed the fifteen who are dominating them in their Irish language policy, and every other policy, to dominate them in this.  Of course the fifteen have another thought, and how could they be expected to do the right thing by the State, the taxpayer and the farmer?  They swallowed it and withdrew clause 9 of their original Act, which said that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be allowed to take deposits.  Here you have the Banking Commission saying that the only way in which we can get credit for the farmer, the only way in which finance can be placed at the disposal of farmers for agriculture, will be first by getting the deposits from the farmer.  But the deposits, of course, must go into the joint stock banks.  They must not in any circumstances be allowed to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, although the taxpayer has to face the losses if there are losses.</P>
    <P>He has to pay the interest and the principal as well.  The one moneymaking side of the whole business, the one thing that could enable the Corporation to work properly, naturally and well, and to put it on a firm foundation, like the credit corporations of other countries, Germany and so on, which really have the State behind them, and the commercial banks working with and for them, is not given an opportunity here.  That kind of thing is going to be prevented.  I would remind the Minister for Agriculture, also, when he is jibing at the Fianna Fáil Party, at their audacity and impertinence in discussing this question and pointing out the defects of his mighty, original Bill which, we are told, is the model for legislation in the Imperial Parliament, that the officials of the Agricultural Credit Corporation say it is so unworkable that there is hardly a single clause of it that is not utterly impossible.  Even at this hour of the day it is so bad that, as regards the memorandum of association and the articles of association, things which an ordinary <Col N="1950" /> joint stock company has power under the Companies Acts to change and adapt to altered circumstances, the Agricultural Credit Corporation has to come here and ask us to pass a special Act so as to enable them to change their memorandum of association or the articles of association in order that they may do as they want.  Still we are told this is a model piece of legislation and that it is a wonderful contribution to statesmanship.</P>
    <P>Before ever the Minister for Agriculture became a member of the Dáil the National Land Bank was set up by men who certainly were not experts any more than we here are experts, but who decided to set up an institution which, in the first place, should be national, and, in the second place, should have a definite aim.  Though the institution did not turn out as satisfactorily as it might have&mdash;the bank had very hard and unsettled conditions to strive against in the country&mdash;the work was still carried on.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Gorey would be very anxious to point out the particular transactions where it paid too much for land.  So it did, undoubtedly, but it had men behind it who were determined to make it a success, and in spite of these huge difficulties the Land Bank held its head up, it kept its head over the water, until better times came along. When better times arrived, and when the bank, which was the real kernel for the future agricultural development of this country, because it had the power to accept deposits and it had good-will and a trained staff which had some familiarity with land legislation and with transactions concerned with land, was doing well, the whole thing was swept aside and handed over to the Bank of Ireland, which has found it a very profitable transaction.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland has found it, perhaps, a more profitable transaction than any other bank in the thirty-two counties.  The Minister for Agriculture, the Executive Council and the Government Party were responsible for handing over the bank <Col N="1951" /> which ought to have been the genesis of the whole thing, and from which everything concerned with agriculture should have developed, and the Minister says here that there was nothing known about agricultural credit until he came with his Bill. As a matter of fact, at the Banking Commission a statement was made that the really authoritative Commission, on the whole question of agricultural credit, was the Commission which sat in Ireland under Mr. Cahill in 1914.  There is nothing to stop any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, be he Minister or back bencher, from consulting the report of that Commission and learning what has been done in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;What can you do when you cannot sell out the farm, &ldquo;and he pushes aside the whole question of what is to be done with the down-and-out people, the 200 farmers who are derelict in County Wexford, and points to the hundreds of thousands due to the banks in Tipperary and other counties.  We said here before, and it was said by the farmers when the original Act was introduced, that steps ought to be taken by the Government to approach the banks and clear off the old loans.  One of the worst things the Agricultural Credit Corporation is suffering from, and one of the biggest obstacles it has to face, is the whole question of taking over old loans which are hanging on and which make it impossible to approach this question from any new angle.</P>
    <P>When it was suggested here that the bankers ought to be made accept the position on account of deflation and of the particular circumstances in the country, and on account of the fact that if prosperous conditions follow, as they certainly would if the banks were reasonable, that the bankers would be the first to profit and they would profit a great deal more in the long run than the farmers who would get away with some of their obligations or responsibilities, we were told that that was embezzlement and bankruptcy and it was <Col N="1952" /> preaching dishonesty.  We were told that that was actually telling the farmer not to have all the civic virtues and not to be honest.  Now we find in almost every county the banks are making arrangements of their own free will.  What was wrong and what meant embezzlement and bankruptcy when it was preached from these benches is quite right from the point of view of the banks. I do not understand that sort of policy in regard to banking.  When part of a national assembly here says a certain thing ought to be done, we are told it would amount to bankruptcy and embezzlement; but when the banks see fit to do it we are told that is good commercial credit.</P>
    <P>Let us know where we stand in regard to the banks.  Are they or are we the masters as to the future progress and development of the agricultural industry?  If the Minister got in touch with the banks I believe he could have got at them by telling them that this thing was an obstacle in the way of the successful working of the Corporation and he would have got them to come to a general arrangement so as to enable the old debts to be liquidated and so give the farmers a chance to start off again.  The Minister for Agriculture also said, when he was introducing his original Act, that one of the principal objects he had in view in regard to the part of the Act which dealt with chattel mortgages was to give a chance to the congests and landless men in the West of Ireland and other areas.  I would like to have some figures that would show us the valuations of the counties in which the £400,000 has been distributed.</P>
    <P>Under the original Act, this precious Act which is to be the model for all future legislatures all over the world, Section 17 sets out: &ldquo;The Agricultural Credit Corporation shall keep all such accounts and other records and in such form as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this section.&rdquo;  I think it is one of the blots of the present Bill that no attempt has yet been made, after so many years, to frame definite regulations <Col N="1953" /> in regard to the manner in which those accounts are to be published. Deputies from all over the country have asked questions in the House as to the amount of loans that were granted and the areas in which they were granted, and other matters like that.  There was no information given, although the taxpayer is the man who has to foot the bill for the whole thing, as to the amount of loans, the areas in which they were distributed, or the type of farmers who have benefited, or the reasons why loans were refused. Deputies got letters saying that loans were refused, but the reasons could not be stated.  At least we might have been told here if the loans were refused because of inherent difficulties in regard to title and so on, or whether they were refused because the man had no security to offer.  We have not the remotest idea into what categories those refusals were placed.  We are told now that it is cheeky and impertinent for us, having been refused on so many occasions the most elementary information from the Minister about the working of the Corporation, to speak here on this matter.  If that is representative of Parliamentary Government, then the sooner we get a Mussolini here the better.</P>

      <P>To come back to the question of the landless men and the congests, the Commission that sat in 1914, and every Commission or every expert who has examined the policy of the country on the question of agricultural credit, examined it from the German point of view.  They examined it from the point of view of the problem of giving a loan to a man who had very little security, perhaps no security <Col N="1954" /> at all, to offer except honesty; that if the man was an honest man, a man in whom his fellow-parishioners believed, a man who they thought would make good, and who, when they came together in their little Credit Society, they decided was a good-enough man for them to stand over, that was the security they had.  That was that man's security, the confidence of his fellow-men in his own area in his honesty.</P>
      <P>But because Professor Parker Willis, or whatever he is called, comes across here from America comes across from a country where the ranches are as big as whole counties here, and tells us about American farming and the Farm Board system of credits on a very large scale, we are to forget completely all about the small farmer who is the backbone of this country. I do not care whether he is a congest or a man with 15 or 20 acres, at any rate, a man for whom a loan not of £50, £40, or £30, but even a loan of £10 or £15 would be a big thing and which would place cash in his hand that would enable him to buy stock or even poultry and who, when these were sold off, would pay back the loan.  We were promised that not alone would the system of chattel mortgages deal with these small farmers but that there would also be a system of intermediate credits.  I would like to know what the Agricultural Credit Corporation has done with regard to intermediate credits.  Intermediate credits, the Minister said while introducing the Bill, were credits for nine months or twelve months or perhaps for one, two or three years, for the planting of crops or for the buying of cattle or for seed, or for such periodical work on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loans which would benefit the fairly large farmer would certainly be of inestimable advantage to the small farmer.  If the chattel mortgages system is a failure and is a fiasco, I would ask why the system of credit societies cannot be developed, and why you cannot, through that system of credit societies, establish <Col N="1955" /> this intermediate credit system throughout the country?  I admit that you have difficulties with regard to administration expenses. These expenses can be low if you get, as in Germany, the local school master to do the secretarial work. But nothing whatever has been done to spread the good effects, no matter what they have been to the big farmer; nothing has been done to carry the good intentions of the Government into operation in the West of Ireland, and to many small farmers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The point is, is the Deputy in order.  I am suggesting to the Deputy if he is going to deal with the question of administration it ought to be in relation to this Bill.  I was not in the House when the Minister was speaking. I take it that the Minister, in dealing with it, was pointing out the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We can, on a Second Reading, criticise the things that are not in the Bill as well as the things that are.  The Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers can get up and tell us the necessity for these particular sections in regard to priority and so on, although I notice that the Minister for Agriculture took very great care not to explain the sections in which he is himself expert, namely, the legal sections &mdash;Sections 25, dealing with first <Col N="1956" /> mortgages, 28, dealing with the Irish Land Commission sales, and so on.  In regard to the organisation of credit societies, I regard that as being essentially part of the development of agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These societies must be organised at some time or another.  Now that there is need for agricultural organisation when everybody says they want the farmers to develop their industry and when they want to be able to have them in the position that they can speak for themselves, when they want them to come together and to bind themselves, it is extraordinary that no effort has been made to keep these societies in existence.  They have been blotted out by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The I.A.O.S., the body responsible, I think, and which receives Government subsidies, is so intent on the work of financing creameries, which is a difficult business, that it has no time, staff or organisation for organising the Credit Societies in every part of the country.  If they have no time, money or staff, the time, the money and the staff should be made available for them. Giving evidence at the Banking Commission, the Minister for Agriculture himself said: &ldquo;I believe it would be of great value if some central bank would establish connection with these societies.  The functions of such a bank would be twofold, to provide a secure investment for credit societies receiving surplus deposits, and to make extra capital available for Credit Societies in those districts where it is difficult to obtain deposits.&rdquo;  That is taken almost straight from the reports on the Raffeisen and other German systems. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Agriculture, having given evidence to that effect, and the whole trend of opinion even in the Department for which he is now responsible being in the direction of the organisation of these societies in this country for the past twenty or thirty years, that not alone are they not being organised, and not alone are the small farmers not being brought together to enable them to reap the advantage of this Act, but, <Col N="1957" /> on the other hand, the societies are being absolutely wiped out.  If it is the position with regard to agriculture that because we have a particular scheme of dairy reorganisation going on here, we cannot devote any attention to those areas where there are no creameries, and particularly so in the poorer areas, where £20 might mean more to a small farmer than £200 in other cases, if we have no scheme or policy to help them and to deal with these other areas, let us then be quite frank about it.  Let us say that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, doing its best for the creameries, has not been able to deal with the congests, the tillage farmer and the small farmer.  Let us be frank, and do not let us be deceiving ourselves.  Do not let us deceive ourselves when this Bill is passed, with a chorus of &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo; from the back benches on the Government side, that everything is going to be rosy and that everything is to be paradise.  It will be no such thing.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to call attention is the matter of expenses in connection with loans.  I do not know whether these expenses are high or low.  What I do know is that other members of this Party who have come in contact with them say that the expenses in connection with probate and administration are exceedingly high and that one of the means by which it would be easier for the Corporation to deal with questions of title would be by reducing the expenses.  In the long run, if the expenses are maintained at their present level, the Corporation will lose, the State will lose, and certainly the man who has applied for the loan will lose.  That is one of the elementary things that ought to have been faced.  If we can devote so much time here to remedying the question of title, to giving priorities, and so on, it ought to be easy for us, if we set our mind to it, to reduce the legal expenses in connection with administration. Perhaps this is only a small point, but I think, taking it all in all, that the expenses are unreasonably high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" /> In regard to the attitude of the Government in its dealings with joint stock banks and its failure to secure cheap money for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, in my opinion it is absolutely essential for its success to get the joint stock banks to face up to their responsibility and to put their resources into the Agricultural Credit Corporation until such time as the ordinary investor here can get over his shyness, which, of course, must be very widespread, because land, as the Minister for Agriculture says, is an uncertain kind of security, and there is, perhaps, a prejudice against investing money in new Government institutions; and from that point of view I think that the flotation itself was premature.  But in any case, having decided that money was necessary, that the Corporation could not proceed without it, that money should be got on the most reasonable terms, and that it is far more reasonable, far better for the country in every way, and far better for the banks themselves that they should begin to learn that the proper home for their investments is the Free State itself, in which they get their deposits, it would have been far better if the Government had approached the banks and had tried to get them to do their duty.</P>
    <P>This Bill, however it may succeed in rectifying difficulties in regard to title, in dividing up the shares and increasing the share capital, does not touch the fundamental point.  The Minister refused to touch it in his speech, as indeed he refused to deal with any other pertinent matter.  I put it to the Government that it is time for them to make up their minds as to whether this institution, to which they have pledged the full security of the State by their numerous Bills, is to be made a success of, a course for which, I claim, they have secured the co-operation of every Party in the House in advancing. It is really up to the Government, and it would not be too much to ask them, to go to the banks again, even though they have a shot in their locker, and tell them that they are not doing the right thing. <Col N="1959" /> Remember that Germany built up her industries because her banks invested their money in those industries. Not alone did they invest money in them and keep them going until they became remunerative, taking the entire expense and trouble of financing them in the initial stages, but they actually borrowed money from abroad for that purpose, and they borrowed that money by pledging their own assets.</P>
    <P>This is a very technical point, and I am not an expert, but I wish that somebody, like the Minister for Agriculture, who knows all about these banks, would tell us what is the precise position with regard to the marketing of these certificates of charge in the foreign investments market.  I say that they can never become a security which would realise the same return as the Irish banks themselves could have realised if they were prepared to extend over their liquid assets the same kind of certificate of charge as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is now proposing to do.  I say that the difficulty that you have about the security of land&mdash;the difficulty of selling out farms&mdash;will reflect itself in the foreign markets in the dealings which the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have with the London discount and clearing houses.  There will be a difficulty there, and you would need some intermediate organisation to step in. It might not be so bad if the banks had a national attitude in this matter, if they were really out, as the English banks are, to make a success of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They are not.  It might make a difference if they were.  The fact is that you have either to get deposits or cheap money, or you have got to get the Irish banks to do their duty by transferring their deposits, by means of some system of negotiation, in order to make their liquid assets and their deposits available as further backing for the Corporation in its transactions in the foreign market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister <Col N="1960" /> for Agriculture, replying on the Vote for Agriculture, gave us a lecture on practical things, and advised the Opposition to come down to facts and to forget about oaths and constitutions. Now when we come to a practical thing he scorns all criticism, and he says that we have no right to criticise this Bill at all. Previously, when there was a Bill to amend the original Act, he told us that there were only five people in Europe who knew anything about the vagaries of credit.  Apparently those are the people who whispered to him that it would be unbusiness-like or wrong for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to take deposits. He told us, further, that the Chair ruled out all discussions on the matter of credit and that we are debarred from discussing that very important subject.  If that were so, we might as well close this House, because it would be nothing else but a talking shop, and appoint three commissioners, nominated by the bankers, to run the country.  Deputy Derrig asked who were the masters &mdash;the bankers or this Assembly&mdash; and it would seem from the hole-and-corner way in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation is doing its business that the bankers are the bosses.  As far as I can see, the chief achievement of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was to give jobs to the defeated candidates of the Farmers' Party for their support of the Government.</P>

      <P>I suppose on account of the ruling of the Chair it would be better for me to leave them in peace.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation deals with the question of credit for agriculture, and as we all know, agriculture is the principal industry in the country.  If this Agricultural Credit Corporation is to achieve anything it must act with broader vision.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that the Corporation had lent half a million of money.  I question the accuracy of that figure.  It may have sanctioned the lending of half a million of money, but I do not think it lent that amount.  Even if it lent half a million of money, if we analyse the assets of the joint stock banks, and assume that at least half of these assets are loans for agricultural purposes, we find that these run into millions of money, and we see that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is only jobbing at it.  Of course there were all kinds of legal barriers put up.  I know one case where a widow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that this lady went to about £15 expense to prove title, but as she had only a life interest her application for a loan had to be turned <Col N="1962" /> down.  We have an attempt here to tear up the original Act, and to try to put it on a proper basis.  I submit that on the Second Reading of this Bill we should have the right to criticise the Agricultural Credit Corporation in its working, and to suggest how it should be worked to meet the situation it was supposed to deal with.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that deposits would be no good to the Corporation. He said deposits were for long term loans.  I ask the Minister if any loan for agricultural purposes is anything but a long term loan? A farmer goes into a bank and gets a four months' bill but he renews that bill for years.  Beyond paying the interest at frequent intervals it is a long term loan.</P>
      <P>Irish banks find their deposits very useful.  We know that bankers contend that 10 per cent. is enough to keep in hands to meet any demand. We contend that if the Agricultural Credit Corporation, spread throughout the country as the principal credit institution, did banking business in the orthodox fashion, and if it was given the fiduciary issue given to the joint stock banks at 1½ per cent., then it would work on a bigger margin than one per cent.  We who may be unorthodox on these things want to know why a fiduciary issue should be given to one credit institution and not to another, or if it is right that the State should lend to one credit institution a note issue at one and a half per cent., while another State institution should have to go to the original party and borrow that at five per cent.  Why not pass the issue direct to it and let it have the same benefit?  Of course we know that in all these things the bankers' word is final.  The bankers' nominees on the Agricultural Credit Corporation say that what is practicable for the ordinary banks in impracticable for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an example, however, in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia which, when it was set up, got in actual cash £10,000.  It has spread all over the Commonwealth owing to <Col N="1963" /> being able to receive deposits.  That Bank had never to call on the Federal Government for anything more than that £10,000, and now it has branches all over the Commonwealth and is the principal financial institution in Australia.  It is not a theoretical Bank.  What is true of that Bank could be true of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  When I hear the Minister for Agriculture saying that nobody knows anything about this question of credit unless what the Minister has learned I begin to ask what was Griffith, whom the people opposite glorify, writing all those years about banking?  If he was right all those we are suggesting, how is it all these suggestions have now become so silly and so nonsensical?</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out&mdash;I cannot recall his exact words&mdash;that land should be a commercial commodity, capable of realisation.  He is the one Deputy who says that it is absolutely right that the farmers of Ireland, who have been fighting for fifty years to establish fixity of tenure, should be sold out, so that every expeeler and ex-pensioner can buy them out, after they had sustained the fight for Irish nationality.  Well, here is one Deputy who stands behind the Irish farmers.  They are not always such a pack of wasters as the practical people opposite suggest. They have to work hard every day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig dealt with the question of a composition, or of the writing down of the debts due by farmers to present valuation.  At present we have going on what one might call a squeezing-out process. The farmers hold on, but the land annuities and local taxation pile up. The land is derelict and because of an Act passed in this House, no one can take it.  Eventually, when the land is sold, even in a free market, it does not realise sometimes one-third of the debts.  We have this long-drawn out process, and land that could be utilised for production is lying fallow, because of the stupidity of <Col N="1964" /> the joint stock banks.</P>
    <P>We say that there should be a general national policy of writing-down these debts to present valuation, and a fresh financing of farmers who are in such sore straits. That is not due to slackness or negligence on their part.  As we know, they bought land when they did not know what was going to happen. It was the bankers who called the tune of deflation, and when they called the tune they should be the people to pay.  It would be of great benefit to the country if there was a writing-down of these debts, so that the farmers might get on with their occupation.  If this Agricultural Credit Corporation is going to be a success it has got to get out of the hole and corner in Merrion Square, come into the main street, spread its branches all over the country, and carry out a national policy of credit, a policy in sympathy with the country and with its needs.  You will have amending Acts here ad infinitum unless you legislate in such a way that this Credit Corporation will become, in every sense, a proper State institution for the financing of agricultural credit in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very eagerly to the speech of the Minister for Finance, and was rather hopeful that some word of encouragement would come from him as regards the better working of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The whole burden of his speech appeared to me to be a justification for the Bill in so far as it proposes to give powers for increasing the capital of the Credit Corporation.  The principal reason he advanced for the Bill was that the margin of profit of one per cent. on the working of the Credit Corporation was very small, that the present capital of half a million was in reality so small that the margin of profit might possibly lead to dangerous consequences, and that from the financial point of view the country might find itself in difficulties. That was the one point that was brought forward very forcibly in the Minister's speech.  I could not see, in the Minister's speech, any <Col N="1965" /> hope for a betterment in the conditions of the people who look to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for some form of redress.  Following him we had the Minister for Agriculture, who emphasised very strongly that the Credit Corporation was a commercial body.  Any attempt on the part of Deputies to suggest that it had failed to provide terms to meet the ordinary requirements of some sections of the people was, in the Minister's view, all skillywash.  The important factor was that this was a commercial body.  The same might be said of the joint stock banks and of various other kinds of financial institutions in the country.  They are all business and commercial undertakings, but the people who control them do not go out on the hill-tops and emphasise that.  They carry on their business without making that factor the predominant note at all their meetings.  If that is the big factor&mdash;that this is a commercial body &mdash;that the Minister for Agriculture wishes to emphasise, will he explain, when he is asking the security of the State to back it, how, when it enters into competition with the other commercial bodies such as joint stock banks, it is to have any hope of dealing with that section of the community that, in many instances, these joint stock banks and other commercial institutions have refused to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commercial undertaking that the Minister speaks of will have to borrow from the joint stock banks at five per cent and lend money at six per cent.  The joint stock banks that lend money to it will, in the first instance, have been able to get that money themselves at the rate of from one and a half to three per cent., or perhaps slightly over three per cent.  Is not the Minister placing himself and this State in the position of a man who deals in a secondhand commodity?  Is not this commercial undertaking, that he emphasised so strongly, in the same position as a person who has a huxter's shop down the country, who buys his goods in the nearest town from the big man in that town, and re-sells them to the people in the immediate locality in which he resides? <Col N="1966" /> I think, if this commercial undertaking, on which the Minister laid so much emphasis, was a really sound financial and commercial undertaking that he would not have needed to emphasise the fact so much.  Another point which the Minister for Agriculture looked eagerly for information and enlightenment upon was: how he was to deal with a set of people down the country&mdash;farmers&mdash; who are now in the position of what is known as &ldquo;down and outs.&rdquo; Since a lot of these farmers are to be found in the West of Ireland and in the congested areas, I suggest to the Minister that the first advance to be made in meeting the position of the &ldquo;down and out&rdquo; farmer is to remove from the statute book a law that was passed in the Dáil a few years ago.  The Minister for Agriculture was, I suppose, primarily responsible for the passing of that law.  It was sanctioned by the other representatives in the Dáil at the time.  The Minister's first advance should be to remove that penal code which has put the &ldquo;down and out&rdquo; farmer permanently on the run, which has placed a ban on his position and which has left him for all time, as far as legislation can do it, a &ldquo;down and out.&rdquo;  Remove from your legislation a law that prevents the farmer who now finds himself a &ldquo;down and out&rdquo; from utilising his land in any way that he can utilise it.  The first thing to be done is to remove that penal enactment.  The legislation which was passed a few years ago, and to which I am referring, was, in effect, a notice to quit to the farmer. If the Minister takes steps to remove that penal enactment, then he will be taking the first important step in the way of dealing with the &ldquo;down and out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A very important factor to be borne in mind by a person or a body which has to deal with applications for loans is, not always the assets that the borrower puts forward as security for a loan, but rather the character of the person seeking the loan, his ability, and his will to make good.  The personal qualities of the applicant count more, perhaps, in transactions of this sort than the <Col N="1967" /> amount of assets he may have in the way of land or live stock.  As far as I can see, the only office which the Agricultural Credit Corporation has is its head office here in Dublin. Therefore, what prospect has it of getting in touch with, and taking advantage of, what I have described as the essential qualities in a borrower. It will have no means of making inquiries to ascertain whether or not a prospective borrower is possessed of those qualities and has the ability to make good.  I do not know what system the Credit Corporation has at its disposal for dealing with that important factor. If the Minister wants to deal with the &ldquo;down and out&rdquo; farmer he will have to find ways and means of getting in personal touch with him.  He will have to find ways and means of getting to know the personal qualities of the &ldquo;down and outer.&rdquo;  That is a first essential if there is to be any prospect of assisting him by commercial loans.  I suggest that if the Minister was anxious to provide ways and means of helping those people, whom he sees no prospect under present conditions of reaching, he could easily find them.  He has at his disposal the experience of other Departments of the State which dealt with the same class of people in these localities some years ago.</P>
    <P>The old Congested Districts Board had a scheme for lending money to farmers in the West of Ireland.  That is a very important factor&mdash;that the experience gained in that way is available.  The old Congested Districts Board lent money to farmers for their farms.  These were farmers who had no great interest in their holdings.  They were farms that had first been divided up by the Congested Districts Board and then apportioned out to the new holders. The interest of the incoming tenant farmer in these holdings was naturally very small compared with that of a farmer who had been in possession of his holding for a great number of years.  These men had no money to purchase stock.  The Congested Districts Board, under their <Col N="1968" /> scheme for lending money to these men, placed them in the position of being able to purchase cattle.  In addition, they had a scheme of insurance for cattle.  During all the years in which this scheme was carried on with great advantage to the farmers, the Congested Districts Board did not lose one penny that they lent to them.  An important fact to be emphasised in connection with it is that not alone was the scheme of insurance carried out by the Congested Districts Board years ago a safeguard for the money they lent to the farmers, but what is more important still, it proved, on its own basis, a financial success.  There is no use in the Minister for Agriculture trying to rid himself of responsibility for his neglect, or of the inability of the Credit Corporation to meet the wants of the ordinary small farmer in the West of Ireland or elsewhere by questions across the floor of this House, such as &ldquo;Will you show me how it is to be done.  This is a commercial undertaking, and that is the be-all and end-all of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture is right in saying he has employed the greatest experts in the world in connection with his efforts in the direction of the formation of the Agricultural Credit Corporation he is quite entitled to make that statement.  I presume he did employ expert persons, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.  If the Minister had it in his mind to found a scheme of credit that would be primarily commercial, and after years of successful working show a strong balance to credit, then, no doubt, the work of the experts may bear fruit; but if the object, on the other hand, of the experts who examined into and recommended this scheme was that the farmers should benefit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, then I can tell the Minister that the farmers of Leitrim, who do not claim to be financial experts, will tell him that the scheme to provide money for their requirements has been a colossal failure.  I suggest in all seriousness that there is no Act which requires amendment so much as the Agricultural Credit <Col N="1969" /> Corporation Act.  There has been no measure introduced that has been such a complete fiasco.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of conditions in the West.  If the Minister wants to improve those conditions he will have to come down to the ordinary small requirements and the ways and means of the people of the congested areas.  Without in the first instance coming into touch and acquiring personal knowledge of the applicants, there is no hope of making things better for the people in those areas.  Efforts have been made from time to time by the I.A.O.S. to establish credit societies, and in that way to get a better understanding amongst the people themselves, and a stronger sense of their responsibility of what business in a general way means and what credit and financial transactions mean.  Unfortunately, in the past the I.A.O.S., possibly with the best intentions in the world but with no business experience, made so many serious failures that they have made themselves unpopular.  They have antagonised the people, and that has interfered with the efforts of the society.  A good deal of spade work will have to be done before the people's confidence will be secured again.  I am satisfied no other course will have the same effect, or reach the same ultimate end, and do as much good as the extension of credit societies all over the country.</P>
    <P>If the State were to give the same guarantee to the local depositors who lodge their money with the local credit societies, as they now give to those who invest their money in the Agricultural Credit Corporation, there would be no difficulty in getting as much capital as the Corporation would require at a rate of interest of 3½ or 4 per cent., and get it on terms of a guarantee deposit of from three to five years.  I have experience enough of local conditions and the sums of money saved and the conditions under which that money is invested, and the length of period for which depositors are prepared to loan.  By such an arrangement and linking up the societies with headquarters in Dublin who <Col N="1970" /> would take charge of the deposits and bigger transactions, leaving the credit societies to transact business to the extent of £15 or £20, small loans of that sort, they would be able to get the considered opinion of local people as to the personal character of those who apply for loans and their ways and means.  That appears to me quite a simple and feasible proposition. If the Minister followed the experience gained by the Congested Districts Board in its operations in the West of Ireland, he would be going in the right direction, and it would prove to him that the granting of loans to farmers and the work of local credit societies could be carried out very effectively if the State is prepared to give the necessary support and sympathy.  As I have said, if the object of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is merely their financial success, then they have no justification in coming to this House and asking the guarantee of this State for funds for the operations of such a Corporation.  If, on the other hand, they tackle the problem in the proper way, and put as a first essential meeting the requirements of farmers, if that is their primary consideration, then they need have no hesitation in coming to this House and asking for the fullest support and assistance, and they will be sure of receiving it, and with such an object the condition of the farmers in the Free State would be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aird</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill. To my mind, it is a very important measure, for it deals with agriculture, which is our main industry. Everything produced in the country comes, directly or indirectly, from the soil.  Credit at the present time is one of the most perplexing and pressing problems with which one could deal.  Various factors have operated in the recent past against credit.  There were high prices for farming produce for a few years, but a slump in the prices for cattle, produce and land came in 1921.  The farmer who borrowed heavily, especially for land, lost most of his money. When those who lent the money <Col N="1971" /> tried to realise they found there was a great difficulty in doing so, and that they had not the security in land they thought they had.  They found that land was not a liquid asset.  The Banking Commission which sat in 1926 made recommendations with regard to the setting up of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. That Corporation was brought into being for the purpose of loaning money to farmers for the purchase of stock, seed and manures, to drain their lands and improve their buildings.  The first year they were to give £500,000.  Personally, I thought that amount small, and that the Government might be more generous and extend it to £1,000,000, and lend it for a few years, at a low rate of interest, until such time as farming became stabilised.  I do not think they could lend it for nothing. They cannot get free money.  They have to buy money in the world's market, and they cannot get it at less than five per cent.  Consequently, there is no use in talking of cheap money.  This Bill is an extension of the Acts of 1927 and 1928. The principal provision of this measure is to facilitate the Agricultural Credit Corporation in advancing money to men in connection with lands not registered.</P>
      <P>What is holding up the Corporation at present, I understand, in connection with a good many applications is that in the Land Act of 1923 there is a section which gives absolute power almost to the Land Commission to take even a small holding from a farmer.  Consequently, if the Credit Corporation lent money to a tenant farmer, and if the Land Commission wanted to acquire the land for increasing or consolidating an estate adjoining for some purpose which they thought was in the interests of the community, or for the benefit of small holders, the Corporation would have a charge upon it, so that neither would know what was the position.  However, this Bill gives power to the Corporation to take a mortgage from that particular tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> Reference was made by some Deputies to &ldquo;down-and-outs.&rdquo;  There are, of course, a good number of these.  In some cases it is their own fault, but in the case of others they have been unfortunate and have borrowed money, and have lost money.  Some of them have not made up their minds to change from one system of farming to another.  In many cases farmers have not changed their outlook to meet the changed conditions in marketing, etc.  Very often they are slow to change from one system to another. It is a very difficult problem, because profits have been so small in farming recently, and it is not easy to blame them for being slow to change.  If they adopted a different system of farming, and if, for instance, in tillage areas they went in more for dairying, I believe it would pay them.  I agree with the Minister for Agriculture when he says that if in the tillage areas they went in more for dairying it would be better for the farmers in general, because it would lead to an improvement in live stock and to increased tillage.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister is that some provision should be made for giving credit to barley producers.  Barley comes in in October and November, and it is sold within three or four weeks.  Last year it was practically sold within a fortnight.  There is only one market for it at present, and that is the maltster.  The output of the maltster at present is only about 40 per cent. of what it was in 1914.  There should, therefore, be some credit provided for barley growers to enable them to retain their barley for three or four months so as to carry them into the spring.  They might then be able to find a market for their barley in non-growing barley districts.  People fail to appreciate the value of barley as a feeding stuff.  Barley is considered by many people to be as good for stock feeding as maize, although there was a difference last year of about £4 per ton between the price of barley and the price of maize.  For that reason I should like if some provision were made whereby loans <Col N="1973" /> could be made to barley growers to tide them over a period of three or four months, until such time as they could dispose of their crop.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the system of credit in Germany and the fact that the Government was behind the farmers there.  I do not know anything about that, but in Belgium there is a big co-operative system amongst the farmers themselves. Probably the farmers there have more trust in each other than they have over here.  After the war the farmers in Belgium established a co-operative system amongst themselves which has gradually increased year by year until it has now assumed enormous dimensions.  I believe their capital is now something like seventy or eighty millions&mdash;or some big figure, at any rate.  I do not believe we could ever get as far as that in this country.  As I say, they have probably more trust in each other than we have here.  I know it has been found very difficult to make a success of the credit societies here. In some cases they have been successful, but, on the whole, I would think they have not been.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I should like to see the Government, if they possibly could, being more generous with the Credit Corporation, and the Corporation loosening themselves up a little and not holding so hard and fast to title and small points like that as they have been doing.  I might cite the case of a farm which has changed hands on three different occasions within the last fifteen or sixteen years.  On each occasion a loan was given to the purchaser of the farm.  The title was vouched by the law agent of the bank concerned. The title was also vouched by the solicitor acting for the purchaser. In that case, although a loan has been sanctioned by the Credit Corporation for over twelve months, the loan has not yet been given.  I believe it is being held up by some very small point as to whether a certificate has been got showing that the estate duties have been paid.  I do not believe that was ever required before by any of the law agents of the banks who advanced <Col N="1974" /> the money when the land was being sold.  For that reason, I should like to see these small points waived, so as not to hold up the giving of loans which would be very useful to farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate closes, it should be made clear to the Minister for Agriculture that nobody on this side wants the Corporation to lend money without proper security.  I think the Minister very well understands that.  He seemed to be in the mood to misrepresent anyone who had a word to say in criticism of the Corporation, and, for that reason, he slipped into the error of accusing Deputy Ryan of advocating that money should be advanced to farmers who had not proper security.  I would remind the Minister that there has been no opportunity to discuss agricultural credit this Session up to this.  The other day, when the matter was mentioned on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, the Minister himself stated that he would be shortly introducing a Bill which would provide an opportunity for discussion.  The problem of the bankrupt farmer is a credit problem &mdash;at least one is entitled, without making a big mistake, to call it a credit problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Ryan spoke for that very large number of farmers he was not surely, by implication, suggesting that they should be given money on the same terms as a farmer who could provide ordinary security.  I do not know whether the Minister has observed, with regard to the bankrupt farmers, that while there is no provision for them to get credit under this Bill or any Act, they are going to be made to pay for the credit of the prosperous farmers. That is rather an extraordinary situation, and that is why I asked the question: what this is going to cost the State?  It is obviously going to cost the State a certain amount. The bankrupt farmer will have to pay the subsidy, grant or gratuity, whatever it may be, in his taxes on sugar, liquor or anything else you like, and I think that creates a <Col N="1975" /> rather unfair situation.  Even the Minister himself does not go so far as to state that all the bankrupt farmers are bankrupts through their own fault.  He did not say all; he said a certain number.  We agree. There are a certain number of farmers not bankrupt through their own fault, and I think they have a very serious grievance, indeed, through this measure.  While there is still the admission that we cannot do anything for them, they will have to pay out in helping their brother farmers to get credit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is rather an extraordinary situation, and I think the House should not decide, as far as that fairly large class is concerned, that nothing can be done until at least a Commission or some body set up specially to examine their position, has reported that there is no possible way of helping them except at an expense which the country cannot afford.</P>
    <P>A country with a very small population can hardly afford to ignore any class like that, many of them very industrious, respectable people, who cannot get on their feet because of the trials they have been subjected to.  I suggest the Minister should give a promise that their cases will be looked into before long.  I am sure if a small committee, or commission, was set up it could make a suggestion with regard to them.  It could examine the problem and inform the country whether it must face for a long time ahead the spactacle of a large number of farms in the country, covering some of the best of land, with big buildings going to decay, land unused, and all this trouble about the failure to pay annuities and rates persisting.  I think if people properly understood the very big loss these farmers mean to the State in their present circumstances they would insist that some inquiries should be made into it.  Of course I have no idea of the amount of time spent upon it.  It may be that the Minister had had such a commission appointed privately, and if he has had, I should be glad if he <Col N="1976" /> would say so.  I am more inclined to think that on account of the pressure of other work no more than a limited amount of time has been given to this problem.  There are two or three questions on which I would like more information before the debate closes.  With regard to the creamery scheme, so far as we are advised it is working pretty harshly in some ways, in that the best farmers are required to furnish securities.  Farmers who have no mortgage on their lands and whose farms are absolutely good security are required to provide personal guarantors before they get a loan from the Corporation; they have to give the names of two people to guarantee them.  That seems to be an extraordinary situation, and I would be surprised if it is one that is going to help the Corporation to get on.  So far as I have heard, it is not a popular feature of the creamery scheme, and I suggest that it might well be looked into.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give some explanation as to why creameries in existence for many years, well-established and having no big debts, cannot get loans for rebuilding through the Corporation. I heard of three recently that are paying seven per cent. on loans to the ordinary banks.  They are well-established creameries and, I think, were prepared to offer the usual joint and several security of a certain number of their members.  Two of these were in the County Monaghan, and another was in the South of Ireland.  There may be some explanation for it; if so, I would like to hear it.  The Minister was rather hard to-day upon farmers who will not go to the trouble of taking out administration.  Has it occurred to him that many farmers cannot afford that cost?  And has it occurred to him that it would be worth while making the cost of administration cheaper?  To a great many people the cost is prohibitive, and I know a case at the present moment where administration is not taken out simply because the person whose duty it was to take it out could not <Col N="1977" /> afford to do it; it would be depriving somebody else of money due.</P>
    <P>Then there is a further question with regard to the Corporation and its dealings.  It appears that all certificates of charge and other public issues will be guaranteed by the Government.  Is it the case that the Corporation will not have to borrow for short terms?  Will there not be any transactions between the Corporation and the banks or such institutions as discount houses?  and will these be guaranteed by the Government?  It is not, perhaps a very important question, but it is well, I think, that we should understand all about the Corporation before this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financing of the Corporation, it appears to some of us it would be worth while now, since the Corporation is a trading body, that they should go out after certain good business the same as the banks. There are ever so many farmers in the country who could do with new out-offices and improvements of their dwelling-houses, and who are in a rather good position to offer security for long term loans.  Through timidity, conservatism or some other cause, they do not have these improvements effected.  If the Corporation is to be a live institution, competing with other banks, I do not see why it should not have an organiser to go out after that business.  It surely would be worth while to the Corporation to get business of that kind instead of having to depend on the broken reeds that seem to be the major part of their customers at the present time.  In that connection it must be remembered that the banks have shown no hesitation in striking out in competition with a State institution, the Post Office Savings Bank.  In recent years nearly all the banks have gone in for thrift accounts and for attracting small depositors, although they knew that the Post Office was established in this business and that it had heretofore been regarded as a State preserve. There is no reason, therefore, why the Corporation should not enter into competition with the banks with regard to the big accounts and try to <Col N="1978" /> meet the banks on their own ground. It is very generally reported throughout the country that the banks are now endeavouring to get in touch with people who are thinking of borrowing from the Corporation. If these people are good accounts they are prepared to offer the money on the same terms as the Corporation, or even at less in some cases.  It appears evident then that the Corporation cannot afford to lie down under its problems, but that it will have to go out and show it is alive.</P>
    <P>It seems a regrettable thing that the Dáil has to admit that notwithstanding the very big problem in front of it, it can do nothing in regard to the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Numbers of farmers and others throughout the country are lending money to the banks at 2½ per cent., while other farmers with the best security can only borrow money at 6 per cent.  It seems a pitiable thing that the Dáil has to admit that we can do nothing to lessen that difference. That is a thing which we have, apparently, to accept for our generation, and we are told no amount of thinking on our part will improve it.  It seems to me to be the position, so far as I can understand it, that, even though the State is engaged in banking to some extent and even though it knows that millions of pounds are deposited in the banks at a low rate, it can do nothing to overcome the problem of getting hold of that money so that it may be lent on more generous terms than the Agricultural Credit Corporation is at present prepared to lend it.  I think that a remedy for it will be found in time, but at present it is very regrettable that the Government have nothing to purpose in regard to it.  I think that they cannot be too confident, despite the Minister's statement that he looks forward to this being a most successful institution&mdash; I think that the Minister knows too much about the profits in agriculture at present to be satisfied that farmers are going to do well with this money and that it is perfectly safe for them to borrow money at <Col N="1979" /> such a high figure.  I think that the Minister can hardly be satisfied that it adds to the security of the country or that there is absolute certainty that all these debts will be repaid. We hope that they will be repaid.  It is our desire to see the Corporation a very big success, and I cannot imagine what possessed the Minister to say that we opposed the Bill last year.  He had no grounds for that assertion, as there was not a word of opposition spoken on the Bill last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing that gives this side of the House so much pleasure as when the Minister for Agriculture starts abusing us, because we know that he is simply doing what the lawyer always does when he has a bad case.  Of course, he made a historic speech yesterday which will go down to future generations and be known as the whiskey speech, a speech in which he asserted one of these maxims of political science which escaped Bentham, namely, that whiskey is better than politics.  When dealing with the Agricultural Credit Corporation one would have expected that the Minister would have been in a more sensible mood, as he was yesterday on the Forestry Estimate, when he showed certain glimmerings of common sense mixed with large doses of bluff.  When he came to deal with the Agricultural Credit Bill he showed that he was suffering from a kind of invincible ignorance, because he pointed out most of the defects of the previous Bill.  We pointed out on that occasion that what was wanted was a link which would establish real agricultural credit.  The mistakes that the banks made were, as we pointed out, lending on what might be called raw material, mere title, lending on mere land.  What is really wanted is the granting of loans upon the prospect of success.  Credit could not be administered without having men with expert knowledge of farming, so that they would know where these loans should be given, not merely on title, which is often complicated&mdash;this Bill is a good example <Col N="1980" /> of the difficulty of getting over questions of title.</P>
      <P>That is not the way to make a success of agricultural credit.  What you want is to do what is done in Germany, where you have schoolteachers who know the farmers, and others who are likely to make a success of farming, and also those who would probably turn out to be duds. You should either have that system or the system which they have in Denmark, where men make a career of being successful experts in credit. Although the Minister has been reminded of these things, he is absolutely determined that he is not going to open his mind to what is being done in other European countries.  The result is the Irish farmer is placed at a great disadvantage compared even with the English farmer, who is going to be de-rated, and in England credit societies will get free credit from the Government.  In Ireland, we are sticking to the terms of usury.  We are absolutely bound up with the five and six per cent.  There is no attempt on the part of the Minister to assert different principles of economy for Ireland different to that prevailing in England.  There is no attempt to get away from the banks in Ireland.  Even in England, bankers, such distinguished men as Sir Reginald McKenna, have demanded time after time to have a real inquiry into the question of credit and the control of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country one would imagine that a Government which claims to be the successor of the Government which started the Land Bank, would have tried to assert principles which would put Ireland and the farmers' interests first in the matter of credit, and put such interests before the interests of those who established a rate of five per cent.  These are people interested in financial transactions in London and, apparently, we must follow in the wake of different sets of interests which are neither Irish nor on a footing similar to that of the producer on the land.  It is really on these two cardinal issues that I am afraid the Credit Corporation is not going to <Col N="1981" /> succeed.  I admit that I made severe criticism of the Corporation on the previous occasion.  I confess it, and I am sorry that my statement has come true.  I wish that it had not come true.  We must pay attention to the two fundamental things which form the whole basis of credit and we must have a real inquiry into it. Canada is ahead of us in this matter and has had such inquiry.  Australia is also ahead of us, and there they have a bank which has been referred to&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank.</P>
    <P>It is not yet too late for the Minister, if it is psychologically possible for him, to open his mind and take up a different attitude, and to set up a proper inquiry into the whole question of credit rather than to consult the bankers, whose interest is to keep things as they are.  The Minister should set up an inquiry which will lead somewhere to the advantage of farming in Ireland.  Fifty per cent. of the farms in Ireland are of £10 valuation, and under, and 90 per cent. are of £50 valuation and under. We are dealing all the time with small farmers.  Unless the Minister is going to justify every charge made against him&mdash;that what he wants to do is to change the whole system of farming by sweeping away the small farms and leaving only farms of 200 acres&mdash;he must change his whole attitude and policy in regard to agricultural credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy (Tipperary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make an appeal to the Minister in regard to a certain type of farmer who makes application to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan.  This type of farmer has incurred debts in the bank for land purchased in recent years at exorbitant prices, at a time when land was at its highest price.  These lands are now derelict and are left without stock.  That is a serious loss to the nation as a whole, because the lands are producing neither food nor wealth.  Those farmers are in difficulties through no fault of their own, because they are most enterprising and industrious, and would continue to be so if they got any assistance to <Col N="1982" /> help them work and stock their lands.  If we are to survive as a nation we must produce all the food possible from the land, as we are mainly dependent on agriculture. Up to the present the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been very slow in giving loans.  At least, that has been my experience in some cases.  I have found a few cases in which farmers made applications for loans and were kept waiting months before getting them.  It is very disappointing to them when they cannot get loans at the time at which they require them to buy stock.  I have known cases where queries of a very simple nature delayed the loan for a considerable time.  Farmers like to buy stock in the spring time of the year, and it would be of much more advantage to them to get a loan at that period than when cattle are fetching higher prices.  It would be much more profitable to them if they could get a loan at a suitable time.  Certain of these farmers, as I have pointed out, bought their land at exorbitant prices some years ago.  The value of that land has decreased to a considerable extent, and the lands have been stripped of stock and left almost derelict.  That is not due to any fault on the part of the farmers themselves, as they are most industrious.  If they got any help or encouragement I am sure they would work those farms to the best advantage and to the benefit of the community as a whole.  I hope the Minister will consider the case of those farmers favourably, in the matter of granting loans.</P>

      <P>So many points have been raised that it is not possible to take them all seriatim.  I will deal with one or two.  The question of the man who is down and out is.  I think, bound up with the possibility of forming local credit societies.  I think the man who is down and out can only be dealt with if his neighbours who know his character are prepared to pledge their own credit in some way on his behalf.  I do not see that any big body such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="1983" /> could directly do anything for him. They cannot distinguish between the man who is down and out through no fault of his own, through misfortune, and the man who is down and out because of his own fault, and they cannot consequently directly touch on his case at all.  One of the main functions of the local credit society would be to deal with such a man and with the man whose requirements would be very small.  It is very difficult to get these local credit societies going.  It might be possible to build up a system of local credit societies, but so far the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which has given an amount of time and energy to them, has had no success with them.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to tell us that they do great work in other countries.  We all know that.  Perhaps because of the different histories of those countries it seems to be easier to get them working there. Anybody knows that there is nothing in existance at present here in the way of local societies which corresponds to the efforts put into organising for many years past.  I know of one or two which have a fairly long existence and which have done, and which continue to do, good work, but in all the other cases that I have heard of, the success is due to one or two special individuals who are not only of high character but who have courage and perseverance to settle into this work and who do it, not only in its pleasant aspects, but in its unpleasant aspects, men who are not merely willing to help individuals by grants but who are willing to refuse when refusal is necessary, and who apply pressure for repayment when pressure is necessary.  Sometimes you get people who are willing to do all the work except applying pressure for repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many of these societies, started in the past, did reasonably well for a period and then collapsed. People do not readily take to them at the moment.  I believe that some steps must be taken in that direction, because there are classes of people <Col N="1984" /> who should be given credit who can only be found and who can only be isolated from those who seem to be like them on the surface but who do not deserve credit, by these local societies.  Creamery societies might deal with a large number of people, not merely with the bigger farmer, but also with comparatively small farmers.  I believe the creamery scheme is a good scheme.  There are one or two points that Deputies mentioned with which I am not familiar and which I could not answer, but I am satisfied that it is a good scheme. So far, however, very few creameries have been willing to take it up.  Out of about 400 creameries only ten or eleven have taken up the creamery scheme.  The reason some of them have given for refusing to take up the scheme is that they do not want the responsibility for refusing loans. It is just that very factor that has made the small credit societies a failure.  People do not like that end of the work, the end of refusing loans and also of recovering loans. In the case of the creamery societies recovery would be comparatively simple, because it would be accomplished by means of a deduction from the milk cheque.  We have here a whole barrier of psychology to fight against.</P>
    <P>I do not see that any methods that can be adopted are going to break that down very rapidly.  It can only be broken down, I think, by outcries, by propaganda, by the force of example, when something is done successfully and the people in neighbouring districts take it up. The question of individual creameries who could not get loans for extension or rebuilding is a matter I cannot deal with because it would require a knowledge of the individual cases.  There is not a great deal of money which it would be possible for the Agricultural Credit Society to get on deposit.  If there is anything that the history of the Land Bank proves, it is that a body started like that cannot get the deposits.  Before the Land Bank was sold it was a nightmare, because all sorts of efforts had to be made to <Col N="1985" /> get certain Government funds which could be kept with money in hands, subsidiary funds.  I think the Road Fund was with it and some others, because of that need to maintain liquid cash to meet cheques that might amount in some particular weeks to a very big amount.  I know that from the beginning in the Land Bank, people who were hot about it and advised that branches be started here and there, and spoke in public as if they were tremendous supporters of it, and were supporters in a sense, did not bring along the deposits to any great extent. The keeping of deposits is extremely difficult work.  A body like the Agricultural Credit Corporation can keep very small deposits without branches.  If it sets up branches any advantage you get from deposits is more than lost for a long period.  In fact, great numbers of the joint stock banks' branches do not pay at all.  They are a dead loss to the institution and are only set up because of the excessive competition in the creation of branches which has grown up amongst joint stock banks.  Capital has to be expended on a house; a manager has to be paid a relatively high salary, and two or three other members of the staff have to be maintained.  Travelling and other expenses have to be incurred in connection with the branch.  As a matter of fact a great lot of branches represent a dead loss to the banks which establish them, and very few new branches are otherwise than a loss for a considerable number of years.  I do not know, after a long period of years, as a result of an effort on the part of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to get deposits, that they would not get them, but no help would arise in the early years from that.  There would be no possibility of its getting money on the whole at less than 5.2 per cent. which it looks to get it at.</P>
    <P>The loans that have been made, amounting to something like £110,000, have been well spread over the country.  They are over all counties, but I do not think any information can be given to Deputies <Col N="1986" /> that will carry them very far in that respect.  After all, lending and borrowing are private transactions. Although public money goes to the setting up of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, nevertheless the transactions between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the borrowers are private transactions as between banker and client, and I do not think detailed information can be given to Deputies with regard to them.  As I said, the amount which has been actually lent is £410,000. The amount that is authorised, and will be lent shortly, is £850,000. There has been applied for and under consideration, roughly, £1,500,000. Somebody asked as to what the Bank was costing, what it would cost the public.  As a result of this Bill it will cost £5,000 down.  As I said when introducing the Bill, the full dividend on the A shares would be available out of profits in 1931, and certain dividends on B shares and the amount of interest that will be lost through its not being paid on B shares will run to about £43,000, and that will, if all goes well with the Corporation, ultimately come back by way of bonus payment on the B shares.  This is on the basis of the Corporation being able to get money at 5.2 per cent. and being able to extend the business, as I indicated in the opening statement.</P>
    <P>Of course, there has been a good deal of talk about the alterations. The alterations have been, while numerous, minor alterations.  The main scheme is not affected in any way by this Bill, or by the last Bill. Changes have been made in the law with regard to the giving of charges on a loan.  They were, perhaps, in some respects substantial changes, but they only deal with the outside of the scheme, and so far as any other changes have been made inside they are minor changes.  The changes in this Bill, in the matter of making A and B shares and all that are relatively minor changes.  They simply mean that money is not paid out of the Exchequer and paid back again in the form of dividends.  It practically amounts to that.  The capital is being increased, but that <Col N="1987" /> is not an alteration of the scheme.  I think the scheme is a sound one.  It is the only kind of scheme that can operate here.</P>
    <P>I do not think we could manage an Agricultural Credit Corporation that is directly controlled by a State Department in any way.  I think in that case the difficulty of considering applications on the merits and irrespective of political pressure would be extremely great.  I certainly would not like to face up to the administration of a Bill like that if I were the Minister responsible.  I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture, in the course of the debate, has expressed the same thing.  Political pressure can be resisted, but it is unpleasant, and it is disturbing, and it certainly would be exercised. Everybody, if this were in any way directly controlled by the State, who wanted to borrow would get at representatives, and representatives would be obliged, by the laws of competition, to take up the cases and ask questions about them.  All sorts of things would go on.  I do not think that we could possibly have any other scheme than this.  I do not think again that we can go putting pressure on the banks to lend money to the Corporation at a rate greatly under the market rate.  This is, I gather, what some people suggest.  If the bank will lend it because they see the advantage, well and good, but for us to put pressure on them would have very bad reactions on the general economic outlook of the country.  The same thing applies to any question of forcing the bank to cut down the debts that were owed to them by farmers.  If the State were to come in and force the banks to do this it seems to me not only should farmers' debts be cut down, but apparently farmers' deposits should be cut down.  For the State to intervene in the way Deputy Kennedy suggested it seems to me would have the most damaging reactions. For the bank itself, as a matter of business dealing with a client, to reduce his debt is an entirely different matter.  It is quite <Col N="1988" /> free to do it, and it is a thing which banks habitually do with all sorts of clients.  When clients are in difficulties they perhaps do not think it wise to put them out of business; they take something less than the full amount, and a fresh start is made. Nobody would interfere with that. Some of the things which have been suggested, it seems to me, should not be contemplated at all.  I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation must be managed as nearly as it can be managed on a business basis. Money must be lent at a rate that will be governed by the market rate of money; it must be lent on security. If there are people who have no security of their own to offer, then it can only be lent to them if their neighbours in organised credit societies, or some similar way, gave security for them.  If we once begin to have the need for agricultural credit met by some system of dole there is no end to it.  As a matter of fact, the credit element would be squeezed out, and the dole element would be increased.  I think it is necessary to deal with it right from the beginning as a matter of business. While certain changes have been shown to be necessary in the Bill, and perhaps further changes may yet have to be made, the line on which we have attempted to solve this is, I am convinced, the only line on which it can be solved.  I am satisfied that it will be successful in some respects.  We may, as a result of experience, be able to get along quicker than at the present time.  We may manage to operate successfully branches in which there has been no success.  I see no reason to contemplate any fundamental changes.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that in order to have liquid assets at the disposal of the Land Bank, certain Government funds were placed on deposit.  Would the Minister say that if all Government funds were passed through the Land Bank there would be a different story to tell?  Would the Minister not say if the Agricultural Credit Corporation is open to receive deposits and if all Government funds were passed <Col N="1989" /> through that Corporation that it would make a very big difference?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think it would.  As a matter of fact, after the first National Loan we had very considerable sums for a couple of years to credit.  It was possible, therefore, to make deposits.  Since then the position has not been like that, and it is not likely in the future that we are going to have big sums to the credit of the Exchequer, and the possibility of having subsidiary funds that could be dealt with as cash in hand.  That was an abnormal situation.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of the time when the fruits of the first National Loan were becoming exhausted, it was extremely difficult to find any cash that could be put into the National Land Bank.  The same sort of thing would operate in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Possibly at the moment when the Corporation most needed cash there would be no cash in the hands of the Government to place on deposit there.  I think nothing can be done, therefore, along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three serious criticisms have been made with regard to sub-head A of this Vote.  The first criticism came from <Col N="1990" /> Deputy Lemass, who asked whether it is right that this sum of money should be paid&mdash;£48,000&mdash;to the Great Southern Railway under the 1924 Act, when, as he alleged, the Railway Company was not carrying out the obligation imposed on them under the Act of 1924.  He founded his charges entirely on Section 55 of the Act.  As far as I remember, the contention ran this way, that Section 55 establishes that rates of pay of railway employees shall be regulated in accordance with an agreement made or to be from time to time made between the trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and the railway companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of that section states: &ldquo;The original or a counterpart or a copy certified in such manner as the Minister shall direct to be a true copy of every such agreement as is mentioned in the foregoing subsection shall be deposited with the Minister within one month after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  The Deputy's allegation is, first, if there is an agreement which is not registered under that Act, then there is a dereliction of duty.  I am particular in not saying that it is registered.  There is no positive obligation imposed on me under that section to see that any agreement is lodged with me.  As a matter of fact, I went out of my way by writing both to the Union and to the Companies, and by writing on several occasions, to get all the agreements of which I had any notice, and to get them registered.  If there was an agreement of which I had notice, I think it would be the commonsense view to take it that it was my duty to write and ask why this was not being registered.  But when we come to the MacNeill award, I want to say I did not write and ask for that.  If the MacNeill award had been sent in as an agreement to be registered under this section, I should have to refuse it, because by its very title it will be revealed to anybody who thinks that it is not an agreement. An award of an arbitrator can never be classed as an agreement.  If after the arbitrator had made his award <Col N="1991" /> both parties had accepted it and it was in the hands of the courts and made a sort of rule of court, then it might have been registered.  Further, I asked Deputy Lemass if he thought that this agreement which he felt I should have registered and which he apparently thought was an agreement of the type spoken of here applied to the people concerned.  The Deputy was very careful.  It is a good habit when you do not want to make a case against yourself not to read the section in full.  The Deputy simply said that the wages, etc., of railway employees were offset against shopmen, and shopmen were railway employees.  The third section says: &ldquo;Railway employee means a person who is employed by a railway company in any of the grades specified in the Eighth Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  I wonder does the Deputy know what a shopman is?</P>
    <P>Who briefed him in regard to the contention that he was arguing last night?  Is there anybody who has any knowledge of railway affairs who would say&mdash;or will the Deputy again say after he has thought over this matter&mdash;that the people on whom notices were served and whose cases formed the grounds of his complaint last night, are in any of the grades mentioned in the Eighth Schedule?  They do not form part of the grades mentioned in that Schedule and particularly the people about whom Deputy Lemass was speaking could not have their grievances registered except in so far as under the next section they might hereafter be brought within the scope of the agreement referred to in the section by reason of a further agreement between the parties.  That has not been done.  In so far as the Deputy founded his case for refusing to vote the money to the railway company because they are not carrying out their obligations, and founded that upon the recent notices served on the shopmen and his interpretation of Section 55, the case falls to the ground.  Section 55 bears no relation whatever to the matter and no railwayman could possibly have <Col N="1992" /> advised the Deputy that Section 55 has any relation to shopmen.  If it has, then the MacNeill award could not have been registered.  In fact, no attempt was made to register it. If there had been I should have felt bound to refuse it.  There was no attempt made to register it and it certainly is not my duty to see that any agreements are registered.  Section 55 has no application to the people about whom the Deputy spoke and their cases need not be considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy raised a different point.  He said that notice has been given that certain machinery is to be put an end to.  That is a very serious notice to have issued.  It is a thing to which attention must be given and there will be plenty of time to consider just what the situation is.  The Deputy's plea was to look forward to the chaotic state in which the railways might be plunged if that negotiating machinery was not kept in being.  I do not know what the Great Southern Railways Company's intentions in the matter are.  I do not know if they are going to propose other machinery which might be better.  One has to wait and see how it is going to work out. Deputy Davin's criticisms went on a different line.  He did refer to the same point as Deputy Cassidy, and he took very good care not to refer to the point made by Deputy Lemass, which he realised, I think, as an absurd point. He did seem to be complaining that employees of the Railway Company who had certain compensation granted to them, or at least who had terms on which compensation would be given to them under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, who had terms on which compensation would be given to them under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, were not in fact receiving these terms.  That is a serious allegation to make.  The Deputy says that he knows of cases and could mention individuals who were obviously before his mind when it would be necessary to mention them.  He said he could go into detail and could speak of men with thirty or forty years' service who were notified by 'phone that they could take holidays and at the end of holidays they <Col N="1993" /> would be dismissed and whatever would be given to them would be announced later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And as to brutality, there is no statutory regulation. But if there is breach of agreement, if there are conditions promised to railway employees by this House, and if these conditions are not being observed, then a different situation arises.  If I get a sufficient number of cases to evidence that statement, then I will certainly take the field against the railway company just as previously I took the field against the employees, when I thought they were trying to proceed in a way detrimental to the legislation passed by the Oireachtas. But there must be cases and we must get details.  If the Deputy, or any other Deputy, can give me indications of cases where it is alleged men have to perform certain services, and that they are the type of men whose conditions were envisaged under the Third Schedule, or under the amending legislation, and compensation is not being paid them or the conditions in regard to them are not being carried out, then once I get a sufficient number of such cases to make me believe that there is more in the matter than a mere accidental case cropping up, I will take it up with the railway company in order to see if their conduct is contrary to the Act or deliberate, and if I get that proved we will then proceed to some further action, but it will depend upon the cases if I can get them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-head C is an item of £23,290, representing the annuities contributed to repay advances by the National Debt Commissioners under the Railways (Ireland) Act, 1896, and the Marine Works Act, 1902.  These Acts were passed by the Parliament of the old political unit that was known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  The Railways Act was passed for the purpose of facilitating the construction of certain railway lines in Ireland, and the Marine Works Act was for the purpose of facilitating the construction of certain piers and other marine works in connection with industries in the congested districts.  The amount required to enable these works to proceed was advanced by the British National Debt Commissioners, and was repayable in a certain number of terminable annuities similar to those set out in the note attached to this Estimate.  If the old political unit of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland had remained in existence, there would be no question as to the right of the British National Debt Commissioners to receive these annual payments; but when that unit ceased to exist, and when it was divided into the present units of the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the question as to who was entitled to receive these payments should have arisen for discussion and settlement.  Apparently it has not done so.  I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed us, when we were discussing this matter last year, that probably agreements in connection with financial matters of this kind <Col N="1995" /> were proceeding every week during the existence of the Provisional Government; but at one time, at any rate, we were given to understand that these various financial agreements were codified, if I may use the word, in the document known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement.</P>
      <P>In the statement in this House by the Minister for Finance relating to the payments under the so-called Ultimate Financial Settlement, no reference to these payments occurs. No information was at any time given to the House as to the reason why the full amount of these annuities was being transferred to the British National Debt Commissioners and every attempt which we have made to secure information has not been successful.  It is possible, of course, that it never occurred to the Executive Council in this as in other matters to question the right of the British National Debt Commissioners to receive the money.  We hope, now that the fact is brought to their notice, that they will have a perfectly legitimate claim to part, if not to the whole, of this money, and that they will at least press that claim with the same vigour as the British Government pressed their claim in respect of the coinage settlement recently perpetrated. When the political division between the Irish Free State and the British United Kingdom occurred, one possible arrangement in respect of these payments would have been to have divided the annuities in a certain agreed proportion between both Governments.  That was not done. Instead of that being done, the entire amount of the money is being handed over to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is well that I should at this stage say that it is not, in my opinion, any argument to assert that we have in Ireland the assets which this money was advanced to create.  Money was advanced to the same Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as it was called, by the British National Debt Commissioners to <Col N="1996" /> create similar assets under similar Acts in Great Britain and in Scotland and in Wales.  If the Free State Government thinks that the fact that they possess assets which were created under these Acts in Ireland obliges them to pay the full amount of the annuities due in respect of them to the British National Debt Commissioners they are mistaken and they are entitled to claim some, if not the entire, of the payments which have been made annually to the British National Debt Commissioners.  The fact is, however, that the British Government receives all the money in respect of the assets created, whether these assets exist in Great Britain or in the Irish Free State.  I think the proper attitude which the Free State Government should have maintained in this and in other financial matters was to have retained in the Exchequer of the Irish Free State all the money arising in this matter in the Irish Free State, and should have permitted the British Government, without objection, to retain in its Exchequer the money accruing from British territory. There would have been many international precedents for that action. Instead of doing that, they have never at any time questioned the right of Britain to receive the money and are very meekly and mildly paying it over every year.  Of course, it is only a small item in the financial relationship between the two countries, and a rather inadequate one on which to base a discussion upon the whole so-called Ultimate Financial Settlement, but it helps to understand the attitude of the Executive Council, and it gives us a clearer insight into the weakness which they have displayed in other matters, particularly the matter of the land purchase annuities and the more recent coinage settlement.</P>
    <P>When this matter was discussed last year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce attempted to confuse the issue by making reference to a payment which was made to the Free State railways by the British Government in respect of the period <Col N="1997" /> during which these railways were under Government control.  That payment as the Minister knows quite well, was on an entirely different basis; but even if the financial settlement which he would like to have effected was to bring about a pooling of all the assets and liabilities of the old political unit of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and a fair apportionment between both countries, it is quite obvious there should be a net sum coming to us every year, unless the liabilities of the British Empire exceed its assets, and it was, in fact, at the date of the dissolution of the United Kingdom, a bankrupt concern. As it is, however, we find ourselves paying an undue contribution in respect of the liabilities and generously surrendering all our claims to the assets in order to help the poor, struggling taxpayer of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Free State Government, whether through undue love of the Imperial connection or through mere inability to stand up for what was their obvious legal right, have in this as in other matters inflicted a financial injury upon the Irish people. We ask the Dáil to signify its disapproval of their attitude by adopting this amendment, the effect of which, it is intended, will be to delete the amount payable under this sub-head altogether from the Estimate. The amount is not due.  Even if part of it might become due under a new Ultimate Financial Settlement, the whole of it certainly is not due, and the fact that it is being paid out without question or explanation seems to us to be a matter that merits the disapproval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My case in this matter is very simple.  When the Government of the country was transferred to the Provisional Government, there was certain property which fell into their hands. An agreement was made at that time, and assets and liabilities were taken over with regard to quite a lot of <Col N="1998" /> matters.  It is very easy to pick out one item and say that the assets are not worth very much, and consequently a liability ought not to be incurred.  The assets would refer to such things as Government buildings, and so on.  There was a very good settlement from our point of view. The money was spent in the country, and it cannot be said that a very big annuity had been demanded for it. The country is in possession of some of the assets.  It is in possession of the assets in so far as they are not decayed or have not disappeared by the lapse of time.  The country took over all the assets and took over the liabilities in respect of them.  There was money spent in the country.  It was not extravagantly spent.</P>

      <P>(Cork): I rise because I may be able to throw a little light on the subject with regard to the Marine Works Act.  I was one of a deputation consisting of Mr. T.J. Canty, M.C.C., Clonakilty; Mr. Murphy, M.C.C., Castletownbere, and myself, who were appointed by Cork <Col N="1999" /> Co. Council to proceed to the House of Commons in 1902 to lay before Mr. G. Wyndham, Chief Secretary of Ireland, Sir Antony MacDonnell and Lord Shaftesbury our claim for a share of the £37,000 which was allocated amongst the six congested counties of Ireland.  We succeeded in getting £5,000 out of that sum for a harbour of refuge for the island of <Col N="2000" /> Cape Clear, on condition that the Cork Co. Council contributed £300 out of the rates, which they did. Kerry, Galway and the other congested counties got the balance.  It was very valuable money and was anxiously sought for by us in those days.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give us any information as to the present position in respect of standard charges.  I thought it was intended that the standard charges would have been in operation at the beginning of this year, and that this year would be &ldquo;A&rdquo; year, within the meaning of the Railway Act.  The possibility of having standard charges in operation was undoubtedly prevented by the action of the Railways Company in appealing to the courts from the decision of the Railway Tribunal.  But is there any prospect that standard charges will be in operation next <Col N="2003" /> year, or towards the end of this year, or when are we to expect them? It is now five years since the Railway Act was passed, and as the principal function of that Act was to fix standard charges, and as we have no standard charges yet, I think that the Minister, on a Vote of this kind, should take the opportunity of informing the House as to what the position is.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of this service is essential for the administration and control of our merchant shipping and of other merchant shipping visiting our ports. It is principally concerned with the giving of certificates of fitness and seeing that all the statutory conditions are fulfilled and for our engineers to make sure that seagoing <Col N="2005" /> vessels are fit to carry passengers. Provision is also made to ensure that no contagious disease, or anything like that, prevails on board ships.  Life-saving is controlled by the stations that we have around the coast.  The life-saving service is controlled by an officer in charge of each of the 53 stations that we have.  The other items in the Estimate practically explain themselves.</P>

      <P>There are a great many people in that particular town who are very anxious as the summer advances to ascertain whether any protection is to be given to them before next winter.

    <Title>Question on the Adjournment. - Entertainment Tax on County Cork Concert.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise on the motion for the adjournment the matter dealt with in question No. 2 on to-day's Order Paper.  I am raising the matter because I think the case, taking it all round, has been most unfairly met.  The Committee in in this case was organised for the purpose of doing something to make that particular locality attractive for visitors generally and particularly for visitors going there for the week-end from the city of Cork and other places.  The Committee consists of the parish priest, the curate and six other members who have no financial interest whatever in the undertaking.  The idea of charging them something like £5 16s. tax on a concert which was held for the purpose of raising funds to carry out the object for which the Committee was formed is in my opinion carrying this matter in relation to the entertainment tax too far.  As a matter of fact, practically all the entertainment held in rural districts are more or less of a philanthropic character.  I consider that any entertainment which is organised in a rural district, and which tends to render rural life less burdensome on the rural community, is of a philanthropic character and should not be taxed.  The Revenue Commissioners not only charge this, to my mind, most unfair and unjust tax in the case of this concert, but they went further in the way of piling on the <Col N="2009" /> agony.  When the people who organised the concert returned unsold tickets to the value of £2 9s. 7d. the Revenue Commissioners deducted out of that the sum of 14/11 and retained that for some unknown reason.  The Minister in his reply to-day made the allegation that this money was kept because the tickets returned were not apparently in sequence.  The regulations made enjoin that tickets when sold be torn in two halves.  The fact that the tickets were intact when returned to the Revenue Commissioners proves that they were not sold.  I think that the Revenue Commissioners, in this particular instance, are acting somewhat in the fashion of a Jewman or perhaps something worse&mdash;the part of an extortionate moneylender who goes to look for his last pound of flesh.  I think that some definite steps should be taken in the matter and that something should be done to put an end to this kind of game. The matter has been carried too far, and I would ask the Minister to see that an end is put to it.  I consider that the case has been very unfairly met here.  I think that the Committee have been very unfairly treated in having a tax levied on this concert at all.  The Minister apparently is accustomed to dealing with people who try to trick him out of everything.  That seems to be the assumption on which the Revenue Commissioners are working.  I think that could be gathered from the Minister's statement the other day about the bookmakers when he said that he thought they were most unfair and unjust people.  He follows that up in this instance by his treatment of the people connected with this concert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister could urge that the parish priest or the curate entered into this from any other motive than a philanthropic one.  I am afraid he does not realise that we have some philanthropists down in that district.  As a matter of fact, we have a philanthropist down there who was concerned with this matter, and who was given something like £2,000 from the loyalists' <Col N="2010" /> distress fund in that district during the last few months.  I think that the Minister should look into this matter again and give it fairer consideration than he has given it up to the present.  Apparently, the Revenue Commissioners are instructed to deal with these matters on the supposition that they are dealing with a gang of rogues or vagabonds.  That is the only conclusion anyone could come to from the attitude of the Commissioners in this particular case.  I consider it is adding insult to injury turning around and taking this 14/11 as a tax on unsold tickets which were returned to them, and not torn as specified in the regulations.  That is carrying the matter too far, and the Minister should give it a more sympathetic consideration than he did earlier in the day.  I think those people for whom I am speaking have been unfairly treated.</P>

      <P>If a concert is held in aid of local funds, for the St. Vincent de Paul Society, or any such purpose, there is no question about exemption of tax.  It is allowed without question, but for such a purpose as that for which this concert was held, I think the Commissioners had no option.  I do not think that town improvement could be regarded as a charitable or philanthropic object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same whether it is a town or village.  There can be no question that the Commissioners, on the report of the collector at Cork, were bound to come to the conclusion they did with regard to the question of the 14/11.  It may be that was hard on the Committee, but on matters such as this the Commissioners have to act according to rule. They must have a uniform practice. That practice is that there must be no possibility that tickets which are returned for repayment were actually used.  In the ordinary way the Commissioners assure themselves of that by the fact that they remit on the pad or roll in serial order.  The <Col N="2011" /> person who is giving the entertainment and putting stamps on the tickets should take them off one by one as he requires them, and then what remains will be on the original pad or roll in their proper order.  If that is done they are allowed for them, but where you get a broken series of stamps detached from the roll or pad the possibility exists that they may have been used.  It is not necessary that the Commissioners should be convinced that they have been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual practice in rural districts, especially for a concert of this description, is to give the tickets out in bundles of about a dozen or two for sale in the district. They are usually sold earlier than the date on which the concert is held. You just give two dozen tickets to a person and say &ldquo;Sell those for me.&rdquo; That is why these tickets were not in serial order when they were sent back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If they came down and found that the tickets were not torn could not they prosecute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that these tickets were not torn shows that they were all right when returned. If not they could prosecute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not actually follow.  The Commissioners have to act on some general rule which would apply everywhere.  Otherwise, there <Col N="2012" /> is bound to be grave dissatisfaction. They have this rule which has been adopted to prevent the possibility of tickets being used and not torn&mdash;of somebody collecting the tickets and holding them.  That might happen. The Commissioners have adopted the rule of accepting back only those which remain on the original pad. They might, at their discretion, if there were a strong case, vary that rule, but a strong case would need to be made.  It is a matter in which I would not intervene, because it is the people who are acting from day to day who know best the need for various precautions.  I cannot recommend the Deputy to do anything further than to put up a case to the Commissioners in the clearest and strongest way for accepting these tickets.  As I have said, it is a kind of matter in which I certainly would not intervene to use any pressure on those who are administering the Act, because I know the danger of departing from any rule which experience has shown to be necessary in a general way.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say if he will consider an application made by the local committee through the parish priest for the return of this 14/11, provided the definite statement is made in that application that these tickets were not actually used, and the circumstances explained as to how they became detached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the kind of matter I regard as suitable for ministerial intervention.  I would not undertake in a matter of this kind to intervene at all.  It is too much a question of detail and a type of matter that can only be satisfactorily judged by those who are engaged in administering the Act.</P>
