      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agrees with the recommendation made in the Third Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding sittings of the Dáil on holidays of obligation.&rdquo;  That motion was put down at the request of Deputies opposite in order to afford them an opportunity for a discussion on the Report of the Committee.  My ideas on the subject are just the same as when the matter was under consideration by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know in what manner a decision will be taken on this Report.  Perhaps a vote for or against the adoption of the recommendation of the Committee would be the best way of dealing with it.  I speak for those who do not accept the recommendation of the Committee.  The Committee met on the 11th October last. The Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges sets out that this matter was taken into consideration arising out of some references to it that were made in the House on a couple of occasions last year.  The decision of the Committee is that a motion in assertion of the general principle that the Dáil should not in future sit on any holiday of obligation was negatived on a division of the Committee.  Accordingly the Committee recommends <Col N="1162" /> that the practice heretofore followed should not be departed from.  The practice in regard to what are known by Catholics as holidays of obligation&mdash;Catholic Church holidays&mdash;has been not to interfere with the ordinary routine sittings of this House except in the case of St. Patrick's Day when it occurs in the middle of the week. There are Deputies in this House who are of the opinion that the Dáil should not sit on what are known as Catholic Church holidays of obligation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if this matter was taken into consideration when the House was first organised.  Probably it was not, and there was no serious consideration given to the matter.  The practice grew, and the House sat regularly on such holidays. I and some others think that there should be no sittings on Church holidays.  I do not desire to raise what would seem to be a sectarian or purely religious matter; but we cannot avoid it in this case. Some people are strongly of the opinion that it is not wise or proper that the House should sit on Catholic Church holidays.  The holidays that we know as bank holidays&mdash;who invented them or arranged them I do not know&mdash;grew up, I suppose, gradually and developed in England. Their history might be interesting to those who care to study them, but they do not seem to have much serious application to the conditions in Ireland.  There is no special reason why the first Monday in August should be a bank holiday, or why bank holidays as such should play such a serious part in the social life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt holidays are agreeable to everybody, and no question of sectarianism or anything of that kind arises so far as they are concerned. In considering the social life of Ireland, in my opinion, public holidays, recognised as such, ought to have some relation to the social life of the people.  Of course, our social life here has been, for historic reasons, based on the practice that has ruled in England.  We cannot get over the fact that our life <Col N="1163" /> has been ruled and regulated in accordance with ideas that were not native to this country and were not inspired by the traditions of the people here.  The change that has taken place here in recent years in public affairs&mdash;governmental affairs &mdash;is such that the holidays ought to have some relation to them, and if we are going to mark that change some effort ought to be made to correlate the public festivals with the social life of the country.</P>
    <P>Bank holidays at the present time are not observed in the country; they are not generally observed in the agricultural areas.  This, of course, is mainly an agricultural country, and workmen do their ordinary work and give their ordinary hours of labour on these bank holidays. Both the workmen and the farmers work on bank holidays. There is a cleavage between the main body of the public in Ireland and a certain section of the business community in this matter.  There are towns in Ireland where the banks, and, following their example, certain business houses, are closed, to the inconvenience of many, while outside these places the ordinary work of the country goes on.  If the holidays are to have any meaning at all, in my opinion, they ought to be selected and arranged so that the whole community should be able to enjoy them.  That is not the rule at present.</P>
    <P>In discussing this matter with people here in Dublin I have heard some shopkeepers say that they would not approve of the Church holidays being made obligatory so far as business is concerned.  I have heard it stated that the Catholic Church holidays are recognised by the business men in Dublin as being particularly useful days for them.  Many people come from the country and do business on these holidays because the holidays are not observed in the City of Dublin. That is an argument against my own idea, if you like, but, even so, the holidays as such, if they are to have any meaning at all, should be selected with an eye upon the history <Col N="1164" /> of the country, or, at least, the social history of the country.  It is with a view to giving a lead in that direction that I move that the House does not agree with the decision of the Committee.  I do not know, if that were carried, that it would exactly achieve the purpose I have in mind&mdash;that the House should not sit on holidays of obligation, Catholic holidays.  But if the House, by expressing its opinion on this matter, agrees with the point of view that I have, then I suppose we could arrange that the matter would be further discussed, perhaps, by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or perhaps by a Special Committee, which would be set up to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>Anyhow, I am strongly of opinion that the time has arrived when this matter should be investigated by a body that would take into consideration the history of our country and the social conditions here.  Any holidays that are to be recognised as public holidays in future should have some relation to the views of the majority of the people in the country.  At present, in my opinion, with the exception of St. Patrick's Day and Easter Monday (which is accepted very generally) the other holidays do not coincide with what I regard as Irish ideals.  This matter will arise in a particular way in the month of May.  There will be two Catholic Church holidays in that month, one on the 9th and one on the 30th.  Both of them will fall on a Thursday.  That would, perhaps, make matters awkward for some people in this House.  In view of that I think the suggestion of the Ceann Comhairle, that this matter should be discussed at an early date and not be brought into this House as it was last year, a few days before such Catholic holidays would arrive, is a wise one.  There should be a discussion upon it in good time so that a decision could be reached, giving due notice to everybody concerned if a change is to be made.  I suppose it is not necessary to move an amendment, but I am strongly of opinion that the House ought not to adopt the view that Catholic Church holidays, <Col N="1165" /> so far as this House is officially concerned, are to be ignored.  I might say, in passing, that it is my view, speaking from the Catholic point of view, that there has been too much ignoring of the fact that this is a Christian country, no matter what church we belong to. So far as this House is concerned officially, no notice whatsoever is taken of that fact.</P>
    <P>I am told that that is not so altogether in the Seanad.  This is, perhaps, somewhat irrelevant, but I think it is a matter which ought to be taken seriously into consideration.  This House has ignored so far the existence of God, and I think that is not quite proper.  In a Christian country one of the first things that a House like this should do would be in some way to recognise that the public acts of the House have, and are bound to have, serious reactions on the life of the people, socially, politically, even spiritually, and some reference to the existence of God, Who directs our minds, and from Whom we expect guidance and assistance, ought to be made by the House.  However, that will probably arise on another occasion&mdash;I hope it will.  On this special question of the Catholic holidays, I feel very strongly, and there are other Deputies who feel equally strongly, and I would urge the House not to accept the decision of the Committee as contained in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain the effect of this motion.  This matter was discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and, as Deputy O'Kelly has said, I suggested to the Committee that a decision should be taken before the Easter Recess, so that we would not be discussing the matter just before a holiday of obligation. It was the opinion of the Committee that, as the matter had been referred to the Committee, it should be discussed in the House in Government time, and the President agreed with that view.  For that purpose, in order that Government time in the ordinary way would be given for it, the motion is moved by the Chief <Col N="1166" /> Whip of the Government in the form on the Paper&mdash;that is, in the form of agreement with the Committee's report. Should the motion be decided in the affirmative, then it means that the procedure heretofore followed in the House will continue.  Should, however, this motion be negatived, I think that will be accepted as an expression on the part of the House that the procedure should be altered, and that the House should not meet on Church holidays.  Therefore the decision of the House on this motion in its present form should, I think, be an effective decision of the House on the matter which Deputy O'Kelly originally raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the effect of the decision on this motion will be such as you, sir, suggest, namely, that if the House disagrees with the motion a change will have to be made so far as the practice here is concerned.  Deputy O'Kelly has raised this question on more than one occasion, and on both occasions, I think he spoke of the feeling that he himself had, that other members of his party had, and, apparently, that certain people outside the House had on this particular question.  It is really not a question on which we can come to a decision on the private judgment of any individual, on the private feeling of any individual. What we want to find out exactly is, what is the basis of the proposed alteration; why, in other words, should we depart from what has been the established practice of, I think, all the Dála that sat in this country.  I think the Dáil sat on a holiday in 1920, and also on a holiday in the beginning of 1922. Leaving that aside, however, what I want to know is not exactly the personal emotions of the Deputy, but what is there in the practice that we have followed for a number of years that is in any sense contrary to ordinary Catholic teaching, because it is argued from that particular point of view.  When the Deputy comes forward, as he seems to come forward, as the exponent of Catholic views on this subject, what authority <Col N="1167" /> is there behind that assumption on his part?  I am speaking my own individual views, and putting forward arguments merely, without, naturally, making any claim to any authority.  I think the matter should be based on definite reasons put forward, unless we can assume that the Deputy can speak with authority on the matter on behalf of those who are in authority to speak on the matter.</P>
      <P>This is a practice which was in existence in this House even before the Treaty was ratified.  How was it that in all that time those whose special business it is to watch over these matters, those who might be expected to speak out, have never in any way intimated that this House was doing what was abhorrent to the bulk of the people of the country, whom they in religious matters represent and control?  How is it that these people in authority have never spoken, have never put forward any views to the responsible people here on this particular matter?  As in many another matter in this country, when it comes to gestures, what I feel very often might not unfairly be described as empty gestures, there are people who are much more orthodox, much more militantly Catholic, so to speak, than those whose business it is to represent and to speak with authority on Catholic opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to judge the case on its merits, knowing, as every Deputy knows, what the ordinary Catholic teaching is on the subject, and not to assume too lightly that Deputy O'Kelly, not having brought forward any definite reasons, has some vague kind of authority to raise this particular matter.  It is a gesture.  I gathered from portion of his speech that the particular value of it would be merely as a gesture&mdash;I hope I am not misrepresenting him.  I feel in this, as in a great many other matters, that there is too much of a tendency to substitute gestures, very often empty gestures, for real solid good works, so to speak&mdash;too much <Col N="1168" /> of a tendency to take refuge from reality in gestures of that kind.  I could view this with a great deal more complacency, perhaps, had I found that in these particular matters other aspects, not merely Catholic emotions, but fundamental Catholic teaching, were strongly inculcated by the party opposite, both here and through the country; that they always showed a readiness to accept the views of those in authority, for instance, on the question of what is due to the lawfully constituted authority of the State; that they denounced more strongly some of the events that have taken place even quite recently.  If they had shown their enthusiasm for ordinary fundamental Catholic teaching in that respect, I must say I might approach this with a little more patience.  As I say, gestures of this kind are a very poor substitute indeed for failing to make that effort, as they are in a position to make it, when the opportunity arises and their words might have some weight to stir up a sound public opinion on matters that are fundamental to the Catholic Church, and to all Christian Churches indeed, if I might use the phrase as Deputy O'Kelly has used it, and when not merely dissociation but strong condemnation might be expected.</P>
    <P>What is there in what we are doing that runs in any sense counter to Catholic practice or doctrine?  I speak now from recollection, but I think most Deputies can remember that the rule, so far as Sundays and holidays is concerned, is that we abstain from all unnecessary servile work; that is well-known to all of us.  Now, if there is anything further removed, despite occasional efforts on the part of certain parties in the House, from the strict conception of servile work than the proceedings in this Dáil I am not aware of it.</P>

      <P>This is preeminently a debate in which Deputies might refrain from offensive interruptions. (Deputies: Hear, hear.) I suggest that the Minister should be allowed to make his speech without interruption.  I am not for a moment suggesting that Deputy Lemass's interruption was offensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the number of interruptions from the opposite side tends to show the levity with which they approach what they profess to regard as an important subject.  They are not prepared to discuss the merits of this particular case.  It is not a matter for humour, one way or another, from Deputies on the opposite benches.  We do not get any further, and we certainly will not increase respect for Catholic holidays or Catholic institutions by interruptions of that kind.  I know nothing further from the fact, if Deputies take up that line, and suggest that it should be decided on that line, than that the work of this Dáil is, <Col N="1170" /> from the Church point of view, servile work.  If they can get established ecclesiastical authority to pronounce in that way, I am quite willing to abide by the decision.  One merely has to glance at the actual practice.  Deputy O'Kelly referred to the fact that this is a predominantly Catholic country; the majority of the people of this country are Catholics.  Quite so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass made one interruption which I shall answer.  If Deputy Lemass looks up the Catholic practice in this particular way, if he looks up, for instance, the last Council of the Church&mdash;the Vatican Council&mdash;he will find that processions were held on public holidays and that the work was done on these particular days.  If the Deputy would turn to the countries that were Catholic, not merely Catholic in the sense that the bulk of the people were Catholic, but, also, in the sense that the State was formally Catholic, he will find that the Parliaments met on Church holidays. I can find nothing to support the view put forward by the Deputy. This has not been put forward, as I suggested already, by anybody that I regard as entitled to speak with authority on the Catholic side. No representations have been made, and there were many years in which representations could have been made, that we were doing anything wrong in meeting on Catholic holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall take some examples.  Take one of the most Catholic portions of Europe, one of the oldest Catholic democracies in Europe, the Canton of Uri in Switzerland.  Its legislative assembly is the assembly of the people.  What day do they meet? On a Sunday in May and they pass their laws there for the coming year. That has gone on right down through the ages to the present time. Now if we take some examples here. I remember one of the most significant and striking political actions taken in this country was taken on a Sunday after Mass at the various churches, and that was the signing of the Anti-Conscription Manifesto. <Col N="1171" /> I am dealing with the matter purely in relation to the particular type of work in the Dáil.  But look at the actual practice, even where other work is concerned.</P>
    <P>We meet here in the city of Dublin, where all the shops are open and all the business in the city goes on as usual on Catholic holidays.  It is suggested that it is a kind of shock to the Catholic conscience that we should meet and do this particular kind of work while every other type of work is going on in the city and so far as I know in every town in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in nearly all the towns in Ireland, so far as I know.  There is one particular exception&mdash;the city of Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be several, but the ordinary practice is as I say, so far as nearly all the towns in Ireland are concerned. Some of the biggest fairs are held on Church holidays, as Deputy O'Kelly himself indicated quite fairly and recognised, to a certain extent, that it told against his own argument.  What is the attitude of the ordinary business man in any town or city in Ireland?  It is that the holiday is a very good business day&mdash;not, mind you, for the kind of work which is not servile work, but work that approaches to it.  In a number of towns which I know in the South, a holiday is looked upon as being next to a market day, so far as business is concerned.  Here we are dealing with a class of work that in no sense can come under Church rules regarding servile work.  I wonder whether the Deputies were ever at school.  What is the practice there?  Am I to be told that in the big boarding schools run by religious communities in this country there is abstention from work on those days?  Not in any with which I am acquainted.  Work and very hard work, is done there on holidays and Sundays, and examinations <Col N="1172" /> are often held on these days.  It is recognised very clearly that that is not servile work, and that not merely is there no prohibition, but that that is the natural thing to do on these particular days.</P>
      <P>Is it seriously put forward by any party in this House that Deputies here should abstain from political work on Sundays and holidays of obligation?  Everybody knows that Sundays and holidays of obligation are periods of intense political activity throughout the country.  Perhaps Deputies opposite abstain and only pretend that they hold these meetings, and that they send accounts of them to the newspapers, but everybody knows that there are more objectionable political speeches made on those days, because there is no control over them, than could ever be made here.  I am not at all convinced that from that point of view, and from the point of view of real observance, that respect for Church holidays would be in any way increased if this Dáil were not to meet on those days.  It would be another opportunity for holding these political meetings, as in the past, right through the country. Practically at every Church door meetings of this kind are often held. I would ask the House to seriously consider this.  Do the various professional men opposite intend to stay away from their offices on these days if they are released from their duties here?  What is there in favour of abandoning this particular practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, no representations have come to us from those whose business it would have been to approach us if they felt that we were in any slight degree outraging Catholic opinion in this particular respect.  How could representations come to us on that matter when neither Church doctrine nor Church practice could urge them to make such representations? Deputy O'Kelly mentioned two holidays.  These are generally the two holidays in question, the two particular Thursdays to which he referred. It may accidentally happen that the Dáil may meet on other <Col N="1173" /> Church holidays.  We meet three days out of seven, and the chance is that very often when holidays come together at Christmas the Dáil is not meeting.  Therefore there is practically no danger, except perhaps in times of crisis, of the Dáil meeting on Church holidays during that period.  There are a few other holidays in regard to which it may happen that Church holidays may coincide with a meeting of the Dáil. It may occur in mid-week.  The two particular holidays in question come in mid-week, at the busiest time during a meeting of the Dáil, and coincide with Thursday's sitting here.  If you adopt a proposal to refuse to meet on these holidays it will mean summoning Deputies for a day and having them in Dublin idle.  I think the better thing in that instance would be to abandon the sitting of the Dáil during that particular week.  Deputy O'Kelly made a suggestion about bank holidays. What are the bank holidays in question? St. Patrick's Day.  Is it suggested that we should change that? St. Stephen's Day.  Is there a suggestion that we should change that? Easter Monday, Good Friday and Whit Monday.  Is there a suggestion that these should be changed?  Then there is left the first Monday in August.  Let us look at it.  Why is Monday chosen as a bank holiday in preference to any other day?  Because, of course, the greatest advantage comes from having a public holiday on that particular day.  It is connected with Sunday.</P>
    <P>Half the value from the point of view of the recuperation of people engaged in work and who get off on that day would be gone if you changed it from Monday to mid-week. That is the grave objection from that point of view.  If we were able to change Thursdays to Mondays we might be able to meet Deputies opposite in regard to this proposal, but until some extraordinary change of that kind takes place I do not see anything would be gained by consideration of the bank holidays. We are doing nothing, I suggest to the House, in so far as I know the ordinary teachings of the Church <Col N="1174" /> of most of us here, that can in any sense be regarded as a violation of Catholic teaching.  We are carrying out our ordinary business, and, so far as political activities are concerned, I feel that they might be much worse spent if the Dáil were to rise on these particular days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much the tone which the Minister for Education has imported into the debate. We hoped that it would not be a debate on party lines, but that it would be a debate on which Deputies would advance their individual opinions.  I hope that the Minister for Education does not represent the view of his party when he suggested the lines on which the division would be taken on this proposal.  He imported matters of high political controversy into this debate.  That is not going to get us a reasonable and harmonious settlement of the question. In fact, I hope that we will allow his political references to pass by in order that we may get a general decision on this question.  I would like to know from the President whether he holds that a decision on this matter is a matter of party or one on which the House should be free to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made a certain advance in atmosphere if nothing else.  This question is largely one of atmosphere.  The Minister for Education dealt with the question from the point of view of <Col N="1175" /> Church authority.  I think it is invidious to bring the matter of Church authority into this question. It is rather a question of creating atmosphere.  There is a strong feeling in this country among the people that we are only emerging from the Penal laws, and that we are ashamed of any public demonstration of our faith such as occurs in all countries where you have had a continuous tradition of Catholic practice.  When I say that I do not wish in the least to say anything that would be offensive or aggressive towards those who do not agree with the majority views of the Irish people in matters of religion or religious convictions, but I think any sensible person will recognise that in a country like Ireland which has emerged from the persecutions it has gone through in the past, it is quite a natural thing that the people here should try to establish an atmosphere in regard to Church holidays which will have some relation to the culture of their religion. I use that word in the sense of something which is apart from strict dogma or the strict rules of what you must do and what you must not do.  It is a public gesture, if you like, that we should not meet on these two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education wants the miracle performed of changing Thursday into Monday and said that we could find a solution if that were done.  I suggest that if the Dáil did not meet on Thursday and Friday, and if it met on Tuesday and Wednesday of that particular week, and if necessary, for an extra day on the following week, the problem could easily be solved.  To bring home the point of view that I want to get at, suppose these days had been freely recognised holidays and suppose measures were taken to abolish them, you would find that there would be a very strong feeling in the country against doing such a thing.  It would not hinge merely on the question of whether it was unnecessary servile work or not.  It would be taken as in some way diminishing the respect due to the beliefs of the majority of <Col N="1176" /> the people.  We want to pay a tribute of increased respect by not meeting on these two Thursdays. There is not a great deal to be said on the subject.  The Minister for Education argued about different Sundays that had been used for political purposes in the cantons of Switzerland.  On that line of argument, if one were to be logical, one should suggest that the Dáil should meet on Sunday and I think that would be a great outrage to opinion generally in Ireland.  I would like if some attempt were made to meet the wishes of those who put forward this proposition and that some general view would be expressed which would not be one of a hostile nature, but one which would go to meet the viewpoint of those who made the proposition.</P>

      <P>I think it is a good thing that this matter of the holidays was brought forward, because it has been in a state of uncertainty for a very long time.  I may perhaps view it from a different standpoint to that of the majority of members of the House, but I cannot see why the Church order to hold certain days free from work&mdash;an order that is common to the whole of Ireland&mdash; is not universally obeyed throughout the country.  For instance, in Dublin and in the towns it seems that work goes on as usual.  I conclude the order to attend service is obeyed as it is in the country, but in the country the holiday is strictly observed.  I never could understand why if it is right in the one place it should not be right in the other, why if it has got to be done it should not be done everywhere, but it is not.  I look at it from a different point of view from that of a good many people, but I notice that in the country, after the Church duties have been performed, in many cases there is nothing for the people to do.  They hang about, not looking very happy, and the large majority of them would be much happier if they were doing their ordinary work after having attended to their religious duties.  However, it is a matter for the Church, but I observe that <Col N="1177" /> it is not carried out in Dublin.  That is beyond yea or nay.  I do not know what other cities like Cork and Limerick and the big towns do, but I suppose they act in the same way as Dublin.  I conclude that the order to abstain from work has been promulgated in Dublin and these other towns, but yet it is not observed. It is observed in the country, and I do not understand it.  It seems to me that the work we do here cannot be considered servile work.  There is nothing to prevent anybody from attending service at whatever church he belongs to before he comes here to do the work on the day appointed for the work.  Of course I naturally will fall in with any arrangements, but that is my opinion.  If people can carry on servile work in Dublin and the big towns, as they do on these days, I think it is not wrong for us here, who are legislating for the good of the country, to carry out our work.</P>
      <P>As regards the other question of bank holidays, I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that we need not necessarily take the example of England in this matter, that we should suit ourselves according to our own needs.  Bank holidays, I conclude, are meant to give bank officials, who are very hard-worked people, a certain amount of relaxation and change. They do not get very much in the year.  But it seems to me that the way in which they are arranged does not do them much good.  A certain number of days are spread all over the year.  It always seemed to me that it would be far better if some arrangement were made by which they could have their five or six days together, when they could get some good out of them, instead of having them spread all over the year, when they are very frequently wet, so that they get no good whatever from them.  In the mills in Lancashire, and in other places like that, employees are given a certain number of days off at the same time &mdash;a week or ten days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The motion proposed by Deputy O'Kelly has not, I suggest, been supported by a single logical argument from beginning to end.  It certainly has not been supported, as the Minister for Education has rightly said, by any representation from Catholic authorities. Neither, in my opinion, has it got the support of the common people, who are the real masters of this country, no matter what any of us may say or think.  References have been made to the fact that business men would seriously object to carrying out the principle which this motion involves. If this motion is to be carried it would be only a logical sequence that the principle should be applied to every other concern&mdash;to business, to the professions, to work of all kinds and classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one class in this country who would object, and rightly object, to the application of that principle, it is the businessmen of the City of Dublin, and I think I can safely say, as far as they are concerned, speaking with some knowledge, that they are of opinion that there are almost too many holidays, and many among the masses of the people are of the same opinion.  If a working man gets a holiday he generally gets it at the expense of his own pocket.  How do you think that the ordinary businessman could afford to close his premises, with the present depression in trade and business? Do you think that the closing of every shop in the city on Patrick's Day does not mean a very severe loss to those engaged in trade and business?  Anybody who has practical experience of these things knows that it entails very serious loss; and when we are discussing this matter let us be fair to all classes of the community and not take a narrow point of view. I consider that when Deputy O'Kelly made the suggestion that this <Col N="1179" /> House had ignored the existence of God he was, in common parlance, grossly over-stating the case.  This House has never refused to recognise or ignore the existence of God. It has never infringed in any way the teachings of the church to which I belong.  I would remind Deputy O'Kelly that the leader of the Opposition, sitting beside him, is the head of one of the great Universities in this country, and if this be applied to the Dáil surely he ought to set an example and apply it to that University.  Any Catholic knows that there is one obligation upon him&mdash;to receive Mass&mdash;and after that he is free to perform his ordinary normal operations.  We carry out that obligation.</P>

The Minister has rightly said that the work we perform here is not servile work.  Nobody has attempted to prove that that statement is not correct.

      <P>I am, in common with you, my friend.  We have had a lot of empty humbug being talked on this subject, and there is nothing in it.  This is the only institution in the State that is supposed to close, and then we are going behind our counters and into our offices, while the Dáil is going to be closed as a recognition of the existence of God. Was there ever such humbug talked in a national assembly?  If there is any infringement of the rights of the Catholic Church, Deputies on these benches would not be slow in protesting, <Col N="1180" /> and in standing up for them. They have as much respect for the Catholic Church as Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  We are lectured as to how we should perform our duties, and what we should do and not do, and when certain of the gutter Press journals in this city set out, as they say they are going to set out, to stiffen the backs of Deputies, I am one of the Deputies whose back they are going to stiffen, and they have certainly stiffened my back in opposition to this proposal. Deputy Little made a very moving plea in favour of this course, but would Deputy Little's office be closed on a holiday of obligation on which the Dáil is closed?  I cannot see that there is anything in this but an empty gesture with nothing in it. We are told by some of the speakers on the opposite side that the Whips are off on this motion.  Well, I was very green in that respect here at one period, but now when I am told from the opposite side that the Whips are off I hold a very different opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an open mind on this question, which is not a party one.  I have not, however, been quite convinced, but I am inclined to side with Deputy O'Kelly owing to the speech of the Minister for Education&mdash;his episcopal, ex-cathedra pronouncement.  He lectured us on sanctity, morals, faith, and many other things.  It was a question on which I thought there would not be such an attitude taken up, but that it would be discussed calmly, with arguments put forward for or against.  I do not know exactly which side Deputy J.J. Byrne is on, because his speech reminded me of Percy's &ldquo;Bulls and Blunders.&rdquo;  He talked of an &ldquo;empty something having nothing in it,&rdquo;&ldquo;that the House never refused to ignore,&rdquo; about &ldquo;receiving Mass,&rdquo; and so on.  I do not really know what it was all about.  However, there is much to be said against closing the Dáil for Catholic holidays, and there is much to be said on the other side.  Deputy J.J. Byrne referred to this as a <Col N="1181" /> rational assembly.  There is such a great deal of rationalism and materialism that even a gesture might do something to counteract them in this country, and that is one of the reasons why I would be inclined to vote for this.  There is the idea that business is the end of life, that the making of money is the end of life, but there should be some other ideal also.</P>

Ecclesiastical authorities spoke to me on the matter, some for and some against.  Some were very strongly in favour of this and some were against it.  I did not consult them on it.  It was in the ordinary course of conversation.  As regards the ordinary working man not getting paid, I put it to Deputies that if business is closed down on these holidays, that is not the fault of this Dáil; it is the fault of that materialism I referred to&mdash;the materialistic spirit.  It is not merely because these are Catholic holidays, but as a recognition of some other world, or something beyond the making of money, that I would be inclined to vote for the motion.  I do not know what gutter Press Deputy Byrne refers to.  It is true that we have had meetings of this Dáil, and of the old Dáil, on Catholic holidays, but we never met in the old Dáil without having a chaplain there, and having some recognition of faith and Christianity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make it clear that, as far as members on these Benches are concerned, there is no question of any Party decision, or anything of that kind on this question.  I think it is essentially a question on which there should not be a decision by Party.  It is one on which every individual should express his opinion, and vote, if the question goes to a vote, according as his conscience <Col N="1182" /> directs.  I regret that I was not present for the whole of the debate and did not hear Deputy O'Kelly speak, but from the speeches that I heard I believe that we are here as a lay assembly to decide this matter, and apparently are trying to introduce into it questions of religious principles which we are quite incompetent to discuss or debate.  I believe this matter ought to be decided purely on common sense and on custom, and, personally, I see no reason for departing from the practice which has been followed here during the seven years that the Dáil has been sitting.  I have heard no evidence that the sitting of the Dáil on Catholic holidays is considered to be in any way an abuse.  I am not in the position of Deputy Fahy; no representations have ever been made to me by my constituents, by ecclesiastical authorities, or by anybody, as a matter of fact, to the effect that it was wrong, or even that it was not proper or fitting, that this Assembly should meet on Catholic holidays.  I am rather slow to believe that this matter is brought before the Dáil from any overpowering sense of religious feeling.  I am not prepared to admit that people who sit on one side of the House are any more deeply imbued with religious feeling than people who sit on the other side, I do not believe that is the reason this proposal is brought before the House at all.  It is the custom to hold meetings, conferences of all kinds, religious and lay, on Catholic holidays.  It is the custom to open shops and do business and if we are not engaged here in the Dáil we will be engaged in our offices or at business.  We may not have control over business people or offices, although if we wished we could pass an Act of Parliament compelling all business premises and offices to close. It is not suggested that we should go so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We certainly have control over our own services, and we have direct control over civil servants who are in the employment of the Government that is responsible to the Dáil, but it is not suggested from any quarter that we should close all <Col N="1183" /> Government offices on church holidays. That proposal has not been made.  It might be popular in some quarters&mdash;a more popular suggestion than this&mdash;but it has not been made.  I do not want to take up the time of the House beyond saying that this is not a question on which any great arguments are necessary, but I am not going to admit that for the past seven years we have been following a practice which should not have been followed by sitting on these holidays, or that it was necessary&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy O'Kelly was the originator of the proposal; I think he was&mdash;to tell us that we were doing something that, in fact, it was not right or proper in the circumstances we should do. I am therefore prepared to vote for the motion on the paper, that the practice should remain as it has been for the past seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say very much on this question.  My view is not that the Dáil has been doing something wrong during the past four or five years, but I think when a change is proposed it is not necessary to prove that what was done up to this particular time was wrong, but that a better practice than the existing one is available. I think it is better that we should not sit on Catholic holidays, and if I examine why, I go back and I find myself thinking of the nature of the Sabbath generally.  Leaving <Col N="1184" /> aside the question of any divine institution with respect to the Sabbath, I think it is very good for us, from the social and from the human point of view, that we should be taken away from our ordinary daily routine at regular periods.  Therefore, I think the Sabbath is very important from a purely human point of view; that is, without dealing at all with it from the religious point of view.  Looking around the country I must say that I have felt all my life that there has been a growing tendency not to give the Sabbath, and holidays, which for Catholics ought to take the same place as the Sabbath, the observance, from the point of view of change of daily routine, which it would be good for the country that they should be given, and when we look at this encroachment on the Catholic Church holidays, I feel that it is going to lead to an encroachment on the Sundays.  From a Catholic point of view&mdash;at least, from my point of view as a Catholic; I do not want to claim any authority for it&mdash;I think we ought not to distinguish between the holidays that are instituted by the Church and the Sabbath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that I have ever seen any distinction made between the two.  How many of us would propose to come here and meet on Sundays?  If it were necessary, I believe that we would and could meet on Sundays.  If the circumstances were such as they were in 1920, when we had to come together and met in private, and if there was a proposal that the Dáil should meet on a Sunday, I would support it. Suppose that the circumstances were such that it was necessary for us to meet on a Sunday, then I would have no objection to that.  My objection to our meeting here on Catholic holidays at present is that it is not necessary.  Remember that we are not legislating now for the keeping of Catholic holidays outside.  We are legislating for ourselves, making rules for our own conduct, and there is no doubt whatever about it that, without causing any grave inconvenience, we could arrange not to <Col N="1185" /> meet on the two or three days involved. The fact that there are only two or three days involved makes it all the easier for us to arrange not to meet on those days.  All that is necessary is that when a Catholic holiday occurs on a Thursday when the Dáil is in session that, instead of meeting that week on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, we should arrange to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday or, if necessary, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  I see no reason why, in such circumstances, we could not arrange to meet on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</P>
    <P>The reason that I am going to vote against the motion as it has been put before us is that I believe that it is not necessary to meet on Church holidays.  This has been referred to as a gesture.  Remember, that when people are left to judge for themselves as to whether a thing is or is not necessary, they naturally weigh the balance in their own favour.  The tendency all the time is to take greater liberties.  Therefore, I think that a gesture by this Assembly is not an empty gesture, and that it would be of value.  I think that such a gesture and such a line should be set by this Assembly.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the schools in the country do not observe Catholic holidays.  If that is so, then I must have forgotten all my experience in that connection. I have had as wide experience of different types of schools in the country as the Minister for Education. As a teacher, I do not remember at any time going to teach in Catholic secondary schools on a Catholic holiday.  It is true that the boys have study on a Catholic holiday, but the day is not an ordinary school day, and that is made plain on various occasions throughout the day.  The ordinary routine is broken on that day.  It is broken almost completely by the fact that you have not the ordinary classes.  The whole question for us to decide is, whether or not it is necessary for us to meet here on Catholic holidays.  If it were proved <Col N="1186" /> to be necessary, then I would say all right, but I believe it is not necessary that we should meet here on those days.  I think it is right that we should give a proper gesture in that way by not doing work which is unnecessary.  It was stated that the business of the Dáil is not servile work.  May I say again that my idea of the Sabbath is that it is a break in the ordinary routine.  I believe it is just as necessary to change from office work or the type of mental work that we do here&mdash;to change from that periodically&mdash;as it is to rest from manual labour.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point.  I regret that the Minister for Education referred, for instance, to our attitude with regard to Church authorities in certain cases in the past.  If we were to argue that question to-day, it would bring us into the whole controversy of the last four or five years.  I have only to say this, as far as I am concerned, that the whole thing depended on whether there was a lawfully constituted authority here in this country at the time.  I hold that there was not, and I am prepared at any time to hold my views against anybody on that.  I hold that at that particular time we were not fighting against a lawfully constituted authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, if we observe the Church holidays well from eight o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon, I think we would be doing a very good day's work for our souls.  If, for instance, we were to adjourn on Catholic holidays at seven o'clock in the evening in order that we might have an opportunity of attending Vespers, I am afraid that more of us would be found at Shelbourne Park or at the Royal than in the Churches. Trades people open their shops on Catholic holidays and also publicans who, of all people, are the most conscientious. They are compelled by law to do a little bit on Sundays. Town labourers, after attending Mass in the morning, work on Church holidays.  I believe that agricultural labourers and the farmers <Col N="1187" /> are the only people who really observe Church holidays.  I do not believe that we would be doing any harm by meeting here on Church holidays at three o'clock in the afternoon.  We could do good honest work from that hour until seven or eight in the evening.  If we compel people by law to remain idle on Church holidays, such people, for instance, as labourers employed by county councils, then I think we should also make provision and see that these poor people, who cannot afford to be idle for one day are paid their wages.  To my mind, the holiday is not a holiday at all, if you get no wages for it.  We take very good care to pay ourselves for our own holidays.  I am not a great judge of the rules laid down by the Church, but my conscience tells me that we will not be infringing its rules very much if, having attended Mass on a Catholic holiday, we assemble here at three o'clock in the afternoon to do the work that is here for us to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, having attended to our religious duties in the morning, we should have a little dispensation to spend a few hours here in the afternoon doing the work of the country, especially as many of us have to travel very long distances. Deputy Anthony and myself, for instance, have to travel a distance of between 150 and 200 miles.  It would not be fair, I think, to summon us to attend here and then send us back without doing any work.  I would also remind the House that in many places fairs and markets are held on Church holidays.  They go to great trouble to advertise the fact that one of their best fairs will be held on New Year's Day.  The people in those centres believe that in holding their fairs and markets on Church holidays they are not doing injury to anyone or giving bad example, but are simply carrying out what has been done for centuries. With regard to Deputy de Valera's point that there would be no harm in having a change and that Deputies could meet here on the <Col N="1188" /> Mondays.  I assure the Deputy that it would be very awkward for a number of the Deputies to have to start at 6 o'clock on a Monday morning to catch a train so as to arrive here in time for the meeting of the Dáil.  We consider that we would be doing too much if we did that. For that reason I am satisfied; as far as I am concerned I am quite safe in meeting here at 3 o'clock on the Church holidays, and if that is all I am going to do to injure my soul there is no fear of me.</P>

      <P>After such manifestations of piety on the part of the leaders of Fianna Fáil, it is with a certain amount of diffidence that I rise to make any contribution whatever to this discussion.  I rise to support the motion even at the expense of being labelled a pagan.  I want to say at the same time that I have quite as much respect for Catholic holidays as any other Deputy in this House.  I want also to say that there is an atmosphere of unreality about the whole discussion. I feel, to be quite frank and open on this matter, that Deputies are speaking with their tongues in their cheeks in the majority of cases.  While advocating that Catholic holidays should be observed by the Deputies of this House, there is no suggestion, as has been pointed out by some Deputies, that workers in the city employed by private enterprise should observe the Catholic holidays by abstention from work, and, of course, no suggestion has been made that if and when they are asked to abstain that they will be paid for these holidays.  I may be told I am a materialist.  To a large extent I am, but I want to know how many in this House are <Col N="1189" /> altruists?  How many of them are so non-materialistic that they refuse to accept their salaries?  Let us have some evidence of it.  Again, I would suggest to those imbued with this great religious zeal for Catholic holidays that they will find plenty of outlet for that zeal here in the City of Dublin.  I am one of those who think&mdash;I do not want to digress &mdash;that we are sending too many missionaries abroad.  We have plenty of work here in this city for missionaries. I believe we have in this House, and we have had evidence of it to-day, some very useful lay preachers.  Let them go and preach the Gospel all over the City of Dublin, and let them ask the people to observe the Commandments, particularly the great Commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo;  Then I, for one, will be thoroughly and deeply impressed by their seriousness and lack of materialism, and will believe they are altruists and mean what they say.  The Minister for Education has described the whole thing as a gesture.  Personally I would refrain from making this gesture where a religious matter is concerned.  I much prefer to practise religion, although I admit I am a rather poor practitioner, but, at any rate, there is only one thing we should get rid of in this House, and that is the cant, humbug and hypocrisy preached by people who say &ldquo;We are the only Christians in this country and the rest are anti-Christian,&rdquo; because, forsooth, they are materialistic enough to work on Catholic holidays.</P>

    <P>As I said before, I have as much respect for Catholic holidays as anybody, and as much respect for the rules of the Church, but I would ask Deputies do they really mean what they suggest when they say this House should not sit on Catholic holidays because it is against the rules of the Church?  If that is the case I am very much afraid that if it be a mortal sin then we are all damned, for I have worked most of my life on Sundays and I have hunted and fished and shot on Sundays, and I will continue to do so <Col N="1190" /> while I am able.  I think if we had as a slogan &ldquo;Away with cant and hypocrisy&rdquo; we would be doing a good day's work for the country instead of wasting our time and public time in discussing this motion.</P>

      <P>I regret this discussion has developed into more or less of a controversy as to what is right or wrong.  This whole question should have been tackled and handled in the way suggested by the leader of the Opposition, and that is that a Catholic holiday should be looked upon as something different from the ordinary working day.  I for one approached this question with an open mind, and I am going to vote for the motion for the reason that I do not see why we here should not meet on Catholic holidays as long as every other servant in the State has to work on those holidays. The only exception I know of is in the case of national teachers.  They are exempt from working on Church holidays simply and solely because Church holidays are observed by the farming community and the children will not attend the schools in the rural districts.  So long as the Law Courts have sittings on Church holidays, and so long as civil servants attend their offices, and barristers and solicitors and everybody else attend to their business on Church holidays, including the poor dispensary doctor who has to attend at his dispensary on Church holidays, I am prepared to support the claim that we should meet here.  When the Dáil proposes to give a general holiday to its own servants, not forgetting the dispensary doctors, I will then support a motion that the Dáil does not sit on Church holidays.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes I will hear Deputy Corish for a few minutes, as I understand he is against the motion.  I would like to have it on record that the House decided to take an hour and a half for the discussion of this motion.  It was then agreed to go into Private Members' time, but I think it is an unsound principle to be taking Private Members' time in this way.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency where business is completely closed down on Catholic holidays, I feel it is my duty to vote against the motion.  In the constituency of which I am a representative, bank holidays are not observed by people other than those working in the banks.  What I object to is the tendency on the part of those who observe bank holidays to have them observed through the country generally to the detriment, as I think, of Irish Ireland.  We have always looked upon bank holidays as something instituted by England in this country.  That has always been the tendency, in my opinion.  When Deputy J.J. Byrne was speaking he laid great stress upon what I believe to be a fact, that the businessmen of Dublin would certainly be adverse to this proposal.  I am not at all surprised at that, because the business men of Dublin reap a very rich harvest on Catholic holidays.  Clery's and other business houses of that kind make it a point to arrange for excursions from different parts of Ireland to Dublin on holidays in order that money may be spent. That is most detrimental to other parts of the country.  If that were the only reason why people should not work on Catholic holidays the Dáil should make an effort in order to secure the state of affairs Deputy O'Kelly wants to have brought about.</P>

      <P>I think this discussion has been largely unnecessary.  Every Deputy who got up, and I with him, had to state quite clearly that as there are others who speak authoritatively on matters of Church holidays we speak always subject to their teaching.  That teaching is that on Church holidays we are to hear Mass and rest from servile work.  I understand servile work to be such work as was done by the servants in Rome.  There is nothing further removed from that than the work done here by the Dáil.  Therefore, by no stretch of the imagination could the work done here be described as servile work.  The work here generally <Col N="1192" /> begins at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  It does not in any way interfere with the hearing of Mass. Therefore, the decision of the Church to make such holidays has no relation whatsoever to the discussions here.</P>
      <P>The Church's first Teacher warned His Disciples very strongly against asserting as dogmas such things as are not dogmas.  For instance, things have been implied here to-day as dogmatic that are not such.  Deputy de Valera constantly used the word &ldquo;encroaching.&rdquo; He definitely suggested that we were encroaching on Church holidays. He declared that the judgment of what is to be done in this should be determined by the answer to the question &ldquo;Is it or is it not necessary?&rdquo; That question does not arise except in the case of servile work.  There is no question as to whether it is or is not necessary to meet on Church holidays.</P>

      <P>The mere fact that these particular days happen to be Church holidays has no direct relation to the matter.  It really is a question of whether it would or would not be a good thing to have the Dáil meeting on two Thursdays before Whit-Sunday and another Thursday shortly afterwards.  In this matter I speak subject to my teachers, and I say that this matter has no relation whatsoever to the Church's definition of these days being holidays of obligation, because the work done here is not servile work and it does not interfere with our hearing Mass.  Therefore the Church's teaching is not touched on in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the Church I do not see that there is any more reason why we should not meet on Sunday, but I think Sunday would be inconvenient. As the Minister for Education <Col N="1193" /> pointed out, the Vatican Council, doing work analogous to our own, meet on Sundays.  There is nothing in the teaching of the Church which would make it undesirable for us to meet on Sundays, except by meeting early in the morning it might be difficult for us to hear Mass.  As regards Sunday or any other day, it is purely a matter of convenience. Deputy de Valera suggests that we should meet on Mondays and Tuesdays in order to avoid Thursdays. Is it or is it not convenient for us to meet on Mondays?  That means, as a matter of fact, that a great many Deputies would have to travel on Sundays.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies may not have motor cars, and it means at that rate that there would be another day wasted.  It means that they would have to travel on Saturday, or at the very latest on Sunday, in order to meet on Monday.  As I have pointed out, it is purely a matter of convenience.  Monday is inconvenient because it means travelling on Sunday, or some time prior perhaps.  Religious questions have really no relation to the subject at all.  I can well understand that Deputy O'Kelly may have a sort of sentimental idea that he would like holidays of the Dáil to coincide with holidays of the Church.  That however, is purely a question of sentiment; in reality there is no direct relation whatsoever.  These Thursdays would break up the whole week and there is no objection from the point of view of the Church to the Dáil doing its work.  The Church has defined how these holidays should be kept, and, in my opinion, it is <Col N="1194" /> almost impertinent on the part of other people to suggest to the Church that it should have thought of some other way of keeping those days.</P>
      <P>Thursday seems to me to be a particularly convenient day.  if people have to meet here on Monday, as has been suggested, it means travelling on Saturday or on Sunday. It is a very inconvenient day. After all, this whole question is purely one of sentiment and, without being blatantly materialistic, we may be permitted to consider the question of our convenience.  These holidays happen to occur at a time when the Dáil is sitting, and at its busiest period.  Of course, we could cut out the whole week if we desired. Very often when it is proposed not to meet on a certain day, we hear voluble protests from Deputies about the waste of public time and money coming up here to meet only on two days.  If you do not meet on Thursday I do not see how you could avoid wasting a day.</P>
      <P>It is not a matter of confidence or anything like that, but I do not think we should like it to be suggested that by the Dáil meeting on Church holidays we are encroaching. By meeting here it is not a question of servile work; that question does not enter into it.  Deputy de Valera talked of the tendency to take greater and greater liberties.  By meeting here on Church holidays we are not taking any liberty that I know of.  It is merely a matter for Deputies to consider whether it is or is not convenient to meet on Thursdays. If it were more convenient for us not to meet on Thursdays, I would have no personal objection to anyone trying to satisfy Deputy O'Kelly's sentiments.</P>

      <P>We have a repetition then of the attitude which we had, not merely last night, not merely immediately in relation to this Bill, but through the whole history of this interest and interests like it in relation to this and similar questions. Passive resistance, passive obstruction, the tenacity in resistance of the molluse; &ldquo;Oh, we would not think of interfering with anything of this kind, we are anxious and eager to see all this thing done, but we will not allow it to be done.&rdquo;  You had the extraordinary example of the protagonists of, if I might say, this profession in this matter putting forward a case on behalf of that profession that what they wanted simply was consideration in the matter, consultation, and so on.  We have had the fact that when they themselves, in their own assemblies, came to consider it, they threw over their advocates in this House and would not have either consultation or consideration. &ldquo;It is Irish, away with it; it is unclean&mdash;no consultation!&rdquo; If that is to be permanently the attitude of this or any other body in this country in relation to the nationalising of this country, then they must <Col N="1198" /> face the fact that there is in this South of Ireland a permanent majority, however otherwise divided, which is determined that in this matter, and in all matters, not merely the tendency of movement but the actual movement shall be in that direction, and that the forces which are going to measure themselves against that must be prepared to measure themselves against the vast majority of the people, and to take the consequences of deliberate obstruction of that movement.  I do not want to see that condition developed. I want to see a condition in the future, of which there are many parallels in the past, in which the great motherhood of Ireland has shown itself capable of absorbing into itself and burying and turning into the purpose of its own self foreign and antagonistic elements in its own body.  I am anxious personally to smooth that road, to do what is possible to allow and to enable that amalgamation to take place, but if we are going to have in this matter a definite repudiation of the authority of the vast majority of the people who decide the direction of the movement, then those who stand in the way must take the consequences of their action.</P>

While it is possible to defend a plain assault case in Irish, it is quite impossible to draw a marriage settlement in Irish! My idea is that marriages took place in Ireland and marriage settlements were made long before this profession decided how or when it was possible to make a marriage settlement.  It was impossible, according to these people, to lease land or draw a lease. My recollection is that such contracts were entered into at a time when the language of the country was the language which it is impossible for these people to learn.  But listen to this: &ldquo;It is quite impossible to draw up any other complicated legal document.&rdquo;  That is the object&mdash;they do not want <Col N="1200" /> complicated legal documents made impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I am very perfectly satisfied to say that complicated legal documents will be less complicated under this measure.  I shall give now directly, in my own words, this same argument and answer it.  I have told of the case of a Dean of the Faculty of Commerce turning out the best trained men in commerce in Ireland at the present moment, and turning them out under a system of tuition in economics which is in Irish.  I have given his explanation as to why it is easier and better to teach economics in Irish, and the explanation is this: that the people who learn economics in that class in Irish must know the meaning of the terms they use.  Ask anyone in this House at the present moment what rent means as economists would define it.  It has no relation whatever to its meaning. Capital has no relation whatever to <Col N="1201" /> its meaning.  Land has no relation whatever to its meaning. What those people, in teaching through Irish, have found out is that in attempting to teach they must themselves be capable of learning the meaning of the words they use.  Exactly the same way in legal documents.  As soon as the lawyers themselves have to learn and to put clearly in a way that they can understand and translate, through the vehicle of another language, the meaning of the technical terms they throw about, and whose complication is the cause of three-fourths of the litigation, then we will get simple language in legal documents, and we will find it is quite possible to draw a marriage settlement and to lease land in Irish, and that it is quite possible to avoid the necessity of complicated legal documents. It is complained that the defence of this measure should be on the lips of those who themselves have little of the language of this country. It is because I have little of the language of this country that I take the risk, and regard it as a duty, to subject myself to that criticism and attack.  It is because I know the lack of it that I want that that lack shall not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried harder to learn the Irish language than I have tried anything else in my life.  Frankly, I have failed, and I frankly recognise the extreme difficulty which men of my age, and possibly of my peculiar incapacity in that respect, will have in the same way after a certain age. I have no recollection for sound.  You could repeat to me a particular phrase thirty times and I could not repeat that phrase, phonetically, afterwards in an hour or so.  I am frankly facing the difficulties, and I think it is impossible for me now, except by a process of living where I must continually use for the ordinary business of my life every day and all the day for a considerable time that language before I can now acquire it.  I am trying again.  My two little boys are trying to teach me what they learn themselves day by day.  I may fail again, but it will <Col N="1202" /> not be for lack of trying.  I believe that this language if fully understood, if it could grow up with our children, above all, if it could be used by the older people to their children, it would be the cement in the whole architecture of a new Irish life.  It would be the beginning of hope, of the breaking down of that sort of heterogeneity which would again give us some separate place in which we would be actively conscious of a share of an individuality greater than our own.  It is because I do know the difficulties which a man of full age has in acquiring this language, and because I value it, and because I think that every effort should be made while people are young, and in proportion as they are young, to make this language the spoken and the ordinarily and regularily used vehicle of communication in this country that I ask this House in this particular small matter to start doing what it will be its business to do in relation to membership of the Dáil, and membership of every profession in this country, and in relation to every commercial and educational activity.</P>

      <P>I have spoken on the Second Reading of this Bill and protested against its introduction and I shall continue to do so.  I have no reason to alter the attitude I then took up.  On the contrary, the reasons that seem to me against this particular measure have been strengthened in the meantime.  To my mind, this is an utterly unwanted, unasked for, unnecessary and unprecedented piece of legislation. Legislation generally takes one of two forms: It is either Government legislation or it is Private Members' legislation.  If it is Government legislation it is generally the settled policy of the Government of the day; if it is Private Members' legislation, which this is, it usually has something behind it in the nature of public opinion or public demand.  Take, for instance, the Town Tenants Bill, which I myself introduced, or the Workmen's Compensation Bill, introduced by Deputy Rice.  These <Col N="1203" /> measures, or any such measures introduced by Private Members, have some foundation outside this Dáil.  I say that this Bill has none, that there has been no demand for it, but that there have been declarations and protestations against it and that outside this House there has been practically not one solitary voice raised in its favour.</P>
      <P>Who wants the Bill?  When Deputy Flinn spoke of a majority I thought he was alluding to a majority of the people.  He enlightened me on that point by declaring that he referred to a majority of the House.  It is true that this Bill has passed the Second Stage by a large majority, but was this Bill ever suggested to the people of the country at the last or any previous general election?  Was it ever suggested that anything in the nature of compulsory Irish would be instituted against one particular profession in this country? That is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
      <P>It is all very well dilating in general terms upon the benefits and the patriotism, and even the necessity of compulsory Irish, all round. That is not what this Bill proposes. This Bill singles out one set of people, and one set alone, lawyers by profession, and it says that they must adopt a certain course in regard to the Irish language.  Does the public want the Bill?  Do the professions concerned want the Bill?  I think they are entitled, because they are most intimately and directly affected in the matter, to give expression to their opinion and to say whether they want it or not. Meantime, since the Second Reading, we have had a declaration from the Incorporated Law Society, which speaks for the great majority&mdash;two-thirds, I think&mdash;of the solicitors of Ireland, that they are opposed to this measure.  They do not say that they are opposed to the revival of the Irish language, but they say that they are particularly opposed to this specific measure, and they give their grounds of opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say in passing that they <Col N="1204" /> are perfectly entitled to do so, and, though perhaps rather sneering references may have been made to the fact that Deputies were circularised by that body, I say that that body were absolutely within their rights as the body directly concerned in the matter to place, by every means in their power, their views before the representatives in this House.  I think that that statement is most cogent, concise, and convincing, and, if Deputies were to take the trouble to read it, I think they would find that the arguments contained in it are unanswerable.  At any rate, though not present during the last discussion, I have read the speeches made here, and so far as I can gather, there has been no answer to the arguments put forward on behalf of the Incorporated Law Society.  But the public have not expressed an opinion in favour of the Bill, the professions intimately concerned have not expressed an opinion in favour of it.  Have even the political parties in this House officially backed this measure?  Nothing of the kind.  So far as I understand, there is to be a free vote on this Bill.  Why?  A very good reason&mdash;namely, because the Government know very well that if some of their supporters were to desire its passage, a large minority in the Government Party are not in favour of the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons presumably why it is not a Government measure.  I sincerely trust that the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who are not in favour of this measure will have the courage of their convictions, will take advantage of the fact that the Government Whips are not being put on, and will go into the Lobby and vote against it.  I think that this whole proceeding by way of private legislation, affecting these two learned professions, is trifling with the Legislature, trifling with the language, and also trifling with the learned professions themselves. I very much resent the introduction of anything in the nature of sectarianism with regard to this question, and, unfortunately, sectarianism <Col N="1205" /> has been inclined to be introduced, not only by the advocates of this measure but also by its opponents.  There are 92 per cent. of the people of the Free State Catholics according to the last Census returns.  Is there any Deputy who has any ground or reason for saying that the majority of that 92 per cent. of Catholic citizens of this State want or desire this particular Bill?  I say not.  There has been nothing in the nature of a referendum upon it.  There has not been even a suggestion of a plebiscite. The Bill contains some extraordinary propositions, the principal among them being a definition of what is described as a competent knowledge of the Irish language. That is to mean &ldquo;such a degree of oral and written proficiency in the use of the language as is sufficient to enable a legal practitioner properly to conduct the business of his clients in the Irish language.&rdquo;  It is that &ldquo;competent knowledge&rdquo; so defined, that it will be necessary, in the view of the Chief Justice, for anyone to have attained either before he was called to the Bar or was admitted a solicitor.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is suggested that when this Bill passes, as presumably it will by a large majority, it is to be considered a dead letter, or whether it is to be strictly construed literally according to the terms laid down in the section which I have quoted.  If it is to be considered a dead letter, and if students shall not be required to have this extraordinary competent knowledge of the Irish language, I say that the whole proceeding is a farce and that we are only wasting public time by discussing it.  On the other hand, if it is to be strictly construed, I am inclined to think that it will be the end of the legal profession in this country.  Perhaps that is what some supporters of the measure are aiming at, but at the same time let them remember that it is very hard to get on without some evils, some of them are even necessary for our very existence, and it is very difficult even for idealists of the <Col N="1206" /> character of the Deputy who has just sat down to get on without lawyers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken mentioned several terms in English.  He spoke of &ldquo;rent,&rdquo;&ldquo;land,&rdquo; and so forth. All these terms have been in use in legal parlance in this country for many centuries.  They have acquired a distinct legal meaning.  Is he now suggesting that that legal meaning should be scrapped and an entirely new code set up in an entirely new language, because a great deal of this Irish language will be put into a new language?  It will have to be a new language.  It will not be the language spoken by Brian Boru or his contemporaries, because there are many things in existence to-day which the law has to deal with which were not heard of or dreamed of in his time.  Is it suggested by the advocates of this Bill that all this volume of precedents, coming down from generation to generation, whereby a word has derived a certain meaning in legal parlance, is to be scrapped, that we are to start afresh, and, as he says, reach the millennium by having the simplest form of legal documents in the Irish language?  It is very difficult to get simplicity in any document.  One of the chief reasons why legal documents are so complicated is because of their desire to convey certain meaning and certain meaning alone, and it is the very search for simplicity that renders them so complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flinn has given us very kindly a personal explanation and apologia as to his incompetence in either a knowledge of Irish or in the learning of it.  He has told us that neither does he know it nor, after very strenuous efforts, has he been able to learn it.  I am not here to say that Deputy Flinn is anything extraordinary in mentality, but I do think that if he has not been able to surmount the obstacle of the Irish language, it will be very difficult to <Col N="1207" /> expect the ordinary average citizen to do so.  On the occasion of the Second Reading, I suggested that in all fairness to the profession concerned, and that in all decency, before we fasten this collar round the necks of the legal profession, we might try it on ourselves.  Of course, at the time, that was greeted with a certain amount of derision, but since then many people have made the same suggestion to me.  Only the other day it was suggested to me that members of this House should first learn how to speak Irish themselves or make it compulsory for admission to this House.  Another friend of mine chimed in and said: &ldquo;What would be the use of being a Deputy if you were not exempt from things that other people have to do?&rdquo; That is the only reason that I can see why we should not begin with ourselves instead of passing laws for the benefit of others which we do not seem to think should be fastened on our own shoulders.  I wonder will the country solicitor feel more Irish when he is addressed as &ldquo;Aturnae&rdquo; because I believe the Irish for solicitor is &ldquo;Aturnae&rdquo;&mdash;at least the newly-manufactured term for solicitor which we have been told is Irish, is &ldquo;aturnae.&rdquo;  I wonder will he feel more Irish, more patriotic and that he is serving his country better by being called by the country people &ldquo;Mr. Aturnae&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Mr. Solicitor.&rdquo;  That will be, I presume, one of the great benefits that the Irish language will gain by the passing of this measure.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, it was suggested by the last speaker that this is only the thin end of the wedge and that eventually the principle contained in this Bill shall be applied elsewhere.  Well, if that is the case I say that it is grossly unfair to pick out one particular group of persons and apply it to them.  It has been said in previous debates that there was a demand in <Col N="1208" /> certain districts for Irish-speaking lawyers.  My reply to that was, and is, that if there is that demand there, it shall be supplied.  No people are so quick to deliver the goods if there is a demand for them, and name a price, too, as lawyers. The principle embodied in this Bill is a mean one.  It is summed up in two or three words, simply these: &ldquo;Try it on the dog; see how it goes there, but do not try it on ourselves. Try it on the dog first and if the dog survives, very good; if he goes down, it does not matter.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I realise that it does not apply to existing solicitors and barristers, but it refers to future ones.  I do not see why this Bill should be brought in referring to future solicitors or barristers, any more than another Bill, or the same Bill, should not also bring the same conditions about for future bakers, butchers, candlestick makers, or perhaps fishmongers for that matter.  These people come into every-day contact with the people.  If there is a demand for Irish-speaking lawyers, surely there is a demand for Irish-speaking fishmongers.  I suggest that it is a mean thing to fasten upon one particular section of the community sooner than upon others. In answer to that argument, I think some speaker suggested that barristers were court officials.  At the time I was not quite certain of the point.  Since then I have looked it up, and I have discovered that barristers are not court officials, in any sense of the word.  Solicitors are court officials; barristers are not, and even if they were court officials, why should officials of the court have to expound their various arguments in a certain way when other people like doctors, auctioneers, architects, or any other form of professional gentlemen, are allowed to go about their business in the ordinary <Col N="1209" /> way that has obtained for so many years in this country?  I do not see what sense or decency there is in the Bill.  It is a private measure. It is professedly a non-party measure.  It has no demand from any section of the people.  There has been a certain amount, I will not say very great, of decided opposition to it, but there has been no form of support of any sort or kind throughout the country for the measure. I think it is a great pity that the proposer introduced it, and I only hope that he will see the error of his ways and withdraw it now.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that in my judgment, anyway, this Bill has been improved in the Committee Stage.  I ventured on behalf of the profession of which I am a member to make certain suggestions, and I am glad to say they have been embodied in the Bill, and that the Committee showed a complete willingness to use this Bill as a measure for furthering the interests of the Irish language, and showed themselves anxious to be as conciliatory as possible. I have just listened to two speeches.  I heard a speech from Deputy Redmond attacking this Bill. I heard a speech from Deputy Flinn purporting at any rate to advocate the Bill.  I must confess that it appeared to me that no matter how strong persons might regard Deputy Redmond's attack, his attack did not do half as much harm to this Bill as Deputy Flinn's attempted defence of it.  I am glad Deputy Flinn informed this House that he did not know Irish; I am glad Deputy Flinn did not put himself forward as a man who had done any solid work for Ireland.  I am glad that Deputy Flinn's speech was not made from the Front Opposition Bench; I am glad that Deputy Flinn's speech was a speech made by a person who carlies little weight in this House, and I think none at all outside.  I am glad that a speech of that nature cannot be taken seriously and cannot be made use of by persons who are bitterly opposed to the revival of the <Col N="1210" /> Irish language; I am glad that nobody can say that Deputy Flinn is typical of Gaelic League mentality, or is typical of the Irish revival mentality. What has he done?  Simply in stentorian tones he has bellowed out an attack against one particular body of professional men in this country.</P>
      <P>What is the object of this Bill? What is it supposed to do?  This Bill is supposed by those who introduced it, by everybody who votes for it, to encourage the Irish language, to make the Irish language spoken more than it is at present.  How is that to be achieved?  You make it necessary for solicitors to learn the Irish language, that future barristers practising in this country will learn the Irish language, but that brings you a very short way indeed.  What is the use of solicitors knowing the language, what is the use of barristers knowing the language, if they are not going to use it afterwards? It is worthless.  You may have a man who passed all examinations as a solicitor with a speaking knowledge of Irish, but if he does not use that knowledge it practically does not help at all.  What we want in this measure is to encourage Irish, to make it more spoken in court.  What we want is the co-operation of the rising generation of members of the Irish Bar and members of the Incorporated Law Society.  That is what we want, that is what we hope to achieve, and that is what we believe we will achieve under this Bill.  How is that co-operation to be got?  Is it to be got by wild attacks on a learned profession?  Is that helpful?  Is that the way it is going to be achieved? If you want the solicitors of Ireland and the members of the Bar of Ireland to become Irish speakers and to use their knowledge of Irish, are you going to do that by making wild attacks upon them?  In my judgment, that is a method by which you would defeat, and would not attain your end.  Deputy Flinn put forward some very strange theories.  Deputy Flinn put forward the theory that in a profession, or in a science, you can get on better if you have no technical terms.</P>

      <P>No technical terms.  There are professional men sitting beside the Deputy, and I am glad to see he has returned to the House.  I wonder how the medical profession could get on if technical terms were taboo.  I wonder how the solicitor profession is going to get on, or how the Bar is going to get on, or how the conduct of the law is going to go on if professional terms are taboo.  I wonder how in any science, physical science or mental science, you can progress without technical terms.  Technical terms get a hard, clear-cut meaning, and they can be used by those who require their use.  Deputy Flinn cannot understand a simple legal document.  Why?  Because, I take it, Deputy Flinn has never gone to the trouble of acquiring a knowledge of the meaning of the most simple legal phrases.  I regret very much that the Incorporated Law Society have taken up the attitude which they took up.  I would have very much preferred, and I think everyone would have preferred, if, recognising that this Bill is almost certain to become law, they had seen in what way it could be improved, because I think it is quite possible, from their point of view, that this Bill would have been improved. I believe that if amendments drafted by them, doing away with what they consider to be difficulties of machinery, were put forward in this House, such amendments would have been dealt with by this House in the spirit in which the Committee dealt with the amendments that came before them, but not in the spirit which prompted the diatribe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You did not even vote for it yourself?  I suppose you did not bother to call for a division.  I believe, however, that if the Incorporated Law Society passed a resolution suggesting amendments to this measure those amendments would be sympathetically considered by this House.  But that is not the position in which we stand at the present moment.  I regret that there has been what I would call this completely negative attitude taken up on their behalf.  But I do not despair of them.  Things change.  It may be that the Incorporated Law Society find themselves now being, as Deputy Redmond stated, picked out as it were for compulsion, first, and that they object, or it may be that feeling annoyed, feeling disturbed in their minds by that, they are now anxious to fight to the end.  But it does not follow that when they have fought to the end and are defeated they will not accept <Col N="1213" /> their defeat.  That does not follow at all.  In fact, I hope it will be the other way about.</P>
      <P>I believe that when this Bill becomes law and when the years have passed, which must pass before it becomes an operative measure, in those years the question will be fully considered by the Incorporated Law Society.  Up to this they have not shown themselves as enemies of the Irish language.  I know that they had Irish as one of the subjects upon their programme; I know that they have had two of the most distinguished Irish scholars as their examiners; and I trust that in the future, when the time which must pass before this Bill comes into force will have elapsed, the Incorporated Law Society will take it up and work it thoroughly.  As I said before, it is only with the co-operation of the Bar, and only with the co-operation of the solicitors that this Bill can be made a real, working success. I do hope that that co-operation will be forthcoming, and what is more, I believe that it will in time be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about the fact that there is a great deal of legal business which cannot be transacted in Irish.  Difficult documents dealing with complicated matters cannot be drawn in Irish.  A great deal of legal argument cannot be conducted in Irish, because it is necessary for you to cite your precedents and to get the exact meaning of your words.  In time it may be so used; in time a vocabulary of technical words may be evolved.  But it does not exist at the present moment.  I admit all that.  But there is a great deal of work which can be done in Irish, and it does not matter, to my mind, very much as to what language a document is in; it does not matter to me very much whether in the Supreme Court an argument is carried on in Irish or is carried on in English.  That does not seem to me to be a matter of very great importance. Provided that the whole Nisi Prius business of the country, that is to say, cases in which witnesses <Col N="1214" /> are examined before juries or before judges, all viva voce evidence, can be done in the Irish language, the purpose of the framers, and, I believe, the purpose of nine-tenths of the supporters of this Bill will be achieved.  I hope that in time such a result will be achieved.  But I do express this view, that in reviving the Irish language there is a very difficult thing to be done; there is a very long way to go; it is a very uphill fight.  It is by proceeding tactfully and carefully, by enlisting the help of every supporter who can be got, by antagonising as few as possible, and by earning the support of as many as possible, that you will achieve that end.  Here is a Bill which certainly gets over one difficulty. It makes it necessary for boys when they become young men to have acquired a spoken knowledge of the Irish language.  Now, that is one of the great difficulties to be overcome&mdash;the force of inertia. Overcome that, have your young men so that they do know Irish, and then it will be a much easier thing to get them to use that knowledge than it would be if you had to force them afterwards to acquire and to use it.  Here we are encouraging them, encouraging the acquisition of that knowledge, and if we in this House proceed carefully and tactfully, we will not only have achieved what is our real object&mdash;that a knowledge of the language will be acquired&mdash;but we will have achieved the object that when it is acquired it will be used.</P>

I did hear his voice on the Second Reading of this Bill; I understood he was then in favour of the Bill, but when I read the report of what he said on Wednesday night I came to the very opposite conclusion. We all know, we must never forget, that Deputy Flinn is a most eloquent <Col N="1215" /> orator, the most eloquent orator that this country has seen since the time of Daniel O'Connell.

Is there anybody in this House more anti-Irish than the Deputy himself? And I took it from him and heard with great surprise to-day that he had again changed his mind, becoming a supporter of the Bill, because to-day he has spoken in favour of it&mdash;or at least he has declared that he has spoken in favour of it.

      <P>I am Irish both in Dublin and in Cork and I object to Deputy Flinn suggesting to me that <Col N="1217" /> I am anti-Irish.  Deputy Flinn came here as an Englishman.  He was not above appealing to the British Government as an Englishman, and of relying on his services to the British Government in 1918.  There is something that an ex-Crown Prosecutor does know, and he knows that. Later on the Deputy took an oath of fealty to his King and to his country.  I have no doubt that he took it, not as an empty formula, but as meaning what it does mean.  Again, I ask the Deputy, when did he become an Irishman?  When he joined Fianna Fáil?  That, I think, was the evening before the nomination at the last General Election, when Deputy Flinn said: &ldquo;I will cease coquetting with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party; I will abandon my flirtations with the Labour Party, and from this on I will swallow the whole programme of the Fianna Fáil Party, including the mere empty formula.&rdquo;  This is the gentleman who tells us calmly that if we cast a vote against this Bill we are anti-Irish. We are not anti-Irish.  Those who vote against this Bill have more Irish blood beneath the nail of a small toe than Deputy Flinn has in his whole composition.</P>

      <P>What does this Bill hope to do?  What will it achieve? Deputy Flinn has pointed out the difficulty of learning it.  He has pointed out some difficulty that he has as regards understanding sounds.  I do not think that any member of the Dáil when the Deputy is speaking finds that he has any such difficulty.  But there is Deputy Flinn debarred for ever from learning the Irish language because he says he cannot follow sounds.  He assumes that that difficulty only arises when a man comes to full age.  I cannot quite understand that from a logician of Deputy Flinn's understanding and education. Why should not the same difficulty be there when one is under 21?  There are a great number of <Col N="1218" /> people, as Deputy Flinn has pointed out, who cannot possibly learn the Irish language.  Are they forever to be debarred from entering the legal profession?  Deputy Flinn says: &ldquo;Yes, you must debar them; there is no other way out of it.  They cannot learn Irish, and, therefore, they are not going to enter the legal profession.&rdquo; That, he says, is the decision of the majority.  Where does the majority arise, as Deputy Redmond asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the people of all others who are interested in this matter, and who are expert in it and know how it will affect the profession and the public, are the members of the solicitors' profession.  Solicitors are more in touch with the public than barristers, and they have by no uncertain vote, not by a vote of 110 to 8, but by a unanimous vote from one end of the Free State to the other, declared that this Bill cannot be carried into effect.  The Bill is nonsense on the face of it, so nonsensical to carry out that anyone interested in the Irish language could come to no other conclusion than that it will have the effect of putting one more nail in the coffin of compulsory Irish. A solicitor has to pass three examinations. In the first examination he is compelled to show that he has a knowledge of Latin, English, English literature, and other subjects.  After he has got that knowledge he has to undertake a three, four or five years' course of legal training.  The period during which he has to learn his law is very short, in my opinion, and might be easily extended.  But the suggestion has never been made until now, and it would not have been made now if behind this Bill there were any people who had the slightest knowledge of legal education, that from the time a person becomes an apprentice for the solicitor profession up to his final examination he might do as he likes as regards law, but you must administer to him solid doses of compulsory Irish.  When starting his profession a man likes to get his examination with honour and credit to himself.  That is not to be done any longer, because it may well be that a first of first as <Col N="1219" /> far as legal subjects are concerned may fail in Irish, in which event he will have to go for his examination again, and in his next attempt he will probably be put down among those who have just scraped through. There will no longer be the great desire and ambition for the apprentice to do well in his final, for the result of the final will have very little to say as to how he really did and what his knowledge of law really is.</P>
    <P>The promoters of this Bill have given an irreparable blow to the promotion of the Irish language.  Of course, I will hear from the Minister for Local Government that I do not understand the great change that has come over Irish public feeling.  The Minister may find to his cost one of these days that it is I who do know, and if he thinks that this movement to cram compulsory Irish down the throats of unwilling students has the will and the voice of the people behind it he is mistaken.  That is a lesson he has to learn some day.  I do not suggest that Deputy Conlon and Deputy McFadden are anything more than figure-heads in the promotion of this Bill.  We all know who are behind it.</P>

      <P>I will refer to them as Minister A and B.  The Incorporated <Col N="1220" /> Law Society and the members of the legal profession know who are behind this Bill, who are responsible for it, and who will be responsible for this outrage on the teaching of the Irish language and on the legal profession.  Nineteen years ago, when I was a member of the first governing body in University College, Cork, this question of compulsory Irish was proposed. I was then one of the very few anxious and willing to do everything possible to promote Irish, and I went further towards its promotion than five-sixths of those who belonged to that body.  At that time we had in Cork a member of our profession who was enthusiastically in favour of the Irish language, and he has been ever since.  He is the greatest supporter of the Gaelic League I have met in our profession; a man of talent who has brought up his family as supporters of the Gaelic League.  I met him a week ago and asked him what he thought of this Bill.  &ldquo;There is only one thing for us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let them carry on.&rdquo;  I asked him then: &ldquo;What do you think of the teaching of Irish now?&rdquo;&ldquo;This does not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;affect my son; but never again will he with my consent open an Irish book.&rdquo;  That shows the change, and yet I know nothing about this change coming over the country and affecting even the strongest supporters of the Gaelic League and the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No greater slander could be cast upon the Incorporated Law Society than to say they were opposed to the Irish language.  Years and years ago they made Irish a voluntary subject in their examinations.  They believe, and I believe, and the great majority of the people of this country believe, that you cannot get Irishmen to do anything by force. Most of us believe no good comes out of anything in the nature of force.  You can encourage a boy to learn the Irish language under a voluntary system.  In that way he will learn it and develop his education, and when he becomes a solicitor <Col N="1221" /> he will not throw it aside.  But if you make it a compulsory subject for him, once he is qualified it will be good-bye to Irish.  That would be one of the results of compulsion. After he gets through his final never again will he speak a word of Irish, and never again will he have anything to say to it.  Deputies who are supporters of this Bill are creating enemies to the Irish language, and, I respectfully submit, enemies of no mean order.  I do not want to suggest anything in the nature of reprisals, but I was shocked and displeased to find that already there were people who say the Government are secretly behind this, and add: &ldquo;They are winking at the Parties, but we will have it off the Government.&rdquo;  Such criticism would be unworthy of the profession, and I am glad to say it has no sympathy whatever from the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, but if that spirit is there, as it has been shown to be here and there, the sooner we get rid of it the better.  Coercion is always bad, and will always continue to do harm and not good.  The Minister for Justice has spoken with very deep regret, and almost with tears in his eyes, of the fact that the Incorporated Law Society have not brought forward amendments to this Bill.  I think if the amendments which were brought forward had been carried, we would have had a very different Bill.  You would not have what you have now, a Bill that is nonsense from start to finish, unintelligible and unworkable.  You would have a Bill which would be workable, and you would have the assistance and encouragement of the Incorporated Law Society in making it a success.  Let it be a workable Bill.</P>
    <P>It was nonsense to put into the Bill that after a student has gone through his legal course plus Irish, and when he has finished he must go to the Chief Justice and satisfy him that he has a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  It does not matter, according to the promoters of this unintelligible Bill, whether <Col N="1222" /> the Chief Justice could say &ldquo;Good morrow&rdquo; to you in Irish or not. The Chief Justice is being given arbitrary powers over the Council of the Incorporated Law Society and their Board of Examiners.  Speaking from sixty years' experience of the Council I can say that their examinations have all been conducted in the highest style, and compare favourably with those of any University or Board of Education.  When they were bringing in Irish as an extra subject they did not do it in any mean way.  They did it fairly, and they brought two of the best examiners they could get in Irish to examine their students.  They were not going to have any underhand methods.</P>

      <P>Their standard of examination in Irish is very high, and I think that it might be substantially reduced without doing any harm, and in fact that might rather do good.  The House has been reminded by Deputy Redmond that the result with regard to this Bill is a foregone conclusion, that it is going to be carried in the final stage as in the previous stages by the same large majority of Irish and anti-Irishmen. Though they will carry the Bill they will carry it against the protests of the profession that it affects, which sees that legal education is being hit in a way in which it never was hit previously.  You are going to carry it against the protests of the profession to which I belong, and those who support the passage of this Bill are not doing any work for the Irish language but rather a bad day's work for Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputies Wolfe, Redmond and Cooper, and other eloquent Opposition speakers against this Bill, have been in the past some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the rights, privileges and liberties which we enjoy under the Constitution. That being so, I find it very difficult to understand why Deputy Redmond, who I think was a member <Col N="1223" /> of the Constituent Assembly responsible for the framing of the Constitution, protests in such emphatic language against this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>At any rate, he is certainly one of the most enthusiastic advocates of the rights of the existing Constitution both inside and outside the House.</P>
      <P>Article 4 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The National language of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) is the Irish language, but the English language shall be equally recognised as an official language.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent special provisions being made by a Parliament of the Irish Free State (otherwise called and herein generally referred to as the &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;) for districts or areas in which only one language is in general use.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Redmond is not deliberately overlooking that Article.  He did, perhaps, forget that Article when he spoke to-day. I know many members of the Solicitors' profession who are fairly fluent in the French language.  They go into the Universities and schools and, of their own free will, they learn the French language.  I cannot understand any Irishman, especially a solicitor who hopes to practise in this country, refusing to learn the official national language.</P>

Deputy Redmond has not raised any protest against the young men of this country who seek Civil Service positions being obliged to learn Irish as an obligatory subject. Deputy Redmond and Deputy Wolfe know quite well that the Banks, the Railways, Guinness's Brewery, and big business concerns make French and German obligatory subjects in their examinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I gave a silent vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, but the speeches I listened to to-day force me to pass the observations I am now passing. I agree with Deputy Flinn that we are put into the position of having to support this Bill as people who have some kind of a national outlook, and who are opposed to those with the purely anti-Irish point of view.  I have no knowledge of Irish other than a bog-man's knowledge. Twenty-four or twenty-five years ago I learned a few books of O'Growney in the National Schools, but since then I have not followed up the language. I believe that in our generation, within the lifetime of the youngest member of this House, Irish will not become a commercial language in the country.  We are asked here to hinder or to help.  That is the position Deputy Conlon has forced us into.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Private Bill legislation so far as this and other Bills are concerned.  Deputy Redmond said it is quite right for Deputies like himself and Deputy Rice to bring in Private Bills dealing with Workmen's Compensation and Town Tenants.  I disagree with that, because I believe these are matters the Government should deal with.  This Bill we are discussing is also one that should have been introduced by a Minister rather than by Deputy Conlon.  We are now forced into the position of helping rather than hindering this Bill in order to give effect to the Article of the Constitution for which those of us who were here at the time are responsible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Incorporated Law Society's protest, I look upon the Society as the strongest and most autocratic trade union we have in this country.

      <P>Deputy Wolfe is a very able advocate, and he is an influential and important member of his profession.  His case is that the Incorporated Law Society should be consulted and the majority of them should agree before this House attempted to pass a measure of this kind.  Would Deputy Wolfe say that before, say, teachers' salaries are reduced the teachers should be consulted?  The Deputy did not say that the workers on the Shannon Scheme, who have to work for a miserable pittance of 32/- a week, should have taken a vote as to whether or not they would work for that amount?
