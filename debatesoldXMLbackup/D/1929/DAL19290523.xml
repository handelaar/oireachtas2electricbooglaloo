      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon (for Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Roscommon Co. Council, at its meeting held on the 17th October, 1928, agreed by resolutions to make contributions out of county funds towards the following four drainage schemes&mdash;Corboley and Sandfield, Feorish and Derrynadoey, Cross River and Clogher; that notwithstanding the Council's willingness to make the required contribution no steps have been taken by the Board of Works to start operations under any of the schemes, and whether he can state when work may be expected to commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part is in the affirmative.  As to the second part the contributions which the Roscommon Co. Council offered to make were not in consonance with the proposals put before them by the Commissioners for Public Works, and after full consideration it has been decided that the Council's alternative proposals cannot be adopted inasmuch as they would involve a departure from the ordinary basis on which the Government have agreed to make free grants for schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  No further steps can be taken to proceed with the schemes concerned unless and until the Council reconsider their decision and fall in with the procedure which is accepted by other County Councils.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state, in view of his reply to this <Col N="166" /> question to-day, why no reply was given to inquiries made by me to the Parliamentary Secretary at several interviews and to definite letters asking for similar information addressed to the Secretary of the Department on the 27th November, 1928, 8th February, 1929, 19th February, 1929, 6th April, 1929, and a subsequent letter in the present month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what Deputy Conlon asked, the position is that this scheme was sent first to the County Council in April, 1927.  They did not agree to make any contribution until October, 1928.  Then they proposed to offer a fixed sum instead of giving a percentage of the actual cost of carrying out the scheme as was required. The new proposal was the subject of discussion between the Board of Works and the particular section of the Finance Department which was dealing with these matters.  That discussion commenced at the busiest period of the year when the Estimates were being considered, and there was delay in coming to a decision. As a matter of fact, it was only finally decided this week that it would be impossible to make any change in the arrangement that had been made in this particular case, and, if the scheme is to be proceeded with, the Roscommon County Council must enter into an undertaking of the same character as that which other County Councils have entered into, and that is to give a definite percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if a fixed sum was mentioned by the County Council, it was because a fixed sum was mentioned by the Board of Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Board of Works estimated that the scheme would cost so much.  The County Council said that they would give a definite figure.  That is not the arrangement made elsewhere.  The <Col N="167" /> arrangement is that they undertake to give a percentage of whatever the costs may turn out to be.  In the case of drainage works, it is impossible to estimate accurately, as in engineering works of this kind some unforeseen cause very often leads to some excess in carrying out the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state if the outbreak of typhus fever in the district of Lettermore in 1924 was attributed by the Local Government Department Medical Inspector to infected clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Gen. Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The occurrence in Lettermullen in the spring of 1924 was not specifically attributed to the cause suggested by the Deputy.  There was a history of access to a neighbouring house in which typhus fever had previously appeared and in which suitable protective measures seemed to have been overlooked by the local sanitary staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is aware that there was an outbreak of typhus fever in Ballyduff area shortly afterwards.  The Medical Inspector who was sent down to investigate the matter was the same officer who had been investigating the outbreak in Lettermore. I was Chairman of the Board of Health at the time, and the inspector asked me whether there was much of a sale for imported second-hand clothing in the area.  If I mistake not, he told me at the time that he had traced the outbreak in the West to imported second-hand clothing and he stressed the importance of a very careful examination of imported clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If questions arising out of the sale of second-hand clothing are to be discussed here, we had better have them addressed directly to this matter, but in the case of Lettermore, <Col N="168" /> in 1924 the circumstances were that ten years previously a family appeared to have died out as a result of typhus fever.  The house was shut up, deserted and ostracised generally.  Ten years later, in a neighbouring house, there was an outbreak of typhus.  The investigation of it disclosed that some time shortly before the outbreak the deserted house had been entered, the furniture taken from it and used as firewood.  The house, which had lain deserted for ten years had been disturbed by persons from the house in which the second outbreak took place.  If it is sought to connect that case with second-hand clothing, let us have a more explicit statement of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officer spoke to me about that house and, in addition, told me that to the best of his belief the real cause of infection was second-hand clothing.  He referred to the danger of imported second-hand clothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies are interested in what may arise from the point of view of public health as a result of the use of second-hand clothing, I suggest that they should address themselves directly to the question, so that we may know what we are talking about, and know something about the facts, but we are not going to arrive at anything now by discussing what second-hand clothing may or may not do, arising out of typhus fever in Lettermore five years ago, which, so far as the information in the Department goes, was more or less directly attributed to a house being closed up for ten years.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his Department, within the last ten days, has addressed a recommendation to the Leitrim <Col N="169" /> Board of Health that all second-hand clothing in the area should be thoroughly disinfected owing to the recent outbreak of typhoid fever in Carrick-on-Shannon?</P>

      <P>May I point out that in this matter the Minister made light of the whole question of second-hand clothing when dealing with the question on this night week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I stated that such regulations as had been brought into force, dealing with the importation of second-hand clothing, are based entirely on our general scheme for dealing with smallpox, and that no case has been made either in the House or by any member of the medical fraternity in the country, whether working under a local authority or not, that there was a danger to the public health because of a possible outbreak of typhoid fever arising out of the second-hand clothing trade.  If there are people in the country who think there is a danger to public health by typhus, typhoid or any other discase than smallpox, because of the second-hand clothing trade, let us hear about it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state the reason for the appointment, by sealed order, of an official of the Department in charge of the roads in the Balrothery area of Co. Dublin; if he will state the Act and the section of it under which the appointment was made, and how far this official's executive powers extend; also whether arising out of this appointment the Minister will state what steps are being taken to terminate the dispute with the Balrothery Council, and what immediate precautions are being taken to ensure the administration of Home Help in that area, so that the poor may not suffer in that area as a result of the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment was made on receipt of the following resolution from the Dublin County Council:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dublin County Council in pursuance of Section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1898, complain that the Balrothery Rural District Council have failed to make an estimate for road expenditure which would be sufficient to keep the roads in their district in good condition and repair, and appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of such resolution I was bound to make an Order limiting a time for the performance of the duty.  Such Order was made in pursuance of Section 82 (1) of the <Col N="171" /> Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, and Section 15 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1896, on the 10th April and issued to the Balrothery Rural District Council; the District Council having failed to comply with the Order I was required by the last mentioned Act to enforce it either by Writ of Mandamus or by the appointment of some person to perform the duty.  I decided to appoint an officer to perform the duty of the District Council in the matter of the complaint of the County Council.  Under the terms of the Order, the officer is required to formulate adequate and sufficient proposals for keeping in good condition and repair the trunk and link roads of the district in conformity with the recommendations in the report of the county surveyor, and to take all steps consequent on the making of such proposals that are necessary for the purpose of performing, according to the powers of the district council, their duty to keep such roads in good condition and repair.  The County Council on learning of the proposals formulated by the officer intimated, by resolution of the 16th instant, that they were rejecting such proposals, and I am now considering what further steps I should take to see that effect is given to the complaint which the County Council previously made to me.  It is understood that both the District Council and the Board of Guardians met yesterday and the latter made all necessary arrangements with respect to the distribution of outdoor relief.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if it is a fact that the delay in opening the limestone quarries in Gneeveguilla, Rathmore, Kerry, is due to the failure on the part of the Irish Land Commission to provide a suitable holding for Mrs. Cronin, Quarry Cross, Gneeveguilla, on whose lands the quarries are situate, and if he is <Col N="173" /> aware that residence on said lands would be impossible owing to quarry blasting operations; (b) if Mr. James Kelleher, Gleanriskeen, Rathmore, is seeking, through the Department, an exchange of lands; (c) and if Mrs. Cronin, at the request of the Irish Land Commission, has written offering acceptance of Kelleher's farm; (d) and if the Land Commission will now provide suitable accommodation for Mrs. Cronin, and incidentally assist the opening of these important quarries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The limestone quarry at Gneeveguilla referred to was conveyed by Lord Kenmare to trustees on behalf of tenant purchasers and tenants on his estates.  It is situated on the holding of John P. Cronin at Tooreenamult, Rathmore.  It was represented to the Land Commission some time ago by the trustees that, owing to the proximity of Cronin's house to the quarry, they were unable to carry on quarrying operations. The Land Commission stated they would do what they could to facilitate the re-opening of the quarry, but as Cronin had not purchased his holding under any of the Land Purchase Acts they were not in a position to take any action in the matter until the lands were returned by the landlord as coming under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923.  After repeated applications by the Land Commission the lands were so returned in February last, and with a view to expediting the resumption of quarrying operations the Land Commission decided to deal with the estate at once, but it will take some time to complete the proceedings for the purchase of the lands under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission did offer Mrs. Cronin an alternative holding in Offaly, but she refused to accept it, and they then proposed to build her a new dwellinghouse away from the quarry on the existing holding, but she was not satisfied with that proposal either.  The Land Commission have been informed by another party that James Kelleher was willing to exchange his holding at Gleanriskeen for another elsewhere, and <Col N="174" /> it was suggested that Mrs. Cronin should be given Kelleher's holding, but they have not received any communication from either Mrs. Cronin or Kelleher.  The matter will, however, be investigated immediately in connection with the sale proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is the opinion of the Dáil that the flour-milling industry should be protected by imposing a tariff on all imported flour, save flour admitted under special licence for biscuit manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that this motion was put by Deputy Lemass and myself on the Order Paper a short time after the discussion on the Report of the Tariff Commission advising against a tariff on imported flour.  That was many months ago. Some time afterwards Deputy T.J. O'Connell put down an amendment which deals with a wider question. It seems to us it is a pity that we should be compelled to vote as between these proposals by way of motion and amendment.  Deputy O'Connell's amendment deals not merely with the question of the protection of the flour-milling industry and a restriction on the importation of flour, but it also deals with the promotion of the growing of native wheat.  Our position in that matter is that we are largely at one with Deputy O'Connell.  Like him, we believe it is most important that the State should take the necessary steps to induce the growing of native wheat to a far greater extent than it is grown at the present time.  In fact, we put that as part of our general policy.  We are in the position now, with respect to the amendment, however, that we will be compelled to vote against it, although we agree largely with the main purpose of it.  We will be compelled to vote against it because we regard the putting of restrictions on the importation of flour as an urgent matter, as something <Col N="175" /> that can be done immediately, and as something in which we are likely to get a greater degree of agreement than in the case of wheat. It was on that account that at one stage Deputy Dr. Ryan withdrew proposals which he had put forward and now appear over his name in another motion on the Order Paper.  He put his proposals in a separate motion rather than let them go forward as a further amendment.</P>
    <P>We are sorry Deputy O'Connell could not see his way to allow these two questions&mdash;Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposals and his own amendment to this motion to be considered together.  We feel that it would be a very much better way of dealing with the question.  However, if Deputy O'Connell is not prepared to take that course we will have to deal with both proposals.  There is, of course, a certain advantage in doing that, but we must be clear in our minds as to the relation between the two matters.  It is clear that a proposal to restrict the importation of flour is a necessary addendum to or a necessary consequence on any proposal to promote the production of native wheat.  On the other hand, we think that even if the Dáil were not to agree to any scheme for State assistance towards the promotion of native wheat it would be necessary, in the general interest of the community, to prevent the present free importation of flour which tends to destroy our milling industry. The relation between the two is that the restriction on imports would be necessary as a part of a general scheme for providing our own flour supplies, partly through the growing of native wheat, but without any such scheme it would be advisable to have restrictions on the importation of flour, such as we propose in our motion.</P>
    <P>Our general attitude towards the whole question involved can be summarised by saying that we believe it is the best national policy to make ourselves as self-sufficing as possible in all vital economic matters. There is no matter, of course, more <Col N="176" /> vital than the question of food.  We are an agricultural country.  Our exports in 1927 in agricultural produce, articles of food, live animals, drink, etc., came to about £39,000,000 in round numbers.  It would be a very difficult thing, I think you will all agree, to expand that, so as to increase it by two-thirds.  Yet, we have a home market which would absorb just that amount.  We are importing no less than £26,000,000 worth of agricultural produce, while we are exporting £39,000,000 worth.</P>
    <P>We do not know why it should not be the policy of the State to see that this home market is captured.  We believe that it can be captured, and that not to capture it is to give employment to the stranger while our own people have to emigrate for want of work.  We have estimated that the net gain to the community in added wealth by producing those articles of agricultural produce at home which we needlessly import would amount to £6,000,000 yearly. That means that there would be employment given, even after making allowance for the partial employment that would become full-time employment&mdash;there would be extra employment given to a number of hands, and that number would run from 12,000 to 20,000.  Indeed, 12,000 would be a very low estimate.  Now, the employment of 12,000 hands is a thing that should not be disregarded. The possibility of employing 12,000 hands, or more likely up to 20,000 hands, is a possibility that should not be neglected in our present condition.</P>
    <P>That has regard to agricultural produce only.  If we go into the wider field of general manufactures we find that there are about £28,000,000 worth of manufactured goods, exclusive of food. drink, tobacco and agricultural produce, imported in the year for which we have the last completed figure, 1927.  If these were substituted by home products and home manufactured articles it would, we calculate, result in giving an increase of wealth to the community of about £14,000,000, and would give employment to anything from 60,000 to <Col N="177" /> 100,000 extra hands.  If we were to do that accordingly, if we were to make it our aim to become as self-sufficing economically as possible, and pursue that aim we would be able to provide a solution for our great unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>If we look at the list of imports we will see that the largest items are wheat, flour, maize and maize products. Wheat and flour alone account for seven millions of those imports. Being an agricultural country, we think that we ought to set out to supply these ourselves, apart altogether from the added consideration I have just hinted at, namely, that it is a vital matter and to see that the community will at all times have essential articles of food.  I think it was actually stated in the Report of the Tariff Commission that at the time of the general strike in England the total available supplies necessary for the making of bread did not amount to more than would be sufficient for the community for 27 days.</P>
    <P>At the present time, if we take the necessary figures and make a simple calculation, we come to the conclusion that the amount of wheat that is grown in the country at the present time would not supply the needs of the community for more than 12 days.  It seems to me that we ought not to allow ourselves to remain in that precarious position with respect to such a vital article of food as bread is.  It is not enough to be told that in case of necessity we could kill our cattle, or that we could use potatoes, perhaps, to a greater extent than they are being used at the present time.  We ought, it seems to me, provide so that the ordinary supplies will not be disturbed, that no foreign crises would disturb these supplies, and that they would run on continuously and smoothly in all circumstances. We are not in that position at the present time, and it is on that account that we should regard this protection of our milling industries as an urgent problem.</P>
    <P>Dealing with wheat would take more time, but there is hardly a doubt that we are acting most unwisely in allowing time to elapse <Col N="178" /> without taking the measures that are necessary to deal with the flour question. Since 1921, ten of our flour mills have closed down.  Since 1924, six have closed down.  When the discussion on this question was taking place before, I read extracts from statements that were made by the managing directors of certain large mills pointing to the dangers that lay ahead of them, and, in fact, indicating that unless the State intervened they could not continue at work and that they would have to close down.  That position still holds and, therefore, we are asking the members of the Dáil to examine this whole question carefully, and to ask themselves why, if we are satisfied that in other industries protection should be given, protection should not be given in this very vital industry also.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well before I come to deal with the flour question in detail to revert to the question of wheat.  Our proposals are given in the report which has been circulated &mdash;the Report of the Economic Committee. The main plan of the proposal was to guarantee to the farmer a definite price for his wheat, that price to be guaranteed for three years in advance.  If a definite price were guaranteed to the farmer, one of the principal objections that he has at the present time to the growing of wheat would disappear.  We know that there are fairly big fluctuations in the general prices of wheat, and as there is such a preference for the foreign wheat, as the majority of the millers have up to the present shown, the farmer is afraid that if he grew wheat he might find no buyer.  By these proposals you meet immediately his doubts as regards the market; you guarantee the market, and you guarantee him against any great fluctuations in price.</P>
    <P>I believe that with a guarantee of that kind given to the farmer, areas in this country which are suitable for wheat growing would be utilised for the growing of wheat.  In 1847, or about that time we grew well over 600,000 acres of wheat.  Last year we grew something about 31,000 acres of wheat.  I am giving the <Col N="179" /> round numbers.  The actual figures will be found in one part or another, I think, of the Report of the Economic Committee.  I can give them, but it is just as well that we should keep to the main items.  If you look at the map of the country showing the areas that grew wheat in 1847 you will find that by far the greater part of the Free State is suitable for wheat growing.  As I have said, you could guarantee the farmer a fixed price.  We know that there are over 600,000 acres of land which formerly grew wheat, which can now grow wheat also.  Our proposals were intended to provide for the promotion of wheat growing, extending over a period of about ten years.  We did not expect that we could get quick results.  We believed that time would be necessary, and that confidence would come from experience. We expect that the programme could not be worked out in much less than ten years.  In that time it was hoped that we could, by making a fixed price certain to the farmers, induce them to provide something like half our wheat requirements.  The amount that would be required to meet our present consumption, making allowance for seed, for a 70 per cent extraction of flour, and allowing 20 per cent. off for wheat which would be unsuitable for milling, would be 860,000 acres. Of course, the half of that would be 430,000 acres, and therefore, even to come to the point which we hope to reach within ten years, we would have to increase the cultivation of wheat up to 430,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The machinery by which we hope to achieve our objective was outlined in detail and can be found in the report. The reason why I am not going so fully into details here is because I think that will be more appropriate when we are dealing with Deputy Ryan's motion.  The whole machinery has been worked out, and that is why we think that Deputy Ryan's proposals and the proposals in the report are preferable to Deputy O'Connell's proposals.  Deputy O'Connell has made merely general <Col N="180" /> suggestions, whereas the other proposals have been worked out and all the machinery shown.  In the main, the machinery would consist of a wheat control board, which would be responsible for buying and re-selling such imported wheat as was necessary to make up the deficiency in our home supplies.  It would also have the duty of determining the fixed price that should be paid to the farmer for the three years in advance. It would have power to change that price upwards, if conditions demanded it, but it would not have the power of changing it downwards. That would be to ensure a supply, if some special conditions made the price originally guaranteed such that it would not be an economic proposition for farmers to grow the wheat.  The board would also have the duty of determining what sum should be paid to the millers to make up for the losses they might incur through the use of native wheat instead of foreign wheat. With that machinery, we see no reason why the whole scheme cannot be worked out.  Of course, objections have been made, but we do not think they have very much substance in them.  The main objection that has been made was that wheat is a precarious crop.  We are not satisfied that that is so to any greater extent than in the case of other crops.  We believe that if proper attention were given by the Department of Agriculture to developing proper strains of wheat risk in that respect could be obviated.</P>
    <P>In fact, experiments show, taking them over a considerable period, that the risks of failure in the case of wheat are not greater than the risks in the case of other grain crops.  It was also stated that wheat is a particularly severe crop on the land, and that it induces the growth of weeds.  We think that quite the contrary is the case, that a good crop of wheat smothers the weeds. and that you have only an excess of weeds where you have a particularly bad crop.  Statistics show that we are able to grow good crops of wheat and it is only in the case of bad crops that the question of dirty <Col N="181" /> land would arise.  On the other hand, an advantage in connection with wheat is the fact that it is the most suitable of the grain crops as a nurse crop for grass seeds.</P>

      <P>We have got people who have practical experience of the growing of wheat, and they will bear that out.  Another objection that was put up to the scheme was that an increase in the amount of land under grain would necessitate an increase in root crops beyond our requirements.  Again, that will not stand examination. The fact is that even in an ordinary four-course rotation you have grain twice for roots once, and there is room for an increase in the quantity of wheat grown to the required amount without any undue increase in root crops.  For instance, in Denmark the ratio of grain to roots is three to one, while the ratio in Ireland in the years 1847 to 1851 was ten to four.  When crops relatively greater and heavier than the crops of a later decade were grown, the acreage of root crops, when compared with grain, was only about forty-two per cent.  We hold, therefore, that that is really no objection. As regards the general question of climate, in other countries they have to face drought and frost, and everybody knows that the farmer, in one way or another, is dependent upon the weather. But to single out wheat specially in this manner is, in our opinion, simply a matter of prejudice, pure and simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I wish to deal only in very general terms at this stage with our wheat proposals.  I do so simply to indicate that we are largely at one with Deputy O'Connell in the <Col N="182" /> main purpose that he has in mind in his amendment, but we will vote against it, mainly because to allow it to pass would prevent us from dealing with what we regard as the immediate and the more urgent question of flour.  Now let us come to the question of flour.  I indicated at the outset that our mills are closing down, that the directors of some of our principal mills are anxious about the future.  There is only one mill in this country at present that is working at full capacity.  The average working of the other thirty-four mills is not up to sixty per cent. of their capacity.  It must be obvious to everybody that when the mills are working only fifty to sixty per cent. of their capacity the overhead charges must be such as to make it very difficult for them to compete with mills that are working at full capacity.  At the present time our flour supplies come mainly from the Liverpool mills.  As has been indicated already at one time or another in discussions on this matter, England was over-milled at the time of the Great War, and there has been competition among the biggest mills for the English trade, and also for our trade.  The result of that competition and of the desire to get a market has been that they cut down their prices to the very lowest when sending flour into this country, and in our report we show that there is not merely a cutting down to a small margin of profit, but that a process of dumping has actually been going on.  Figures have been given in the report of three specific instances where flour was sold in the Twenty-Six Counties at at least a shilling per sack less than the price at which it could be produced.  If that is to continue what the result will be is pretty clear.  The closing down of mills will be continued, and in the case of those which will survive, their fifty to sixty per cent. working capacity will be reduced still further, and the possibility of successfully competing with outside mills will become even more remote, so that finally our position will be that we will be practically completely dependent for our flour supplies on foreign sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> We hold that these conditions are such that it is our duty to put an end to them.  We believe that a moderate tariff on flour would prevent that unfair competition and would give our mills an opportunity of holding their trade.  At present our mills do not supply much more than fifty-two per cent. of our average consumption.  They are capable of supplying close on ninety per cent., and there is hardly any doubt that if the protection we demand were given to them they would be able in a very short time to meet the complete demand.  Is there any reason why that protection should not be given?  No really good reason was put forward in the former debate except one, and that was that it would cause a rise in the price of bread.  We believe that that need not necessarily follow, at least after the short period of reorganisation and readjustment to the new situation. But supposing it did, in view of the position we would have to face it.  I believe that it should be faced.  But we do not think that it will follow.  If you read the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal, and examine the diagrams showing the relations between the prices of flour and the prices of bread, you will notice that, over a period of two years, the prices of bread as compared with the prices of flour were unfavourable to the consumer and greatly favourable to the baker in twenty-one out of the twenty-four months given, and if you look at the amounts you will notice that they are greatly to the advantage of the baker in three months that were examined.</P>
    <P>Now, if we had this tariff, and particularly if we had a control board such as we have suggested in the case of wheat, the prices could largely be controlled, because the price at which the wheat and such flour as would be allowed in would be given to the millers on the one hand, and the bakers on the other&mdash; allowing for drops in prices or advances&mdash;could be so arranged that they would correspond definitely to a change in price of the loaf, so that <Col N="184" /> the curve showing the price of bread and the curve showing the price of wheat and flour would be absolutely parallel.  As I have indicated, there seems to us to have been no good case whatever put forward by those who have opposed the tariff, no good case whatever, except on the one matter of price.  As I have said, we have to face that.  I believe that if we face it, the results will not be those that have been anticipated, and that, if we take into the whole scheme wheat and flour, we can obviate them.</P>
    <P>Concluding then, our position is this: that wheat and flour are vital articles for the community.  They ought to be left in no unsafe position with respect to these supplies.  The amount of labour and employment that could be given is considerable; the amount of capital which is involved, and the replacement values of all the flour mills in the Free State, would be something like one and a half million pounds.  The present capital reserves of 29 of them is £1,700,000.  Now, we ought not to allow an industry of that importance to be jeopardised, and as I have said we ought not to allow the community to be placed in a precarious position with respect to a vital article of food, nor should we, when we protect other industries, allow an industry of this particular size and importance, to be neglected. As well, there is urgency.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the amount of extra employment that will be given will not be very great.  But it is obvious that the 1,700 hands at present employed part-time would, if the scheme of protection was put into force, be assured of whole-time employment.  If we do not protect the industry, a large proportion of them, anyhow, will be thrown out of employment.  But if we do protect it, these will be safeguarded in their employment.  They will be given whole-time employment instead of the part-time employment which they have at present.  It is also estimated that direct additional employment in the trade will be given to over 170 hands as an immediate consequence of protection. There are also the ancillary industries <Col N="185" /> to be considered.  There is no reason why the same sort of protection should not be given to them. In fact, the millers themselves are prepared to use Irish-manufactured articles, such as sacks and twine, and so on, which represent a considerable sum of money each year, so that on every ground we hold that this protection should be given.</P>
    <P>Several months have elapsed since this motion was put down, and we would ask Deputy O'Connell to reconsider his position with respect to the amendment&mdash;whether it would be wise on his part to defer taking action in connection with the import of flour until the wheat scheme is accepted.  We think that the industry is in grave danger at the present time, and that it would be most unwise to defer for a moment the putting on of this protective tariff, particularly when the putting on of that tariff would not be contradictory to, but would be supplementary to and really ancillary to the scheme for the promotion of the growth of native wheat which the Deputy has in mind.  If, however, the Deputy does not do that, then we will be compelled to vote against his amendment, and to wait until Deputy Dr. Ryan's motion comes along to press proposals for the protection of native wheat.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment which appears on the Order Paper in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all after &ldquo;it is the opinion of the Dáil that&rdquo; and to insert:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;it is expedient that special steps should be taken to promote the production of wheat and protect the flour-milling industry in the Saorstát and for these purposes the Executive Council is requested to formulate and submit to the Oireachtas proposals which will provide&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that a guarantee shall be given to wheat-growers in the Saorstát of a market at a paying price for wheat suitable for milling with the object of securing <Col N="186" /> that within ten years twenty per cent. of the country's wheat requirements shall be home-grown;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the full capacity of the flour mills in the Saorstát shall be utilised and to this end that the importation of flour shall be controlled by a State organisation;</P>
    <P>(c)  that it shall be obligatory upon the flour millers of the Saorstát to take a prescribed proportion of home-grown wheat;</P>
    <P>(d)  that special facilities shall be given to biscuit manufacturers to enable them to continue to import whatever flour they require for their industry at minimum market prices;</P>
    <P>(e)  that there shall be established a control over flour and bread prices so as to limit to a minimum the cost to the community necessitated by the guarantee of a paying price to wheat growers and the protection of the flour milling industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, in the course of his speech, seemed to criticise the action of the Labour Party in putting down this amendment.  It seemed to me that the greater part of the Deputy's speech was in favour of the amendment rather than of the motion, and that it had reference to the amendment rather than to the motion.  We could only judge what was in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party by what we saw on the Order Paper before us When we saw the motion on the Order Paper, a simple motion asking for the imposition of a customs tariff on imported flour, we felt what Deputy de Valera has admitted now, that the Fianna Fáil Party felt and fully believe, that this in itself was not a complete solution of the problem and did not purport to be.  But, as have said, we could only judge by the motion that we saw on the Order Paper.  It simply asks for the imposition of a customs tariff on imported flour.  That is a question that was examined at great length <Col N="187" /> by the Tariff Commission.  A report has been issued on it and, while the Commission seemed only to take into account by way of the advantage of a tariff, the extra employment that it would give, it seemed to them&mdash;that is their main reason for turning it down&mdash;that the amount of employment that it would give would not be sufficient to compensate for a possible increase on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I must say that, looking at it from that point of view alone, it did seem to us that the extra amount of employment that would be given, taking into account the 1,700 who would be given full-time employment and the extra 153 who would be employed, would not be sufficient to warrant the possible increase that might be imposed on the community by way of an increased price of the loaf made of home-manufactured flour, and we had to take into account that the imposition of a tariff might lead to the concentration of the milling industry at the ports, an amalgamation of mills, perhaps, and the introduction of more efficient machinery, which would mean that from the point of view of labour alone the increase would not be very great.  Consequently we felt that there was something more than a mere tariff on flour to be considered, and that bound up with the milling industry was the encouragement of the growth of wheat, which would have the effect of increasing the supply of home-grown breadstuffs, as well as an extension of tillage, an increase in the productive wealth of the country, and, as a consequence, a decrease in the adverse trade balance. Hence we believe that a tariff on flour should not be taken by itself, but that it should be bound up with the more important issue of the encouragement of the growth of wheat.  Deputy de Valera suggests that I should withdraw this amendment and let the other one go, but is it not much more obvious that Deputy de Valera should withdraw his motion and accept my amendment <Col N="188" /> as a substantive motion?  My amendment contains what is in his motion, but it contains much more. If the Deputy will read the amendment he will find that it makes provision for the protection of the flour-milling industry, and on the question of urgency the only point he makes is that to allow my amendment to pass would be to prevent us from dealing with what we regard as the more urgent question.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera did not show how the passing of my amendment would prevent him or the country from dealing with the more urgent question.  I cannot see why, if this amendment is passed, it will not meet the point that Deputy de Valera has in view, and even do something more.  So far as our proposals are concerned, they differ essentially in one or two respects from those proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is, for instance, the question of a control board. I do not know what special reason the Fianna Fáil Party have for making that control board a limited liability company rather than an organisation or a board which will work in the interests of the community as a whole.  Is it that they are rather nervous of being, as some might say, tarred with the brand of State socialism?  Are they afraid of the term?</P>
    <P>What is the particular object of a limited liability company?  Is it going to be a profit-making institution? Is it going to work in the interests of the community as a whole?  Is it going to be under the control of the State in any way? Why a limited liability company? That is one of the things I cannot understand.  I wish some of the speakers who are to follow would explain why the board that is to control the importation of flour and wheat is to be a limited company, and the measure of control which the people of the State will have over that limited company?  Is it to be a profit-making institution, and if not, how are its profits to be controlled?  We suggest that any such organisation should be controlled by the State&mdash;under the control <Col N="189" /> of the community as a whole. That is nothing new in this country, or in other countries.  There is no objection to it, but there may be the possible objection that one might say that here we are landed into socialism.  My friend on the right would regard that as a final tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There is one other point in which our proposals would differ from those in Deputy Ryan's motion, that is, in regard to the percentage of wheat which should be incorporated in home-milled flour.  We take it that 20 per cent. is a more practical proposition and is more likely to be achieved inside a period of ten years than the 50 per cent. which the Fianna Fáil Party propose.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the 20 per cent. or the period of ten years within which that figure would be reached.  There would be time to see whether that figure was possible of attainment or whether it might be increased.  It has been selected because it represents approximately the acreage which was under cultivation during the war years.  It is safe, I think, to assume that the land that was brought into wheat cultivation in those years was on the whole suitable for wheat growing, and that all the land that was suitable for wheat-growing was used for that purpose at that time, so that we think on the whole the 20 per cent. figure is a more suitable one to aim at than 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was shown to us definitely that 50 per cent. was attainable, we would be glad that 50 per cent. should be grown rather than 20 per cent.  The proposals in the amendment do not pretend to be explicit or definite or worked out to the last detail, and I do not think Deputy de Valera's scheme, unless he has his proposals worked out somewhere else, are either.  I have not seen them worked out to the last detail anywhere. They do not pretend to be and it will be noted they enunciate nothing more than general principles, and the Executive Council, as <Col N="190" /> the authority for the time being in the State, is asked, if the Dáil accepts the principles, to submit proposals showing the detailed working out of the scheme. The objects to be attained are two-fold: the encouragement of the milling industry and the encouragement of wheat-growing in the Free State with the consequent extension of the area under tillage.</P>
    <P>Someone will ask: Why encourage the growth of wheat instead of any other crop?  The answer seems to be obvious&mdash;that wheat is a crop which provides a suitable product to be consumed by the people.  There is, therefore, an assured home market for wheat.  It is sometimes said: Why not encourage the growth of oats?  I submit that there is no analogy.  We are practically supplying our home market with oats.  Comparatively speaking, the quantity of oats imported is small.  The proposal set out here is that the importation of flour should be controlled.  It may not be necessary to impose a tariff. If the importation of flour is controlled by a board, that board will admit into the country the amount of flour required in the country to make up the deficiency in the amount which millers can supply. The Irish millers will be told to go ahead and to work at their full capacity.  The balance of the flour required for the community will be imported and put on the market by the control board.  This will serve another purpose.  If the millers, taking advantage of the position in which they are placed, are inclined to charge an unreasonable price for flour, the control board, by admitting to the market an increased supply of flour, can check the price which the millers will be allowed to charge.  For instance, if the Irish millers are charging an unreasonable price for the flour, the control board will say that if they continue to charge that price the board will admit an increased amount of imported flour on the market and undersell them.  That will have the effect of checking the price charged by the millers.  There is no reason, from the <Col N="191" /> point of view of urgency, as pointed out by Deputy de Valera, why a scheme of that kind could not be made operative within a year, and why the flour mills in the State could not within a year or a year and a-half be working at full capacity, if the importation of flour were controlled as we suggest in our amendment.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any practical difficulty in that scheme, and, personally, I think that that is a better way of putting the milling industry on its feet than the mere imposition of a customs tariff&mdash;that the flour imported into the country should be controlled, and only such amount let into the market as the Irish mills fail to supply.  Even when they are working at full capacity, until new mills are established, or the existing plants and buildings extended, there will be something like 300,000 sacks of flour that would need to be imported.  The second portion of our proposition&mdash;it has been already touched upon by Deputy de Valera&mdash;is that the farmer should be encouraged to grow wheat, and that arrangements should be made whereby all the wheat suitable for the market which the farmers would produce would be purchased in the country, and for that purpose that it should be laid down by this control board that a certain proportion&mdash;the proportion to depend upon the amount of wheat produced and the amount of wheat available&mdash;of home-grown wheat should be incorporated by the flour mills of the Free State. It will be held, no doubt, that there are various objections to that proposal, that it will mean control of various kinds and an increase of officials.  I think that these objections are magnified.  I have studied very carefully the reports of the Economic Committee, and I think the arguments used in the majority report are in the main largely superficial. We were told, for instance, that an individual farmer might do better by growing some other crop. There seems to be too much of that looking to the individual farmer rather than to the good of the community <Col N="192" /> as a whole.  It has been argued, too, that the farmer who would be asked to pay may not benefit from the growing of wheat. Farmers and other taxpayers are asked to pay for a great many things from which they do not directly benefit, but from which the country as a whole benefits.  The Mayo farmer pays for the Army, but he does not benefit very much from that payment, while Deputy Colohan's constituents may benefit very considerably from it.</P>

      <P>The farmers of Galway and Mayo do not benefit very much from the subsidy paid to the farmers in Kildare and Carlow for the growing of beet.  The particular argument, that the man who has to pay does not benefit very often directly from the payment of a subsidy, can be pushed very far and too much can be made of it.  I think that what we should take into account is the organisation of the State as a whole, and it has yet to be pointed out to me that if the wealth of the country can be increased, as it can undoubtedly, by the production of wheat, the country as a whole will not benefit by it.  I do not pretend to be anything in the way of an expert on these matters, any more than many other Deputies. While Deputy de Valera was speaking, Deputy Mathews was inclined perhaps to make light of the views of Deputies like Deputy de Valera or myself on agricultural matters. Perhaps if Deputy Mathews and myself were put into an acre of land and told to live on it, I might make a better hand at knocking a living out of it.  In any case, it does not require a great deal of agricultural skill to grow grass on the plains of Meath.</P>

There is an industry that is fast going out of the country, or will go out of the country, unless some steps are taken to encourage or protect it&mdash;that is the milling industry. There is an advantage in maintaining our inland mills.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy leaves wheat and comes to flour, the amendment states:&mdash;&ldquo;That a guarantee shall be given to wheat-growers in the Saorstát of a market at a paying price.&rdquo;  Would the Deputy indicate the price, because the whole question of cost hinges on that, and I think the Deputy would agree that that is a consideration to be taken into account in seeing whether it is in the national interest or not.  He has not indicated a price and, therefore, the cost of this.</P>

      <P>Experience might prove it, perhaps, to be too much or too little, but I am suggesting it as a fairly reasonable figure, in the circumstances. Working on that basis, I think that the cost of the proposals which I suggest would at the maximum be less than half a million.  But, as against that, wheat to the value of one-and-a-half millions would be produced in the country, and there <Col N="194" /> would be a net gain for the farmers and the community as a result of the operations of the subsidy.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches that instead of my withdrawing my amendment in favour of their motion for a Customs tariff, the proper course would be for them to accept my amendment as a more practical and a more comprehensive motion.</P>

      <P>Even though it is myself that says it, because it does, what I say they want&mdash;it includes protection of the milling industry.  It can be done urgently.  There is no question of degrees of urgency involved. Their suggestion can be put in operation no more rapidly than mine, and it does commit the Dáil to the principles which are embodied in my amendment, and which I think are of greater importance than the mere question of the imposition of a tariff on flour.</P>
      <P>The object is, as I have said, to encourage wheat growing in the country, to encourage an increase in tillage, to encourage consequent employment in the country.  And it must appeal to the townsman as well as to the countryman, because if agriculture is our main and staple industry, as it is, any increase in the prosperity of agriculture is bound to react upon the towns, and if employment in the rural areas is increased it will mean that there is less pressure on the towns from unemployed people coming up from the farms to the towns and a greater chance for the townsmen to get employment at a reasonable wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Dáil would be well advised to pass this amendment, which asks the Dáil to consider proposals whereby these two objects, which I suggest are laudable objects in the interests of the community as a whole, would be effected, and to examine into the machinery which would be required to give effect to them.  It must be admitted on all sides that these are objects well worthy of being considered in <Col N="195" /> the interests of the community as a whole.  This would not be the only country in which that was done, and has been found to be successful in the interests of particular communities. We have had it in other countries, and there is no reason why we, situated as we are, seeing that it would be to the benefit and for the advantage of all within the State, should not put these proposals into operation in this country.</P>

      <P>In fact I do not know why it was not moved.  We have had a rather amusing conflict between Deputy de Valera and Deputy O'Connell as to why Deputy de Valera's motion should be preferred to Deputy O'Connell's amendment, and a further day left for Deputy Ryan to develop his Fianna Fáil policy with regard to wheat.  Is it that we can only have in this House a policy really valuable when it comes under the Fianna Fáil auspices? Is there anything except jealousy in this matter of urging Deputy O'Connell to withdraw what he rightly says is the more comprehensive motion, and in voting for which, whether it is preferred as the better motion or not, Deputy de Valera does not in any way detract from the urgency of his own resolution with regard to the milling situation? It is much the more comprehensive. It was tabled prior to <Col N="196" /> Deputy Ryan's; it indicated a policy thought out, considered and exemplified in a motion before the House prior to that of Deputy Ryan.  It includes the motion which Deputy de Valera has set down, and it was the obvious thing to set down after the Adjournment motion on the report of the Tariff Commission. Deputy de Valera to-day states that the only argument against the tariff on flour is the question of a possible, or, as we say, a certain increase in the cost of flour and a necessary increase in the cost of bread.  In that Deputy de Valera follows very closely on the Tariff Commission themselves, who in their report say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The main difficulty which confronted us in dealing with this application and has prevented us from recommending in its favour is the smallness in the increase in the number of persons likely to be employed in consequence of a tariff, together with our disbelief that the additional output secured by a tariff to the Saorstát mills would enable them to reduce their cost of production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tariff Commission would probably have been more precise if they had stated &ldquo;to prevent a rise in the price of flour.&rdquo;  I say that the other necessarily follows.  Deputy de Valera has used an argument to-day to try to disprove that contention. What does that argument amount to?  Simply to this: That if one reads the report of the tribunal on prices and takes the calculation set out there with regard to the cost of the loaf in comparison with certain given costs of flour it is clear that the bakers have been getting inordinate profits and that we should take some of these profits from them and so cover up the increase in the price of flour which is likely to arise from protection of the flour-milling industry.  That is not presenting the case fairly to the public.  It is not right to say, even if that did occur, that the public to some extent are being fleeced for the benefit of the Irish millers.  I use the word <Col N="197" />&ldquo;fleeced&rdquo; because I think that the report of the Tariff Commission pointed out that in their judgment the mills here are neither well equipped, well situated, nor well managed.  If the price of bread at this moment in relation to the price of flour is too high it should be brought down.  Let us assume that it has been brought down and that there is a figure at which bread is being sold.  Is that going to be increased or not by a tariff?  That is the way the question should be looked at, in order to arrive at a proper conclusion as to whether it will cause an increase.  It should not be camouflaged by saying &ldquo;The bakers' profits are too high.  Let us take it out of them and let them reduce their profits and pay for the increased price of flour which must inevitably come about if the requirements of the country are to be met by the flour millers in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Merely to put forward that argument in order to hide the increased cost of bread is an admission in itself that Deputy de Valera believes that there is going to follow, on the granting of a tariff on flour, an increase in the price of flour.  If the public have a right to get bread more cheaply with flour at its present price, let that be tackled as a separate item.  It is a different question. All sorts of figures and calculations have been given in relation to the present price of bread, but I am not convinced that the price of bread in relation to the price of flour is too high except in the city of Cork.  That is a particular problem in itself, and it is complicated by a variety of considerations, such as labour costs, output per man, the number of loaves to the sack, and so forth. Generally speaking, one is up against all sorts of ludicrous comparisons with the loaf baked on the other side, which is made under entirely different conditions.  The Tariff Commission Report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main difficulty which confronted us in dealing with this application, and has prevented us from recommending in its favour, is the smallness in the increase <Col N="198" /> in the number of persons likely to be employed in consequence of a tariff, together with our disbelief that the additional output secured by a tariff to the Saorstát mills would enable them to reduce their costs of production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am changing that to the price of flour for the purpose of clarifying the argument.  We have a Minority Report presented by portion of the Economic Committee.  We are told by the people who signed it that from the evidence given before the Committee it appears that in the more efficiently equipped and better situated mills the result in the reduction in cost would be much more substantial than the 18 per cent. which, the Tariff Commission state, the applicants claimed would result. The Minority Report of the Economic Committee states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem, therefore, that if a tariff on imported flour were imposed for a period only, to enable the mills to reach their maximum production, and then removed, they would be placed in a much stronger position to meet foreign competition, and the more efficient of them might be well able to hold the position thus gained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is the test sentence, and best conveys the opinion of the people who signed the Minority Report on this item.  Can the Free State mills as they exist&mdash;even the best of them&mdash;under prohibition which would grant them this situation in which they would work at their maximum capacity, produce flour at a cost equivalent to what it could be imported at from the other side?  The answer to my mind is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Read the sentence.  They state that the more efficiently equipped and better situated mills would have a reduction in cost bigger than 18 per cent.  They put up this position to themselves, and they answer it in this very reserved way: &ldquo;If a tariff on imported flour were imposed for a period only, to enable the mills to reach their maximum <Col N="199" /> production, and then removed, they would be placed in a much stronger position to meet foreign competition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Grant them a period in which they will work to full production and be able to get their costs down more than 18 per cent.  We are, of course, speaking of the more efficient mills.  Give them that position and remove the tariff.  Do the five who signed the report say that they could then stand on their own feet?  They do not.  They say that they would be placed in a much stronger position to meet foreign competition, and that the more efficient might well be able to hold the position thus gained.  I think that that is the test question for the consumers in the country.</P>
    <P>Can we get the Free State mills &mdash;equipped as they are, situated as they are and managed as they are, into that position by giving them a tariff for a certain period to enable them to work to their maximum capacity and then removing the tariff&mdash;to produce flour which, when selling costs are added to the costs of manufacture, could be sold at a price equal to that of flour on the other side which has its manufacturing costs and freight charges to meet.  The answer of the minority group is: &ldquo;They might well be able to hold the position thus gained.&rdquo; That reads peculiarly when taken in conjunction with another paragraph. Paragraph 13, page 20 of this report, after stating that the British millers possess certain counter-balancing advantages, goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to us, however, that no circumstances exist to prevent an efficient mill in the Saorstát, working at full capacity, being able to produce and market flour here at a price capable of competing successfully with British flour, if British flour is sold at rates which give a reasonable return to the producers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the difference in the two paragraphs?  The efficient mill. What are we being asked to do by <Col N="200" /> the motion which has been put before us to-day?  Remember that we are settling the industrial future of the country.  We are asked to take a group of mills which have presented their case before the Tariff Commission which was set up to inquire into all the facts and circumstances put before them.  These mills were invited to produce witnesses and to send in statements.  They have had before them the counter-balancing statements of their opponents, and they were asked to comment on them. I do not think that we ought to discuss the question of management at this stage as it would not do any good, but on the question of site and equipment, two matters that can be rectified, if the mills here are not so placed or equipped as to hold their own with their British competitors, and even taking into consideration the question of freight charges which gives them a definite preference as against flour coming in from the other side, we are asked to take a group of mills which are not properly situated and equipped, and to give them protection.  We are to hold off the competition which might mean the weeding out of some of them, and even the Minority Report considers that desirable.  That might bring the best of them into the position required by renewing machinery, by getting better situation and by placing them at the water's edge, if necessary, to compete successfully with their foreign rivals.  We are not asked to improve the industry, but to give protection which will prevent competition coming in on these people.  The Tariff Commission referred not merely to fair but also to unfair competition of the dumping type.  Has the Economic Committee added anything by way of proving dumping?</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera speaks of three specific instances.  Three instances were given by one witness.  His figures and his costings were challenged but the particular figures which were given and which.  I think, were completely and entirely adopted by the witness, are given here on pages 15 and 16 of the second part of the report. <Col N="201" /> There are slight changes, but they are substantially the same. The Majority Report shows, at any rate, the questions that had to be taken into consideration when coming to a conclusion as to whether dumping had been proved in these three instances.  At the start, there is the very big question of the price of wheat and there is a figure of 46/5 mentioned.  The Majority Report states that wheat at that time was sold at 44/6.  It is impossible to determine whether the consignment mentioned was made from the 44/- or the 46/- wheat.  It says, however, that the two big items &ldquo;working at mill&rdquo; and &ldquo;conversion ex ship&rdquo; amounted to 1/9.  They were quoted previously at 2/- and in the opinion of the Economic Committee were placed at twice the figure they should have been.  There is no evidence of dumping given in these three instances.  One witness came before us with regard to dumping, and his figures were challenged.  The two items that have to be taken into consideration can be read but the impression created on the minds of the majority of the Committee was that the allegation of dumping, in so far as it related to these three cases, had not been proved.</P>
    <P>Previously, the applicants for a tariff on flour had leave to go before the Tariff Commission and make their case on oath there.  In the report of the Tariff Commission, page 16, paragraph 26, it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Applicants claim that the British millers instead of meeting the problem by restricting their output are in fact individually striving to keep their manufacturing and overhead expenses low by working their plant as near to full capacity as they possibly can and that a large proportion of the output of the Merseyside mills is exported to the Saorstát at prices with which they cannot compete and with which, as frequently being less than the cost of the article, they ought not to be expected to compete.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They conclude, after having heard the evidence given by the witnesses <Col N="202" /> on behalf of the applicants:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No clear and definite examples of such undercutting have been placed before the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We got one man who came before us.  His figures were challenged, and they are there.  The Majority Report ends&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If satisfactory evidence were forthcoming that the practice was widespread or that it had been maintained over a period, the State could not remain indifferent to it, but a case for governmental interference on this ground has not, in our opinion, been established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a definite promise implied that if the case be established, there certainly would be governmental interference.</P>

      <P>The State took steps, and no example of under-cutting came before us.  I do not know if I grasped precisely what Deputy Hennessy meant, but I take it that he was referring to certain allegations with regard to certain consignments of flour.  That case suffers from exactly the same objection as these special cases referred to by the Economic Committee, that the particular consignments of flour cannot be related to particular cargoes of wheat.  That is the biggest fault in the figures.  One could take the ruling price, and so on, but nobody would allege dumping, and there would be no case for State interference on the few examples shown over widely-spread periods where, at any rate, it could be said that the flour was made from other cargoes of wheat, the price of which was less than the cost of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but can we say that a consignment of flour, sent to Galway, related to a particular wheat price on a particular day? That is where I think the flaw is in the argument.  At any rate, let us have a number of examples, not merely three.  Take the position as it is.  Witnesses appeared before the Tariff Commission and the applicants there put forward their best case.  The Tariff Commission stated that no clear example of undercutting came before them.  Another Committee was set up.  We invited one person who we were told could sustain a charge of dumping to come before us, and he gave three instances. That particular individual had experience of the flour trade in this country for many months, at any rate, and out of an experience of many months he could only pick three instances.  Will anybody say that the three instances coming before the Economic Committee, and no instance coming before the Tariff Commission, are sufficient grounds for anybody coming to the conclusion that dumping on any scale is going on in the country?  The Tariff Commission wound up that paragraph by saying:</P>
      <P>The view taken by us is that the bigger capital and production of these mills and their greater efficiency enable them to quote lower terms without resorting to dumping or selling without profit, and that it was for the applicants to substantiate these allegations, and this they have failed to do.</P>
      <P>Let this question be separated from that of tariffs generally.  Apart from the tariff generally, there certainly should be protection against dumping.</P>

      <P>The less economic mills find themselves in a very precarious position, while some of them have gone out of business.  The reaction of this state of affairs on milling in the future was not easy to determine precisely, though some of the results are obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The results are obvious in the sense that flour is coming in here at a rate with which Irish mills cannot compete, and no question of dumping had been proved.  I would like to separate dumping from tariffs generally. Dumping may be effected in a variety of ways.  We have dumping from countries with depreciated currencies. You may have dumping caused by selling here at a price which is equivalent to the cost of production, without making any allowance for sending it across and unloading it here.  Dumping can also be caused by a peculiar freight charge that would give a preference to imported materials.  Another class of dumping would be that caused where a bounty is given in certain countries in respect of certain products. In any case, dumping is something which should be shown and should be treated apart from tariffs. There should be anti-dumping measures or anti-dumping legislation, but there is no case of dumping made out in the matter of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigations of the Tariff Commission, plus the investigations of the Economic Committee, resulted in what is explained here in pages 15 and 16 of the report and what is in <Col N="205" /> some way dealt with in another page of the Majority Report.  Let me get back to what I said was the kernel of the whole question.  The minority of the Economic Committee do not believe&mdash;they do not state they believe&mdash;that after allowing even the more efficient and better situated of the Irish mills to work to the full capacity they would be in a position to withstand foreign competition again if the barrier of a tariff were removed.  They say afterwards there is no reason why an efficient mill working at full capacity should not be in a position to produce and market flour here at a price capable of competing successfully with the British flour.  That, I presume, refers to dumping.  Also, the minority of the Economic Committee state that they can see no reason why the Saorstát mills would not be able to compete successfully with the foreigners, though they do say earlier that the best situated and best equipped of the present mills&mdash;they do not venture on the statement that they would be able, given some period in which they would get to work at full capacity, to maintain themselves&mdash; could not stand up against the foreigners.</P>
    <P>Surely that shows something wrong with the mills in the country? If we are here settling the industrial future of the mills, are we going to stereotype them in their bad situation, in their bad equipment and in their ill-management, if there is ill-management in some of them?  Should we not get some spur put on them, or if necessary offer them some inducement and get their mills brought to better sites and have better equipment and more economical working? Give economics a little bit of play, and if necessary let the uneconomic concerns go to the wall. See if the best of them can manage. Give it to us without any bad effect upon the consumer&mdash;and the bad effect is unnecessary if the mills are put in order.  The Minority Report of the Economic Committee says: &ldquo;From every point of view the case for an import duty on flour appears <Col N="206" /> to us to be overwhelming.  It would benefit the community as a whole by increasing the net production of wealth in the Saorstát by about £400,000 a year.&rdquo;  Then it goes on to say &ldquo;it would give the farmers the advantage of a plentiful supply of corn offals at lower prices, with beneficial results on the dairying, pig-raising and poultry-keeping industries.&rdquo; Everybody would agree that it would benefit the country as a whole if the net production of wealth in the country could be increased. Similarly, everybody would agree that if the farmers are given corn offals at lower prices that it would benefit them, and similarly everybody would agree that if security and increased earning power could be given to 2,000 employees that that would be a great benefit, and a benefit to be desired, if we could reduce the risk inherent in outside concerns.</P>
    <P>But why should we get all these things in the present admittedly bad condition of the Irish mills?  We can get all these things by getting our mills into a position in which they can compete successfully with outside flour millers.  The Minority Report says that the signatories believe that no circumstances exist to prevent an efficient mill in the Saorstát working at full capacity to compete with the foreign mills.  I hope the Report of the Tariff Commission is not going to be the end of the question as to the production of flour in this country or the ability of the flour millers to produce flour. I hope even this debate is not going to be the end of it.  But I do not think it is right for us to impose upon the consumers, simply because the mills are badly equipped, badly situated and badly managed, a burden that they would not and should not have to bear if these mills were well equipped, well situated and well managed.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report on page 20 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was not our intention in submitting proposals for a tariff to keep in production mills which because of their poor equipment, <Col N="207" /> bad situation or indifferent management, should be allowed to disappear. We believe that within a comparatively short time after the duty is first imposed the flour milling industry in the Twenty-Six Counties will be in the hands of a smaller number of large well-equipped mills, capable of producing flour and offals at a cost very little, if at all, in excess of the cost of production in the present Merseyside mills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minority Report admits that there are certain mills in the country which ought to disappear, and which under their proposals for a tariff are likely to disappear.  The Tariff Commission report only goes a step further, and says that more of them ought to disappear, and that their disappearance will be for the benefit of the remainder; the survivors of them will benefit by that disappearance, and the people employed in the milling will benefit, and it will definitely and clearly be for the benefit of the consumer of bread.  Instead of getting on to that condition of things we are going to stereotype bad management and more bad milling in this country by simply blindly going ahead with the tariff. Under the tariff we will wipe out some of them.  Under the tariff some of them will be weeded out.  I think that is clear to everybody.  It is time for the millers to put their houses in order before they come to the State for protection, which protection must be given to them at the expense of the consumers.</P>
    <P>I have invited the millers to make use of the Trade Facilities Act or any other Act, or to put up proposals whereby they will be enabled, if they think a change is going to benefit their business, to remove their mills from their present situation, and then to see that they are well managed and well equipped.  Let those that are ill-managed get a little more business method into their mills.  I do not know to what number of them that applies.  I know it applies to some of them.  We have in the country an example of a mill <Col N="208" /> situated not very advantageously.  I would not even say that this mill is equipped in the most up-to-date or efficient way.  But this mill is so well-managed that the owners do not wish to appear as advocates for a tariff on flour.  Now, I do not think that this mill would be considered one of the really up-to-date flour mills so far as equipment is concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of employment must be looked to.  The Tariff Commission themselves referred to that.  They say &ldquo;the smallness of the increase in the number of persons likely to be employed in consequence of a tariff, together with our disbelief that the additional output secured by a tariff to the Saorstát mills would enable them to reduce their costs of production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread,&rdquo; compelled them to refuse the application.  If the bread which the community consumes is to be at a higher charge in this country, and if the benefit to be derived from that charge upon the people of the country is going to be spread over a great number of people, if we were going to indicate any considerable hole in the number of unemployed at the moment, even if there is going to be a higher charge upon the community, the problem would deserve consideration; but we find that the claim made for the tariff is that at a maximum 153 additional persons are to be employed. I am not minimising the effect of the increased employment, but people now in employment are only part-time employed.  The figure of an extra £100,000 in wages is given.</P>
    <P>That is considerable, but set against it the cost to the community, argued to be about £300,000.  We come, therefore, to this point, that the best opinion seems to be that if milling is to be conducted in an efficient fashion, it ought to be attempted in a small number of well-equipped and advantageously-situated mills, and that the numbers to be employed eventually may be lower than the numbers at present employed in the scattered mills. The <Col N="209" /> difference would be, of course, that the smaller number would probably be full-time as opposed to the 1,500 or 1,600 employed part-time now.  The effect of a flour tariff on the unemployment situation is so small as to be negligible, and it is absurd in comparison with the cost to be imposed on the community.</P>
    <P>A point made by the applicants before the Tariff Commission, which is referred to in the Minority Report, is that apart from the question of dumping, one must compare, not the price at which flour is sold here, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the price at which English flour at the moment can be sold here, but the sale price here compared with the price at which English flour would be sold if the Irish market were taken from them. That, I think, is a wrong argument. The number of bread consumers here is relatively a small thing in comparison with the population of England.  If one takes the ordinary automatic increase in the population of England, Scotland and Wales, whatever offsetting disadvantage there might be for a very short period in the absence of the Irish consumption, it would soon be regained by the increase in population on the other side.  To whatever extent that is an argument, I think it is an argument that should not be stressed.  It is not stressed in this report, but it was stressed by the applicants before the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>I am still of opinion that the Tariff Commission properly advised that the application for an import duty on flour should not be granted. I am still of opinion that their advice was justified, and justified on two grounds.  They were justified mainly on one ground, but with some weight to be added to the second.  They were justified mainly on the ground that there was going to be an increase in the price of flour, and, consequently, in the price of bread, and they were somewhat justified on the ground that the increased employment was going to be negligible.  We will leave out of this question altogether the matter <Col N="210" /> of biscuit manufacture and Jacob's as a firm.  Both proposals before the House indicate that they are going to give special facilities to biscuit manufacturers, so that they can import anything they may require. There is nothing, therefore, involved in this simple motion of any special difficulty in relation to the question of biscuit manufacture. Biscuit manufacturers are going to be dealt with separately if there is going to be a tariff.  It is simply a problem of a tariff on flour and an increase in the price of flour which the Commission has decided would inevitably follow and which the majority of the Economic Committee decided would follow.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report of the Committee implies in effect that there would be an increase in the cost of flour.  I say that an attempt has been made to hide the effect of that from the public by saying that there need not necessarily be an increase in the price of bread.  There are people who believe that the price of bread has been too high for some time past.  If it has been too high, what one must look to is what price the bread should have been sold at, and will that price go up by reason of a tariff on flour and a necessary increase in the cost of flour?  I think it must be admitted that that price will go up.  The price of bread at the moment should be taken away from these consideration.  It is first of all founded on the statement that bread is at present being sold at too high a rate.  It is very hard to prove that, and I doubt if it can be proved except in one place.  Even if it were, it is involving and clouding the argument to use that point. One should look to what would be the increased cost to the community of the tariffed article, and not to the tariffed article after it has gone through one, two or three processes, with the argument made that as regards one of the processes too much has been charged and some of the profits can be knocked off.  Let us take the price at which bread should then be sold and let us query whether it would be raised or not if the tariff on flour were granted.  I <Col N="211" /> believe it would; the Tariff Commission recorded its belief that it would; the Majority Report of the Economic Committee recorded its opinion that it would; and the Minority Report, while saying that it would not, admitted, I think, by implication, that it would.  Therefore we get agreement as between the majority and the minority of the Committee on the point that at the moment the Irish mills are not capable of producing flour at a price which will compare with our English neighbours.  I think also that we get agreement, if there are no circumstances here which would render that situation inevitable or unavoidable, that there is no reason why Irish mills should not be so efficiently conducted as to compete with English mills.  But it is not being done, and we are asked to protect the mills that are here. I say if we protect them we are stereotyping for a very long time the existing badly-situated, badly-equipped and badly-managed mills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that it is not the mills which are there now that we are asking the State to protect; nor do we think the imposition of a tariff would stereotype the existing situation in the industry. I would like to ask the Minister why he considers it his duty to act the part of devil's advocate against proposition for the encouragement and development of Irish industry.  He says we will get all the advantages which are mentioned in the last paragraph of the Minority Report as following from a tariff on flour by other methods. He does not indicate&mdash;he did not consider it necessary to indicate&mdash; the other method which should be followed.  If these advantages can be secured from a tariff on flour, then until some other and better method has been placed before the House, the proposition to put a tariff on flour the field.  No other proposition has been put forward. I am quite certain if there was any other proposition in the mind of the Minister it would have <Col N="212" /> been put forward.  He was merely straining a bad case in order to cover up and to justify the action which the Ministry took in accepting the Report of the Tariff Commission&mdash;accepting it apparently without adequate consideration.</P>
      <P>Let us examine for a moment the position the Tariff Commission had to deal with and the position we have to deal with.  The Tariff Commission was established to consider an application for a tariff on flour which was submitted by the Irish Flour Millers' Association.  That is not our function; we have nothing to do with the case put up by the Irish Flour Millers' Association.  We have to consider the case for a tariff on flour as public representatives who are anxious to preserve the national interest.  The Irish Flour Millers' Association is composed of the proprietors of mills throughout the country&mdash;good mills and bad mills&mdash;and they may be good proprietors and bad proprietors; they may be associated with efficient or inefficient concerns.  The case they had to put up was obviously a case with which every one of their members would agree.  They could not put forward a case to suit the efficient mills only; they had to make their application so that it would cover every member of the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their case, therefore, was defective; it was bad, and it was that case which the Tariff Commission considered and rejected.  If we find the majority of the Economic Committee basing their arguments, not upon the examination of the problem which they themselves conducted, but upon the examination of the Irish flour millers' case which was conducted by the Tariff Commission, then we can only come to the conclusion that the majority had themselves no argument to put forward against the proposal.  I hope no Deputy will be influenced by the fact that the proposals which were submitted to the Economic Committee were rejected by a majority of that body.  I think I am correct in stating that the majority of those <Col N="213" /> who signed the Majority Report did so giving as their ground that they were opposed to tariffs on principle and their signatures have nothing whatever to do with the arguments that are advanced there.  It is because they were opposed to tariffs in principle&mdash;and, of course, it is possible that they were put upon the Committee because of that&mdash;that they signed that report and not the other report.</P>

      <P>However, to get back to the consideration of the case against the proposal which is contained in the Majority Report, I suggest that it is based upon the report of the Tariff Commission, and the report of the Tariff Commission is a <Col N="215" /> report, not upon the case for a tariff on flour which was submitted to the Economic Committee, but a report on the case for a tariff on flour which was submitted by the Irish Flour Millers' Association.  If you examine the Majority Report you will find that in each of the paragraphs in which they deal with the main arguments advanced against the imposition of a tariff they based their statements upon quotations from the Tariff Commission Report.  For example, in No. 6 we find that &ldquo;The millers themselves do not in fact claim that, even with the reduction of manufacturing costs which might be expected to follow an increase of output to their maximum capacity, they would be able to bring their costs down to the level of the costs of British mills under the conditions which would ensue if the latter lost the whole of their present Saorstát trade.&rdquo;  Now, that is obviously an argument which was advanced, or a statement made, by the Irish Flour Millers' Association, because of the peculiar nature of its composition.  There are mills in the Free State to which that statement might or might not apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the point I am making is this, that the case made by the Irish Flour Millers' Association was not, from its very nature, the best case that could be made for a tariff and was not the case which the Economic Committee considered, and the majority in their report should have dealt with the case made at the Economic Committee and not with the case that was made before the Tariff Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to the paragraph in which they deal with the possibility of an increase in price.  Instead of giving their own opinion on the information which they secured at the Committee, the paragraph is based upon the <Col N="216" /> statements which were made by the representative of the Flour Millers' Association before the Tariff Commission. I want Deputies to bear in mind that the Irish Flour Millers' Association was handcuffed in the making of its case by the fact that it includes in its ranks representatives of mill which will disappear in any case, tariff or no tariff, and which, because of their bad situation, bad equipment or inefficient management, it would be in the national interest that they should disappear. The Economic Committee set about the consideration of this problem as a national problem.  I do not think that they would have had any function to consider it in any other way. The question of the preservation of an important industry and its relation to the national welfare was the only question that came before the Committee.  We had to consider the statement made before the Tariff Commission that on the occasion of the general strike in Great Britain the supply of wheat and flour available in this country was sufficient only to maintain the population for a period of twenty-seven days.  We had to consider that that situation was nationally unsound, and was one that should be remedied.  Other countries faced similar situations, and faced them in the same way as we suggest we should face ours.  We want to establish, as far as is reasonably possible, what would suffice for this nation.  We want to increase the production of wealth within the country and thus give additional employment to our people, and to reduce the very considerable adverse trade balance that now exists.  Let me deal with the points made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. His case against the tariff can, I think, be briefly stated as follows: First, there is the danger of an increase in the price of bread&mdash;I think he suggested the certainty. Secondly, there has been no proof of dumping, and, thirdly, he maintained that in some other way, which he did not mention, the advantages that could be secured with a tariff could also be secured without a tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the possibility <Col N="217" /> of an increase in the price we maintain, and we think we are reasonable in maintaining, that that should be considered in relation to the situation which would exist if the total milling capacity of the country were increased sufficiently to meet the country's requirements.  There is at present a deficiency of milling capacity here.  Working at full capacity, our mills can produce only eighty per cent. of our requirements in flour.  For the period immediately following the imposition of the tariff during which that deficiency in milling would exist there would be a possibility&mdash;almost a certainty&mdash;of an increase in the price of flour.  But we should consider the case for the tariff, not in relation to the situation that would exist for a short period after its imposition, but in relation to its permanent effect, and we maintain that no case has been established to show that after the development which we anticipate would happen, after the flour milling industry had been concentrated into the hands of a smaller number of highly efficient and well-equipped modern mills, flour could not be produced here and sold by these mills at the same price as English flour can be produced in England, shipped to this country, and sold here.  The maximum amount by which the price of flour could be increased during the transition period would be the full amount of the tariff&mdash;two shillings per sack&mdash;and Deputies should understand that a fluctuation of two shillings in the price of a sack of flour is a very usual occurrence.  In any one year the price of flour very frequently fluctuates by more than two shillings per sack.  There has in fact been a drop of over two shillings in the price of the sack of flour within the last fortnight.  Deputies should also, I think, have their attention drawn to a statement which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of this day fortnight, which is to the following effect: &ldquo;Yesterday the price of straight-run flour fell from thirty-five shillings to thirty-three shillings a sack.  Bakers say that a further reduction of two shillings a <Col N="218" /> sack will be necessary before the public receive the benefit in the form of cheaper bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement would seem to indicate that the remorse of conscience which the Minister for Industry and Commerce appeared to imply had affected the bakers is not altogether as complete as he would like.  We have, on the report of the Food Prices Tribunal, to accept the truth of the statement, that over a period of 23 months the price of bread was in excess of what it should be in relation to the price of flour, and was only less than what it should have been for three months, and then slightly less in comparison.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to this matter in the Minority Report, where it is pointed out that the price of flour to Dublin bakers fell between March and November, 1925, from 58/- to 44/- per sack.  These are the figures given in the report of the Food Prices Tribunal.  On the basis of ninety 4lb. loaves per sack, this decrease was equivalent to a decrease of 1.86d. per 4lb. loaf in the cost of producing bread, but the actual reduction in the price of bread in Dublin over the period was only 1½d. per 4lb. loaf.  So that the profits of the bakers were increased by .36d., equivalent to 2s. 8½d. per sack of flour. Although the millers have no hesitation, apparently, in pocketing an additional profit equal to 2/8½ per sack of flour, if for a short period they have to pay 2/- extra for flour, they are going to see that it is passed on to the consumer, even though they cannot do it with the coinage that is in circulation.  There would have to be an increase of at least 4/- in the sack of flour before they could increase the price of the 2lb. loaf by a farthing, which is the lowest coin in circulation.  They cannot possibly increase the price of the 2lb. loaf by a farthing in consequence of an increase in the price of flour by 2/- a sack, unless they are going to make an additional profit of 2/- per sack. We maintain that if the Government for the brief period during which the milling capacity would be deficient following the imposition of a tariff, were to take steps that would <Col N="219" /> ensure that the price of bread would bear its proper relation to the price of flour, the possibility of hardship during that period would be obviated. It is no use for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us that that is merely disguising the increase in the price of flour.  If the Government had taken steps to bring down the price of bread to the level it should be at, then undoubtedly there would be a possibility of an increase in the price of bread.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there should be temporary control of bread prices for that period merely to avoid the possibility of hardship, until the milling capacity is increased at least to such a degree that it is capable of supplying the entire flour requirements of the country. I think we have reasonable grounds for expecting that flour produced here could be sold, at least, at the same price as English flour is sold here, if the English flour is sold at a price which can give a reasonable return to the producer. The Minister is quite right in saying that we do not want to take any action which will keep in production inefficient mills.  That is the essential difference between the case we are making for a tariff on flour and the case made by the Irish Flour Millers' Association.  We are not concerned with the interests of the members of the Irish Flour Millers' Association.  We are concerned with the maintenance and development of an Irish industry.  We believe, and I think it is generally agreed, that the one immediate effect of a tariff would be that the firms which are now operating from the Merseyside, and doing the bulk of the Irish trade in flour, would establish mills here.  I think it is <Col N="220" /> only reasonable to expect that they would.  There may be grounds for considering that undesirable, but following the imposition of a tariff&mdash; even a smaller tariff than we suggest &mdash;I think it will be generally agreed that the milling capacity of this country would be considerably increased, and we would have established here large and highly efficient modern mills, capable of producing flour, very little, if at all, above the cost at which flour can be produced at the Merseyside.  There is the possibility of a small increased cost, due to the fact that these Merseyside mills can purchase occasional parcels of flour at less than cargo rates.  They have other minor advantages, all of which are offset by the fact that transit charges have to be paid on English flour brought to this country which would not have to be paid by mills here.</P>

    <P>In theory, it is quite clear, and in practice I think it will be equally clear, that mills situate in Dublin, with the same equipment and management as mills on the Mersey, should be able to produce flour at the same price, leaving other considerations such as parcel prices out of the question.  In practice it will be found that as soon as the milling capacity has been increased, and competition begins to come into operation, the permanent effect of the tariff on flour will be that we will produce in this country the flour we require at the same price as it can now be obtained, but with the additional and very substantial advantage of having for our farmers an adequate supply of offals as feeding stuffs at much reduced prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not make any reference to offals.  I will do so as soon as I have covered the main arguments used by him with relation to flour.  He said the Government would reconsider their attitude towards the case for a tariff on flour if adequate proof of dumping were forthcoming.  What proof does he require?  What proof does he expect to get?  It is said that a gentleman who appeared before the Economic Committee to give evidence <Col N="221" /> was a certain prominent miller. Obviously a certain prominent miller in this State is not in a very good position to get actual examples of dumping.  If the Minister could get in touch with certain prominent importers he might get evidence.  But these gentlemen would take good care that that evidence is not available.  I would like to ask the Minister what class of evidence he expects to get. Surely there is nothing so difficult to get as evidence of the dumping of any commodity.  Certain examples were produced, and in addition to these examples figures are shown in the report which purport to show the minimum price at which flour could be produced in an English mill, and therefore the minimum price at which it must be sold here, if the miller is not actually going to lose on the operation.  The Minister appears to question the accuracy of these figures.  The only items the Minister mentioned were the figures given for conversion ex ship and the working of the mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first of all with the cost of the wheat.  We cannot say, any more than the Minister can, that a particular bag of flour was made out of a particular consignment of wheat, delivered at a particular price at a particular port on a particular day.  We took the average price of Pacific wheats alloat Liverpool, as quoted in the current trade news in the period January 1st to January 31st, 1928. We took the average parcel price for the manufacture.  The Minister will admit that a very small percentage of wheat milled in England comes in at the parcel rate.  The big bulk of it comes in at cargo rate, which is the higher rate.  During the period referred to the average cargo price for the same class of wheat was 47/- per quarter.  Taking into consideration the fact that these figures are based upon the parcel rate, although, as I have said, the big bulk of the wheat milled in England is imported at the cargo rate, <Col N="222" /> taking into consideration also that these figures contain no allowance for depreciation, which I think it will be agreed should be about 8d. or 1/- per sack, and taking into account the price of offals quoted as the published price in the current trade news, and that the actual taking price of offals is probably something less&mdash;I think the Minister for Agriculture may disagree with that, because he has some extraordinary notion that the millers generally succeed in getting for their offals a bigger price than that which they ask for them, but how he arrives at that conclusion I do not know&mdash;and taking the moisture content of the wheat at 11 per cent., although the average in some of the Pacific wheats is 12 per cent.&mdash;despite all these allowances that could be made, and every possible allowance was made by us to reduce the ultimate price of the flour, we found that the lowest price at which these English mills could produce a sack of flour was higher than the price at which they actually sold in the three specific cases mentioned.</P>

What I have pointed out is that we have made every possible allowance in the figures that would reduce the ultimate price of the flour.  If we are going to take the average, then we will have to make allowance for depreciation, we will have to take the moisture content of the wheat at 12 per cent. instead of 11 per cent., we will have to take another figure for the price of the wheat than that given in the current trade news, and we will have to take into consideration the fact that the English millers pay for the bulk of their wheat a much higher average price than that mentioned there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That dumping is being carried on.  The figures prove either of two things: that dumping is being carried on continuously or that flour is being sold in special districts at special rates for a special purpose.  I cannot say which is the correct conclusion, but it could point to either.  To try to establish the case that there is a general policy of dumping being carried on by British millers would be almost impossible. It would be very difficult, any way.  I say that if evidence of any kind is produced to show that even in particular districts a particular case of dumping has been resorted to, the Irish mills should be given the benefit of the doubt, unless the Minister can prove conclusively that in fact there is no dumping.  But in this matter, as in all other matters, the Minister appears to think it his duty to take his stand against supporting a policy in favour of industrial development in this country. The whole case against the giving of a tariff to the flour milling industry is, according to the Minister, based upon these two statements of his that there would be an increase in price and that there is no dumping. He has proved neither.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that all the facts which came to our notice and the facts which have been made available in relation to the whole question seem to us to indicate that after the transitionary period has elapsed there will not be an increase in the price of flour, and that flour can be produced here and sold here at the same price as English flour can be sold here.  I maintain also that whatever evidence does exist in relation to dumping would seem to indicate that there is dumping, and that evidence to the contrary has not <Col N="225" /> been produced.  The Minister went on to say that we could not leave out of consideration the effects of this proposal upon unemployment.  It is perfectly true to say that the additional number of hands that would get employment in the mills as a result of this proposal is very small.  Why is that?  Is that not because the mills here are only working part-time, and because they are at present employing more hands than they should be, and because the proprietors of these mills, sooner than dismiss a number of their workers, reduced the number of working hours so as to keep the greatest possible number of people engaged?  The very fact that it has been estimated, and not contradicted, that the immediate result of the tariff would mean the payment of an additional annual sum of £100,000 in wages to mill workers shows that there is a case.  The advantages of the tariff and its relation to the problem of unemployment have very little to do with the actual number of new hands who will be engaged.  It is the actual employment which will be given which we should take into account. In this matter, also, I notice that the Minister, as well as the Tariff Commission, left out of consideration altogether the insecure position of the 1,700 men at present engaged in this industry.  The fact that these men are at present only partially employed is no justification for ignoring them.  If the present policy continues in operation, and if these mills close down, as they probably will, then the result of that will be that we will have 1,700 additional men added to the number of the unemployed.  This proposal to put a tariff on flour can be shown to have a very direct relation to the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, was anxious to establish an apparent contradiction between two sentences in the report.  One sentence is to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It appears to us, however, from the evidence given before the Economic Committee that in the <Col N="226" /> more efficiently equipped and better situated mills, the resultant reduction in costs would be much more substantial.  It would seem, therefore, that if a tariff on imported flour were imposed for a period only to enable the mills to reach their maximum production, and then removed, they would be placed in a much stronger position to meet foreign competition, and the more efficient of them might well be able to hold the position thus gained.</P>
    <P>The other sentence is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It seems to us, however, that no circumstances exist to prevent an efficient mill in the Saorstát, working at full capacity, being able to produce and market flour here at a price capable of competing successfully with British flour, if British flour is sold at rates which give a reasonable return to the producers.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had a little more time to give to an examination to these sentences he would see that they confirm and do not contradict one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said they contradicted one another.  I said that one of the criticisms, for what they were worth, was that if the mills were efficient they could produce at a rate to meet competition. That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears we are agreed on that.  The question arises how are we to get the mills in this country to that position in which they will be able to meet competition? At present they are only working at 60 per cent. of their capacity, and as a consequence their costs per sack are very much higher than they otherwise would be, and their labour less efficient than it otherwise would be.  If these mills get to the position where they can produce to 100 per cent. of their capacity then efficiency will increase and the cost per sack will be reduced. We have taken into account in relation to some of the mills that even on their maximum of production <Col N="227" /> and their maximum of efficiency they are less efficient than they could be, or less efficient than other mills situated in the country could be.  We want to see in this country a number of mills capable of supplying the total flour requirements of the country at a price equal at least to the price at which English flour can be sold here.  We could, I think, have mills capable of selling flour less than that, but we want, at least, to be equal to that price.  We maintain the only way you can get that situation is by putting an import duty on flour.</P>
      <P>One of the arguments advanced against the flour tariff was that it would operate to strengthen the more efficient mills at present existing in this country in competition with their less efficient rivals.  One of the obvious defects of the tariff will be to drive out of the Irish market these inefficient mills.  They will go out quickly and painlessly if it is done in the way we suggest.  If the tariff is put into operation we will get efficient mills in this country with the necessary capital reserves for increasing their capacity.  I think that will be agreed.  We will get new mills established and conducted by some of the most efficient flour producers in the world.  We will have in a very short time the country over-milled, and by that I mean we will have a milling capacity in the country in excess of our requirements if we include these inefficient mills.  Then there will come the stress of competition and the inefficient mills will disappear.  The only way you can get that position in which the mills can compete even without a tariff with British mills is to give protection. If you do not, what will happen? The mills here will disappear, and even the most efficient are not paying.</P>

We have the assurance of practically every one of the owners of mills in this country that it is only a question of time with them unless they get the protection they ask for, and which they say is necessary to protect them against dumping, and which we say should be given.</P>

      <P>No, the case made by the Irish Flour Millers' Association was one designed to cheapen production for the Irish mills.  They went out for a higher tariff than we suggest. It was suggested to the Economic Committee that it should be 2/- a sack.  They had to modify their arguments so as not to offend any of their own members, and not make statements which their own members could not stand up to.  We are making a case for the flour-milling industry irrespective of what the proprietors or employers of the mills may be, because it is in the national interest that the industry should be here, and that it should be fostered and developed, because it will be effective in providing increased employment, in decreasing the adverse trade balance, lessening our dependence on outside sources, and will result in a largely increased supply of feeding stuffs for the farmers at reduced prices.  On feeding stuffs, we drew attention to the fact that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;During the twelve months, January-December, 1927, there were imported into the Free State 3,380,984 cwts. of wheaten flour, valued at £3,084,634.  If there had been an effective import duty in operation during that period, resulting in the complete exclusion of foreign flour, the quantity of wheat which should have been imported to produce the same quantity of flour, presuming an average extraction of flour from the wheat of 72 per cent., would have been 4,695,811 cwts.  At the prices for wheat prevailing during that year these 4,695,811 cwts. would have been secured for £2,954,447, or £130,187 less than the amount paid for the corresponding quantity of flour. In addition to the flour, however, we would have from the wheat 1,314,827 cwts. of offals, equal in value during that year to £640,978.  The actual quantity of offals imported was 608,605 cwts., valued at £296,728.  It is obvious, therefore, that if an effective import duty had been in operation in 1927 the amount expended outside the country for wheat and <Col N="230" /> wheat products, and consequently the adverse trade balance, would have been reduced by £426,915, and, in addition, we would have an additional supply of 706,322 cwts. of corn offals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Professor Whelehan, in his addendum to the report of the Tariff Commission on the application for a tariff on flour, pointed out that we were getting from England less offals than we were entitled to in relation to the import of flour from England; that in the year 1926, for example, flour was imported into the Saorstát to the extent of 160,000 tons, and that had this flour carried with it its due proportion of the resultant offals, there would have been an import of 68,000 tons of such.  The actual import was only 16,700 tons, leaving a deficit of 51,700.  He goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nor can it be urged that Saorstát Eireann did not need these offals, for it has been submitted in evidence that in one instance the shortage of offals adversely affected the price in Saorstát Eireann to an extent of £2 per ton, while only three tons of offals could be offered for every four in demand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious, of course, that the millers of the Saorstát, producing some 700,000 cwts. of offals in excess of the present consumption, would be forced to reduce the price of these offals in order to dispose of them.  It has been argued, however, that that reduction in price, in view of the present price of maize, need be very small in order to increase the consumption of offals and to absorb that additional 700,000 cwts.  Irish millers, however, at present realise for their offals a price equal to 15/- in excess of the price which English millers get for their offals&mdash;that is, the freightage between the two countries.  Therefore, they could immediately reduce the price of their offals by 15/- without putting themselves into a position of disadvantage in competition with English millers, in so far as they would then be getting <Col N="231" /> for their offals the same price that the English millers get.  The effect of that would be to give the farmers the benefit of these offals at 15/- per ton less than at present at the expense of the carrying companies operating between the two countries.  If the imposition of a tariff upon flour had no other effect than to increase the supply of offals available to the farmer and decrease the price of them, there would be a strong case for it.  Those who are engaged in the agricultural industry know more about that matter than I do.  I am merely pointing out that these offals would be available, and available at a cheaper price, as a result of the imposition of the import duty.  The exact advantage which that would mean to farmers engaged in feeding pigs, or whatever they feed offals to, cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the wheat proposals, as we will have an opportunity of dealing with them when Deputy Ryan's motion comes up.  I should like to say, however, in that connection that our reasons for putting forward proposals for the promotion of wheat-growing are identical with the reasons for putting forward proposals for the protection of flour-milling, because, in a matter of this kind we must consider national and not personal interests, and it is in the national interest to increase the production of wealth here, to decrease the adverse trade balance, and to give people employment at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce asserted that jealousy was the only reason which prevented us from accepting Deputy O'Connell's amendment, and Deputy O'Connell asked that the question of the imposition of a tariff upon flour should not be taken by itself, but only in relation to the whole question of the development of the wheat area.  The reason we are particularly anxious that the question of a tariff on flour should be taken by itself is because it can be, if accepted by the Dáil, put into operation at once, and considerable <Col N="232" /> advantage bestowed without undue delay, as it merely involves the introduction of a motion into the House, the machinery being there already; whereas the adoption of the wheat scheme which we put forward, or which Deputy O'Connell puts forward, would involve the preparation of a very intricate Act, and the erection of fairly delicate machinery.</P>

The proposals contained in Deputy Ryan's motion are. in brief, the proposals submitted to the Economic Committee, and it is the report of the Economic Committee that we want to have considered.</P>

      <P>We have had occasion in the past to congratulate ourselves, whenever any question which was discussed in this House and subsequently misrepresented to the country again came before the Dáil, because we were able to ask Ministers <Col N="234" /> to repeat here the statements which they make so glibly outside. If for no other reason except to secure that reconsideration of the subject in the Dáil and its re-discussion, Deputy Ryan's motion will serve a very useful purpose.  My function is to deal with the proposal for a tariff on flour and that only.  I maintain that this House should approach the consideration of that question with a prejudice in favour of putting on a tariff and not with a prejudice against it.  I maintain we should give the benefit of the doubt to the Irish flour millers in any matter in which there is doubt.  I maintain, also, that the case that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made against the proposal does not hold water and he himself knows it. There was no suggestion of sincerity in his speech.  He was merely arguing for the purpose of producing some show of justification for the Government's action in accepting the Report of the Tariff Commission.  He based his speech upon the Tariff Commission Report, although he knew that that was the weakest case that could be made against the tariff.  He knows the majority report which he signed is probably the most ineffective and inconclusive document that was ever produced by a State Department.</P>

      <P>This whole question seems to range about one particular aspect of the subject, and that is the question of white wheaten bread. Now, if we had in this country a leader or a party in opposition with courage and with honesty I think the thing would have been approached <Col N="235" /> from another aspect, but I do not think we have that party leader with that necessary courage and honesty. If we were to give effect to the proposition made here to-day it would mean compulsion or force for the farmer, the miller, the baker and the consumer.  Why not go a bit further?  In regard to the quality of the wheat that is to be milled and consumed, why should we stop at wheat?  I think anybody who will look at what has happened, and must happen of necessity to people living in our latitude, will find some food for thought.  Go to Northern Europe &mdash;Germany, Denmark, Sweden and even Holland&mdash;and what do we find? We find wheaten bread, practically speaking, remarkable by its absence. They do not import wheat in large quantities.  I do not know that they import wheat at all.  They grow their own bread, but it is not from wheat.  Wheat is not their main article of food.  They rely more on oats, barley and rye&mdash;particularly on rye.  Let us have an opposition leader here who will have nailed to his banner &ldquo;black bread,&rdquo; and we may get over the difficulty.  But while we demand in this country white wheaten bread what is aimed at will not be got by a tariff or any inducement you can offer to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera talked about the amount of flour coming into this country.  What percentage of that, according to his proposal, do we hope to have to grow in the country?  He may tell us that six million of money could be distributed amongst the Irish farmers, but he knows very well it is not true.  What percentage of it would be true?  What percentage of it does he hope to reach?  We have heard about a guaranteed price to the farmer for what he produces. I would like to know if the guaranteed price is to be for what he produces or for what he attempts to produce. What does a guaranteed price mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the winter of 1926 there was a considerable amount of wheat sown in this country.  Did any of it grow, <Col N="236" /> or how much of it grew?  We saw whole fields without a blade of wheat coming to the surface because the wheat died in the ground. Where does the question of a guarantee affect the farmer whose wheat rotted in the ground?  That is a question that Deputy Ryan should answer.  I would not accept the answer from Deputy de Valera considering some of the statements he made.  How far does the question of a guarantee go if there is no crop or only a half or a third of a crop? It is no use talking about 1847 when we grew 600,000 acres.  What is the use of mentioning '47 now?  In '47 we had no railways; the big wheat belts were not open, and if they were there to grow wheat people had no means of taking that wheat to the ports.  From that time on we began to have the railway system and the steamers, so there is no comparison and never can be between '47 and now, and it is only a fool who goes back to that year to make comparisons.  Guaranteed prices to the farmers and guaranteed prices to the millers for any loss they might suffer! What price is to be guaranteed to the farmer and on what conditions?  What guarantee is going to be given to the miller and where is it all going to come from?</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is not, as Deputy de Valera suggested it was, a question for the Department of Agriculture.  From my experience of our climate I suggest it is more a question for the Board of Works to put a roof over the country and to maintain it.  I suggest that in all seriousness. considering the three last winters we have had, without going back further.  It is true that perhaps once in every four years we have a favourable wheat sowing season, but it is only one in every four.  It is more a question for the Board of Works than for the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy de Valera said one of the most ridiculous things I, as a farmer, ever heard.  He said wheat is the most suitable for a nurse crop for grass.  It is most unsuitable as a nurse crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should like to have provision made for you else-where&mdash;you know what I mean.  If it is any information to Deputy de Valera and Deputy Ryan, one of the biggest troubles of the farmer is to clean his ground after wheat.  If you get an exceptional year, as sometimes you do get one, you may be able to go out and pin-fallow.  If you happen to get a decent spring you can attempt to clear the ground, but it is utterly impossible to make a good job in our climate.  Sometimes you get an exceptional fall where you can pin-fallow.  Sometimes you can do summer pin-fallowing, but even some of the summers are not suitable for that.  We have an extraordinary climate, which is gradually getting worse, and what has happened years ago is not possible now.  I say seriously that all the countries of Northern Europe have given up the idea of chasing the moon long ago, and they grow a crop which they can grow economically.  The custom of the country has made the people use an ordinary dark bread&mdash;not the fine white bread&mdash;which has as much, if not more, nutritive quality than any white bread.  Germany has proved that during the war.  She lived within herself and produced her own food.  That ought to set some of us thinking.  The fact is that she did it, and wheat was not the basis of her food.  If we go on facing this question we will have to get away from the old idea that has grown in this country since the big wheat belts of America began to open up.  Even before '47 or '48 we were not dependent on wheat for our foodstuffs.  I want to know where are you going to end up with this question of force, of guarantee, and of payment?  Nothing less than force, if you want to get the number of acres which politicians here suggest, will do it.  There will have to be compulsion.  You will have to <Col N="238" /> compel the miller, the baker and the consumer, and in the case of the consumer you need compulsion more than all to compel him to use the particular article which you grow.  I make the plea that if you are going to have compulsion the people whose crop has failed, under conditions over which they had no control, must be also compensated.  We do not know in this country where the question of compensation and guarantee is going to end, and when people talk of this they ought to take all the facts into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat has not been grown largely in the country, but in my part of the country nearly every farmer grows some wheat.  The best of the farmers grow it, but in past years the best of the farmers with their land well farmed only got half a crop in a few cases.  In most cases the seed rotted in the ground.  What is going to happen?  At present you have milling in this country carried on in a certain way.  A special tariff on flour that will give protection to the men here at the start may be an inducement&mdash;I think it is certain to be an inducement&mdash;to bigger outside millers to come into the country and start up-to-date mills here.  What will we have then?  We only need to provide berthage at the ports. The plant, the elevators, the suckers, the washers that will do the washing, drying and grinding will do the rest.  It means no extra employment whatever if you get the big mills here.  Unless you stop modern progress and modern plant and machinery by force from coming into this country you will give no further employment.  It will mean that these big mills will come in here with elevators and suckers for drying, washing and grinding. These can be passed on from one to the other without any manual labour and without any employment.  I see the time when you can wind up with less employment than you have to-day. There is no use in trying to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the people in the country.  You should get down and face actual facts instead of trying to influence votes here and there.  We are talking on behalf of the nation, not on <Col N="239" /> behalf of an individual.  This is my firm belief in the matter.  Unless you prevent new methods and machinery from operating in this country you have very little hope of increased employment.  I say you have none at all.  Let us face that.</P>
    <P>It is said also that all the land tilled in the country was suitable. No one can say that except a man who did not know anything about what he was talking.</P>

They are self-reliant in Kilkenny, Wexford and Cork, and if some of the other counties would be as self-reliant as the counties you talk about there would be probably less distress in the country.  Perhaps we might get Deputy O'Connell's proposition.  He suggested a pound a ton, which would work out at 2/6 a barrel, as a guarantee for a subsidy.  The subsidy would cost half a million.  At 2/6 a barrel it would produce one million and a half pounds' worth of wheat.  I think his figures must be wrong, because if you spend half a million on a subsidy at 2/6 a barrel and get in return one million and a half pounds' worth of wheat it means wheat is sold at 2/6 a barrel. I think his figures are wrong.</P>

Perhaps it requires courage to try to change the present public taste in food-stuffs that has been acquired from the continuous importation of foreign food-stuffs.  We and England are the only countries in Europe with similar tastes in that respect.  Throughout the whole continent, you do not find the state of affairs that you have here.  We might consider other aspects of the case, for instance, whether we ought to encourage the growth of rye here and get a different class of flour that could be grown economically in the country.  Wheat, in my opinion, can never be grown economically here.  It is an almost impossible crop, and it is the most awkward crop in our rotation.  Deputy Dr. Ryan is going to prove to us that wheat is the best nursery for grass seeds.  I say, before he attempts to prove anything, that it is absolutely impossible to sustain that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I might preface what I am about to say by stating that I find myself in agreement with Deputy Gorey when he says, in referring to the report on the application for a tariff on flour, that it is admitted&mdash;I agree with him that it is admitted generally&mdash;that it will not give the extra employment suggested by some people.  However, as pointed out earlier in the debate by Deputy de Valera, it would mean in addition to these one hundred or two hundred extra people who would be engaged in the industry, the full employment of those already in the milling trade.  In voting, as I propose to do, for Deputy O'Connell's amendment as against Deputy de Valera's motion, I do so, and I might say all our Party will do so, not because we are against a tariff on flour, but because we believe that Deputy de Valera's motion does not go far enough and that it should be more comprehensive in character.  If the House agrees to accept the proposals contained in Deputy O'Connell's amendment, we suggest that these proposals should be referred to Departmental experts who would, in the ordinary course of events, report on them as to the most practical method of giving effect to the policy that is outlined in the proposals, and that they should be considered as a part of a general forward movement to encourage agricultural production, to promote industry, and to employ the unemployed, as an alternative to the policy of centralisation, which, I submit, may be taken as the considered economic policy of the Executive, not alone in this matter of flour but in other matters appertaining to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I have a very great regard for all the social activities grown up around the small inland mill.  I think the Minister for Agriculture and others are too prone to take the purely economic viewpoint on this particular matter.  I say that without any disrespect to or disparagement of the very able academic economists who advise the Department, but, after all, there is a human side <Col N="243" /> to the whole of this policy which I think would certainly yield to better treatment on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  We suggest that under one, two, or three heads the production of flour-milling and encouragement of wheat growing should proceed simultaneously as two phases of a single policy.  That is the main difference between our proposal and the proposal put forward by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>We also suggest that it is desirable to maintain inland mills.  To me this is the most attractive proposal in our programme.  I know that that view is held by members in other parties besides the Labour Party.  I could illustrate the social value of these little inland mills, but I would have to claim the indulgence of the House for some time in order to do so.  We know that where these little industries grow up there is a social life that we would all like to see developed. I have in mind at the moment a mill in a rather remote part of the county of Cork, where in addition to having some of the ordinary amenities of the cultural side of city life, they have a little dramatic society, a musical society, and so on, in addition to having outlets for the more vigorous and younger people such as a hurling and football club, which I think every Deputy here who has any regard for the development, both physical and cultural, of our people will admit are very useful assets.  The capacity of our existing mills, we suggest, should be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said, in the course of the debate, that the majority of our existing mills are inefficient.  I hope I am not misquoting him.  I think that was the impression he generally conveyed.  But we have to remember that in the present undeveloped state of our industries and in the present state of our resources it would be a bad thing, whilst we do suffer by that comparison so far as efficiency is concerned, and so far, perhaps, as the organisation of industry, distribution and so on are concerned, if we were to continue to make those <Col N="244" /> comparisons with a view to proving that our people cannot do anything right.</P>
    <P>That is what it will mean in the long run.  We might point to other industries in which further development and better organisation are necessary.  That should not imply that we should scrap some of what should be our key industries.  We also suggest in another portion of the amendment that no flour should be imported except by a grain and flour control board, or by such persons as are specifically licensed by the board to import flour, as in the the case of Messrs. Jacob for the manufacture of their biscuits.  We suggest that this board might use its supply of imported flour as a means of steadying the price of flour to consumers and preventing excessive charges by millers.  Deputy O'Connell, I think, explained at some length the raison d'être of that particular section of his amendment, so that it is unnecessary for me to amplify his remarks in that respect. The board should be empowered to become the sole importer of wheat if circumstances arose to warrant this, but until experience showed that such a development was necessary imports of wheat could be continued as hitherto, except that the importers are to be required to obtain a licence from the board and to make such returns as the board may require.</P>
    <P>That is, if you like, a further amplification of the last paragraph of the amendment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to suggest that there was little or no dumping of flour in this country.  I only wish that he could afford the time to come any day to the quays of Cork, and I will give him visible evidence as to the amount of dumping that goes on in the flour trade. I may remark that when it was mooted that there might possibly be a tariff on flour there was a good deal of forestalling, with the result that I think I would be quite safe in saying that there was more flour dumped into Cork during the one or two weeks in which the Economic Committee was sitting than was <Col N="245" /> dumped in for three or four months previously.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, placed the term &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; under two heads.  He said that dumping might take place under subsidies, and another class of dumping might take place because of some specially favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to suggest that there is a form of dumping going on which possibly the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not heard anything about.  The Mersey Dock and Harbour Board, for instance, gave public notification a short time ago that from the 1st April it was their intention to exempt goods exported coastwise from outward coastwise town dues.  That represents a very decided advantage to the flour milling trade at the ports of Liverpool and Birkenhead in addition to the relief obtained under their Government under the Derating Bill, in which it is stated that Irish Free State ports will come under the category of &ldquo;coastwise.&rdquo; The Irish Free State comes under the category of coastwise and will automatically be exempt from dues. I want to suggest very seriously to members of all Parties in the House that whilst this might appear to be, and certainly is, a very serious proposal when it is put before the House in the shape of an amendment like that of Deputy O'Connell, and whilst it may be taken to be a negation of Government policy, at the same time it should be made a question of an open vote in this House.  That is to say, if it is made an open vote, and if the vote goes against the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or, to put it in another way, if it is a negation of Government policy it should not be made a great affair of State, but the Minister should be prepared to alter his bias, if you like, and proceed along the line suggested in the amendment.  It is my belief that if the Minister and his advisers, and possibly some members of the Executive Council, had gone into this matter with a bias of doing the thing which we suggest, it would have very serious reactions on the social and economic life of the country, all the <Col N="246" /> machinery in the Department of Agriculture, and in the Department of Industry and Commerce would be invoked in order to put forward a policy to which they themselves would have given their blessing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, comes with a bias in the other direction, and because of that bias towards this policy which we indicate in our amendment and which we advocate, not alone in this House but outside, this amendment of ours may be turned down.  I want to suggest that we in this House should place such a question as this above party. There is a very strong feeling in the country amongst all parties that something should be done to protect this industry.  We are, of course, taking the production of flour and the production of wheat together, but I fear that whilst we are talking on this matter many of our people are emigrating and eventually we will have to apply, perhaps, violent economic remedies when to-day a mild one might suffice.  I am reminded, when dealing with matters of this kind, of the old country woman who, when asked to supply her bill for curing the Widow Maloney's pig, furnished her account somewhat after this fashion&mdash;&ldquo;To curing the Widow Maloney's pig till it died, 5/-.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion in the names of Deputy deValera and Lemass asking that a tariff should be placed upon the importation of foreign flour into the Saorstát.  I wish to say that I agree with the remarks of Deputy Anthony to the effect that it is a pity that for once we cannot get away from the efficiency specialists, and instead of trying to develop, as it seems to me the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in mind, a new scheme of rationalisation by which all the industries of the country will be concentrated around Dublin City and by which the whole population, or what is left of it, will be forced to come to Dublin to look for employment, the Ministry would give more consideration to this question as it affects the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> Deputy de Valera in his opening remarks has pointed out with regard to the proposals on wheat which are set out in the amendment in Deputy O'Connell's name that the Fianna Fáil Party agreed with him, but that they are in the position of having to make up their minds whether it is better to ask the House now to declare itself in favour of taking immediate action, which they consider necessary to save the flour milling industry, or whether they will, on the other hand, wait until proposals come from the present Government, presumably, to enforce some such proposals as both the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party seem to be agreed upon, to encourage the growing of wheat.  While the Government, if ever they do so, are engaged on producing these proposals, what is to happen the flour-milling industry?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that our representatives on the Economic Committee agreed that, even under a tariff, the weaker mills would have to go to the wall and that there should be some allowance here for the free play of economic forces.  I think in this case it is not so much the free play of economic forces, if the gradual wiping-out of our industries is what is connoted by the term, that demands to be encouraged, but the restraint of economic forces.  Whatever ideas the Ministry may have about the rationalisation of industry and this concentration of our industries in certain centres on the sea-board, and the development of some such practice as has found favour with the Tariff Commission, the development of some such mills as they have in Birkenhead&mdash;where, to the delight of the Tariff Commission, it was found that seven men and a boy could run an 80-sack mill&mdash;I think that as responsible men charged with looking after the affairs of this State and trying to keep its population at home, they will have to try to square that conception as to up-to-date methods, efficiency, and all the rest of these terms, with the urgent necessity for dealing with the agricultural <Col N="248" /> depression, unemployment, and emigration.</P>
    <P>If the Ministry had any policy whatever to offer as against the proposal to impose a tariff on flour something might be said, but the Ministry have no policy.  They have not given to us the slightest idea of any policy.  So far back as 1923 a body called the Fiscal Inquiry Committee sat upon this matter, and when the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes here now and says that there is no improvement in the amount of data and the amount of information that is at the disposal of the Government to formulate a policy on this matter I would remind him that so far as the findings of the Tariff Commission were concerned they were practically all anticipated in the report of the Fiscal Inquiry Committee which dealt with flour. That was a very efficient Committee. It was so efficient that every possible argument that could be advanced against protection was advanced.  We know that protection, as a policy, has this misfortune: that the cleverest writers, the best experts from the academic standpoint, and the most wonderful literary geniuses can write the most entrancing theories against protection, but it happens in the world as it stands to-day that the men who are pushing things forward in the countries which they govern are men who are working protection and who are carrying it out as a policy.  Therefore I say that the findings of the Tariff Commission, any more than the finding of the Fiscal Inquiry Committee, should not rule our discussions here to-day.  If the findings of these bodies have not enabled the Government in power to formulate a policy, then I do not think that the members of this Committee, placed as they were and having the prejudices that they had, are to blame as much as the Government itself.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done during all the years since 1923 when this question was first taken up?  It has seen the gradual closing down of the flour mills, and now at the eleventh hour the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along <Col N="249" /> and says: &ldquo;Oh, let economic forces have their way.  Probably we will be better off if more of the mills disappear.  Let them come forward and make some proposals to the Government and we will be able to get them to transplant their whole machinery and business to the ports.&rdquo;  It is very late in the day for the Minister to come along and ask the mills to submit definite proposals by which the whole of their invested capital, their interests, their goodwill and whatever local facilities they have should be scrapped in a moment and their undertakings transferred to the ports.  It is not, I think, taking a proper view of the situation for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come along now and suggest to the House that his offer to examine the proposal from the milling industry is serious or that the House should take it seriously.  The milling industry have made their proposals: they have gone as far as they could go, I think.  They have, perhaps, overestimated their case in certain ways, feeling that the position of the industry was a precarious one. Generally speaking, I think they have acquitted themselves well in meeting the demands of Messrs. Jacob and other people opposed to the tariff, and I think the Minister should meet them in the same spirit. The Ministry, instead of doing that, come along first with the suggestion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the milling industry should at this hour of the day submit new proposals, and with the suggestion of the Minister for Finance that the problem could be settled by excluding straight-run flour.  I do not know what precisely the Minister for Finance sees in that, or how he can prove to the House that that would be a solution of the question.</P>
    <P>Professor O'Rahilly has shown in his pamphlet&mdash;and I have discovered myself in a flour mill in my constituency&mdash;that there is nothing whatever to prevent foreign mills producing straight-run flour and having it imported here.  It merely means that an extra proportion of the flour will <Col N="250" /> be taken and will be called offals, thirds, shorts or middlings, as they are technically termed.  The proposal that to exclude straight-run flour would solve the problem is, I think, a mistaken one.  In any case, if there is anything in that proposal it is extraordinary that the Government have not examined it at more length.  They have had advice from their experts, and this question has been discussed in their Departments. They have had plenty of time to come to some conclusion.  They simply state at the end of their Report: &ldquo;We shall submit at a later date a separate report dealing with this proposal.&rdquo;  As far as I am aware, we have no suggestion whatever from the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I have not heard the whole of his remarks&mdash;as to how the Government propose to deal with the question.  It seems to me from the manner in which the debate has wandered into the subject of wheat, which could be more appropriately discussed on Deputy Dr. Ryan's motion, that the Government are anxious to put the question on the long finger.  They feel they are on comparatively safe ground when they are discussing the wheat question; there are such an enormous number of considerations in connection with that matter that it is very easy to say circumstances have much altered since the time when this country grew half a million acres of wheat, and it is very easy to build up a long and painful argument against any attempt to revert even partially to that situation.</P>
    <P>On the straight question of the protection of the flour-milling industry, it seems clear that the Government have no policy.  They simply want to take up the time of the House in refuting arguments in respect of wheat.  Deputy Gorey said it would be well if this question were examined apart from politics.  It would be a very good thing indeed if it were examined apart from politics.  I cannot understand why it could not be so examined.  It seems to me that Deputy Gorey, in his desire to exclude the question of politics, wants to exclude the question of nationality <Col N="251" /> as well.  He wants to refuse to allow the House to consider that a proposition such as this&mdash;that a tariff should be placed on imported flour&mdash;which may have had many minute arguments advanced against it in detail, may be fundamentally sound and may, as a national proposition, have such counter-balancing advantages that it puts into the shade all the minor arguments that may be advanced against it on account of the imperfection of some of their details.  Deputy Gorey said that we were accustomed to talking on this side of the House about ranches.  That is so, and we have yet to see that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, which, I take it, is the policy that dominates the Executive Council, is going to solve the question of unemployment and the question of emigration, and is going to save the country the enormous amounts that are being spent in home assistance and in relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>A very distinguished county man of Deputy Gorey, the late Rev. Dr. McDonald, Professor of Maynooth College, who certainly was of the conservative type in politics. examined this question.  Speaking of the Corn Laws he said: &ldquo;Ireland, however, had been living by growing corn; living and paying rent thereby. How were we to meet this competition?&rdquo; That was the competition of the incoming American corn.  &ldquo;So far no meat came, nor butter; and people foolishly hoped that these products could never come; so landlords then all-powerful in Ireland, resolved to turn their fields into pasture and produce meat.  This let to consolidation of holdings, with evictions from the rich lands, and something of the same kind in poorer soils, for the production of butter; the whole coming at a time when land was to be had for nothing in the Mississippi valley, gold could be picked up by Californian rivers, and one could get fabulous wages without going beyond New York.  Low prices at home and abundance over sea&mdash;this, not the potato blight, was <Col N="252" /> the true cause of the stream of emigration that set out then from the shores of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to point out that it was the development of steam power and the opening up of new countries abroad that hit Ireland so severely after the repeal of the Corn Laws. &ldquo;Had we in Ireland been our own masters, we should have had to face the same problem, caused by the loss of our market for grain; and we should probably have found some more or less effectual remedy long before now.  It is the main argument for Home Rule; that, as the United Kingdom has been managed hitherto, by a single common Parliament at Westminster, Ireland did not get fair play.  She should have had some power to meet emergencies such as we have been considering; power within herself, since the predominant partner was careless, thinking there was no emergency at all.&rdquo;  He goes on to state: &ldquo;You cannot expect everything from the Government.&rdquo;  At a critical period, which the Fiscal Inquiry Committee also referred to, in the flour milling industry between 1879 and 1881, when other Irish industries were wiped out of existence by virtue of their failure to instal up-to-date machinery, flour mills kept going and were successful because they had all installed the new roller system, and from 1880 up to the present time the majority of these concerns, which were owned by Quaker families distinguished by their uprightness and business integrity and their sympathy with the people amongst whom they lived, had managed to keep going.  Now, these mills are closing down and I submit that the industry which succeeded by virtue of the special enterprise of its proprietors in the eighties in weathering the storm and living against foreign competition up to the present time, has a natural right to demand a better policy from the Government than what they are getting.  We must remember that industries in every country, even in England, are looking for protection. The people are looking for assistance from their Governments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> In this country if there were any alternative policy, if there were any suggestion that unemployment could be solved in any other way, then something might be said for the Government.  But the policy they have to offer in opposition to the proposal for this tariff is simply a policy of negation.  Now, let us examine some points that have been raised.  Deputies, I am sure, have read very closely the reports that have been issued and they will probably in different places have individual arguments for and against the two reports.  If we get out of this discussion a feeling that there is some common policy which every Party in the House can stand for and that some effort is likely to be made by this Government or a future Government, some large effort, to deal with the question of unemployment in a thoroughly serious way&mdash;if we can get some ground on which to establish that and to get co-operation from all Parties in solving it, then the discussion, though it may not bear fruit in another way, will have borne fruit in that way.</P>
    <P>The cost of manufacture and the profits which would be left within the Free State if the whole of the flour output were left to the Irish mills would be larger.  The Irish millers themselves calculate that the difference found by subtracting the price of the imported wheat from the price of the finished product&mdash; that is, the total amount which would represent the wages and profits in the manufacture&mdash;would amount to £1,372,000.  I am leaving out of the question altogether the effect that this tariff would have if followed up by a proposal to mill a certain percentage of Irish-grown grain, and I am leaving out of the question also the effect on local activities and the valuable effects on inland communities which Deputy Anthony has mentioned.  For example, it would result in giving the farmers offals at a much cheaper price than they buy them at present. Leaving all that out of the question, the millers claim that a sum of £1,372,000 would be left in the country <Col N="254" /> as a result of the manufacture of the total output of flour here.</P>
    <P>If we are going to consider what the loss to the country is going to be in the placing of this tariff, what the increase in the cost of living is going to be, we ought not to talk of that without taking into consideration the other factors which have to be put against it.  When I was a student and when I read books on economics I found that every single economic proposition that was laid down in the books was always qualified by the addendum &ldquo;other things being equal.&rdquo;  But, in this Government Report on this question of flour tariff, they never tell us that other things are equal, because they never consider that there are any other things except the prejudiced considerations upon which they themselves want us to base arguments and to come to conclusions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when they state that the big facts as to the efficiency of the mills and the increase in the cost of living should be the determining factors in this matter, I submit that they are having Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, because they are omitting entirely the great advantage which is a counter-balancing advantage.  They are omitting altogether the enormous effect of having the amount of money that is exported out of the country for the purpose of foreign flour and foreign grain left in it&mdash;at least to a large extent.  They are omitting that completely. When they speak in another part of their Report of the effect on the purchasing power of the community of the extra farthing in the 2lb. loaf which they say would follow as a natural result of this tariff, I say that if you take into consideration the extra circulation of money which would ensue to the country as a result of keeping the money at home which is now going out for the purchase of these flours, an extra gain of £1,372,000 which the millers claim would be a clear gain if we manufactured our flour here, the balance is in favour of the tariff.  If you take that into consideration you will be able to say, and I think there is a good deal of truth in the argument, <Col N="255" /> that the purchasing power of the community would increase at such a rate that even the working men, men who would not be directly employed in the milling industry, would gain by reason of the increased circulation of money and would not feel the extra farthing on the 2lb. loaf.  The Government representatives have omitted entirely that question, and they have gone on to state that there are certain advantages which the Irish flour-milling industry has.</P>
    <P>They state that there are certain advantages by virtue of the freight which the foreign flour has to pay. Professor O'Rahilly has pointed out in his pamphlet&mdash;I do not know whether it is correct or not&mdash;that according to the harbour dues in Cork Harbour, the amount that is given by the Government Report as the freight charge for Cork on page 6 of the Report is 2/1, and that it should only be 1/1.  Whether it should be 1/1 or not I think there is a good deal in the argument and a good deal in the contention by this critic of the Government policy, that they have simply arbitrarily taken the schedule of freight charges and they put this on paper and they tried to make us believe that to the extent of these charges the Irish flour milling industry has an advantage, a protective tariff, so to speak, in its favour.  It is well known that some of these companies, like Spiller and Baker, have vessels of their own. Even if they had not vessels of their own which would give them very cheap freight rates, they can always, by virtue of that freemasonry that exists between the importing trades into this country, the shipping trades and the English wholesalers, get preferential rates where it is a question of giving English manufacturers an advantage.  There is a prima facie case, I submit, in support of that. If the Government have not been able to get sufficient information to show that dumping is going on, then I say the Government is in fault It is a well-known fact that along the West Coast of Ireland flour is being imported and sold at a price that, if <Col N="256" /> above the cost of production in England, is certainly not much above it. Experts on dumping tell us that it need not be below or equal to the cost of production; even if it is a little above the cost, it is dumping.  If it is shown that the native manufacturer is being placed at an unfair disadvantage, then that is said to be dumping and the Government should take steps accordingly.</P>
    <P>Here the Government say that there is no dumping.  They put the onus entirely on the millers to prove that there is, as if the millers had complete access to the commercial secrets of their rivals.  These English rivals are powerful organisations; they have great ramifications in this country.  They are able to give extended credit facilities, for example, and even on the solitary question of extended credit facilities I maintain that the English combine, with its large resources, can always place the native manufacturer at a disadvantage.  Our people have so many disadvantages, as the Government report itself admits, in respect of the fact that they are producing in a small way, and that they are up against mass production, with cheap overhead expenses and all the rest of it, that it is almost impossible to say that they are not subject to unfair competition.  Whether you call it dumping or not is really only a technical matter.  The question is whether there is such unfair competition going on as is likely to end the Irish flour-milling industry.  I think there is, and I think that the House will agree with me that the Irish flour-milling industry, by virtue of that, is in a parlous condition.  The Government had also to admit that the English combine has the advantage of being able to purchase wheat on a very large scale.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been referred to by Deputy Anthony is a matter that might very well be stressed here, a matter that makes it more urgent and more necessary to impose a tariff now than on the last occasion when we had this matter under discussion.  It is that the British Government have taken very <Col N="257" /> definite and very decided steps to remove certain burdens from manufacturing industries in Great Britain by relieving rates.  The statement has been made that a single mill&mdash;this mill which has been held up to us by the Tariff Commission as being absolutely the last word in efficiency, an 80-sack mill which can be worked by seven men and a boy&mdash;is to be relieved to the extent of £8,000 yearly in its rates.  If that is so it means that the British Government, while they are not, as, of course, they will claim, protecting that industry, are nevertheless helping to subsidise it indirectly, and that means that the cut-throat competition which has been carried out against the Irish millers will now be carried on with more intensity.  It means that if some steps are not taken the remaining mills, with the exception of, perhaps, one or two, will have to go out of business.</P>
    <P>The Ministry may be afraid&mdash;they have not admitted it&mdash;that if the tariff is put on a foreign combine will come over here and take control and that the process of weeding out the inefficient which is going on, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says would also go on if a tariff were imposed, would continue, and that as well as having all the inland mills wiped out we would get a foreign syndicate here which would perhaps give greatly reduced employment by virtue of their superior equipment.  If that is so, and if the Ministry feel that it is a real reason for not imposing a tariff, I think that they ought to approach the question from an entirely different angle&mdash;that is, by putting such prohibitions in the way of foreign companies as would enable the Government, if it felt that these foreign combines would come in under a tariff for the purpose of wiping out their weaker rivals, to review the question and to take some steps to counter-balance the advantages which the tariff would give an English syndicate in that case.  I think that that is a question which naturally comes up, like the question of price fixing, under the tariff system, and the fact that the Tariff <Col N="258" /> Commission, under the law as it now stands, is entirely precluded from making any suggestions as to how that difficulty of foreign combines coming in here and buying out the native industry should be overcome, and that, moreover, they are not permitted to make suggestions with regard to price control, in my opinion invalidates the recommendations and the work of the Tariff Commission to such an extent as simply to make it hopeless.  It merely means that if you extend your tariff system you will have to appoint new boards to deal with these matters.  If the Government foresee these dangers they ought to take steps to meet them.  They ought not simply to say: &ldquo;We admit that the flour milling industry is in a bad condition, but the obstacles to be overcome are too great.&rdquo;  The Government have complete powers to deal with that situation, and on them rests the responsibility for not dealing with it.  They know the difficulties.  We admit that perfect solutions of these difficulties cannot be found, but let us at any rate try to move in the right direction and to get such solutions as will save our industries from being completely wiped out.  That is the danger at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the price of bread, there the Government have put the whole question on the long finger again.  They admit, I think, that the bakers have been charged by the Food Prices Tribunal with profiteering, and as if it were not enough to take the bakers' word for it that there must and that there shall be an increase in the price of bread if this tariff comes into operation, the Government goes a step further, and in order to show their complete spiritual communion with the bakers, they put into their report a phrase which the bakers themselves might have used: &ldquo;Even if the price of flour were increased by a smaller amount than 3/9 it is our definite and considered opinion that while it might not lead to an immediate increase in the price of bread, it would mean that the price of bread, which varies with the price of <Col N="259" /> flour, would rise sooner or fall later than it would if no tariff were imposed.&rdquo; We have seen from our experience of the working of the master bakers, and from the report of the Tribunal on Food Prices, that the master bakers have already taken very good care that the price of bread will rise sooner and will fall later than the price of flour over an extended period, and the Government simply take the master bakers at their word, without any further examination of the charges of profiteering against them, and say: &ldquo;Well, this is an easy way out of the difficulty.  Let us go to the Dáil, and, since we have not any better argument, let us say that there will be an increase in the price of bread. That will catch the popular imagination and put a stop to this question of a tariff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government were sincere in believing that that was an obstacle, and if they were not dominated so completely in this matter by our friend, the Minister for Agriculture, they might have decided that the question of prices would have to be tackled sooner or later.  You have the question raised of giving the farmer a minimum price for certain of his products.  You have admitted that already in the case of beet.  You have the question of profiteering raised, and you have the recommendation of the Food Prices Tribunal that some steps should be taken in that matter.  You have a body like the Cork Harbour Board asking the Government to take steps to fix the maximum price for bread. You have various proposals in regard to prices, and you have this question of prices looming very largely in the air, particularly in connection with tariffs.</P>
    <P>Every time the question of a tariff is introduced you have Deputy Good saying that the tariff on boots has increased the price.  In my opinion, the House should not any longer be placed in the position of having to depend on Deputy Good in a matter of that kind.  They ought to charge the Tariff Commission&mdash;and it was suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="260" /> when they entered the House that it should be so charged, if you do not grant them the power of regulating prices&mdash;at least with the duty of watching prices and reporting at intervals to the House to show that the manufacturers who had got the benefit of a tariff were not overstepping the bounds of reason.  But here, while the Government failed to take any steps to deal with the increase in the price of bread, they coolly advanced that here as an argument.  Even if there is an increase in the price of bread, even if it is justifiable, even if it is right that the bakers, the poor fellows, are eking out a miserable existence, something like that of the farmers, living on the brink of bankruptcy, and barely able to make ends meet, and even if the Government believe that any proposals made for the safeguarding of the milling industry should not encroach upon the bakers' profits, I submit that the admission that the baker should get the whole of this 3/9 is absurd.  The millers have said that the increase in the price of the sack of flour under the proposed tariff would be 1/3.  It has been suggested that that would be temporary, and that when the mills were going properly and on full time they ought to be able to sell on the same level as the foreigner.</P>
    <P>In any case you would always have an element of foreign competition here, of course minus the tariff, but you would still have the play of economic competition from across the Channel to keep prices down.  But, even if the price of bread is increased, what is there to show that it will be increased by more than one-and-threepence?  What have the Government to show to support their contention that it will be increased, because they said here that they felt it was inevitable that there should be an increase of a farthing in the 2 lb. loaf?  If that is going to be so, and if the Government believe that one-and-threepence or a smaller amount would represent the real increase in price, I think they have sufficient evidence at their disposal to enable them to take steps, and they have a sufficiently strong <Col N="261" /> case to go before the country and say: &ldquo;If the bakers increase the price by a halfpenny per 4 lb. loaf they are taking an unfair advantage of the new situation.&rdquo;  In the words of the Minister for Agriculture, they are &ldquo;against national policy.&rdquo; That was the phrase the Minister used when he said he was going to take steps if certain foreign companies interfered with his plans for the development of the dairying industry. The Minister was going to tell them that, since the Government had a definite policy in that matter, they were clearly acting against national policy, and he was going to order them to clear out.  Have we now reached the stage where, if this tariff were imposed&mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has admitted that the increase in the price of bread is the fundamental and the only real objection&mdash;that when the bakers say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to them and declare: &ldquo;We are going to increase the price whether you like it or not, and we are going to upset the whole question of the tariff, simply by the help of our friends across the Channel,&rdquo; the Government are going to run away from the bakers?</P>
    <P>It has been shown by Professor O'Rahilly that in Cork city, over a period of fifteen months, from February, 1926, to April, 1927, bread was sold at elevenpence.  It was reduced in the following twelve months by a halfpenny.  The average price of flour in the first period,, when bread was elevenpence, was 50.2/- and in the second period 45.4/-.  Professor O'Rahilly argued that since, on a reduction of 4s. 10d. a sack on flour, the bakers only gave the advantage of a halfpenny, they can still afford to lose one-and-threepence without losing that halfpenny. That is to say, the price of flour having fallen by 4s. 10d. and the bakers only having reduced the price of bread by a halfpenny, if the price of flour goes up by one-and-threepence now, if a tariff is imposed, there would still be a reduction of three and sevenpence, and on three and sevenpence the bakers themselves admit they could give a halfpenny reduction.  In that particular <Col N="262" /> case at any rate&mdash;it may not hold good in all cases&mdash;I think it can be argued that the bakers could carry an extra one and threepence a sack without placing it on the consumer. That might not hold in all cases, but the bakers are entirely immune from real investigation in this matter.  The Food Prices Tribunal failed to get at the bottom of their secrets.  It seemed to me, on reading the evidence of that Tribunal, that the big argument in favour of the bakers was the argument that is now being used, to some extent, against the millers, that they were employing perhaps too much labour and not keeping up to date, that if, like the millers who, it is now suggested, should all become port millers instead of inland millers, the bakers had turned their bakeries into machine bakeries, and cut out a large proportion of the labour which they are employing at present, they would be able to get more loaves out of a sack of flour, and at a much cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>If the Government are suggesting to the millers that they should be up to date, and if they suggest that it is an easy proposition for the millers, with their capital of nearly two million pounds sunk in the industry, to change at a moment's notice, or to make proposals by which the whole of that vast business could be changed to the ports, I think it is equally right, seeing that it concerns the people in such a vital matter as the price of bread, for the Government to suggest to the bakers to instal steam where they have not done so, and thereby to lessen the price of bread.  I do not say that that would be a good thing, but if we followed the Government proposition of efficiency at all costs, and lower expenses, we ought to be able to get the bakers by reducing their expenses to make up for the extra one and threepence per sack which the millers say they would have to bear.</P>
    <P>I do not admit that the extra farthing which it is claimed would be added is justifiable, or that the Government have produced any arguments to show that it would, in fact, be justifiable.  On the contrary, <Col N="263" /> I think everything is in favour of my argument that there is no necessity for such an increase&mdash; of an increase of a farthing per 2lb. loaf, at any rate.  The evidence of the Food Prices Tribunal, and the evidence of the costings of the chief bakeries in the Free State, shows that considerable reductions can be made in the cost, and, therefore, I submit there is no case whatever for this increase.  But, even if there is to be an increase, whether it be an increase of a farthing per 2lb. loaf or less, I say there are other compensations. There is the compensation of the clear margin of £1,300,000 which the millers say would be left in the country by virtue of their having the manufacture of the whole flour requirements of the Free State in their hands.  There is the fact also, as Deputy Anthony mentioned, that you would have improvements in local areas.  You would not alone have the price of offals cheaper, but you would have subsidiary employment given.</P>
    <P>The millers point out in their arguments in favour of a tariff that they would support other Irish industries. They claim, for example, that if a tariff were granted they would spend on bags alone, I think, something like a quarter of a million pounds, and there is no reason why the whole of that sum should not be kept here.  They also say that they would help the coach-building industry, and I believe they would help the railways.  I believe that if the manufacture of flour were kept in this country it would mean an enormous increase in the quantity of traffic carried by the railways.  The fact that the beet sugar industry has been of such enormous benefit to the railways shows that if wheat-growing could be taken up in this country, even if it were not taken up to any considerable extent, but if you manufactured the whole of your flour requirements here, you would be giving the railways a great deal of work which they are badly in need of.</P>
    <P>Another thing against the question <Col N="264" /> of employment is the cost.  We are told that for these 153 extra men you are going to pay something like £290,000.  I do not know how the Government arrived at that figure.  If the tariff is successful, and we keep out the foreign flour, then I think the advantage of the extra wages and of the extra benefits which the areas in which mills are situate will get, the support which will be given to local industries and the employment which local craftsmen will get, will more than counterbalance that.  I must take issue with my friend, Deputy O'Connell, on that.  I say that to take the figure of 153 extra men on the one side and to put against it this sum of £290,000 on the other side, seems to me to be stating the case in a very narrow fashion.  We have to take all the circumstances into consideration.</P>
    <P>The question, after all, is not the giving of employment to 153 extra men.  The question is the giving of direct employment that will be secure and permanent to the 2,000 persons who will be employed in the industry, as well as to the many hundreds more dependent on it indirectly.  The question is, if you do not give this flour tariff and pay this price, even if you have to pay it, what is going to be the alternative? If more mills close down, more men would be thrown on the unemployment list, and, as has been pointed out over and over again from these benches, the people who are thrown out of employment will still have to be maintained by the State.  Their families will have to get home assistance or the unemployment dole, or in some other way the community will have to maintain them. The so-called economists who referred to these 153 extra men and held up that small figure as their great argument against the imposition of the tariff, completely forgot to state the alternative.  The alternative is the closing down of the flour-milling industry, and the throwing of these men on the scrap heap, where, I suppose, they will have to wait until such time as the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="265" /> has his rationalisation scheme completed for gathering them all up to Dublin city to work in the enormous factories which will be started under his direction.  We are prepared if it is shown, and I think it can be shown, that a further step is necessary, not alone to give a tariff on flour but to make provision for the purchase of grain.  We are prepared to do that, if that is another way in which you can cut down the extra cost which you feel would fall on the consumer.  We feel that is a way that could be adopted, but as I have said, there are compensating advantages. There is the extra flow of money, which is a big thing.  In one passage in their report the Government representatives state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The same amount of bread after it has increased in price, presumably, would have to be purchased, with a corresponding restriction in the balance available for expenditure on other necessary commodities.  This diversion of purchasing power might affect the prosperity of other industries and the employment which they give.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another place they say that the increase in earnings would be distributed amongst a very small section. At the moment I cannot find the paragraph in which the Government representatives deal with that, but in any case they definitely state that, as a result of the tariff, any extra employment that would be given would simply result in the distribution of more money amongst a very small section of the community. How would the Government, as regards the money that would be put into circulation in wages, profits and so on, as a result of the operation of this tariff, segregate it from all the other money in circulation?</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that when a ship is being built on the Clyde every shopkeeper in Glasgow, and I suppose the same thing holds good in Belfast, feels the benefit of that on a Saturday night.  If you go into any county town or small town around Dublin and ask the shopkeepers how they are doing out of the tourist traffic, they will smile at <Col N="266" /> you, and tell you that it can never assist them.  They will tell you that the only things that can give them real help are the earnings distributed amongst the workers in their districts.  If you have not weekly wages paid out to the workers in the towns of the Free State, then the traders will feel the effect of that.  I say that this extra amount which would be spent on wages and profits would not be distributed amongst a very small section of the people.  It would be distributed in every area where there is a mill, and it would stretch out from those areas in ever-widening circles.  By virtue of the fact that you had the mills working full time you would have, I claim, increased trade activity in every direction.  It would give a stimulation, too, to other industries. It would result in invigorating and improving them, and you would, I submit, have a greatly increased circulation of money amongst all classes.</P>
    <P>If that is wrong, then some of the ablest men in England who are to-day justifying the expenditure which they are looking for in public works are quite wrong.  Only to-day I read in the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; where Lord Reading said that this money which would be spent on productive employment, even though it was Government money, even though it was the taxpayers' money, would have more than compensating advantages, as it would be money going into circulation, and it would save the State from the upkeep of the unemployed by doles and home assistance, it would put more money into the workers' and traders' pockets, and it would increase the consumption of dutiable commodities to the benefit of the revenue and the State.  I believe that is so.  If you put up these considerations against the cost which we are told this tariff would mean to the consumer, this extra £290,000&mdash;I do not know how the figure was arrived at&mdash;but even if you admit it does cost that, I claim the advantages are more than compensated for.  In conclusion, I merely wish to stress the fact that <Col N="267" /> the Government have delayed a great deal in this matter.  If they have any definite policy at all as against the policy of a tariff on flour to assist these mills let them produce it, but they have not done so, and we can only come to the conclusion with reference to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that it has completely departed from the policy of Arthur Griffith.</P>
    <P>A few days ago, when speaking on another subject, the Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;We are standing in the shoes of other men and we are going to carry on their policy.&rdquo;  I wonder what the late President Griffith would think of the arguments used here about mass production, efficiency, and the rest of it. They are a negation, and absolutely contrary to his whole life teaching, and, what is worse, there is nothing offered instead as a policy.  His whole lifetime was spent in trying to put this particular matter of the protection of our industries in force. He claimed that under the present powers we had here we were safe so long as we had those powers and exercised them.  We are not exercising them.  We have allowed the matter to lapse.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party has in private counsels from time to time, I understand, made proposals for compulsory tillage, which Deputy Gorey dislikes so much.  When Deputy Gorey came into this House he was a supporter to some extent of the policy Deputy de Valera has enunciated to-day.  He said there are too many agricultural products coming into the country and they ought to be kept out.  Deputy Gorey has changed.  I do not know why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>I do not know; he might have done the same, but there is nothing in the circumstances of the present time, and there is nothing in the arguments that have been advanced here against this proposal, to show that President Griffith would have been moved.  This is a <Col N="268" /> period of depression.  It is a period when people want a lead from those in charge, a period when people all over the country have demanded that stronger and more vigorous steps should be taken to meet industrial conditions.  Those steps are not being taken, and those members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who feel they are carrying on a national tradition in economic matters ought to ask themselves now whether they are furthering that policy in voting against this motion.  I beg to offer the House the suggestion that whether this proposal is accepted or not steps ought to be taken to improve the Tariff Commission, so that it would have power in future to examine and watch the course of prices in regard to tariffed articles, and that, in the second place, it shall be empowered to deal with the question of foreign combines coming in and taking over Irish industries.  These are two vital defects in this respect in the Government's tariff policy at present, and everyone knows they are there. It is up to the Government to improve the constitution and basis of the Tariff Commission so that it will be able to deal with these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Minister)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy de Valera's speech on this motion, and I confess I was somewhat depressed by it, because I spent three or four months on the Economic Committee, with the aid of the Department of Agriculture, trying to teach the Deputy the elements of agriculture.  On listening to him to-day I had to come to the conclusion that I had completely failed. Whether it is that I am a bad teacher, or he is a bad pupil, I leave to the House to decide.  The fact is that there is a motion before the House, and also an amendment by Deputy O'Connell.  The motion deals with flour and the amendment deals with flour and wheat, principally wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan has a motion also dealing with this question of encouraging the production of wheat in the country, but it seems to me, listening to the debate, that the <Col N="269" /> enthusiasm for the production of wheat which used to exist amongst the Fianna Fáil supporters has completely disappeared.  I take an interest in the Fianna Fáil policy, and even in some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Out of the generosity of my heart, some time ago I told them to stick to the Land Commission annuities, to Document No. 2, to the Oath, and these sort of things.  I want to repeat now for future record: While you may persuade the farmers of the country to repudiate the Land Commission annuities, and while you may persuade them to call themselves Republicans, you never will persuade them to grow 100,000 acres of wheat, for that is business.  While Deputy de Valera has not learned the lessons which I with the greatest pains and conscientiousness have tried to teach him, he has learned that lesson.  It is perfectly clear to me that so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned they have not the slightest belief in this wheat programme.  Deputy O'Connell, the leader of the Labour Party, has put forward his proposals and we will deal with them.  In speaking to these proposals Deputy de Valera told us that we import £26,000,000 worth of agricultural produce which we might produce here.  Roughly, he said, there are £7,000,000 worth out of the £26,000,000 worth for wheat and flour and about £7,000,000 worth for feeding stuffs. That is £14,000,000, and the balance is made up of all sorts of items&mdash; horses, beef, tomatoes and so forth; stock animals and so on.  In the £26,000,000 are included Scotch whiskey, an agricultural product, beer and other drink that come into the country.  He pointed out that apropos of this motion he had made a calculation.  It is not the first time he has pointed out that if we produced this £26,000,000 worth of what he calls agricultural produce in this country, that from the production we would make a net profit of £6,000,000.  I have read that statement three times, repeated exactly word for word.  It may be that an efficient clerk put these <Col N="270" /> figures into his hands, but I suggest to him to show how you make this £6,000,000 profit by producing this £26,000,000 worth of what he calls agricultural produce in the country.</P>
    <P>He made the point that, of course, the production of £26,000,000 of agricultural produce is all gain, because it will be produced in the country, because it means labour employed in the country, and because it means indirect profit in the country to others than farmers. But, in addition to all this gain that will accrue to the trade balance, to labour, etc., there is to be a profit to the farmers of £6,000,000.  How are we to produce this £26,000,000 worth in the country?  Apparently, we are to put an import duty on those goods coming in&mdash;we are to tax them.  We are to tax the £7,000,000 worth of cotton cake, maize, palmnut cake, pollard, etc., which form the raw material of agricultural production.  That ought to be made clear to the farmers, especially the small farmers, who are rearing pigs and who purchase practically all the maize consumed in the country, practically all the linseed cake for their calves, and all the cotton cake for their young cattle.  The big farmers purchase very little of these items.  It is the small farmers who purchase them, and it should be made clear to them that by making cotton cake dearer, maize-meal dearer, and by taxing their linseed cake, they are going to make £6,000,000 more.  That has been put forward three times already as a statesmanlike contribution to the solution of the evils from which agriculture is suffering, or is supposed to be suffering.  The least we might get from the Leader of the Opposition is a little more detail, and I would ask him to explain, with the same lucidity which he displayed when he was dealing with the question of wheat, to farmers like myself, graziers like myself, who do about 50 acres of tillage, how we are going to make a bigger profit by buying cotton cake at an <Col N="271" /> increased price, or, alternatively, by substituting for it a food which is not nearly as suitable for its particular purpose, such as oats or barley. I should like to know where the profit comes in.</P>
    <P>Of course he went on to say also that we import £28,000,000 of nonagricultural products, and that there was to be an immense profit if we put an import duty on all these. Everybody is to be happy except the consumer&mdash;he is to pay through the nose&mdash;and the country is to be all right.  However, that is not strictly relevant.  I should like the Deputy to explain at some more length how the £6,000,000 is to come to the country as a result of taxing the raw materials of agricultural production.  We ought to be self-sufficient, he says.  We are, in a great many ways.  We ought to be self-sufficient with regard to wheat.  In the good old days, about 1918, 1919, 1920 or 1921, when I was a looker-on and saw most of the game, enthusiastic reformers used to come down to my part of the country and used to tell the County Galway farmers about growing wheat.  Wheat is a sort of fetish.  It is a patriotic crop.  Oats and barley are Anglicised, so are turnips and mangolds, but there is something particularly Irish in our philosophy about wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it has become a fetish.  The picture is painted to us of the condition this country would be in in the event of a stoppage of communication between Great Britain and the Free State.  We were reminded that when the general strike took place some years ago there were about 27 days' supply of wheat and flour in the country, and we were invited to contemplate and to make our flesh creep at the prospect of what would happen if by any chance that strike had continued much longer.  As a matter of fact, if that strike had continued much longer, if the communications between this country and Great Britain had been cut, not for a month, but three months, our <Col N="272" /> flesh would creep, but not for the reason that Deputy de Valera has mentioned.  We would find ourselves with so much food and with so little money in this country that after a short time we would be giving the food away.</P>
      <P>If that had happened, the real problem would not be to get food into the country, but to get it out. If that happened the price of cattle &mdash;another British agricultural product&mdash;would have fallen £5 or £6 per head, if they could not get across to Great Britain; the price of butter would completely collapse, there would be no price for eggs, and even the enthusiastic Republicans who go to the fair of Ballinasloe with a basket of eggs on their arm, or a bullock in front of them, would be a little bit disappointed when they were told that there was no one there except the local butcher to buy from them.  There would be quick conversions from the economic Republicanism of Deputy de Valera if that had happened.  We would be in no difficulty from the point of view of starvation.  We would starve, of course, in about two years, because we could not go on living by taking in each other's washing, but I doubt if this general dislocation would have lasted so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can draw any moral you like from that.  You can say, if you wish: &ldquo;Give up producing cattle, give up exporting the surplus of cattle, pigs, bacon and eggs.&rdquo;  But the one moral you cannot draw from it, in the event of a dislocation of trade between Great Britain and Ireland, is that there would be anything in the nature of starvation or any real shortage of wheat.  We could get as much wheat as we wanted from Canada and the Argentine, provided we were prepared to pay for it.  The real trouble would be to pay for it, because we could not get payments for our own goods from Great Britain.  Wheat comes into Dublin, and into Cork and other ports, both from the Argentine and Canada every week as a matter of course. We could get as much wheat as we liked, and the mills of the country would be able to mill, I am told, 80 <Col N="273" /> per cent. of the total requirements of the country, and we could eke out the other 20 per cent. while the struggle lasted with the best beef, bacon, eggs and butter in the world. We really ought to hear the end of this nonsense as to what would happen this country if we ran short of wheat for 27 days because of a dislocation of the transport services between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>They go further, because Fianna Fáil policy is based, as one would expect from heroes, upon the idea that the duty of statesmanship is to provide, not for normal times of peace, not to expect peace as the normal situation of the country, but war.  In the event of war with Great Britain&mdash;which, of course, is bound to come!&mdash;if we have to fight her we will still get supplies from Canada and the Argentine.  I am perfectly certain that we will have a considerable amount of unexpended heroism after walloping the Empire, and if we do take on the rest of the world we will be in a different position. A little extra heroism is nothing, and I put it to the Deputy that by the time we are ready to take on the whole world, to cut off communication between the rest of the world and ourselves; that by the time we build that brass wall effectually around the country, we ought to be prepared to make a little sacrifice, and I say that we will have to make a great many more sacrifices than by doing without supplies of wheat.  That is so much for that particular article.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera's contribution to this weighty problem is this&mdash;I took it down, and I think it should not be forgotten.  I do say that it was really disappointing to me, after conscientiously taking considerable pains to put matters before Deputy de Valera, to find him making these statements. Deputy de Valera is not a farmer, and cannot be blamed for not knowing all about these things.  Deputy Lemass is not a farmer, and could not be expected to know anything about these things.  Deputy Ryan has not yet spoken, so that I leave him out for the present, but I took the greatest possible care to put the <Col N="274" /> whole Department at their disposal and to give them some of the elementary facts that every illiterate farmer in the country knows about wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I made some inquiries and I would like the farmers to listen to this contribution as the serious contribution to this debate of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;We are told that wheat is a precarious crop.  In our opinion, wheat is a less precarious crop than any other grain crop.  We are told that wheat takes more out of the land than any other grain crop.  In our opinion, it takes less out of the land than any other grain crop.  We are told that wheat fouls the land more than any other crop.  In our opinion, it fouls the land less.&rdquo; These are his exact words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not fight about adjectives, but that is the exact sense.  He also said: &ldquo;We believe, in addition, that wheat is a better nurse crop for grass seeds.&rdquo; As a farmer, I will not attempt to comment upon that.  Comment would spoil it.  Every farmer knows that the exact opposite of these four statements is exactly correct.  Wheat is a more precarious crop; it is much more exhausting to the land; it is eleven months in the land, and it is more exhausting for other reasons. Wheat fouls the land more because weeds grow better if the land is not stirred and cleaned, and the land is not stirred under wheat from November till the following August. The weeds have the whole summer to go ahead.  Wheat is not a better <Col N="275" /> crop for grass seeds.  I know the reason the Deputy stumbled into that mistake.  An agricultural instructor mentioned, in his presence and in mine, that in some places they have heavy land where oats lodge and where it lodges grass does not do well.  In some places, they sow wheat and they put in grass seed with it&mdash;presumably spring wheat&mdash;for it is almost out of the question to put in grass seed with autumn wheat, and ninety per cent. of the wheat grown in this country would be autumn wheat.</P>

      <P>Comment would spoil it.  I assert as a farmer that the statement that wheat is a good nurse crop for grass seed is absolutely a foolish statement.  That is Deputy de Valera's contribution to the wheat problem.  Deputy O'Connell used somewhat the same argument but he got down to business to some extent.  He said he realised that it was almost probable that we could not get anything like the total quantity of wheat required by this <Col N="276" /> country grown in the country within any reasonable period, and he suggested we should aim at twenty per cent.  When I asked him what subsidy he thought would get this twenty per cent., he answered £1 per ton as a guess.  Take that figure. £1 per ton, as Deputy Gorey pointed out, is 2/6 per barrel.  I assume what the Deputy has in mind is this: that the farmer who grows wheat under this scheme will take it to the miller and the miller will pay to him the world-price of wheat, plus 2/6, or an arrangement will be made by which he will receive the world-price, plus 2/6 per barrel.  But it does not end there.  The miller pays the world-price for Irish wheat but he has to get compensation also, because he is not getting a barrel of wheat which corresponds with a barrel of Pacific wheat though paying for it.  He is getting a barrel of wheat, apart from quality or flavour, that contains seven per cent. more moisture, and he has to make allowance for the cost of taking out that moisture, which the Flour Millers' Association themselves computed will take three shillings per barrel.  So that the real subsidy there is 5/6 per barrel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leaving out all that.  That has to be taken into account.  It has, also, to be taken into account that people, rightly or wrongly, prefer the flavour of foreign wheat, but I am leaving out all that.  The subsidy is 2/6 to the farmer, and the miller, in order to be put in the same position and to sell bread at the same price, must get an additional three shillings.  It is suggested that there will be a way of taking out the moisture much more inexpensively, but that particular suggestion is quite out of the question, because it would mean that the farmers would have to deliver their wheat in regular lots at specified mills, in certain quantities, and it would be utterly impossible to get farmers to deliver in that way or to find the regular supplies needed in order to mix Pacific with <Col N="277" /> Irish wheat so that the Pacific wheat would suck the moisture out of the Irish.  So that in addition to the 2/6 paid to the farmer, the miller would have to get three shillings.  When he gets three shillings compensation, he will have a certain amount of wheat that will make exactly the same amount of flour as a barrel of Pacific wheat.  I think it would take about eleven million cwts. of wheat to supply the flour required in the country.  It is 10,900,000, something less than 11,000,000, in round figures, 11,000,000.  That amounts to 4,400,000 barrels, and at 5/-, not 5/6, it would require £1,100,000 of a subsidy to get all the wheat required for the country grown in the country.</P>

      <P>We will come back to the other point later on.  Now the first question you have got to ask yourself is what are the chances that farmers would grow for this 2/6 extra.  We were debating this matter.  I am not giving away any secrets; it has been referred to in debate and it is in the report of the Economic Committee.  It was suggested that farmers would grow wheat if they got a guaranteed price of about 30/- a barrel for it.  I give it as my view that farmers would not grow wheat in any additional quantities for 30/- a barrel, and I pointed out that the price in the year 1928 that could be got by the farmers for good milling wheat was between 30/- and 31/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it could be got then.  Certainly they could get 30/-. Deputy Dr. Ryan, I think, pointed out that it was very fine, and made the point that if there were a definite guarantee of 30/- wheat could be got.  I am still of the opinion that nothing like 10,000 acres extra could be got for 30/- a barrel.  That was the figure suggested.  What is the price of wheat at the present moment?  It varies from 22/- or <Col N="278" /> 23/- to 26/-.  Australian wheat is 26/1.  Manitoba is 21/3; a certain standard of Manitoba, good quality wheat is 21/3.  Rossafidda 22/9, and No. 3 Manitoba would be about 23/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exceptional. The price of wheat has broken, and it is rather amusing in view of that to read the forecasts contained in the minority report signed by Deputy Lemass.  We were told that there were indications from everywhere in the world that there would be a shortage of wheat, that the price of wheat would go up, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is this year's wheat that is being quoted at that price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These are forward quotations.  In fact, what has happened.  The price of wheat has broken for reasons I am not aware of, for reasons which were very hard to measure, but there are certain considerations which are known to us all, and which we can take into account without placing too much reliance on them, and those are: luckily for us the Argentine is getting out of cattle raising to some extent.  Their stock has dropped, I am delighted to say, by about 25 per cent.  Canada is getting more and more out of cattle raising, and more and more into wheat.  Wheat growing has gone into Alberta, the great cattle raising province, and is going further north every year.  While nobody can prophesy, and while it is dangerous to draw deductions, there is one thing clear, and it is this: that there are no circumstances apparent at present which would lead anyone to prophesy that wheat would go up. Whatever indications are there point to the fact that wheat is going to come down.  Take this year.  The prices I quoted were 26/-, 23/- or <Col N="279" /> 21/-.  Take the highest price and make it 27/-, if you like, and for all you know, and for all any Deputy knows, the price of wheat may fall further next year.  Twenty-six shillings plus 2/6 is 28/6.  Last year, for good milling wheat in this country, you got 30/-.  In the light of these facts does any Deputy in the House seriously think that you can get one acre of wheat extra for that 2/6 in view of the fact that last year and the year before farmers who had milling wheat to sell could get 30/- a barrel for it?</P>

      <P>But did the area of wheat raised increase one iota? There are 31,000 acres, roughly, growing at present.  That has been the acreage for the past two or three years.  In spite of the fact, as Deputy Ryan admits, that, say, the year before last 30/- could be got for wheat&mdash;I put this to Deputy O'Connell, or anyone who likes, not from the agricultural point of view, but from the business position with the basic price round about 27/-, if he <Col N="280" /> offers 2/6 more than 29/6 or 28/6, it may be lower or higher, in view of the fact that wheat was fetching between 30/- and 31/- the year before last, and that the area has remained absolutely constant and even with the price of 31/&mdash;does he think that there is the slightest chance of getting 10,000 acres extra?  There is not the slightest possible chance of getting the difference between the present figure of 32,000 and 100,000 acres for a subsidy of 2/6 a barrel. I will put a ten pound note aside and buy all the wheat that would be grown by every member of the Dáil at the fixed price of 28/-, that would be brought genuinely in because of that price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no analogy. It is not the extra shilling they were thinking of; it was the 43 shillings or the 44 shillings that were behind <Col N="281" /> it.  When a farmer is considering the question of whether he will sow wheat or not, he has to take into account very much more than the price he is going to get for it.  If I was thinking of growing wheat on a large scale as a catch crop, the way I would approach it is this, not whether I would get 2/6 a barrel extra for the wheat, but whether I would have to change my economy to a considerable extent.  If you want anything like 100,000 acres or 200,000 acres, a great many people in this country must sow three, four, five or six, and in some cases ten acres extra, and when I come to the question of growing ten acres there will be the question of other crops. I am sowing so much oats, so much roots, and so much barley for feeding. Yet I have to buy between £400 and £500 worth of feeding stuffs each year.  The smaller, mixed farmer has to buy correspondingly less.  The best mixed farmers are the men who are buying the most feeding stuffs and who are tilling most.  I ask myself why have I to buy these foodstuffs? I could, if I wished, substitute additional oats, additional barley, which I could grow, but if I grow that I am short of hay for my stock in winter time, and I am short of a certain amount of grazing for my cows. That, of course, does not apply to every farmer.  It applies to the best farmers, the people who are tilling most, the people who are likely to respond to any inducement for increased tillage.  I have to ask myself is it worth my while to change my whole economy, to break up more land for the purpose of producing a catch-crop which, in the main, even with a subsidy, will hardly leave me a profit.  These are the considerations I will take into account.  You might possibly, by guaranteeing a price of 33/- or 34/- a barrel, get 60,000 or 70,000 additional acres, but if you want to look for 200,000 or 300,000 acres you must contemplate that the farmers whose lands are suitable for wheat-growing will put them under wheat and use them under wheat in big quantities, that they will go into tillage in a big way. To get them to do that, you will <Col N="282" /> have to offer them an extravagant subsidy.  An agricultural inspector put the thing in a nutshell, in answer to a question by Deputy de Valera.  He asked him what he thought would induce farmers to grow 300,000 or 400,000 acres of wheat.  His answer was &ldquo;the gun.&rdquo; That is what it comes to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a good joke; it is the truth.  No money inducement that you could mention without being so extravagant that it would be laughed at, would get, in the circumstances of this country, 300,000 or 400,000 acres of wheat extra.  Supposing you did, by offering an extravagant monetary inducement to farmers, get an increase from 31,000 to 100,000 you would pay for that, roughly speaking, in my opinion, £2 an acre.  You would pay something like between £150,000 and £200,000 for that. What would you have got?  In nine cases out of ten you would not have got an extra acre of tillage.  You would have got substitution.  We examined this question of substitution with great care at the Economic Committee and no one was able to suggest a practical way in which you could prevent substitution.  If you are to prevent substitution you must hold, first, a survey of the crops <Col N="283" /> of the country.  You must know exactly what each farmer is sowing. You must re-inspect them every year and afterwards you must provide most intricate, elaborate and costly machinery to prevent farmers from dealing with each other and getting around it.  We are paying a handsome subsidy for sugar beet, over £20 an acre.  Yet it is very largely substituted.  I should say that out of 10,000 acres of sugar beet there are between 7,000 and 8,000 acres substituted sugar beet.  So, if you had spent between £150,000 and £200,000 to get about one-sixth of the wheat supplies of the country for the sake of saying we were growing wheat, you would have spent it largely not to bring about increased tillage but simply for the substitution of one crop for another.  As well as the loss to the taxpayers of the country in spending £200,000 wastefully, you would have the cost of the administration and you would have a further and even heavier indirect loss; you would have persuaded farmers to get out of a permanent system which might have been quite sound, a system which, in my opinion, is a sound system, of raising crops on the farm for consumption on the farm, to give it up, temporarily, because it could only be temporarily, and to revert to another system which was bound to break down.  You would have persuaded numbers of farmers to sow wheat on land that was unsuitable and, in my opinion, the direct loss due to that would be greater than the loss due to administration costs and the waste of the subsidy.</P>

      <P>So far as the subsidy is concerned it would get us nowhere.  It would be immensely costly.  It would be availed of by farmers to change the existing and better economy, the production of crops, both corn and roots, for consumption on the farm.  In addition to that what would be happening would be that the subsidy would be paid, so far as it was paid at all, by farmers on the poor land in favour of the farmers on the rich land.  You would have no wheat grown in the poorer districts.  You would have no wheat grown in Leitrim.  I did not hear much about wheat in the Sligo-Leitrim election.  The Land Commission annuities are a lot better there.  Stick to land annuities. In Sligo they grow very little wheat. In Galway or any of the Western counties or in any of the light land you have little wheat.  So far as you can induce wheat growing at all, it would be on the better land, and so far as the farmers who were paying that subsidy as taxpayers&mdash;I know they would not be paying the whole of it&mdash;are concerned it would be the farmers on the poor land who would be paying the subsidy for the benefit of the farmers on the rich land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, therefore, are the arguments in favour of wheat-growing?  The position about wheat-growing is this: it is an admitted fact that the trend of prices has been against wheat for a long period as against any other crop.  By that I do not suggest simply that wheat has fallen.  When I speak of the trend of prices I mean wheat has fallen and the price of other crops has risen.  As between the two, taking an index figure, say, in 1848 or 1860, the trend of prices has been against wheat as compared with any other crop&mdash;barley, oats, mangolds or turnips.  That establishes at least a prima facie case that wheat pays the farmer less than any other crop, and that prima facie case is absolutely confirmed when you look at the figures and find that there are three or four hundred thousand acres of oats, four or five hundred thousand acres of potatoes, two or three hundred thousand acres of turnips and mangolds, and only 31,000 <Col N="285" /> acres of wheat.  That is the position for a long number of years.  When you take these circumstances together you are inevitably driven to the conclusion that wheat pays the farmer less than any other crop, and you can only get away from that conclusion on the assumption that the farmer is a fool and does not know his business.  That is an assumption which I refuse to make.  If it is once accepted, then another question arises.  Nobody suggests that there should not be more tillage.  There should be.  There is plenty of room for an increase in oats, ample room for an increase in barley for feeding purposes, and ample room for an increase in turnips and mangolds.  The position is that the best farmers in the country are mixed farmers, and they are the people who are tilling most.  On the other hand, there are many farmers, almost a majority, who, while they are in exactly the same position as mixed farmers, are not tilling nearly as much, and the real problem is to get that majority up to the standard of the best mixed farmers.  There is ample room for an increase in oats, mangolds, turnips and barley, and therefore if you are going to subsidise you have a choice of crops.  We do not stand for subsidies for many reasons.  We believe that they are wasteful in administration, that they will lead mainly to substitution, and that they are mainly paid by people who are subsidised, so that they result in nothing. If you are to subsidise, why not subsidise other crops?  You would get better results.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely certain that a bigger subsidy will be required to make an unprofitable crop profitable.  It is absolutely certain that it will take a bigger subsidy to make wheat profitable than the subsidy required for oats, a crop which pays to some extent, at any rate.  There is, however, no case for any subsidy, no matter how small, on wheat.  There is no point in saying: &ldquo;Let us make experiments.&rdquo;  It would cost a tremendous amount of money to get all the wheat required in this country grown here.  Let us say 20 per cent. What is the advantage of getting 20 <Col N="286" /> per cent.?  Why should we?  If we have money to spare in order to get a 20 per cent. increase in tillage, why not apply it in other directions? What particular virtue has wheat? Wheat is a most precarious crop.  It exhausts the soil, it fouls the land, and it fails often.  It gives a lower profit; so far as the average farmer is concerned, he makes less profit out of it than any other crop.  If you take the other side, and if a farmer can sow more oats, more barley, more turnips and mangolds, the conclusion is inevitable that instead of spending whatever money you have on wheat it could be spent on encouraging the production of crops which are already paying the farmer, but which he could still grow with twice as much profit.  That disposes absolutely of the contention that while it may be impossible to get all the wheat required in the country produced here we could get portion of it.  We do not believe in this policy, and we are not going to make experiments.  If other parties believe that experiments should be made let them make them and let them take all the credit or all the blame attached to them.  I have no faith in that policy.  I do not believe in subsidies, particularly in regard to wheat, and we do not intend to subsidise wheat.  As I have said before, I do not care what your protestations may be, there never will be a subsidy for wheat, except, perhaps, for one year.  We may get away with it on political issues, but when we get down to hard, practical facts and try to get the farmer to do certain things we have to stop talking in generalities and we find that we are up against insuperable difficulties.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to the flour-milling proposal, we are told that we are approaching this question with a prejudice against the flour millers, that we are always acting as devil's advocates, and that the normal and patriotic point of view should be to approach the question sympathetically and with a view to insuring, if at all possible, that the millers should get a tariff.  I entirely deny that particular definition of <Col N="287" /> patriotism.  I believe in the good old maxim that the man who pays the piper should call the tune.  I believe that the consumer is as good an Irishman as the producer.  He is often the same person.  I believe that the consumer, who pays for any tariff and whose point of view we represent, is absolutely entitled to make sure first that a tariff is necessary and, secondly, that if it is necessary only the very minimum tariff should be given.  If I go into a shop to buy certain goods for £1 and if I am told by the producer that I will have to pay £1 5s. 0d., I am entitled to say that I can get them at £1 next door and that I earned that 5s.  I am entitled to ask why he charges £1 5s. 0d., and, if he gives as his reason the cost of production, I am entitled to ask him whether he is sure that his business is organised on proper lines and whether changes in his business would not enable him to sell that article at the same price as other producers.  I am entitled to go further and say: &ldquo;Would changes in your business enable you to sell it at £1 2s. 6d.?&rdquo; That point of view is forgotten by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The idea is that anybody producing in this country has only to call himself a patriot, and protest that he is producing for the good of the country and not for his own profit, to ask for a tariff and, unless the consumer can prove that he does not want the tariff, the consumer must fork out his hard-earned money.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how this policy of increasing prices in general, increasing the price of cotton cake, woollens, flour, boots&mdash;all these necessaries of life&mdash;by tariffs is going to keep more people in Leitrim-Sligo or more people in the poorer areas of Donegal.  I can see that there are advantages in tariffs both from the point of view of the industrialist and the nation as a whole, but I cannot see, from the point of view of the consumer, that the fact that he has to pay more for his necessaries of life or for the raw materials of production, is going to enable him to keep one son more at home.</P>

Whatever else Deputy <Col N="289" /> Lemass may be, he is not exactly stupid.  There are ways in which he is not stupid, and when he puts it to me that there is more emigration in County Leitrim than in any other county in Ireland and asks me to explain why that is so in view of the fact that there are no industries and no tariffs in Leitrim, he knows he is entirely irrelevant.  I am making a specific point in connection with tariffs.  I admit that tariffs to a certain limited extent increase employment and increase wealth.  I am pointing out that there is another side to it and that unless people who impose tariffs are very careful, the evils which tariffs bring in their train will more than counterbalance the advantages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the question of flour, we are told that milling is disappearing.  I see no evidence of that.  As far as I can get any information, there is practically the same amount of flour milled in the country this year as last year or the year before.  It is, roughly, the same.  There are no indications that the mills are going to be closed immediately.  We are told by Deputy Lemass that we ought to ignore the case made by the flour millers and, with his usual modesty, he goes on to inform us that he is prepared to make a much better case.  I read carefully the case made by the flour millers and I listened very carefully to the case Deputy Lemass attempted to make for them. My view, for what it is worth, is that they made a very much better case for themselves than Deputy Lemass did, and their case was the worst I ever listened to or read. There is, in my opinion, no case whatever for a tariff on flour in this country.  At the present moment, fifty per cent. of the flour consumed in the country is being produced in the country, very largely from imported wheat.  At the present moment, the Irish flour millers have <Col N="290" /> adequate protection.  They have 12/- per ton on flour and 15/- per ton on offals.  Wheat, except parcel wheat, can be bought at practically the same price here as in Birkenhead. The spot price is the same in Liverpool as in Dublin.  If you take the case of a mill at Birkenhead and a mill here in Dublin, and say that the miller in Birkenhead buys ten tons of wheat and the miller in Dublin also buys ten tons.  They buy it at the same price and they mill it into flour and offals.  From the ten tons of wheat in each case there are got seven tons of flour and three tons of offals.  You have got the seven tons of flour in Birkenhead, if you like, free on board, and the seven tons of flour in Dublin.  You have got three tons of offals in Birkenhead and three tons of offals in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assume that the two consignments of flour and offals from Birkenhead are being sold here in Dublin in competition with the flour and offals produced here.  The freights between Birkenhead and Dublin&mdash;they are less than the freights between Birkenhead and Galway, or Birkenhead and Limerick, so I am taking the figures that are least favourable to myself&mdash;are 12/- per ton for flour. It costs the miller in Birkenhead, therefore, 84/- to take over that seven tons of flour to Dublin.  It costs him 15/- per ton to take over the three tons of offals&mdash;that is 45/-, or a total for the whole consignment of 129/-.  In other words, by the time that the seven tons of flour and the three tons of offals are landed in Dublin to compete with the seven tons of flour and the three tons of offals produced here, the English miller has paid 129/-.  The Irish miller can get exactly the same price for his offals as the English miller. Therefore he has that protection.  It works out, roughly speaking, at 2/4 per sack.  That is the protection as between Dublin and Birkenhead. These figures cannot be challenged except it is alleged that wheat can be purchased cheaper in Birkenhead than in Dublin.  Wheat can be purchased cheaper in Birkenhead than in Dublin, but only to a very limited <Col N="291" /> extent.  As Deputy Lemass admitted when he was making his case, the amount of parcel wheat that is bought is only an infinitesimal portion of cargo wheat.  The spot price is the same in Dublin as in Birkenhead. The cost of the raw material is the same, and the freight is not denied.</P>
    <P>On these figures, which the flour millers admitted, and which were not denied in any evidence put before the Economic Committee, there is already a protection of over 2/- per sack on flour milled in this country in favour of the home millers. Is that protection not enough for them?  Is there any reason why it should not be?  Is there any reason why the consumer should be asked to pay them more?  Is there any reason why the small farmer, the small shopkeeper, or the labourer in the poorer districts, should be asked to pay more?  I cannot see it.  We are told that Irish mills are suffering from one disadvantage, inasmuch as, for commercial reasons, they cannot make patent flour; they can only make straight-run flour.  They do find it impossible for commercial reasons to make patent flour because they have no market for the low-grade flour left over.  I should say that not more than 20 per cent. of the flour consumed in the country is patent flour, and until the millers are producing 80 per cent., between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent., of the flour consumed in the country, they are not under any disadvantage whatever by reason of the fact that they are not able to make patent flour. We are told, also, as an inducement, that the farmers will get the benefit of cheap offals.  I would like to know why.  Roughly speaking, if all the flour consumed in this country were milled in the country we would have 20 to 25 per cent. too much offals.  Roughly speaking, if 75 per cent. of the flour consumed in this country were milled in the country we would have exactly the amount of offals required in the country. Now, until the mills reach that capacity, that is to say, 75 per cent., there <Col N="292" /> will be no surplus, and there is no reason on earth why the price of offals should fall by one penny.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, until the mills reach 80 per cent. of the total requirements of the country there will be no surplus offals that will make any difference to the price. The price of offals would not fall one penny.  There is no use in saying they would.  There are many people in business who could sell cheaper than they do.  In business a man gets what he is able.  He gets the maximum price.  I get the highest price I can in business. Every other person says the same. Otherwise they would not be in business.  There is no reason why there should be a fall of a single penny in the price of bran or pollard until 80 per cent. of the flour used in the country is milled in the country instead of as at present 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that patent flour will always be demanded in this country.  I personally believe from the witnesses I have heard and from my reading of the Tariff Commission Report that the millers contemplate always importing patent flour. It is almost impossible to keep patent flour out, because you cannot get a test which can be operated at the ports.  I am quite satisfied that they contemplate always importing patent flour.  The position of the millers is this: &ldquo;We would be very glad to get 80 per cent. of the flour business because a lot of us have bakeries.  We would be very glad to import patent flours and we will then be in the happy position of being protected by a tariff.  We will be able to sell our flour up to the hilt and we need not give a rebate of a single penny in the offals, because as long as patent flour comes in and offals up to that 20 per cent. are not brought in there will be no surplus of offals.&rdquo;  Even if patent flour were stopped the first effect of the tariff, as almost admitted in the Minority Report, would be to bring in much more efficient and better equipped mills.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely satisfied that the <Col N="293" /> first effect of the tariff would be to wipe out the country mills.  I do not believe there would be a small mill left in Cork.  We will be asked, of course, to stop these millers from coming in and we will be asked to control prices.  Do not ask us that again.  We have some experience of controlling prices and we have some experience also of the waste and extravagance and inefficiency entailed in having prices controlled. It is practically impossible for a Government to control prices with any sort of satisfaction to the consumer. If a tariff is imposed there is no question about it efficient mills will come in, and come in immediately, and the smaller mills will be wiped out.  The milling trade of this country, which at present is not in the hands of a very large number of people, will then be in the hands of a much smaller number, and I have sufficient confidence in the business instincts of these millers to believe that they will see to it that even if there is a seasonal surplus of offals that they would be kept off the market, that they would be put into compound cakes and sold here at world prices, and even if there is a slight rebate to the wholesaler, I know that by the time it comes down to me and to Deputy Gorey we will get very little of that rebate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the consumer there will be no rebate.  It cannot be denied that until the home milling reaches 80 per cent. of the requirements there would be no surplus of offals and no reduction.  The first effect of the tariff will be to reduce the number of mill owners in this country, and everybody knows that in the absence of Government control that is going to lead to an arrangement which will insure that the full prices would be charged for the flour, that full advantage would be taken of the tariff, and that full world prices will be received for the offals.  Deputy Lemass took great care to show us <Col N="294" /> that under certain circumstances&mdash; he quoted a lot of figures about the fluctuation of the prices of bread and the relation between bread and flour and showed to his own satisfaction that the millers could have sold their flour at cheaper prices in certain circumstances.  Of course they could.  That argument is positively childish.  It is not a question of what a business man can sell an article at.  It is not a question whether a business man could sell at a certain price and still take a profit.  Every business man sells at the highest possible price he can get, and if a tariff is imposed business men will charge fully up to that tariff and the only thing that can stop them is internal competition.  If the milling business falls into the hands of the Dublin Milling Company and the few millers connected with it, there will be no internal competition and they would be fools if there were.  They would be a most incompetent body if there were internal competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to answer that.  I have not much knowledge of the costings in the bread industry but I do know this particular subject and I am dealing with it now.  What are the reasons for the tariff?  It has not been proved here that the milling industry is dying.  The figures show that the industry is practically stationary. It has not been proved here that the millers made any suggestion to meet their difficulties in another way.  Deputy Lemass asked what can be done for the millers. What can be done for people who <Col N="295" /> have already protection to the extent of 2/- a sack?  I tell you one thing that can be done&mdash;that is a good basis to start with.  We are told that if they reach their maximum output, if they were working at their full capacity, that their cost of production would be reduced and they could compete with the British.</P>
      <P>What is to stop them reaching their maximum output?  Capital? We will give it to them.  There is the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. Let them come forward and make application under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  But why should they do that?  As long as there is any hope that there is going to be a tariff imposed, and that the unfortunate consumer is going to be bled to the extent of 2/- or 3/- a sack for their benefit, why should they take the trouble of equipping their mills so as to work to their full capacity? As a matter of fact, the millers are solving their difficulties, and they would have solved them long ago only for all the nonsense that is talked about a tariff on flour.  When we have definitely shown that we are not going to be humbugged on this issue you will find that the millers will do this, and they will be able to look after themselves, with the result that the output of their mills will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not that argument be used against every application for a tariff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not.  Every application must stand on its merits. I could put up an excellent case for a tariff on oats and margarine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suffers from the delusion that tariff reform is a sort of dogma which applies generally and in all circumstances. When I pointed out that the consumer was entitled to ask whether a tariff was necessary and how much it should be, Deputy Lemass nodded approval.  Now he goes back to his <Col N="296" /> old position.  One tariff is the same as another, and everything, in fact, should be tariffed.  He sees no reason why the arguments I put forward in regard to this industry should not apply to every other industry as well.  What the Deputy really means is that there should be a sound principle of economics setting out that every industry in every country should get whatever tariff it required. Of course that is absurd.  I know that the millers have their special difficulties.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not charge the millers with inefficiency. He pointed out that the mills were built at times when, perhaps, the economic conditions were different. Now, because of location and other causes, they were unsuitably placed, and in certain cases there was not the most efficient management.</P>
      <P>If it is true that the mills will be on a paying basis immediately they reach their maximum production and when they are working full time, then why not reach that position in another way?  What do they want? Do they want money?  That is what the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was passed for.  Let them prove their case and the money is there for them.  They want a tariff instead, a tariff which will give them a permanent subsidy.  The Deputy knows quite well that once a tariff is imposed it is next to impossible to take it off.  Indiscriminate tariffs are a bad principle, but it would be worse if there was a Government in charge which would give a tariff one year and take it off the next year.  There would be absolutely no security.  It is no use suggesting that this tariff might be removed later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one other point which had relation to dumping.  I think Deputy Lemass admitted in cross-examination that he had no case in regard to that.  The Deputy started to prove what dumping meant.  He pointed out that dumping meant selling below the cost of production. He asked us how could the millers have knowledge of it.  Who would have better knowledge?  The millers are in touch with their customers, <Col N="297" /> and they know at what price their customers are able to get flour from other concerns.  If they cannot get information with regard to dumping, no one can get it.  They came forward on two occasions to deal with the question of dumping, and on both occasions when they attempted to prove it they failed lamentably. There was one attempt made to prove there was dumping and a start was made with the price of 45/- odd for wheat.  The witness admitted in the course of examination that suitable wheat could be got at 44/6.  The figures brought forward on that occasion proved that there was no dumping.  When it is in the interests of an organisation to prove dumping, and when that organisation, which has all the requisite knowledge and the opportunities of getting full knowledge, fails to prove dumping, then it certainly ought not to lie with the Deputy to allege that there is dumping.  There is no proof of dumping.  It is a fact that competition is keen, that English millers are selling at very keen prices, and that England is over-milled and is competing with the Irish mills in a strenuous way.  But when one remembers that the Irish millers have already ample protection in the way of freights and transit charges, then no case can be made for a tariff for that reason.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to page 16 of the Minority Report.  I would like to take one example from the figures given there.  We are told that a certain amount of flour was brought into this country and that it was sold at a certain figure.  I find that it works out at 45/7 a sack.  We are told that the wheat to produce it could be bought for a certain figure, which I work out at 31/6.  I then applied 31/6 for wheat to the costings figure given in the Deputy's own report, and I find, on his own figures, that the flour cost 40/6 to produce.  Mutatis mutandis&mdash;the the cost of producing the flour was 40/6.  The position, on the Deputy's own figures, is that flour can be produced at 40/6 and sold at 45/7.  In addition to that there are offals amounting to nearly £1,000,000. <Col N="298" /> Apparently, on the Deputy's own figures, there is a fortune to be made in flour; that is, if these figures are correct.  You would there have a profit of 5/- on the price of flour and, in addition, you would have the offals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I calculate it is sold for 45/7.  The Report goes on: &ldquo;If there had been an effective import duty in operation during that period resulting in the complete exclusion of foreign flour, the quantity of wheat which should have been imported to produce the same quantity of flour... would have been 4,695,811 cwts.  At the prices for wheat prevailing during that year these 4,695,811 cwts. would have been secured for £2,954,447, or £130,187 less than the amount paid for the corresponding quantity of flour.&rdquo;  I calculate that that works out at 31/6 a sack.</P>

      <P>I merely quote it to show the Deputy that his figures are absurd.  In the course of the debate I told him that we had too many statistics in this country.  Seditious literature and statistics are the curse of this country.  It should be made a penal offence to publish statistics. The amount of injury that the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce is doing to the Party opposite is almost unbelievable. They produce these figures, and they draw deductions from them showing how much we lose and by how much our trade balance is so adversely affected.  But when I make a calculation from their figures I find a perfectly ludicrous result.  The only lesson to be drawn from all this&mdash;and I have warned Deputies about it already&mdash;is that they should not use these figures without realising all the implications that may follow.  The figures which have led to such results as I have quoted are about as valuable as the rest of the figures, and that means that they have no value at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister started his speech by saying that you are never going to persuade the farmers to grow 100,000 acres of wheat.  I notice that in 1925 the Minister, speaking on the question of wheat, said that for the last two or three years the farmer was paying £1 0s. 6d. for a bag of flour that he could produce off his land at 12/- if that land were in good heart.  When he stated that before, Deputy Gorey stood up and said that the land in this country would not produce wheat.  Most of the land in the country has produced wheat.  At that time the Minister was advocating the growing of wheat by the farmers in the country.  Deputy Gorey was then, as now, opposed to the growing of wheat.  The Minister, in his speech to-day, has made it out to be one of the biggest disasters that <Col N="300" /> could befall a farmer to grow wheat on account of the injury it is going to do to his lands, and so on.  During these last four years he must have found out his mistake, or if not, he is trying now to score a point against us as to the conditions under which wheat is grown, as he scored a point against the then Opposition, which was the Farmers' Party.  The Minister said: &ldquo;It was done practically all over the country.&rdquo;  Mr. Gorey said: &ldquo;It was done.  When?&rdquo;  The Minister said: &ldquo;It was done between 1840 and 1850.&rdquo;&ldquo;It was when they had nothing else to eat,&rdquo; said Deputy Gorey.</P>

      <P>The Dáil debates, 4th June, 1925.  Later the Minister said: &ldquo;They could, on the average, produce barley and oats 3/- or 4/- a cwt. cheaper than they can purchase. Indian meal.  They can produce wheat for 7/- or 8/- per cwt. cheaper than they can purchase flour.&rdquo;  Our economy has changed since then.  If we were to do that now the whole economy of the farmer would be changed.  The man who is tilling 15 acres out of 200 acres, and the small farmer proportionately, would have to grow more oats, more roots, would have to go into his meadow and have no hay for the winter.  He would have to sell his live stock; in fact, farming would have to be changed so much that you would have to compensate the farmer, not only for growing wheat but for having his whole farm turned topsy-turvy, but in 1925 that was not the policy, when the Farmers' Party were in opposition.  But now, when the Farmers' Party have joined the Government Party that is the wrong policy.  &ldquo;If I am wrong in that, I want to be shown where I am wrong. I want to be shown I am wrong when I say that you can produce a cwt. of barley for 8/-, and you can <Col N="301" /> produce it on the average slightly less than one ton to the statute acre.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>From the Minister's speech in 1925.  &ldquo;I will give you some figures which may be of interest&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister was interested in statistics at that time&mdash;&ldquo;He can produce barley at 8/-, yet he is giving 12/- for Indian meal. That man might have two or three sons who might not be working terribly hard.  What has that man been giving for flour, for instance, for the last two or three years?  He was paying £1 or £1 0s. 6d. for the bag.  He could produce that for about 12/- off his own land if that land was in good heart.  When I stated that before, Deputy Gorey said that very little land will produce wheat.  Most of the land of this country has produced wheat.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>He said later: &ldquo;I am only pointing out that they could produce wheat, and did produce it.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Wheat cannot be produced upon a good deal of the land in the country at present because the land has gone back and it is not in good heart,&rdquo; and the Minister made this very interesting observation: &ldquo;I have seen the land myself and I know it.&rdquo;  He knew from the look of the land that it could produce wheat.  Now, what does the Minister know after four more years of experience? The Minister said that if there was a dislocation between Ireland and England some two years ago and if that dislocation had continued the serious thing we would be <Col N="302" /> up against would not be to get food into Ireland but to get food out of Ireland.  I heard him make that observation before.  But I never quite understood it until he said why.  He said the dislocation would be between England and Ireland only, that the rest of the world would be in communication with us to supply us with wheat, provided that we had the money to pay for it.  He said that we could get it from Canada or the Argentine if we were able to pay for it.  But we would not be able to pay for it because England would not take our produce.  What is wrong with that, supposing we were in that position?  It must be that we are wrong in having only one market for our produce or that we are wrong in bringing wheat from a foreign country, because we may be in a predicament some time.  Therefore, until we get alternative markets for our produce or have other than the British market for our cattle, butter and eggs and other things, I think we are in a very precarious position, just as wheat is a precarious crop, if we do not produce more of our own foodstuffs.  I read in the Majority Report a lot of things.  It talks about the good time we could have by living on the best of beef, butter, bacon and everything else, and it actually goes so far as to say that if the thing were to last for a couple of years we could even begin to sow our own wheat. Where we are to get the seed from is a mystery.  Even, if such a situation were to occur suddenly in the month of October, when we would have the largest amount of wheat available, we would not have half the amount necessary to sow the land to provide one year's supply.  What would we do in the meantime?</P>

      <P>We have not enough bacon and stirabout.  Presumably, the live stock of the country in such a case would be fed on the grain and the produce of the land, we would be fed on the live stock, and our dead bodies would be thrown out on <Col N="303" /> the land for manure in order to make up the circuit.  The Majority Report starts off by giving us an insight into the minds of the men who read and signed the Majority Report, and I suppose some of them did not read it before they signed it. On page 1 of that report it is stated: &ldquo;Otherwise the millers would be subject to unfair competition inasmuch as flours manufactured from imported wheats, if sold without restriction, would appeal more strongly to public taste than flour made wholly or partially from native wheat.&rdquo;  There you have the mind of people who, naturally and without question, will always take it for granted that anything made from Irish wheat or anything of Irish manufacture will be inferior to the foreign article until it is proved to be superior.  The onus is always on the Irish article to prove itself superior.  If they had gone to the trouble of looking up the application for a tariff on flour they would find there a proof that the native wheat was superior in flavour and colour.  Messrs. Odlum and Odlum, on page 93 of the Tariff Commission Report, reporting on samples of Irish wheat submitted to them by the Department of Agriculture, said: &ldquo;We are of opinion that wheat of the type reported on above can be incorporated in the average Irish miller's grist to great advantage, both in the matter of colour and of flavour.&rdquo;  They did not say that there would be no disadvantage in incorporating it; they said that it could be incorporated with great advantage not only in the matter of flavour, but in the matter of colour, so that you could have your cream loaf of better flavour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little time now, and I would like to get on to a few other points.  That shows the <Col N="304" /> prejudice of the men who started to write the Majority Report.  In addition to their prejudice there was their ignorance.  They say on page 9, paragraph 12: &ldquo;Popular taste in the Saorstát at present demands bakers' bread of a kind which can be made only from flour milled from a grist composed wholly or almost wholly of strong wheat.&rdquo;  I do not know who in particular was responsible for this report, but very likely it was the Minister for Agriculture who took responsibility for it.  But I think that the Minister for Agriculture, surrounded by a competent staff, might have been advised that there is no bread made by a baker composed wholly or almost wholly of flour coming from a strong wheat.  The ordinary mixture that the bakers make up contains 60 per cent. from a strong wheat and 40 per cent. from a weak wheat.  That is neither the whole nor almost the whole.  If it had been 10 per cent. from weak wheat and 90 per cent. from strong wheat that statement might have been justified, but certainly where it is a matter of 40 per cent. you could hardly use that expression. Then they speak of the difficulty of getting strong wheat grown in this country.  I think they admit that a certain amount of weak wheat can be grown, but not strong wheat.  We will assume for the moment that that is true.  Of all the wheat imported into this country we find that two-thirds used for domestic purposes is weak wheat or flour, as the case may be, and of the other third, 40 per cent. is weak wheat or weak flour.  So that, as a matter of fact, 80 per cent. of the flour used in this country comes from weak wheat and only 20 per cent. from strong wheat.  Therefore, it would be years and years before we would be up against the question of producing strong wheat of our own.  But supposing that we were asked to produce strong wheat, what do we find? In the Journal of the Department of Agriculture, which is doing a little work for wheat, in spite of the Minister's prejudice, it is stated about Red Stettin:&mdash;&ldquo;A large propagation plot of Red Stettin wheat, <Col N="305" /> comprising about three Irish acres, was grown on the farm of Mr. P. O'Connor, Knocklofty, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary.  From this area 46 barrels, 4 stones, 115 cwts. and 4 stones of dressed grain were obtained.  The grain was of exceptionally fine quality, equivalent, in the opinion of several millers, to Manitoba Wheat No. 2.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was not too bad.  The question has been raised by some speakers, including Deputy Gorey, as to some of the disadvantages of growing wheat, and these are tabulated, to a certain extent, on page 11 of the Majority Report &mdash; considerations which would naturally influence farmers in growing wheat; one is, &ldquo;the extent to which wheat growing finds a place in the economy of the system under which his farm is worked.  Wheat is regarded as a more exhausting crop on the soil than other cereals.&rdquo;  We had experts before us at the Economic Committee, and that was not proved, at any rate to my recollection.  It may have been stated by some of them, and others may have stated the opposite; but it certainly was not proved that it was a more exhausting crop on the soil than other cereals.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Wheat occupies the land for a longer period than other cereals, and, consequently, the land under wheat is likely to become more foul with weeds and to require more cleaning than after either oats or barley.&rdquo;  As Deputy de Valera stated, that depends on the crop.  If you have a poor crop of oats or barley you will have weeds, and if you have a good crop of either of them you will not have weeds.  The same applies with regard to wheat.  &ldquo;The suitability of the cultivated portion of his land for the production of wheat, having regard to the fact that wheat will yield a full crop only on the heavier and more fertile soils&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that wheat will be produced only on land that is suitable for wheat, just the same as oats will only grow on land that is suitable for oats, and that bullocks will fatten on lands that are suitable for bullocks, and that is all about it. &ldquo;If corn is grown as a cash crop, the return likely to be derived from a wheat crop as compared with a crop of oats or barley.&rdquo;  From the figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture, the following were the results over four years with regard to oats, barley, and wheat per acre: Oats, £7 10s. 7d.; barley, £9 6s. 11d.; and wheat, £12 4s. 2d.; so that wheat is well away on its own. &ldquo;There is greater difficulty in obtaining a good &lsquo;strike&rsquo; of grass seeds and clover where these seeds are sown down as a &lsquo;nurse&rsquo; crop than when sown with either oats or barley.&rdquo;  As I stated here before, the only witness who came before us who claimed to have grown wheat, and who grew wheat on a very big scale&mdash;the Director of the Agricultural College, Athenry&mdash;when questioned by me on this matter, said that he certainly could never see any difference whatsoever between meadows that came after oats, barley <Col N="307" /> or wheat; that they were the same as far as he could see; and it was not spring wheat that was grown in Athenry.  Of course that can be verified by any Deputy.  Deputy Brennan claimed to have grown wheat.  I do not know whether he gave any evidence on this question of grass seed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture did have wheat grown on his farm, but I do not know that he claims to have personal experience of it.  I do not remember if he gave any opinion of his experience in regard to grass seed.  The next point is&mdash;&ldquo;Wheaten straw is less valuable as fodder than oaten straw or even barley straw.&rdquo;  There is no farmer here and no farmer in any other country who lives under conditions similar to those here who does not require a certain amount of straw for bedding his cattle, so that the farmer who has a certain amount of wheaten straw can use it for bedding, and if he grows oats he will use oaten straw for bedding, so that I do not see any loss from that point of view.  &ldquo;There is, as yet, no really prolific variety of spring wheat suitable for cultivation in this country.&rdquo; It would be a great advantage to the country if a prolific variety of spring wheat could be got, and that is one of the matters to which the Department ought to direct its attention.  Then there is the question of adverse weather conditions, but they can be used as an argument against any crop.  The Minority Report mentions that if that argument were followed to its logical conclusion we should advise the farmers to get out of tillage altogether, because there are years when farmers have the same difficulty in sowing their oats, and the same difficulty in harvesting their oats, and there are years when the farmers have to sow their turnips twice, so that the only logical conclusion, if you lay too much stress on the weather, is that the farmer should get out of tillage altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a greater risk of a total or partial failure of a crop under wheat than in the case of other tillage crops.&rdquo;  There appears to be the impression that that is true, but I do not know that it really is.  With regard to the turnip crop, it more frequently happens, I think, that there is a total or partial failure of it than of wheat.  Partial failure may not happen so often in the case of oats and barley.  There is no doubt whatever but that there is often a partial failure in the case of oats and barley.  That happens very often, perhaps as often as in the case of a wheat crop.  These are the disadvantages given in the Majority Report against the sowing of wheat.  I will go on now to the end of paragraph 18:</P>
      <P>It may, therefore, be taken as granted that the area of wheat sown each season must depend to to a considerable degree on the weather conditions in late autumn and early winter.</P>
      <P>Pay attention to that for a moment.  The contention of the Minister for Agriculture, when speaking this evening, was that the area under wheat had remained unchanged for the last four or five years in spite of high prices and everything else, so that according to the Minister's argument weather conditions must have had no influence on the area of land that was under wheat.  In each of these years there were 32,000 acres of land under wheat in spite of weather conditions and everything else.  The farmers who engaged in the sowing of wheat, must, therefore, have believed that they would have been able to cultivate wheat, no matter what the weather conditions were.  If, as the Minister has suggested, weather conditions had anything to do with the matter, these farmers would have ceased growing wheat.  Although they continued to sow it, we are still told that they are very much opposed to the idea of wheat growing.</P>
      <P>We come on now to paragraph 19:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growing of wheat on lea <Col N="309" /> land which it is possible to prepare for sowing a corn crop at a time when the state of the soil would not permit of working potato or root land is not attended with success, save in the case of land which has been under grass for one year only.</P>
    <P>I would like to know where that information came from.  That is a matter that was never mentioned before the Economic Committee and, as far as I know, it was never mentioned in any agricultural paper or anywhere else.  It may, of course, be the idea of someone in the Department of Agriculture.  I would like to know if there is any Deputy in the Dáil, or anywhere else, who ever heard that proposition put forward before: that you cannot grow wheat on lea land except in the case of land which has been under grass for one year only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further down in that paragraph it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the area of land capable of producing wheat satisfactorily as a second corn crop is limited, and, except under abnormal conditions, farmers do not and would not grow wheat immediately after another corn crop.</P>
      <P>In regard to that, I might say that one of the agricultural instructors who came before us said it was quite a common practice in his part of the country to grow wheat on stubble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say it was quite a common practice.</P>

    <Col N="310" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He used that argument. At least that was my impression. Now we come on to an interesting point in paragraph 20. where they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The liability of newly-sown wheat and wheat brairds to depredations by birds is a further discouraging factor.  Sown at a season when bird food is scarce and no other cereals are in the ground, serious damage to winter wheat crops is caused by the ravages of birds.</P>
      <P>That is quite true, that serious damage is caused by the ravages of birds, but it is not any more true than it would be if applied to other crops such as oats and barley in the spring time.  If anyone cares to come down to the district in which I live, they will see there two fields, one under a crop of wheat and the other under a crop of oats. They can see for themselves that the wheat crop is a splendid crop, while the oat crop is practically all gone as a result of damage by birds. Therefore, I submit that putting in a paragraph of that kind in the report, where it applies not to wheat only, but to every crop, is no argument whatever against wheat-growing, unless, of course, that you want to do away altogether with tillage. Lower down in the same paragraph they state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Precautionary measures are not always effective in preventing such injury.</P>
      <P>I think that any farmer who has been in the habit of growing wheat would be able to give those who wrote that paragraph a recipe for the cure of that.  I think that if they were to use a pint of tar and a pint of paraffin as a mixture to prevent the damage referred to, it would be successful.  In paragraph 24 they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The extent to which a guaranteed price would bring about an increase in the area of wheat is subject to definite limiting factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> Of course it is.  The report then goes on to talk about the limiting factors, and continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The current market price of oats and barley in relation to the fixed price of wheat,</P>
    <P>the price of cattle and other live stock products, and so on, and concludes in this fashion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Unless the price of live stock and of live stock commodities, to the production of which the country is beyond question admirably adapted, should fall considerably in relation to that of wheat, the provision of subsidy for wheat, save at a prohibitive cost, would be ineffective in securing any considerable extension of the area devoted to wheat cultivation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the words &ldquo;to the production of which the country is beyond question admirably adapted.&rdquo;  There is no doubt, but that this country is admirably adapted to the production of live stock commodities, and if it is a good policy for the country, as no doubt it is a good policy as far as it goes, to get all we possibly can for our export live stock, why then do we argue against tillage?  If we look at page 13 of the trade statistics you will find there that Denmark is tilling 61.2 per cent. of the total arable land of the country, while the figure for the Free State is 12.4.  Denmark's net exports over imports in the matter of agricultural products represent £42,000,000 as against our £17,000,000.  It would be argued, perhaps, by the Minister for Agriculture, if one were not familiar with these figures, that if this country were to till 62 per cent. of its arable land the farmer would necessarily have to go into the meadows and sell his live stock, as he would have no way of keeping them, and that the result would be that the number of live stock in the country would go down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  What you would have to do is to do what the <Col N="312" /> Danes do, turn from summer to winter farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph 25 the argument is used that if you till a few acres of wheat you must make up for that by putting a few acres of land under roots, and that, therefore, to make up for the loss of land that is brought under the plough you must put a few additional acres of land under grain for the amount of food that has been lost, and that all that would mean upsetting the farmers' existing economy.  At all events, if it does that it is going to increase the acreage of land under tillage.  It is going to have the effect of increasing tillage in the country. That is what we are told in that paragraph.</P>
      <P>In another paragraph we hear about substitution, that you will not have an additional acre tilled in the country under this scheme.  Well, one or the other must be wrong.  We are told in this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the ordinary mixed tillage farms in the Saorstát of the class on which additional wheat would be grown, the area under grain to that under roots would, under a system of good husbandry, be in the ratio of 2&mdash;1 respectively.</P>
      <P>In 1928 the number of acres under grain in this country was 814,000, and the number of acres under roots was 700,000, so that, according to good husbandry, we have 586,000 to be brought under grain, and therefore there would be no upsetting whatever of a farmer's existing economy. In fact, you would not only be not upsetting his existing economy, but you would be getting better husbandry than you have at present by putting an additional 586,000 acres under wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 26 they go on to say: &ldquo;Some districts are better <Col N="313" /> suited to this crop than are others,&rdquo; which is hardly deserving of mention. Then it is stated: &ldquo;That wheat production, as a cash crop, is and will continue to be localised is a matter of grave importance.&rdquo;  In one paragraph they make an assertion without any proof that wheat will be grown more in some areas than in others, and having proved that by stating it, they go on to say &ldquo;that wheat production, as a cash crop, is and will continue to be localised, is a matter of grave importance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes.  &ldquo;If the price of wheat be guaranteed and no measures be taken to subsidise the production of other crops which can be grown on land unsuited to wheat, the fact that wheat production, as a cash crop, is and will continue to be localised, is a matter of grave importance.&rdquo; In paragraph 29 they say: &ldquo;Immediately upon the cessation of these measures, the area declined; and although the average price of wheat in the three years 1924, 1925, and 1926 exceeded 30/- per barrel, the average annual area of wheat grown in these years did not exceed 30,000 acres.&rdquo;  That is the argument the Minister has used, that the area remained the same even though the price was higher.  As I said before, if you use that argument in that connection we can at least use it also, and say that adverse <Col N="314" /> weather conditions have no effect whatever on the growing of wheat.  I might have added also that in the end of 1928 the price was under 30/- per barrel, and that at the end of 1927 it was over 30/- per barrel.  The farmer has to sow his wheat every year before he knows what he will get for the crop.  He has to make up his mind and have the ground ready for the 1928 crop, before he knows what he will get for the 1927 crop.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 30 they state: &ldquo;Moreover, we are satisfied that the additional wheat would be grown almost entirely in substitution for oats and barley on land suitable for producing wheat and that no considerable increase in the total area under tillage would result.&rdquo;  We have been told already that additional barley and oats will be necessary, and that not only will it not be a substitute, but that really the whole difficulty with the farmer is this, that he not only will have to grow wheat, but more roots and grain to make up for the upset in his existing economy.  In spite of that assertion we are told that it will be a substitute.  In paragraph 33 there is reference to &ldquo;a limited number of farmers who have land in temporary pasture of indifferent quality and who are not financially in a position to stock the land fully.&rdquo;  I think, from our experience of the number of farmers in that category in the country, you would have no difficulty in getting your million acres.  A big proportion of farmers in every county and district have land temporarily under pasture, and of indifferent quality, and they are not in a financial position to stock their land.  If they are able to take advantage of a wheat subsidy we would have done a service to a very big part of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 33 it is stated: &ldquo;In certain of the best dairying districts where a relatively small proportion of land is tilled, it is most desirable that an increased area and variety of crops should be grown for feeding on the farm, but the production of wheat as a cash crop would not, we think, tend <Col N="315" /> towards a better economy on such farms.&rdquo;  According to figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture the profit on an acre of grass for milk was £3 8s. 9d.; for beef, £3 9s. 3d., and for wheat, £2 18s. 7d.  The interesting point about these figures was the data on which they were based.  For instance, we were told by the Department of Agriculture that a bullock would increase by 3 cwt. on an acre of grass in one year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We inquired but we could not find out.  The figures given for wheat were 18 cwts. per acre.  What I said at the time was that if they would give us that acre of grass that was producing 3 cwt. of beef we would certainly produce 35 cwt. of wheat on it, which would change the figure from £2 18s. 7d. to £6 10s. 0d. profit on wheat. Paragraph 34 says: &ldquo;A very large number of farmers produce grain (oats and barley) for the purpose of feeding live stock on their own farms.&rdquo;  Why are they doing it? Because it pays them, and if it pays them to do it&mdash;surely they will continue to do it unless the wheat is going to be made such an attractive matter to them that they will give it up, and, from what we hear from Deputy Gorey and the Minister for Agriculture, the wheat proposition will not be so attractive as that. Again, we have sympathy for the man growing wheat at present for his own use and who will not get the subsidy.  The man who is growing an acre of wheat, and that is not much, would have to have a big family to eat the food that would be produced by it.  It would take a good many people to use the whole of the product of that acre in a year.  That type of man who grows an acre of wheat would probably grow three or four acres if there is a subsidy, and so he will benefit more by the subsidy.  I think we need not have any great sympathy with him.  If he thinks he is badly treated he can sell the whole lot to <Col N="316" /> the miller and buy flour for himself and his family.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 38 says: &ldquo;The scheme would be of direct benefit only to those farmers who are in a position to grow wheat for sale and not to the agricultural community as a whole.&rdquo;  Is not that a truism?  You would not think it necessary to say that it is so obviously true, but when we come to analyse it, it is not true at all. Surely the benefits, as Deputy Derrig says, would flow on to the rest of the population?  It is said that if we give a subsidy on wheat that nobody will get any benefit only the farmers who produce the wheat.  Does not the same apply to beet and other things?  Then at the end of paragraph 39 it says: &ldquo;The fact that the average farmer does make a greater profit from oats than from wheat (whether the profits be direct or indirect) is demonstrated beyond all question by the general practice of farmers themselves, by the fact that the wheat area has shrunk to 31,350 acres, while there are 648,615 acres of oats in cultivation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, the same old argument, that the farmer knows what is best for himself.  If the farmer is not growing wheat, it is because it is not good for the farmer to grow wheat. The peculiar thing is that when we come to the conclusion the farmers do get a little bit of a lecture about not doing the right thing.  Evidently they do not know as much about what is good for them as those who signed the Majority Report, who state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are many farmers who, because of exceptional conditions, are making more money out of grass farming than they could make out of mixed farming, nevertheless, it is demonstrable that the farmers who are making most money for themselves, and creating most wealth for the country as <Col N="317" /> a whole are those who do mixed farming and who are tilling a much higher percentage of their land than the average.  These farmers are the minority, but they work under conditions which are common to seventy-five per cent. of the farmers of the country, inasmuch as their holdings are small and they have considerable family labour.</P>
    <P>So that the minority of the farmers, we are told by those who signed the Majority Report, are doing the right thing for themselves and for the country, but the big majority are not doing the right thing; there are cases where the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Finance are able to tell the farmers that they are doing the wrong thing.  Of course, in other cases, if we suggest a thing should be done we are told that the farmer knows his own business best.  The farmer knows his own business best except in a few exceptional cases where Ministers are able to tell him that he does not know his own business best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim just a few minutes as a farmer who does grow wheat.  There has been so much soft talk and sob stuff spoken by Deputies in favour of this motion and amendment that I really think it would be too bad if a farmer who grows wheat every year was not allowed to say a word.  There are many things I want to say, but which I have not time to deal with.  I should however, like to take up Deputy Ryan upon page 11 of the Majority Report.  This matter has been mentioned by at least three or four speakers.  On page 11, No. (2) states: &ldquo;Wheat is regarded as a more exhausting crop on the soil than other cereals.&rdquo;  Then No. (3) states: &ldquo;Wheat occupies the land for a longer period than other cereals and, consequently, land under wheat is liable to become more foul with weeds and to require more cleaning than after either oats or barley.&rdquo; Then No. (6) states: &ldquo;There is greater difficulty in obtaining a good <Col N="318" />&lsquo;strike&rsquo; of grass seeds and clover where these seeds are sown down with wheat as a &lsquo;nurse&rsquo; crop than when sown with either oats or barley.&rdquo;  I have considerable experience of growing wheat&mdash;in fact, I have been growing it all my life.  I take these three paragraphs together and they are true for the same reason.  As to No. (2), wheat is naturally a most exhausting crop.  It is in the ground for ten months of the year, as it is sown in October, and it is there until the following August or September.</P>

      <P>What about spring wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Spring wheat is considered of no use.  I think the general impression is that only winter wheat is of any use for flour.  If you sow any crop in October and the land is undisturbed all through the following winter, spring and summer, the land must naturally be more dirty and weedy than land that has been tilled in the spring.  That goes without saying.  If you have land undisturbed for ten months, it must naturally be weedy and in a worse condition than other land.  If a crop is drawing out of the soil for ten months and is accompanied by a large amount of weeds as well as itself, it must naturally take more out of the soil in ten months than a crop which is only in the land for four months.  Then as to No. (6), any farmer who knows what it is to till land can imagine the difference in putting in grass seed in the month of April with oats or putting it in at that time of the year upon ground that has already been covered with weeds and that has been lying there for five or six months during the winter.  If any Deputy cares to see the difference between sowing grass seeds with oats and with wheat, I can show them a perfect illustration of it if they come down to Roscommon. I have a field there at present that I laid down last year with grass seeds in turnip soil, potato soil and mangold soil.  One piece was sown in with wheat, and it got grass seed the same as the rest.  The <Col N="319" /> grass seed struck, but, owing to the amount of weeds and the exhausted condition in which the soil was after taking the wheat out, anybody who goes there and sees that will ask what happened that patch.  That has been my experience all through, and I think it is only fair that that should be known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, but I would consider myself a fool if I grew wheat for other people besides myself.  It is good policy for a farmer to grow some wheat for his own use, but I certainly would not grow wheat for sale for anyone.  If I grew any more wheat than I do I would be interfering too much with my rotation crops and the economy of the farm.  What is more, that wheat land, as happened this year, would occasionally have to be laid down in grass, and it would certainly have a very bad effect on the grass.  I was certainly not struck by Deputy Ryan's analysis of the report&mdash;I think it was very weak.  Some Deputy, I think it was Deputy Lemass, mentioned emigration. Does Deputy Lemass seriously believe that the growing of wheat, or rather, what is asked for in the motion here, a tariff on flour, would relieve, to any extent, the emigration problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right; but we are discussing proposals for a tariff on flour.  Deputy Lemass said something to the effect that the present policy with regard to flour was responsible for emigration.  The people who asked for a tariff on flour said that they had 1,700 people employed in the industry, and if they got a tariff they would be able to employ 153 people more.  These are the figures given to the Economic <Col N="320" /> Committee. and they speak for themselves.  I can assure Deputy Lemass that he has made a mistake in assuming that I said at the Economic Committee that I was against tariffs on principle.  I certainly am not, and never was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said he hoped that we had not heard the last of the protection of the milling industry or wheat question with this debate.  I am quite certain we have not heard the last of it.  It is rather fortunate that the House will have an opportunity of going more fully into the whole question of wheat on Deputy Ryan's motion, no matter what happens here, than it has been able to do to-day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested that we should accept Deputy O'Connell's amendment, and that it was as a matter of jealousy, or something of that kind, that we were asking him not to press his amendment at present, and to let the question of a tariff be put as a simple question to the House.  Of course, this suggestion of jealousy is nonsense, because long ago, immediately after the tariff debate, we put down this motion, as we were anxious that the House should take a decision upon the matter.  As regards the Labour Party, we know that some of the principles contained in Deputy O'Connell's motion are of long standing.  We have seen, from previous reports, the Labour Party point of view.  At the same time we know our point of view, and it has been stated; there is no question whatever of jealousy.  The unfortunate part is that there is urgency about this question of a flour tariff.  If the inland mills and others go out of existence, it would be doubly difficult for any object, which has wheat promotion as its policy, to be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For one, I agree, very largely, with Deputy Anthony's view and the view also expressed by Deputy Derrig, that there is something wider in this whole question than the narrow economic view.  But we hold that even from the narrow economic <Col N="321" /> view, our view is right.  I do not know whether any of the speakers have given all the figures that we had at the Economic Committee on the relative values of land &mdash;land under grass and land under different crops.  If Deputies look at these figures, they will see that an acre of land under wheat is worth to the community something like £1 7s. per acre over and above what the same land would be worth to the community if it was used as pasture, either for producing milk or for producing beef.  Therefore we say there is that amount of extra wealth available for the community, if some of the land at present being used for the production of beef and milk were used for the production of wheat.  We say that even if, with the individual farmer, in order to bring up his profits to the point in which he would prefer using his land for the growing of wheat than for the production of beef or milk, it were necessary to divide a portion of that £1 7s., we believe portion of it could very well go to the individual farmer, and it would be good national economy that it should.</P>
    <P>The relative values of land under various crops have been stated, I think, in our Minority Report. These figures have been taken from experts, who considered the question and went into it in detail, and these figures are their expert opinion.  One hundred acres of land under potatoes would support 418 persons for a year; under wheat 208 persons; under oats 172 persons; under mangolds used for feeding cows for milk, 117 persons; and so on down the list, until you come to the average for pasture for beef and mutton, where 100 acres would only maintain nine persons.  It is obvious, when you look at these figures, that, next to potatoes, the most valuable crop from the point of view of human food that can be put upon the land is wheat.  This is borne out by the figures showing the food values of the crops also; they run parallel and they are partially based upon them.  But the fact that you can show, at <Col N="322" /> present prices, an acre of land produces £1 7s. more than the average acre of the same land under pasture producing milk or beef, shows that you have an opportunity of creating £1 7s. extra per acre for the community.  If a subsidy is to be given to the individual farmer in order to induce him to produce that extra wealth for the community, I say it is only fair to give, and the community could afford to give, portion of that £1 7s. to that individual farmer and still benefit.</P>
    <P>That is an argument on the narrow, economic side; but, as I indicated at the start, it has a very much wider consideration than that. The question for us is: are we going to continue the economy that exists? The individual farmer has to adapt himself to the present conditions. We are anxious, and our policy is, that the State should do whatever lies in its power in the interest of the community as a whole to change these conditions to such an extent that it will be in the best interests of the individual, as well as the community, that the crops that are of the most value to the community as a whole should be grown.  There is no use arguing that in the conditions as they exist such and such is the case.  What you must examine is what will be the conditions when the changes proposed take place.  We hold, if you take that view, there is not the slightest doubt that the figures are convincing, and they are there.  When I say there is not the slightest doubt I know that doctors differ, and that different people take different views.  Are we satisfied to be exporting our people, as we are exporting them?  Is the present system so good that we should always attend to the argument for maintaining it as it is and never pay any attention to the argument for changing it?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has been called the &ldquo;devil's advocate&rdquo; in this matter.  He suggested that he has been trying to teach us in the Economic Committee something about agriculture and that we are too dense to understand.  What is <Col N="323" /> wrong is that we are not going to be bluffed by the Minister for Agriculture. We know him too well to be bluffed now, and we know perfectly well that he has sufficient audacity to make any statements, no matter how contradictory they may be to other statements that he previously made; he will still make them without qualification when necessary to assist his case.  We are not people who have been reared in bandboxes in cities.  Most Deputies in this House have a fair general knowledge of the agricultural conditions of the country&mdash;those brought up in the country have, anyhow. There are very few of us who, after sixteen years of age, spent most of our time in cities who did not spend the first part of our lives in touch with agricultural occupations in the country.  I remember that in the national schools when we were taught agriculture in those days there was a book which Deputy Gorey may remember or not, got out by a man named Baldwin and a very good little book it was.  I remember my disappointment with the first part of it, which dealt too much with the Norfolk five-acre rotation and things of that kind.  It was only when we came to Part V that we got things that really mattered for Irish conditions.  I remember well it was stated that there were four million acres under poor pasture in Ireland, which if put under tillage would be much more profitable.  I remember, too, it was stated that under the poor pasture this land was able to produce something like twice the fair rent, whereas under grain crop and tillage it would produce two and a half times that.  He estimated, if I remember rightly, what was the national loss through the fact that this land was kept under pasture instead of being put under grain. We all know that.  As I say, even those of us not connected with agriculture have sufficient knowledge of the general conditions of things to know when the Minister for Agriculture is bluffing and when he is not, and to be able to sift the evidence given by experts <Col N="324" /> and to know whether it is a question, as it is very often, of pure individual judgment or whether there are some facts behind it.</P>
    <P>When we have something in the form of catch-cries repeated again and again, and when we recognise that in these catch-cries there is a good deal of the element of prejudice we naturally discount them.  Instead of being convinced, in any way, by any of the arguments of the Minister for Agriculture, any members of our Party that I have been speaking to were convinced that there was no hope for the country as long as there is a Government in power whose attitude towards national affairs is the attitude that has been indicated by the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  That is our position.  We believe that they are simply going to continue the old policy by which this country will be simply a farmyard for feeding English operatives cheaply, and a dumping ground for English manufactures. That is what we want to change.  We are prepared, anyhow, to take whatever risks there are in furthering this policy, in trying to secure here in this country as much agricultural produce as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, questioned some of our figures.  He talked about cotton cake.  Cotton cake is a very small fraction of the total, but it is a considerable item, and the country would be served if some of the experts were able to suggest substitutes for it.  It would be good policy to have our experts looking out for substitutes for all these imported articles.  Even though it is only half a million in something like twenty-six millions, it is a substantial item, I will admit.  We have done our best to sift the expert evidence that has been put before us, and to read carefully the reports and lectures that have been given by responsible people, such as those who are in charge of the Agricultural College at Glasnevin, and elsewhere.  We are convinced that at the back of this antagonism to the growing of wheat, apart from the conditions which have been imposed, and which will have to be changed, there is a <Col N="325" /> good deal of prejudice.  The Minister for Agriculture was much nearer to the truth when it served his purpose to make a case four or five years ago than he was to-day, when it served his purpose to make a case in the opposite direction.  We know that it is the business of lawyers to make a case on whichever side they are briefed.</P>

The question involved in his amendment is a very much bigger one than the one involved in our motion.  There will be need to be a much closer and more detailed examination of it than there is in the question of the imported flour.  There will be greater need for going into detail to convince individual members of this House.  What is he going to do by putting this amendment forward and pressing it at this stage?  He is going to prevent a thing that is urgent and necessary for his particular proposals as well as ours.  Of course, his is wider, but by the time the Executive Council will have taken the opinion of the Dáil and by the time you get anything out of the mentality that is evidenced here with respect to the wheat proposals there will be several more of your mills closed down.</P>

It is a simple problem.  There is no other way for us to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the arguments in favour of it are concerned, I will mention them in general terms.  I will just summarise the main arguments for the tariff on flour.  I forgot to mention to-day another factor in favour of the British mills, and that is derating. They are going to have a further advantage over the mills here inasmuch as they are going to be de-rated to the extent of 75 per cent.  The effects of protection <Col N="328" /> would be these:&mdash;It would enable the existing mills to work to their full capacity.  It would spread the overhead charges over nearly twice the present output.  It has been estimated by one of the experts who came before the Committee that that would result in an economy of about 1/2 per sack.  It would encourage the erection of new mills and the improvement of existing ones as well as the re-opening of those that have closed down in recent years. We have got from the Minister a picture of what would happen if protection was there and if we had a monopoly or a combine here.  But he has taken very good care not to give you a picture of what will happen if you are wiped out here by a cross-Channel monopoly.</P>
