      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether Messrs. Moore and Co., Shirt and Collar Manufacturers, to whom it was proposed, under the State Lands Act, 1924, to lease portion of the Buncrana Naval Barracks, and who went into possession of the premises on 1st January last, have now been ordered to vacate the premises; whether any payment of rent in advance was paid by Messrs. Moore and Co., and, if so, what amount; further, whether it is proposed to proceed with the proposed letting; and, if not, if he will state the reason.</P>

      <P>Messrs. Moore and Co. proposed to <Col N="764" /> take a five years' lease of a portion of the Buncrana Naval Barracks, subject to Government requirements. Such lettings are subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and the Oireachtas, as required by the State Lands Act, 1924, and pending submission of the proposal to the Minister for Finance and the Oireachtas for such sanctions Messrs.  Moore were anxious to go into occupation.  They were warned that they could do this only at their own risk of being called upon to vacate should the statutory sanctions for any reason not be forthcoming.  As they were prepared to take this risk, and to pay £22 10s. 0d. for use and occupation, they were allowed in on the 2nd January, 1929.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not satisfied that it would be in the public interest to make such letting without inviting competitive tenders to take the premises in question on lease for a term of years.  Competitive offers will shortly be invited by public advertisement, and meanwhile Messrs. Moore are being informed that the letting to them cannot be proceeded with and they have been called upon to vacate the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this matter of the letting to Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. has been proceeding since October, 1927?  Further, is he aware of the fact that the Board of Works informed Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. that they had applied for the statutory sanction?  Is the Minister also aware of the fact that not until Wednesday last did Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. receive any notification from the Ministry to the effect that the letting would not be proceeded with, when it was almost impossible for Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. to take any steps to have themselves safeguarded? Is he aware that Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. went to very great expense to have the premises put in proper repair and to have machines installed in order to employ in or about thirty girls, not alone in the manufacture of shirts and collars, but in the manufacture of pyjamas, boiler suits and dungarees, thus establishing practically the only industry <Col N="765" /> of the kind in the Free State? Messrs. Moore &amp; Co. went to the expense of having all that done, and now at, I will not call it the eleventh hour, but the thirteenth hour, practically speaking, the Minister suddenly discovers that he should have done certain things that he did not do in regard to the letting of this place.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether he discovered on his own initiative that he should have advertised the place for letting, or whether somebody else suggested it to him.</P>

      <P>It is quite usual where a place has been vacant for a considerable period to let it without inviting competitive tenders.  The view taken in such cases is that anybody who might have cared to make an offer for it could have known there was a possibility of it being let.  These premises were not in that situation.  Nobody could have been expected to know that they were available for letting.  It was brought to my notice that certain other people alleged that they desired the premises, had been waiting until they were vacated to make an offer, and would have made a higher offer than Messrs. Moore &amp; Co.  In these circumstances I felt it would not be correct to proceed with the letting without advertising for competitive tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The purpose of the Bill is to increase from three to seven days the period within which an appeal may be lodged against a decision of the Chairman of Dáil Eireann as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill, and to extend the right of appeal so as to permit such an appeal to be made on a resolution <Col N="766" /> of a majority of the Seanad present and voting at the sitting at which not less than 30 members are present.  It is a very small alteration of the existing Article of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the President did not see his way to give a more elaborate explanation of the purpose of this Bill, if for no other reason than to instruct the Deputies of his own Party concerning it.  As I had occasion to point out yesterday, we found whenever any of these Constitution (Amendment) Bills were under discussion members of Cumann na nGaedheal were completely ignorant as to what they were doing, although they went obediently into the Division Lobbies and cast their votes in the way they were instructed.  As the President did not consider it advisable to inform the members of his Party as to what he is going to ask them to do, I think it is incumbent on me so to inform them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to increase the power of the Seanad in respect to questioning the decision of the Chairman of the Dáil as to whether a particular Bill is or is not a Money Bill.  According to Article 35 of the Constitution, two-fifths of the members of the Seanad within three days after a Bill has been passed by Dáil Eireann can, by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House, require that the question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill be referred to a Special Committee of Privileges over which a Judge of the Supreme Court presides.  The Bill which is now before us is designed to increase the period during which two-fifths of the members of the Seanad may give that notice from three to seven days and, in addition, to give them new power which it is not proposed to give to members of the Dáil.  The power proposed to be given is that by a majority of the members of the Seanad present and voting at a sitting of the Seanad at which not less than 30 members are present, this question relating to a Money Bill may be referred to a <Col N="767" /> Special Committee, and the seven days' period is made to operate from the day on which the Bill is certified by the Chairman of the Dáil to be a Money Bill, or the return of such Bill by the Seanad to the Dáil under Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the stage in the explanation at which it may be difficult to make the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal understand exactly what they are about to do, because, unfortunately, Article 38 of the Constitution is now in such a condition that it is very difficult to find out exactly what it does, what it implies or what it does not imply. We have deleted already two very considerable sections from it, and as the remaining portion is, consequently, to be read with these sections deleted, it is not easy to explain what the Article of the Constitution provides.  In any case, briefly, the Article provides that a Bill which is initiated and passed by the Dáil shall be sent to the Seanad, and, unless it is a Money Bill, can be amended by the Seanad, and the Dáil shall consider such amendments.  A Money Bill is sent to the Seanad for its recommendations, not for its amendments.  Within a period of not longer than 21 days after it has been sent to the Seanad, it shall be returned to the Dáil, which may accept or reject any or all of these recommendations of Seanad Eireann, and if so passed, or if not returned within a period of twenty-one days, it shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  This Article, therefore, intends to alter the power of the Seanad with respect to Money Bills by providing that a majority of the members of the Seanad at an ordinary meeting can question whether such a Bill is or is not a Money Bill, and the Bill shall be referred to the Committee of Privileges. It alters it also as to the time in which this is to be done.  Originally that had to be done within three days after the Bill had passed the Dáil.  Now they can do it within seven days, seven days after the Seanad has returned such a Bill to <Col N="768" /> the Dáil under Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Members of Cumann na nGaedheal will perhaps appreciate that the main design behind this Bill is to strengthen the power of the Seanad in one direction, and in one direction only.  That is in the direction of obstructing the functions of the Dáil. This Bill is an obstructionist Bill.  It is intended to provide against the day when the Seanad will be called upon to exercise completely its main function of stopping Dáil legislation in any manner which might be considered to be at variance with the wishes of the other signatories of the Treaty of 1921.  It is conceivable, in fact, I think with the present majority in the Seanad, it is almost inevitable that after the next general election the Seanad will embark upon obstructionist tactics.  I say that the Seanad will embark upon obstructionist tactics although, as I pointed out to the President yesterday, I am not a prophet, but I have enough common sense to realise that after the next general election there is certain to be a change of Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The by-election may help us in that direction.  If the Deputy has any doubt as to the result of a by-election in his constituency, I invite him to resign and to have the matter out with us down there. The fact remains, however, that we can reckon upon a change of policy, upon the fact of a change of Government in this House after the next election.  That change of Government will take place, as I have already pointed out, without any similar change in the Seanad.  The majority of the Seanad will remain the same.  I indicated yesterday that that situation might easily give rise to what has been called a Constitutional crisis.  Certainly, if the Seanad attempted to exercise the power which this Bill now proposes to give them, such Constitutional crisis would inevitably arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are Deputies in <Col N="769" /> this House who do not like the prospect of a Constitutional crisis on any issue.  I am sure that the upholders of law and order who sit on the Independent Benches will be prepared to take the opportunity which they now have of lessening the danger of such a crisis by the rejection of this Bill before it goes any farther.  It is only in its Second Stage now.  If the members of the Dáil accept it in principle, then they are accepting, in principle, something which may operate in the very near future in a manner detrimental to peace, order, law, stability and public morality, and all those other things which the President talks about at election times.</P>
    <P>In the discussion upon Deputy Thrift's Bill here the other day, there came, as an incidental point, the matter of the power of the Dáil over the public purse.  This is a Bill which affects very seriously the power of the Dáil over the public purse.  It deals, specifically and definitely, with Money Bills.  No other type of Bill is concerned in this proposal except Money Bills, or Bills in respect of which there is reasonable doubt as to whether they are Money Bills or not.  If a Bill is a Money Bill, and the Chairman of the Dáil declares it to be such, the Seanad has no power to amend it.</P>
    <P>It goes to the Seanad undoubtedly, but the Seanad only makes recommendations which the Dáil can accept or reject as it likes, and the Bill becomes law irrespective of whether these recommendations are accepted or rejected by the Dáil.  If the power is given, as undoubtedly we think the power should be given, to a minority of the Dáil to question the Chairman's ruling in that respect, we think that any danger of unconstitutional action being taken is obviated.</P>
    <P>In the original Constitution two-fifths of the members of the Dáil had power to question the Chairman's ruling as to whether a Bill was or was not a Money Bill, and to have an order made that such a Bill would be referred to a committee of privileges, consisting of three members <Col N="770" /> of each House and a Judge of the Supreme Court as chairman, and the decision of that committee would be final and conclusive.  That power is still retained by members of the Dáil under this Amending Bill, and the extension of time also operates to the benefit of the Dáil.  We think that that is sufficient, and that it is not necessary to give a similar power to the Seanad; that if two-fifths of the members of the Dáil can question the legality of the Chairman's ruling upon any Bill, that should be sufficient to safeguard the position of the taxpayer, who is, of course, primarily concerned when a Money Bill is under discussion.  This Bill, however, actually proposes to give to members of the Seanad powers which the members of the Dáil do not possess with respect to Money Bills, because not merely can two-fifths of the members of the Seanad exercise all the powers which two-fifths of the Dáil can exercise, but, in addition, a majority of the members present and voting at a sitting of the Seanad can also exercise the same power, provided there are thirty members present at the meeting. Consequently, although two-fifths of the members of the Dáil are required to question the Chairman's ruling in respect to Money Bills, sixteen members of the Seanad can do the same thing&mdash;that is a majority present at a sitting at which no less than thirty members are in attendance.</P>
    <P>We think that it is decidedly objectionable that we should give to sixteen members of the Seanad power to hold up indefinitely vital Bills affecting the lives of the people, because we can take it that any Bill which, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Dáil, is a Money Bill, is one which does vitallv affect the lives of the people.  It certainly affects the interests of the taxpayer, whether it is a Bill to increase expenditure on Government services or impose a burden of any other kind.</P>
    <P>According to the Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A Money Bill means a Bill which contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the <Col N="771" /> following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on public moneys or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them.  In this definition the expressions &ldquo;taxation,&rdquo;&ldquo;public money&rdquo; and &ldquo;loan&rdquo; respectively do not include any taxation, money or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.</P>
    <P>In any case, the definition is sufficiently clear to enable even members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to realise that a Money Bill is one which is of serious importance, and to give to sixteen members of a body not elected by the people, not representative of any class of taxpayers&mdash; members who secured election by nomination in some cases, who were elected in other cases, and halfelected in the remaining cases&mdash; power to hold up for an almost indefinite period Bills dealing with matters contained in the definition I have read is a most undemocratic and, in fact, an amazing proposal. We hope that even at this last stage Cumann na nGaedheal members will attempt to defend the elemental interests of their constituents by rejecting this Bill.</P>
    <P>What happens if it is rejected? The Article of the Constitution which it proposes to amend will remain in operation as heretofore, and under that Article two-fifths of the members of the Dáil will still have power, within three days after a Bill has been passed by the Dáil, to question the ruling of the Chairman.  That is not a power we would give them, but it has been there since the institution was established, and if this Bill is rejected, and the Constitution remains as heretofore, they will still have that power.  I suggest seriously to Cumann na nGaedheal members that <Col N="772" /> that power is quite enough for them, in view of the fact that two-fifths of the members of the Dáil have the same power, and I am sure that they have not lost hope so completely that they cannot at least reasonably expect that in the new Dáil, after the next general election, they will at least be able to muster two-fifths of the members if they are of opinion that unconstitutional action has been taken by the Chairman.  Apparently, however, they have not got that hope. My personal view is that there should be, as a maximum, about two-fifths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is most comfortable, as a matter of fact.  I am serious in suggesting that if this Article of the Constitution is to be amended, it should be amended not in the direction suggested in this Bill, but in an opposite direction. The question as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill is one to be decided, and should be decided, by the Dáil.  The Chairman of the Dáil would normally exercise that function, but two-fifths of the members have power to question his ruling, and if that provision is in the Constitution, that is all that is necessary. The Seanad should be made to accept the decision of the Dáil in this matter.  We should not leave it possible for that institution to hold up indefinitely a Bill which, by either imposing or remitting taxation, does seriously affect the vital interests of the people.  I ask Deputies to realise that there is nothing in this Bill which places a time limit upon the period during which the Committee of Privileges would consider the matter.  The question is referred to this Committee, consisting of three members of each House, with a Judge of the Supreme Court, able and willing to act, and <Col N="773" /> they can deliberate on that Bill almost indefinitely.  In fact, there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent them taking ten years, or even 100 years, if the members survive, to decide the question.  If the Constitution is to be amended at all, let us try to improve it; we are not improving it by this Bill.  We can at least provide that if the Committee of Privileges do not arrive at a decision within, say, two months after the question is referred to them, then the decision of the Chairman of the Dáil shall automatically become effective, and the decision shall be taken out of their hands.  I am suggesting that to the President as an improvement in his Constitution, which he might consider the advisability of inserting on the Committee Stage.  I am not at all sure whether he does want to improve his Constitution. I believe myself that he has succeeded to an extent that we, in our wildest moments, never hoped for, in making the Constitution ridiculous and inoperative by these Bills which have been before the House in the past, and which will come before the House in the next few days. I think I have given sufficient reason, even to Cumann na nGaedheal members, to induce them to consider seriously the advisability of telling the Party Whips that they are not going to be bullied in this matter, and that they will go into the Lobby for the purpose of having this Bill rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to remember that when the Fianna Fáil Party came into the Dáil they announced their intention of devoting such portion of their allowance not required for necessary expenses to useful purposes.  I think I have now found out one of these useful purposes. They have endowed a Chair of Constitutional Law and they have invested Deputy Lemass with the professorship, and in the kindness of their hearts they have set him up to lecture and instruct the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That is very kind of them and we appreciate it; only I feel that Deputy Lemass, in the zeal <Col N="774" /> of his new function, was led into the trap of following the pirate captain in &ldquo;Peter Pan,&rdquo; who made his dying speech lest that when dying there would be no time for it. Deputy Lemass made all his Committee speech on Second Reading, presumably thinking that there would be no Committee Stage, or if so, that there would be no time for his speeches.  I do not propose to go into Committee points, and I shall deal with the principle of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in his study of constitutional law, seems to have overlooked the fact that it is well known that it is possible to abuse the provision which gives the popular House the sole control of finance.  There is a practice known to constitutional lawyers as &ldquo;tacking,&rdquo; that is, adding to a Money Bill certain provisions, so that the Money Bill may also contain certain other very serious provisions not appropriate to a Money Bill, and which might reasonably come under the purview of the Seanad.  I can imagine Deputy Lemass, or any other Fianna Fáil Minister, bringing in a Bill of two sections. Section 1 might provide that &ldquo;the allowance paid to members of the Seanad shall cease from the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  That would make it a Money Bill. Section 2 would provide &ldquo;The Seanad is also abolished from the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo; That is very convenient and simple, and the Seanad is to have no say in it at all.  It is precisely because these difficult controversies arise as to what is a Money Bill and what is not, and because it has been known that unscrupulous Ministers, if there are any such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some, and there may be some in the happy future of which Deputy Lemass has spoken.  Unscrupulous Ministers do tend to use what is nominally a Money Bill with financial provisions to achieve other purposes than the proper purpose of a Money Bill.  That is why this Bill <Col N="775" /> is necessary.  It is possible for the occupant of the Chair of the Dáil, like anyone else, to make a mistake, and he would in any case be placed in a very difficult position if such a controversy were to arise.  Then, indeed, the crisis which Deputy Lemass feared would come into being.  There you would have the Dáil on the one side, and the Seanad on the other, each contradicting the other, each engaged in heated debates, headlines in the papers, the national funds going up and down, and all the apparatus of a crisis.  The proposal in this Bill is to remove controversy of this character from the heated atmosphere of debate to the calmness of the Committee room, to the consideration of three Deputies from the Dáil, chosen from the three parties, and, presumably, because they have some common sense, and three Senators, also, I hope, chosen upon the same grounds, and possibly because they have some knowledge of constitutional law, so that Deputy Lemass might not feel lonely.  Then, to make the atmosphere even cooler it is proposed to set over the assembly a judge of the High Court.  This is machinery to remove a crisis, not to create one, to get away from the violence of party to the more reasonable atmosphere of people sitting round a table presided over by a judge of the High Court.  I believe that is a necessary condition of the Constitution, and in spite of Deputy Lemass's missionary endeavours I am going to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is rather a mistake for the President to conclude a debate on the Second Reading of the Bill without giving every member of the House who is interested an opportunity, as Deputy Cooper has said, of learning as much constitutional law as he can.  We are coming near the end of those Constitution Bills now, but I do not think the President need be unduly harried as to his majority.  He will be able to carry it.  For that reason I think it is rather a pity that he should try to hasten the discussion. The Free State is founded and has its Constitution.  If it is going to last, what objection is there to having the fullest and freest discussion on these matters?  I regard this Bill <Col N="777" /> as one of the most important of all the series because of this question. It is an attempt to forestall a crisis and to provide beforehand machinery by which differences of opinion as between the two Houses may be adjusted.  I do not agree with Deputy Cooper that this proposed Committee of Privileges will necessarily be, as one of my colleagues suggested, a freezing chamber in the way of providing a cool and reasoned atmosphere for the discussion of these questions.  It may be a freezing chamber in so far as they will be able to put questions into cold storage and keep them there for an indefinite period, but you are going to have three members of the Seanad, three members of the Dáil, and a Supreme Court Judge upon it. If it is a legal matter, why not leave it to the judges of the courts, why not leave it to the Seanad themselves who, after all, are the chief party concerned after ourselves in the initiation of legislation?  Are we to take it that this Committee, representative of both Chambers, which sat a few months ago, is the very last word, and that the results of its inquiries, which lasted only a few hours, and which were submitted here, are to be regarded as the last word in constitutional law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not a single argument has been brought forward by the Government in support of this measure. There is no proof that this Committee which will be set up will come to a definite and final decision when and if that crisis arises.  In my opinion it is likely that it will end in the way in which the Boundary Commission ended.  It may issue a decision, but there is no proof that it will be binding on this House.  If a Supreme Court Judge by a single vote is to be put in the position of upsetting the declared policy of whatever Executive Council may be in power, and of holding them up in regard to works involving Money Bills, you will be putting on the Courts the task of the initiation of policy, and you will put on the shoulders of one single judge the responsibility of practically combating the judgment of the majority <Col N="778" /> of this House.  I think there is no haste in this matter, and, as previous speakers pointed out, there is ample and sufficient safeguard in the present Constitution.  There is the supposition that the Committee will conclude its business in a certain time.  We have no proof of that.  There is the supposition that you will be able to get a judge to take this matter up.  I doubt very much that that is the proper course to pursue.  I think it would be better to try and envisage more clearly what will happen and the circumstances that will arise.  At present we are just told that a crisis may arise.  We have not had a definite illustration given as to how this proposed court would work.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Government have gone into this question and examined Constitutional crises that arose in other countries, they ought to tell us why they fixed on this freezing-chamber method of disposing of such matters.  I think that Deputy Cooper, in his references to unscrupulous Ministers and to the possibility of a future Government attacking the Seanad and trying to reduce it from its present position, has somewhat given the show away, and that really the object of the Government is not to strengthen the Constitution and place it on such a basis that any Government afterwards could say: &ldquo;This is a Constitution which in its fundamentals represents the considered view of the common people of Ireland.&rdquo; Their attitude seems rather to be to put as many obstacles as possible in the way of future Governments, although a future Government, if it has a majority in the Dáil, will, on the statement of the Chairman of this House that a Bill is a Money Bill not be deterred by the opinion of 16, 20, or 30 members of the other House, and will not be held up in its operations.  Whatever mandates it may have from the country to carry out, it cannot and will not be held up by the obstacles which you are now proposing to put in its way.</P>

      <P>I also would like to emphasise the sentiments which have <Col N="779" /> been expressed by Deputy Derrig as to the inadvisability of anything like undue haste and hurry in matters of this kind.  I am glad that we have here to-day the Minister for Local Government, who, in a most eloquent and most able speech on one of these constitutional amendments, laid down very carefully the attitude of mind in which the House should come to the consideration of legislation, especially fundamental legislation of this kind.  He asked for pause and full consideration.  He asked for delay.  He asked for caution. He asked for argument and discussion, and suggested that before serious matters of this kind should be decided, every possible opportunity should be given for the fullest possible consideration of every one of the details and implications of legislation of this kind and that, instead of doing rash things and then having to mend our hands afterwards, instead of doing things in moments of heat and passion, we should come to the consideration, especially of Constitutional Bills, in a spirit of men who are desirous of building broadly and firmly.  It is in that attitude of mind, and with that sense of responsibility, which this Sovereign Assembly has to the future generations of this country in relation to any action that may be taken in matters of vital constitutional change, that I would appeal to the President, and to the other members of the House, to take advantage of the opportunities which they now have of sitting at the feet of Deputy Lemass and learning that which they did not and which they ought to know, and which, I submit, they ought to know, not from the lips of a member of the Opposition, but from the lips of one whose business it is to oppose this particular outrage on decent, democratic government, and from the lips of those whose business it is to expound such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House now to cast its mind back to the speech in which this matter was opened to it by the President.  I want it to compare that speech with the speech which was <Col N="780" /> delivered by Deputy Lemass, and to ask itself whether Deputies did receive from the President of the Executive Council that instruction in a constitutional matter which they ought to have received and which, in fact, they had to wait for Deputy Lemass to give them.  Is it not an extraordinary position, does it not go right down to the base of the whole principle of the consideration of these Constitutional amendments, that no exposition whatever of the nature, purport, and intent of these amendments should be received from those who are responsible, that the pig in the poke which you have to buy has had to be dragged out squealing by Deputy Lemass and exhibited in all its young and naked beauty by him and not by its progenitors? I, personally, am grateful to Deputy Lemass.  Naturally, members upon this side of the House do take their duties and responsibilities in relation to this matter more seriously than members opposite because, after all, those who are going to live continuously in a house have more responsibility and more interest in it than a weekly tenant, and the time at which these Constitutional amendments in their relation to the Government of this country will concern, at any rate the Front Bench opposite, is coming very rapidly to an end.</P>
    <P>If I might carry that simile a little further, the spirit in which they are closing their tenancy is the spirit of a man who is going to sell his landlord's furniture before he is put out. This Bill is one of half-a-dozen which represents testamentary benefits made <i>in articulo mortis.</i>  There is an atmosphere to make friends with the Mammon of Iniquity while you are in the way to sit quietly and to write twenty-eight days instead of three. How can they tangle in barbed wire the paths of their successors?  That seems to be the whole philosophy of those Bills, and more especially of this Bill, whose purpose undoubtedly is to entangle their successors in embarrassments for the benefit of those who have supported them up to the present in the Seanad, and who have supported them with subscriptions in the general elections, to tangle in <Col N="781" /> barbed wire the unwary feet of those to whom they are going to hand over a bankrupt Treasury and a barren Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of atmosphere in which we come to the consideration of this Bill.  It is suggested no doubt that the purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the control over and increase the caution in relation to a Money Bill, to provide another means by which it shall be difficult for, I think the word was used, unscrupulous Ministers to waste the nation's money. Well, I have no hesitation in saying that we, upon this side of the House, when we come to deal responsibly with the nation's money, will be about as anxious and as careful in relation to the nation's money as the President was last night in relation to his own.  Deputy Lemass has done a very great service to this House in the attempt which he has made, and I am not sure that it has been a wholly unsuccessful attempt, to educate Cumann na nGaedheal, because it is essential to the stability of this country, essential to the smooth and orderly working of this Dáil in the new Parliament, that Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies should be educated into that elementary knowledge of consitutional law and form as will enable them to exercise with some reasonable degree of efficiency the duties of an opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come now to Deputy Cooper, who entered into competition with my colleague, Deputy Lemass, as to which of them was delivering bromides to the country. They are perfectly well agreed that a constitutional crisis should be avoided and the competition between these two Deputies is as to which is really trying to avoid the crisis and which is really trying to create it.  Personally, I am of opinion that Bills of this kind introduced as I said <i>in articulo mortis</i><Col N="782" /> and for the purpose of buttressing up and increasing the vested interests and power in the Seanad to obstruct the Dáil, will, if those Bills are attempted to be made operative, under the new conditions when the Dáil and the Seanad do not represent the same opinion, produce conditions of crisis.  You are bound to get under those circumstances a hard-shell crash between the two. During the few months, at any rate, in which we are engaged in smashing up the Seanad as at present constituted, you will get undoubtedly a clash in this matter, and this is asking for a clash.</P>
      <P>Personally I would like to see the Seanad fading away nicely and gently and not explosively.  As you know, a condition of this kind did arise in another country in relation to two Houses&mdash;the House of Commons and the House of Lords&mdash;and it had a rather curious foundation in law and a rather curious consequence in fact.  The House of Lords held up a Budget.  The House of Lords had the power to hold up a Budget but what the House of Lords did not know was that you only have the right to the exercise of a power if having exercised it you can continue to exercise it.  In the single attempt of the House of Lords to exercise the power of interference in money matters, they destroyed that power and in my opinion, any attempt, on the part of the Seanad in the new Parliament, to hold up on any definition they like a Money Bill or to interfere in any way with money matters in this country in the face of a Dáil which was hostile to their interests will produce a clash in which not merely these little powers of the Seanad will be removed but the Seanad itself also will be removed and removed with a speed and possibly with a virility, if I might use the term, which possibly might not be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course Deputy Cooper prophesied otherwise.  He sees headlines in the paper; he sees startling speeches. I have no doubt.  Well, Deputy Cooper is a poor prophet.  If we are simply to go on the ground of prophecy there is probably no one <Col N="783" /> less entitled to that name.  I can remember a prophecy of his previously that last autumn we were going to go for a loan.  I do not see that prophecy having yet survived the test of time.</P>

I am perfectly sure when they have done so, they will see that this, a Bill further to increase the vested interests of the Seanad in the power to interfere with and oppose the will of this House, is a Constitution Bill that should not, in the interests of this country, be passed by this House.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the proposition before us in this Bill is one that should be taken very seriously by members of this House.  It is not a matter to be dealt with lightly.  The proposition here set forth is one that has in it the seed of grave and important possibilities for the future of this country.  I do not profess to be an expert on Constitutional law, but like everybody who takes an interest in his own country's affairs, who watches the proceedings in other countries, who reads a little, I have seen, noted and read of the difficulties that have arisen in other countries over matters with which we are now dealing. I know a little of the Constitutions of a few countries.  I know something about the Constitutions <Col N="784" /> of America, England and France, and I have watched their legislatures and Constitutions in operation. I do not think it will be denied that these countries have Constitutions&mdash;in two of them, at any rate, modern Constitutions&mdash;which secure for the common people control over their own finances to ensure that the will of the majority of the people will prevail, and in these countries the complete power of the purse is reserved to the Lower House.  Attempts have frequently been made in some of these countries by the Upper Houses to increase their power, and in some of these countries the representatives in the Upper Houses are elected by the people, by direct or almost direct vote.  Nevertheless, although that is so, the attempts that were made to encroach on the privileges of those who were elected directly by the people, and directly responsible to the people, the members of the Lower Houses, were very definitely and very bitterly fought, and in all of these countries the final decision as to the control over matters of taxation, matters of money, control over the purse of the nation was reserved to those who were directly elected and responsible to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They resolve the question, and if they decide that it is a Money Bill, or whichever way they decide, they have power to hold up, to refuse to recognise the decision of the Ceann Comhairle or the Chairman of Dáil Eireann, as he is called in this Bill, and to refer it to a Committee.  I think it was a strange omission in the original Constitution that no term was suggested during which that Committee should report.  The Bill says:</P>
      <P>The question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall be referred to a Committee of Privileges, consisting of three members elected by Dáil Eireann, three members elected by Seanad Eireann, and a Chairman, who shall be the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, able and willing to act, and who, in the case of an equality of votes, but not otherwise, shall be entitled to vote.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Committee on the question shall be final and conclusive.</P>
      <P>If the matter is referred to a Committee at all, I suppose it is right to say that the decision of the Committee shall be final and conclusive; but it appears a strange omission that there was not put into this Constitution some time limit, whether it be a month or a year, at the end of which the Committee must report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, certainly specifically, and I do not think even impliedly, cover reference to the Committee.  It is not clear and definite, and it ought to be made definite. There is no reference here to referring that to a Committee, or as to how long a Committee may sit. There is no clear implication.  It is not definite, and it is not even implied, that if that committee does not report within twenty-one days, or within twenty days, to give the <Col N="788" /> Seanad an opportunity of considering the report, the committee could report; and if the committee does not report, the suggestion may be there that the two Houses can act.  But that is very vague.  I was astonished, and I am still surprised, that with this opportunity, when this Constitution is being studied for the purpose of being torn up, altered, amended, or repaired, somebody did not suggest that the original omission should be made good.  I would not like this amendment to be taken in anything but a serious way.  I do not think it is a matter to be dealt with lightly at all, and I say that even although the Ministry opposite might remain in power until lá Pilib na Cleite, and that is a long time&mdash; longer than I think they themselves would like to stay.  It is quite possible that with this Bill, if no change in administration ever took place, a grave difference of opinion might arise between the two Houses on the interpretation of a Money Bill, or as to what was a Money Bill; and if that does arise, I claim that the right should remain with this House, directly with the Deputies elected by the people, to decide what is a Money Bill and what is not a Money Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that if the will of the people is to be recognised at all to decide the destinies of their own country, primarily that will is expressed by the power of the purse. If the power of the purse is taken away from this elected body, this body which derives its powers directly from the people and in no other way, then you take away the will of the people from this House. That is my interpretation.  I object in principle to any outside authority, unless in an advisory capacity, such as in the case of a judge of the Supreme Court, having authority to set aside the will of the publicly elected representatives of this House.  That is proposed in this Bill&mdash;it is already in the Constitution, but it is emphasised in this Bill &mdash;and an effort is being made to increase the power to be given to two different authorities, one Seanad Eireann and the other a Supreme <Col N="789" /> Court judge, to take out of the hands of this House, and therefore out of the hands of the people, certain grave authority and responsibility that it now holds.  That proposition is one which I think everybody, irrespective of Party, who takes a serious interest in democratic rule and constitutional government ought to give very serious consideration to.</P>
    <P>The President has for years emphasised, in every word he spoke in public, that he always stood for the will of the people, that he always stood for the absolute control of the Government of the country by the majority of the elected representatives of the people.  As I read this proposition, he is taking that authority out of the people's hands.  I think that that is a very serious proposition for him to bring in, and to bring it in in this form, which might easily escape being properly understood by Deputies.  I think that they do not fairly realise the implications in this proposed amendment of the Constitution.  Deputy Flinn has told us of an effort made in England, I think about twenty years ago, to take the power of the purse out of the hands of the elected representatives of the people.  That was the famous case of the Lloyd George Budget when the British House of Lords held up a Money Bill and provoked a crisis, which in England, constituted as it is, was overcome without danger to life or limb.  But the Constitution of this country, and its recent history, are such that if a crisis of that kind arose here, even without any change of Government, then I say in all seriousness that it might not be got over as easily here, and it is well to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly changes in the Constitution will be necessary from time to time.  We, if we came into power, would propose very serious changes.  As has been said here often, we would propose the abolition of the Seanad.  Probably that would provoke a crisis, but I hope that when such a proposition is made that it will be debated here, whatever House exists then and however it may be composed, and fought out inside the representative <Col N="790" /> assembly; and that the results, whatever they are, will be carried through without danger or difficulty. But, whether we come into power at an early or a remote period, it will undoubtedly be necessary that changes in the Constitution must take place.  We would ask that whatever the changes proposed now or hereafter may be, that they would get the very serious consideration of members on all sides, and that no opportunity should be lost by members of any Party to learn what the implications are in any such suggested amendment to the Constitution.  At all times, I think, all parties should agree that the principle that has been debated and fought out in a constitutional way, and in unconstitutional ways in countries the world over, the question of the right of the common people to control the destinies of the country through control of the purse ought, if proposed for consideration here, to receive very serious thought and consideration from all the members of the House.  The change here suggested does, to my mind, raise that constitutional issue. It raises the question: who is eventually to decide the financial future of the country?  That being so, I think members ought to give the best of their thought to it with the view to preventing unnecessary trouble arising in the House or outside of it in the future.</P>

      <P>I know that, unfortunately, possibly because of the experience which the House has endured during the past five or six years, that it has treated this matter of its powers with scant respect, and often with little ceremony.  The fact that the Opposition here was always up against a secure majority, which could invariably enforce its will, has even among the members of the Dáil itself, spread a feeling rather of contempt for the powers, duties and responsibilities of the House.</P>

      <P>I feel now that the financial position of the country is such, that every penny which is expended ought to be severely scrutinised. Every measure which in any way proposes to curtail or to restrict or to define the powers which this House has over financial legislation ought, for that reason, to be very severely scrutinised and examined. Now, the first thing which occurs to me is this: that often financial matters have to be dealt with with great expedition.  I understand that next week the Government will be coming to this House with a Vote on Account.  After that, we will have the Central Fund Bill.  Now, it may be argued, and probably will be urged upon our representatives on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, the body which is more or less charged with the duty of arranging Parliamentary business, that too much time cannot be given to the discussion of this measure, which is a very important one, by reason of the fact that after the Central Fund Bill leaves the Dáil it will have to go to the Seanad and be considered by it.  We will be urged, therefore, to <Col N="792" /> deal with the Vote on Account, and with all the stages of the Central Fund Bill with the utmost expedition.</P>
      <P>The thing which occurs to me, in connection with this Bill, is that the Government are proceeding on diametrically opposite principles.  They are, first of all, to enable the other House, by a much smaller proportion of its members than is required of the Dáil, to hold up financial legislation coming from here.  Under proviso (b), the majority of the members of the Seanad present and voting at a sitting, at which not less than thirty members are present, may so resolve that the question as to whether a Bill is, or is not, a Money Bill shall be referred to a committee to be set up in a particular way.  Now, I do not know whether the point has been stressed before or not; but it occurs to me that, under that proviso, 16 members of the Seanad, or something very nearly approaching one quarter of the total membership of the House, can obstruct the passage of a Money Bill by simply asking that it should be referred to a Select Committee or to the Committee of Privileges.</P>

      <P>I propose to speak principally on the amendment. The members of the Independent Group cannot congratulate themselves in believing this proposal has led to a very useful debate in this House.  Unfortunately the debate was brought very early to the level of personalities.  I am afraid if I had replied at an earlier stage I should have fallen a victim to the temptation to respond accordingly, particularly because there is a tendency, if that sort of thing is overlooked, to presume upon it being overlooked.  I agree whole-heartedly with the President and others as to the regrettable nature of such personalities, and because of the fact that they always tend to draw away discussion from the real merits or demerits of the proposals.  I do not intend saying anything more on that line, except this, that allied with that there was a great deal of misplaced speculative ingenuity as to what were the motives underlying this proposal of the Independents, or some of the Independents. Of course these speculations are all wrong.  Those who indulged in them disregarded the simple and obvious explanation.  Again, that sort of inventive ingenuity simply led others to go on the same line rather than discuss whether the proposition itself was a good one or not.  It is not a question of what any particular Deputy thinks of the proposer of this Bill or how little he cares what that particular Deputy thinks or not of the motives behind the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we wanted to discuss is the question as to whether this was a good proposition or a bad proposition. <Col N="794" /> It was a suggestion for economy. I think we are all agreed that economy is necessary wherever it can be introduced with advantage, and the real question is whether the economy suggested had advantages which more than compensated for the comparatively small monetary gain that would accrue if the proposal were adopted.  Members of the Independent Group hoped to produce some useful discussion in this House.  The only serious attempt, I think, that was made to touch on that proposition was made by Deputy O'Connell, and if he was serious in asking that a case should be put forward for the matter, undoubtedly he ought to be answered, and such a case ought to be established, but it seemed to us that on the face of it there was a case at least for consideration of the matter, and that it did not require any great argument to establish the fact that the matter ought to be considered.  It is very doubtful, it seemed to us, whether the various calls on a Senator and on a Deputy in various respects, whether in time and in expense in calls from the constituency, in keeping him in touch with his constituency, in various ways justify the ratio of equality being applied to the question of the allowances that are given to Senators and Deputies. I stress the point that this sum under consideration is not a salary.  It is an allowance, and it was so intended from the beginning. I think in considering that attention ought to be paid to what I call the &ldquo;responsibilities&rdquo;&mdash;and I hope in using that word I will not be misunderstood&mdash;of Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not at all mean to say that the responsibility of a Senator in his position is not just as great as the responsibility of a member of the Dáil in his position.  By &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; a good many other things are covered than the mere sense of responsibility in filling the position. I think it is obvious that in the wider sense the responsibilities of a Dáil member are greater than those of a <Col N="795" /> Senator, not that I at all hold the view that the call on the Senator is confined to the number of days in which the Seanad happens to be sitting. It is far wider than that, and if he does his work as a Senator properly it would involve a great deal more responsibility than attendance in the Seanad when sitting, and the time taken by him to perform his work properly would be far greater than the time required for such attendance.  I do not suggest at all that it would be measured by the actual number of meetings either body holds, but I think it does follow if one body sits a great deal more frequently than another body that the time taken up by a member of that body in paying proper attention to his duties will be greater, and will be more of a drawing away from the work on which he would be otherwise engaged than it would in the case of the second body.</P>
    <P>My point is, that I think it would be hard to establish in equity a case for equality of treatment between the two, and, therefore, <i>prima facie</i> there is a case for the consideration of the question.  I was hoping that arguments would be put up on the other side to indicate that even though that was the case that the comparatively small monetary saving that would be made would not justify making any difference in a monetary point of view between allowances to members of the two bodies.  I think the only suggestion of an argument that was put was that the effect of this proposal would be in the case of a wage-earner&mdash;I take it what was meant was wage-earner as opposed to somebody in receipt of a salary in a fixed position&mdash;to make it impossible for a wage-earner to become a candidate for membership of the Seanad. I do not think that that argument is tenable.  If the proposition had been to refuse an allowance to a member of the Seanad that might have been so, but the proposal made by the Independents is very much in favour of the wage-earner as compared with one who is in receipt of a regular salary.  It seems to me that the proposition to allow him £4 a week, if <Col N="796" /> you like, would be very much more attractive to him, and would pay him for the time taken in doing his work as a Senator properly much better than it would pay one who was in receipt of a regular salary.  At any rate, that is one point which may be open to argument and which should be discussed properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask him.  I am stating the argument at the moment in the form in which it strikes myself.  It is one of those arguments which, perhaps, ought to be discussed, and Deputy Tierney's proposition would give an opportunity for discussing it in a way in which the views of the Senators themselves could be put forward and weighed up by everyone, before a decision on the main question is come to.  I can hardly believe that any Deputy was serious or sincere in putting forward a suggestion that Deputy Tierney's proposal was a way of shelving this question, or of confining the discussion on it to secrecy.  It is so obviously nothing of the kind, and it is so obviously the case that a vote on this amendment does no more than postpone the matter for two months at the outside, from coming before the Dáil for full consideration here, that I can hardly believe that the suggestion was made seriously.  It is not for the purpose of shelving it.  It is not a question of shelving it.  It is merely a question of getting a discussion on the matter properly in the most advisable way, and in that respect I entirely endorse the view expressed by the President, that it would be a matter of courtesy to consult Senators themselves in the first place, and give them an opportunity of expressing their views before we bring the matter back before the Dáil for full and open discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of shelving the matter or confining the discussion to an inner body.  There is a question of getting complete information and the fullest expression of <Col N="797" /> views that it is possible to get before we have that open discussion in this House.  It is this House that will have the final determination and the last word as to whether the proposed allowance is a good or bad proposition, and it will be open to everyone to express his views in the fullest way when the matter comes before us again.  I think it was the Minister for Agriculture who said that he thought that he would vote for the amendment.  Well, I hope he will.  I hope he will vote for the other proposition too, if it is decided finally to bring it before the House again after that discussion. This is not a question really where there is a necessity to choose between voting for the amendment and the proposition at all.  One merely delays the time when a vote for or against the proposition will have to be given.  The two are not in any sense contradictory; and in voting for the amendment, as I intend to do, I leave myself in the fullest sense <Col N="798" /> free to vote for the resolution when it comes back again to the House, if I am not convinced in the meantime by the discussion which takes place that it is an inadvisable thing to do.  I had really hoped that it would commend itself to Deputies generally; that it was the courteous thing to do, to set up this Committee; that it was a wise and prudent thing to do, so that we might have the fullest advantage of the discussion before we would come to what might be afterwards called a hasty decision.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to agree to the amendment, reserving the right to give free expression of opinion and decision on the proposition in the Bill itself at a later date when it comes before them.  I do not think I need say anything else.  I merely ask Deputies again to consider that the amendment does not shelve the decision on the main proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This is a Bill to increase the compensation payable to workmen in cases of accident.  To put briefly the principle of the Bill: it proposes to increase the amount of compensation (1) in cases of fatal accident and (2) in cases of non-fatal accident. The existing law is settled by the Act of 1906.  Under that Act, in the case of a workman meeting with a fatal accident in the course of his employment and leaving dependents, the minimum sum payable for compensation is £150 and the maximum sum £300.  This Bill proposes that the £150 minimum should be increased to £200, and the £300 maximum to £600.  Apart from the fact that that change has already been made elsewhere, it will be obvious that it is a change which should be made in our law, because if that scale was an appropriate scale for compensation in 1906, it is clearly an unsuitable scale at the present day.  Many Deputies no doubt will have had experience of cases where a workman was killed in the course of his employment leaving a number of young children, and the scale now in force is equivalent to giving the dependents, no matter how numerous they are, an allowance of only £15 per year, because I call £300 an allowance of £15 per year.  Cases have come within my experience in another capacity where a man has been killed in the course of his employment leaving a number of young children.  For instance, I have known of a case where a workman was killed and left a widow and four young children from seven to one-and-a-half years of age.  That workman was giving £3 per week to his wife for the support of himself and his wife and four children.  Even if you assume that half that £3 went for his own exclusive benefit, there was still 30/- per week for the benefit <Col N="802" /> of his wife and children.  Under the law as it stands, £300 is the maximum compensation which can be granted in such a case, and instead of 30/- per week for the widow and for the children until they come to the age of 15, when they would be able to earn their own living, there is a total sum of £15 per year.  I say that that is inequitable and that the law should be brought into conformity with modern ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the head of incapacity, this divides itself into two branches&mdash; there is total incapacity and partial incapacity.  In 1917, an Act called the War Addition Act was passed. It was a temporary measure, intended only to operate until the end of the war and six months afterwards. There was a further War Addition Act passed in 1919, which was also a temporary measure, but which has been kept in existence. The effect of these Acts was to increase the amount of compensation payable in cases of total incapacity, the second Act increasing the amount which would be given in the case of total incapacity by 75 per cent.  That Act is in force in this country at present.  What this Bill proposes to do is to stabilise the increases given under that Act.  There will not be any real increase, except in one respect, which I will mention.  There is not any real increase in the amount of compensation proposed to be given by this Bill in cases of total incapacity. It proposes to stabilise the increase given.  But, as I say, in one respect there is a difference.  We have in this country at present a maximum sum, apart from the advances given by the War Addition Act.  We have a maximum weekly payment allowed to workmen incapacitated of 20/-, and the effect of the War Addition Act is really to bring that up by 75 per cent. and increase it to 35/-.  In another country they have a total weekly maximum of 30/-.  It is proposed in this Bill to make it 35/-.  The reason for that is, and it was one of the reasons which operated on the minds of the Departmental Committee which the Minister for Industry and Commerce set up, that in this country the <Col N="803" /> workers have not certain advantages that workers have in England&mdash;they have not the medical benefits that the workers in England have.  The Committee made an unanimous recommendation that the maximum sum here should be 35/- per week, so as to make up for the loss that our workers suffer by reason of having no medical benefits as compared with workers in other countries.  That is, as regards war additions.  With regard to the cases of total incapacity, the Bill only proposes to stabilise what is in existence already under the temporary Acts, which it is proposed, if the House accepts the Bill, to be repealed.  The other head is partial incapacity, and it is proposed to put the working people in a better condition than at present in cases of partial incapacity.  That was dealt with specifically in the report of the Departmental Committee to which I have referred.  There were on that Committee representatives of labour, and four members of the Committee were employers' representatives. There was an unanimous recommendation by the Committee, and all this Bill proposes to do is to put in operation the unanimous recommendation of the Committee as regards cases of partial incapacity.  In a word, the Bill proposes to put in force, as regards these limited matters&mdash;compensation on death and compensation in non-fatal cases&mdash;the unanimous recommendation of the Committee set up by the Minister.</P>

      <P>While I wish to welcome this Bill, at the same time I recognise that it may be looked upon as only piecemeal legislation. Undoubtedly Deputy Rice has made a serious and honest attempt to deal with a phase of our industrial life which has from time to time been attempted to be met where the widows and children are bereft of their breadwinners and left with no other provision than that made by the Workmen's Compensation Act. Now, while I use the term &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo;<Col N="804" /> I do not want to reflect in any way on the effort made by Deputy Rice to do something to improve existing legislation in this regard, and to endeavour to make provision to carry out at least some of the recommendations of the Committee set up by the Minister, and before which I myself was examined.</P>
      <P>While I agree that this would be a useful and acceptable contribution to the already existing Workmen's Compensation Act, at the same time I suggest that we should not lose sight of the other recommendations made by that Committee.  I have not the Report before me, neither have I had access to it, but there is a phase of the whole question which I want Deputy Rice to consider at a later stage.  Under the Act there is a minimum and a maximum amount fixed by way of compensation.  I speak under correction, but I think that during the deliberations of the Committee set up to deal with the matter, a sort of sliding scale of compensation was suggested under which it was indicated that the widow left without children should receive a minimum amount of compensation, and a certain scale was specified.  To illustrate my point. I may not be correct, as far as the figures are concerned, but they will be approximate figures.  Amongst a number of suggestions made was one to this effect.  A widow say from 20 to 25 years of age who had no children should receive less than a widow of from 25 to 30 years of age who had no children.  The former should receive from £75 to £100 and the latter from £100 to £150, and a widow of from 35 to 40 years of age should receive from £150 to £200.  The meaning or intention there was that it would place no further burden on either of the contributors to the scheme, workmen or employers, but that we should be able to preserve, all the time, in the operation of the Act, what appeared to be one of the most useful provisions, namely, to maintain £1 plus 75 per cent., or 35s. weekly to the injured worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I understand that a very decent attempt was made by the Committee <Col N="805" /> so to balance matters that they suggested that 35s. should be maintained while a workman was unfit to follow his regular occupation, and that the maximum and the minimum should be increased by way of providing for the widows and orphans of deceased workers&mdash;that is, those people who come in under the operations of the Act.  The continued inclusion in the Act of the 35s. to the injured workman is one of the things I think Deputy Rice has not lost sight of.  In fact he indicated in his speech that he did not want to drop what, to working people, is an absolutely essential portion of the whole arrangement.</P>
    <P>It must be, of course, very manifest that there is a big difference between a young widow without dependents and a widow of fifty or sixty years of age without dependents. There is no need for me to indicate what should be perfectly obvious, that a woman of twenty-five or thirty years of age stands a better chance of re-marriage than a woman of from fifty to sixty years of age, and, consequently, in any legislation which might pass this House, we should not lose sight of the fact, that there are certain features in the present Act which we should like to see continued and preserved.  At the same time, as mentioned by Deputy Rice, we must remember that legislation passed in 1906 is not adequate, and should not be considered adequate in 1929.  We all know the economic change brought about by the Great War, resulting in the higher cost of living. For that reason I welcome this Bill. I commend it to the consideration of the House, and so far as our party is concerned, we look upon it as a decent effort, and we appreciate the endeavour of Deputy Rice to do something to make our legislation a little more attractive, and to bring it more into line with social legislation in other countries.  It seems to me, at any rate, an indication that other Deputies are becoming a little more responsive to the movement towards betterment of the workers and humanitarianism in general.  For <Col N="806" /> these reasons I have pleasure in supporting the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is not, of course, possible to provide legislation against all and every contingency.  There is this one possible case to which I should like to draw the attention of Deputy Rice to see whether provision has been made in such a case.  To the best of my recollection application has to be made, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, within six months of an accident.  It is not likely, but there is a possibility of a posthumous child subsequent to that date.  What provision is made for the maintenance of such a child, if any, in this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this question of workmen's compensation, this House decided to set up a Committee of Inquiry into the whole question as far back as May, 1925.  That Committee went very fully into the whole question, and presented its Report on the 31st July, 1926.  That Report was unanimous; and notwithstanding the fact that repeated efforts were made to get the Minister to introduce legislation along the lines outlined in this unanimous Report, no action was taken by the Executive Council or by the Minister.  The House is now asked to decide this matter in a Bill dealing with a small fraction of a complicated question; and I would like to point out to the House that we have had only twenty-four hours' notice of what is really contained in the Bill.  And although Deputies were only presented with the Bill yesterday morning, we received no explanatory memorandum, which one would expect to come from the Minister accompanying a very complicated matter of this description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British system of compensation which we inherited is very defective in many ways, more especially in comparison with the system in operation in the Province of Ontario, and other provinces of Canada. As far as the Departmental Committee was concerned, it received evidence from employers, workers' representatives and judges as to the deficiencies in the present system.  But <Col N="807" /> the Committee felt itself unable to deal with the big issues, such as compulsory insurance and complete remodelling of the system because of the lack of exact data.  The Committee recommended that after three years' experience of the amended legislation, and the collection of the necessary data, further inquiry into the whole system should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>That period of three years has practically elapsed, but owing to the fact that no legislation was introduced by the Minister along the lines suggested in the recommendations of the Committee, I suppose that the proposed further inquiry is as far, if no further, off.  Owing to the lack of data the Committee had to confine itself to endeavouring to make suggestions so as to improve the present system.  At that Departmental Committee we find that the employers were opposed to any change which would mean increased charges to them.  It should be borne in mind, as apparently it was not by the employers who gave evidence before the Committee, that the whole insurance contributions paid by employers in Britain and the Six Counties are on a much higher level than those paid in the Free State, and that, consequently, employers in the Free State have that advantage, at any rate, over employers in the Six Counties and Great Britain.  In Great Britain and the Six Counties the legislation which was enacted in 1923 reduced the amount of compensation payable in the case of nonfatal accidents from a maximum of 35/- to 30/- weekly, and I fear that there may be a tendency at present to endeavour on the part of, at least, a few members of this House to get the compensation reduced so far as this Bill is concerned.  Personally, I am against any reduction, because I believe that when a worker meets with an accident he has additional expenses to meet, and consequently I believe that he should not be put in a position worse than that in which he is at present.</P>
    <P>The members of the Committee <Col N="808" /> were against any reduction being made so far as the 35/- maximum was concerned, and in order to maintain that maximum and at the same time avoid the imposition of heavier charges on employers, the Committee revised with great trouble the whole series of adjustments in regard to compensation. The changes proposed were inter-departmental.  This Bill completely upsets the balance which the Committee devised so carefully by adopting one recommendation in regard to weekly payments, but ignoring the other recommendation in the case of death and adopting instead the recent British legislation in regard to compensation in the event of death.  The proposals in the Bill before the House are somewhat better than the British legislation, but at the same time I do not think that it will be gainsaid by anyone who read the recommendations of the Committee that the Bill does not go as far and is not as good from the workers' point of view as the recommendations contained in the Committee's report.  The fear has been expressed in some quarters that if we retain the thirty-five shilling maximum it will mean heavier insurance premiums, even if Deputy Rice got certain assurances from the insurance companies that this will not be so.  Of course, I do not know if he got any assurances.  If assurances had been given to the Minister by the companies we would probably have been able to place more reliance on them, because it has to be taken into consideration that the Minister has no power to control the premiums, and this Bill does not give him any power to do so.</P>
    <P>Without putting additional liability on employers the thirty-five shilling maximum could.  I believe, be retained, notwithstanding the demands which I suppose will be made at a later stage to reduce such maximum. It could have been maintained, for instance, if the Minister had seen his way to introduce legislation along the lines outlined in the recommendations of the Committee and if he decided to adopt all the <Col N="809" /> recommendations instead of taking out only a few of them, as Deputy Rice has done.  I believe that a Government Bill is all the more necessary because the subject is extremely complicated and there is real urgency, not only in respect of the revision of compensation but also in respect of international agreements, in order to secure the payment of compensation.  This question is also made more complicated by the fact that there are certain international agreements&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;in regard to the International Labour Office Conventions.  The whole matter should have been dealt with from the Government standpoint in a Government Bill rather than in a Private Bill as it is of great importance, not only to workers in the Saorstát but also to Irish seamen on British ships and to Irish emigrants to Britain who suffer accidents and who upon their return home, in accordance with present legislation, are not entitled, as they should be, to compensation.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I say that I did not state, either in the House or elsewhere, that I had received assurances from the insurance companies in regard to the question of premiums?  Deputy Cassidy probably confused certain facts.  The insurance companies were represented on the Committee set up by the Minister and these representatives informed the Committee that if the recommendations regarding increased compensation were put in force there would not be an increase in the premiums by reason of the increased compensation.  That is probably what the Deputy has in mind in referring to the assurances given by insurance companies, but I disclaim having made any statement that I had received any assurances from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>To some extent I am in agreement with Deputy Cassidy when he objects to dealing with a matter of very great importance, such as this question of workmen's compensation, in a Private Member's Bill.  I <Col N="810" /> think that the proper course to adopt would have been for the Government to have considered carefully the views put before them by the Committee that was set up, and then to have introduced a measure based on these recommendations. I am opposed to this method of dealing piecemeal with large measures of this kind.  I think it is unfortunate from every point of view.  As Deputy Cassidy pointed out, there were other aspects of the recommendations which while conferring boons, or at least, advantages to the workers would not have imposed additional burdens on industry, but they were not carried out.  That fact in itself is very important at present, because I need not tell members of this House that industry at the moment is carrying burdens greater than it can bear, and that it is undesirable that further burdens should be placed upon it. From that point of view I am disappointed that a matter of this magnitude and importance should be dealt with through a Private Member's Bill rather than a Government measure based on the Committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rice when he says that the original Workmen's Compensation Act, which this Bill amends, was introduced so long ago as 1906, and that very considerable changes have occurred in the meantime, so that it is essential and advisable that a Bill should be introduced to bring that measure up to date.  While I agree with that, that does not justify a matter of this importance and magnitude being dealt with through a Private Member's Bill, and I would strongly recommend the Minister to consider whether the proper course would not be to ask that this Bill be withdrawn and to introduce a Government Bill dealing with the matter on the lines of the Committee's recommendations. One would like to hear the Minister on that particular aspect of this important question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been stated by Deputy Fahy, we welcome this Bill.  It might, perhaps, have been made more wide and deal with more <Col N="811" /> matters than are set out in the Bill. Undoubtedly, the question of insurance will arise on this Bill, and also, I assume, the question of increased premiums.  I have in mind particularly the extra imposition on the agricultural community.  Comparatively small farmers will be compelled, as they have been in the past, to insure their workmen.  In many cases they are in a very poor position to bear any further imposition, and unless some arrangement can be made with insurance companies that would enable these insurance companies to bear the increased liabilities themselves, it will mean that the Bill will impose some hardship. At the same time, that is not sufficient ground for any substantial opposition to the measure.  It might appear at first, on looking over the 1906 Act and the War Addition Acts of 1917 and 1919, that benefits had been greatly increased to provide for the changed conditions. There was an increase of 25 per cent. under the 1917 Act, and a substitution of 75 per cent. by the 1919 Act, but as Deputy Rice has pointed out, and I am sure it has come under the notice of everybody conversant with practice in the courts, there have been a number of cases of extreme hardship.</P>
      <P>One saw very often a very sad state of affairs revealed in the courts, where dependents had to come in from time to time to apply for a sum to be paid out of court to enable those dependents, if they were young persons, to be provided with some trade or employment.  One saw the Circuit Judges in the position of having to cut down the amounts applied for.  Where a sum of £10 or £15 was applied for, to enable a young person to go into apprenticeship, the Judges have had to cut down the amount to £5 or £10, and have not been in a position to make an award out of the funds in court that would enable these young persons to be apprenticed to some trade or occupation that would make them useful citizens in after life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy <Col N="812" /> Cassidy, in regard to conventions, is one that had already forced itself on people in certain parts of the country. In the area from which I come, I have known as many as 50 cases to arise within twelve months. In that area, large numbers of small farmers and their families migrate each year to England and Scotland, and in the various employments which they find there, there is, what appears to one in this country, a considerable number of accidents. These people find considerable difficulty in getting compensation.  I have known of cases within the last few days where there was no answer whatever, cases where the weekly award had been paid for a number of weeks while these people were in England.  Immediately they came to this country, the insurance companies took up the attitude that they would pay no money until they returned to England.  It means that these unfortunate labourers who have come home, some of them in ignorance of the legal conditions and the loss which they would suffer by doing so, and some of them forced by economic conditions to come home, as they were not able to work in England, unless they were able to borrow a few pounds from friends, have had great hardships imposed upon them, and are not able to get their just rights.  With other countries, with France notably, conventions do exist, and I suggest to Deputy Rice or to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the question of a suitable convention between this country and England might be taken up or might be entered into with a view to overcoming a hardship which is a very real hardship in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment on the unfairness of the fact that insurance companies, although they are satisfied that cases are real and genuine cases&mdash;and I do not refer to any second-rate companies, but to wellknown companies which have branch offices in this country&mdash;refer one simply to the section and refuse to entertain any question of merit.  It means that these unfortunate people have to go back to England and remain <Col N="813" /> there while their petition is filed or until the case is submitted to arbitration, and they eventually get compensation.  I suggest it is a matter that should receive the urgent attention of the House, that it has existed too long, and is one which, at the earliest opportunity, should be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a general consensus of opinion in the House in favour of the principle underlying this Bill.  I was especially glad to hear Deputy Good state that in his view the Act of 1906 had to be brought up to date, but I do not entirely agree with him that it is not advisable to have a Bill such as this, limited as it may be in scope, introduced by a private member.  Now I largely sympathise with private members introducing Private Bills, and, apart from that sympathy, it is highly commendable that private members, by introducing such measures as this, focus the attention of this House and of the Government on the necessity for introducing at a later date a more comprehensive Bill.  This Bill, I presume, certainly from my reading of it, does not in any way claim to cover the whole field of investigation covered by the Commission, but I think it does one thing&mdash;as one fairly well acquainted with the working of the Workmen's Compensation Act, I think it sets out to remedy the immediate needs.  In respect of any changes that are proposed under this Bill to existing legislation, I do not think anyone can say that they are in any way extravagant.  As has been stated, conditions are not what they were in 1906, especially in the case of widows and dependants; the sums that were then considered adequate by way of compensation are anything but adequate now.  In regard to the proposal that there should be some increase for partial incapacity, I think that was generally admitted too.  There are no medical benefits in this country under the Insurance Acts, and I think that has been taken into account by the Committee, and should be taken into account by us <Col N="814" /> in dealing with any measure affecting workmen's compensation.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as far as it goes, should, I think, commend itself to the House, and I would support Deputy Good's suggestion that if the Minister could see his way either to accept this Bill or to embody it in a larger or more comprehensive measure, perhaps Deputy Rice might be inclined to accept that situation.  As one conversant with the administration of these Acts, there is no doubt about it but there is a necessity, and an immediate necessity, for something being done on the lines indicated in this Bill.  I think that the proposals in the Bill, as far as they go, are almost overdue, and the fact that it was brought forward by private members is, I think, highly commendable, and will go a long way towards securing that at least this measure, or perhaps a more comprehensive one, will be brought in almost immediately by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be nothing more to be said in connection with this.  I notice that there were twelve members on the Committee: Mr. Dickie, Mr. Eason, Mr. Perry, Mr. Barry, Mr. Morton, Senator Foran, Mr. Irwin, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Mortished, Mr. Cruise, Mr. Aylward and Sir W. de C. Wheeler, not one of whom, I think, in the whole bunch, represents the agricultural industry, which is one of the industries most concerned in this matter.  I would like to ask, if I might, how many of the twelve are concerned in insurance companies.  Perhaps it is too early for the Minister to answer that now.  It seems to me to be the whole policy to drive the employers and the workers of the country into the jaws of the insurance companies.  We know the profits these insurance companies are making out of their business.  I have very little to say with regard to compensation for widows or children of people who have met with death in the course of their employment.  There can be no question at all about the genuineness of such cases, and I have no comment to make on any provision introduced <Col N="815" /> to deal with the families of persons who met with death.  But there is another type of action, and that is the type where people meet with accidents, or pretend to meet with accidents.  There is no use putting a tooth in the fact because there is no Deputy or person outside but knows of cases where the act of disablement is aped.  You are breeding a type of mentality in the country&mdash;an unhealthy and undesirable growth&mdash;which is doing more than anything else to retard and hamper industry.  That is a burden on employers.  The type of growth you are encouraging, and that is growing up, that you cannot shut your eyes to, is doing more to hamper and damn industry than anything else at the present time.  I have known cases of genuine accidents that happened through carelessness. A man gives a month, a year, or three years coming up to Dublin, and finally a bulk sum is given him and the case is settled. Within a month you will see such a man going into his original employment, able to work as well as ever. Before the settlement was made he was scarcely able to move his hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the other type of individual, who meets with an accident every time he gets into employment, who falls flat and faints.  I think this is passed over very lightly from the agricultural point of view.  If a small farmer employs a man who meets with an accident, if he is not insured, it means that he is wiped out.  The payment of £100 or £200 would mean that he would have to sell his stock and place in order to meet the award.  In the case of a large farmer, he would be wiped out also if he had to meet a few of these cases. I think a distinction must be made between the agricultural employee and the industrial employee.  My chief comment is that this is going to create an undesirable mentality, and that that will continue to grow. It is absolutely undesirable that that should be so, and care will have to <Col N="816" /> be taken to deal with cases of that description.  That is my chief complaint and worry in connection with this Bill.  I have nothing at all to say to cases of widows and orphans. I admit that these cases will have to be provided for, but it is the other type of cases I want to guard against.</P>

      <P>The fears expressed by Deputy Gorey, and also by Deputy Ruttledge, always deserve some sympathy, but I do not know that the case is so serious as Deputy Gorey points out, unless Deputy Gorey wants to go root and branch into the whole matter and wipe out all workmen's compensation, because what we are actually discussing now is only the increase. There is a code, and certain increases are being discussed.  The actual moneys that have to be paid by way of insurance against these liabilities are small in amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual amount which the agricultural employer has to pay to insure himself against these risks is very small.  The increase, if any increase will have to be made by reason of the increased compensation that will be paid, if any, will also be small.  I do not think there will be any extra burden. It is to be noted, also, that the Workmen's Compensation Committee talked of rates and talked of an experimental period, and that one member of that Committee signed the Report with the reservation that if the amounts recommended, even for an experimental period, increased the premiums that would have to be met to meet the obligations, or to insure against the falling due of these obligations, he would withdraw his name from the Report.  He signed subject to that reservation.  We have to go through a certain waiting period to see.  One has to take what was said in evidence tendered by the representatives of the insurance companies before the Commission, that in fact rates would not be increased&mdash;or at least they held out <Col N="817" /> the hope that rates would not be increased&mdash;by reason of the changes which were being considered, and which have come into the Report.</P>

      <P>I agree that that is so, but the actual amount of the increase in money that would have to be paid by the employer under these proposals to the insurance companies by reason of claims arising under the new proposals would not be very big in relation to their immense resources, and one would have to scrutinise any changes in the rates of premiums that would be proposed by the companies if this legislation comes in.  For that reason, it is rather a good thing that Deputy Rice took out merely certain sections of the Workmen's Compensation Committee's Report and fitted them into this Bill preliminary to the legislation which has been proposed and which will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rice has a very limited objective in this, and it is quite absurd to complain that this Bill does not deal with this, that, and the other. It is only to deal with one thing&mdash; the amounts payable.  It does not deal with the administrative difficulties that my Department are up against.  Deputy Rice does not attempt to deal with any of these things.  He segregates out only one item&mdash;increased payments&mdash;in the main, but there are certain routine clauses as well.  I have no objection whatever to the terms of this Bill. There are certain sections in it to which minor amendments may be necessary; but Deputy Rice's proposals follow almost entirely the recommendations of the Committee, and I have already stated in this House that legislation is being put together, and that that legislation follows completely, or almost completely, the recommendations of the Workmen's Compensation Committee. Deputy Rice has gone a little bit ahead of me, but I have not any objection to his proposals.  As to the delay, Deputy Cassidy says, in that fluent way in which he always says this particular thing, that the Government <Col N="818" /> have done nothing.  If they were only in a position to start now to get ready legislation, it would be two years before that legislation would be introduced.  As it is, we have done so much&mdash;I would not like to hold out a promise of any earlier introduction of that legislation than the autumn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not a simple matter to get the whole mass of this arranged, bearing in mind the different reactions.  Deputy Cassidy has one type of people in mind, the people who will benefit.  But having that limited objective, he might also find that his sympathies are not properly directed, because if it would have the result that Deputy Gorey believed&mdash;that the insurance companies were going to increase the premiums&mdash;undoubtedly there would be a reaction which Deputy Cassidy would not like.</P>

But I have had now about four years' experience of what people say when they are urging a case and what they do afterwards when they achieve their aim, and the two things do not always coincide.  I do not know whether Deputy Rice wishes to persevere with this Bill or not. As far as time is concerned, I can hold out no hope whatever of bringing in legislation, and I would not bind myself to bring in legislation implementing the report of the Workmen's Compensation Committee earlier than the autumn. It is a matter of the draftsman's office, the particular way in which it is clogged up with other matters at the moment.  There is the fact that there is a financial session <Col N="819" /> ahead for the House: even if we had legislation ready there would be little time for its discussion, and it may be a good thing to have segregated in a Private Member's Bill provisions that relate only to the increased amounts and to get them passed speedily.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ruttledge referred to the difficulties which have arisen from what are called the nonresident workmen and from Saorstát citizens serving on British ships. There again the Report simply included a few paragraphs which set out the difficulties, and wound up by saying that they had noticed that the British Government were giving consideration to the signing of a certain International Labour Report with regard to giving international treatment. They said that they thought that these international agreements provided a way by which mutual arrangements could be made for the giving of international treatment. But the fact of the matter is that we have found that, although other Governments have been disposed to sign International Labour Office agreements, they are not always disposed to follow these up when it comes to their own domestic legislation, and we have not found that that avenue was an easy approach to the Governments concerned for getting reciprocal arrangements made in these matters.  The fact of the matter is that in the cases of the migration of labour from this side to England and to British registered ships that migration is much bigger, even relative to the population, than the migration the other way.  Consequently the benefits that would accrue would accrue almost entirely to us, and it is not easy to convince a Government, where the scales seem to be loaded heavily against them, that this proposal is equitable, and that the only just thing that they could do would be to face up to these extra payments and let our workmen have the benefit of what would be called a mutual arrangement, but which these other Governments say would be an <Col N="820" /> entirely one-sided arrangement.  However, attempts have been made to get certain arrangements put through, but without any great success so far. I do not think that the introduction of legislation would help that situation a bit.  That is outside legislation altogether, and we must simply depend on any arguments that can be brought to bear on other Governments to persuade them that it is the proper thing to do.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Deputy Rice did state in detail how far his proposals were in line either with the legislation now in operation in Great Britain or with the recommendations in the report of the Workmen's Compensation Committee.  As far as my Department is concerned, this Bill is simply taking out the sections in that report dealing with increased payments.  In fact, it is pretty well in line with everything recommended in that report.  I think there is just one small item in respect of the minimum.  The Departmental report talk of fixed allowances. There may be some variations there, but it is only a small thing.  This Bill, if it goes through and becomes an Act, will not interfere with the passage of the more comprehensive legislation to be introduced later on.  That comprehensive legislation may entail some very small amendment of this Bill if it ever becomes an Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain?  The reason for my criticism was this: that this Bill purports to carry out the recommendations of a Committee set up by the Government. Surely it is the duty of a Government that sets up a Committee to follow up the recommendations made by that Committee, and to introduce a Bill dealing with them.</P>

      <P>In spite of Deputy Good's criticism and of his attack, I intend to go on with this Bill.  It has been suggested by Deputy Cassidy that this Bill is not comprehensive enough.  Does the Deputy know the amount of work required to be done in order to prepare a general Bill dealing with the question of workmen's compensation?  That is a matter that the Department must spend many months on and devote a great deal of work to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking, I suggested that the Government should have introduced legislation dealing with this matter instead of leaving it to a private member, because I believe that this Bill only deals with a very small fraction of a very complicated subject.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="822" /> already indicated that his Department is engaged on the preparation of legislation in regard to this matter. If the Deputy only considered the matter for a moment, he would realise that the preparation of a general Bill to consolidate the law relating to workmen's compensation is a work that will engage the staff in the Minister's Department for a very considerable time.  Does the Deputy object to a Bill being introduced to remedy a grievance under which working people are suffering at the present time?</P>

      <P>My Bill aims at this: to prevent these individual cases of hardship happening, as they must happen, while the bigger work of legislation is being prepared by the Minister.  With regard to Deputy Gorey's criticism of the Bill, I am sorry that I confused his name at the moment with that of another Deputy.  I did not intend to say anything that would in any way impute to Deputy Gorey the suggestion that he held any view as to a private member not being entitled to introduce a Bill.  Deputy Gorey approached the matter from the point of view that in regard to claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act there could be shamming. I have looked up the debates that took place when the first Workmen's Compensation Bill was introduced in 1906.  From the social point of view, I do not think that I read in those debates anything so reactionary as Deputy Gorey's speech here to-day on this Bill.  If, for instance, there had been a Workmen's Compensation Bill introduced in 1806 instead of 1906, we might possibly have found in connection with it something similar to the contribution that Deputy Gorey made on this Bill to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter that with your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, I brought up to-day is, to my mind, one of vital importance.  It started in October, 1927, when the representative of Mr. Moore himself came to me and told me that he was in business in Buncrana engaged in the manufacture of shirts and collars. The premises he had, he said, were not suitable, and if it were possible to get a couple of huts that were attached to the naval barracks in Buncrana, not alone, he said, would he extend his business in the manufacture of shirts and collars, but he would also engage in the manufacture of boiler suits, pyjamas and dungarees.  The making of boiler suits and of dungarees meant practically the creation of a new industry. I think it is the pioneer industry of the kind in the Free State. It was new in that area, at all events.  After a long space of time, during which a great deal of correspondence passed between the departments concerned and Mr. Moore in regard to these premises, a provisional lease was granted to Messrs. Moore and Co. for two huts, covering a period of five years, at an annual rent of £55.  Statutory sanction <Col N="824" /> would have to be applied for, and on 1st October, 1928, the Board of Works communicated with Messrs. Moore, and said: &ldquo;We are making application for the necessary statutory sanction for making a letting to you of these premises.&rdquo;  They specified that under the proposed lease: &ldquo;You will be required to have the site completely walled off or fenced off from the rest of the camp to our satisfaction, and provide a suitable direct entrance to the site from the adjoining public road, to maintain the buildings and any fresh erections in good condition, and so yield up at the end of the term, and to insure the premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They said, of course, that statutory sanction would have to be granted, and they allowed Messrs. Moore in at their own risk, getting from Messrs. Moore a half-year's rent, £22 10s. 0d., assuring them that statutory permission for the granting of the lease was being applied for.  That is as much as to say that everything would be all right.  In good faith Messrs. Moore went into the place, gave up their own premises, installed machinery, and carried out all the repairs to the huts.  When they took over occupation they got the necessary machinery installed.  They have upwards of thirty girls employed there, and in addition Messrs. Moore gave work out to the surrounding districts, that is, the making up of shirts and so on, which provides very necessary employment for the people in the district, which is a poor, congested area. It is most necessary some employment should be given.  The Minister comes along now after all that lapse of time, and because of the intervention of some mysterious Mr. X., although this has lain on the Table of the House for twenty-one days and this is the last day, he suddenly makes up his mind that Messrs. Moore have to vacate.  He finds out that somebody might give a little more than Messrs. Moore.  The Minister then gets this letter sent to Messrs. Moore:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We beg to acquaint you that the letting of portion of these premises which was provisionally <Col N="825" /> arranged with you, subject to the terms of the State Lands Act of 1924, cannot be proceeded with.  It is, therefore, necessary for us to call on you to vacate the premises forthwith, in accordance with our letter of the 22nd December, 1928. Please inform us of the date and hour on which you will give possession to our representative, who will hand over a payable order for the sum of £22 10s., being the refund of the amount lodged by you for use and occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A nice, polite letter that.  They have put up huts and railed the place off from the rest of the camp, and made a road to the main thoroughfare.  The same mysterious Mr. X. I have mentioned would have paid more had he known the place was to be let.  The place was not to be let.  The mysterious Mr. X. whispers to the Minister that if he had been informed about this perhaps he would have paid more than Messrs. Moore.  Messrs. Moore have, as I have said, girls employed there already, and they will lose their employment if this polite letter of the Minister takes effect.  That is what it means, as there are no other suitable premises in the town.  It means that those thirty girls and the outdoor workers employed by Messrs. Moore will be thrown out on the roadside.  If the President were here he would tell us they can go and see their friends in America.  I want to know from the Minister definitely whether any mysterious Mr. X. from Buncrana or elsewhere is going to dictate the policy of this Government. I had experience a short time ago of the same mysterious Mr. X., who whispered to the Minister what he wanted him to do.  The mysterious Mr. X. is not mysterious to me, for I know him.  In Buncrana he boasted of the fact that he would have Messrs. Moore put out.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say about it?  At this stage the Minister has had whippings enough which should have taught him a lesson.  I am going to teach him one now.  At this stage of the country's history, when we are all prating about our country turning the corner, and <Col N="826" /> about the upper curves in the prosperity of the people, when a firm sets up to employ a number of girls in their factory and others in their own homes, in a portion of Donegal, in a poverty-stricken area, that can hardly support half its present population, and when certain regulations are laid down and complied with, the Minister comes along, and he wants the people who are giving employment to clear out.  He wants to break the firm that gives that employment, a successful firm; a firm that, instead of standing still, is progressing all the time and giving increased employment.  The Minister wants to break that firm and to throw their employees out on the roadside.  What are the thirty girls employed in the factory and the people who make the shirts in their own homes going to do if their means of livelihood is taken from them?  The Minister suddenly discovers, after a lapse of eighteen months, that he made a mistake.  Is it possible the infallible Minister can make a mistake?  Eighteen months elapsed since this matter was first mooted, and the Minister discovers after eighteen months that he should have advertised the place.  There is nothing to compel the Minister to advertise it.  His little tender conscience starts to prick him now.  He suddenly assumes all the virtues, and he does not want to do anything underhand.  He wants the place advertised broadcast, and Messrs. Moore would still get the opportunity of tendering.</P>
    <P>Is it possible the Minister made a mistake when he allowed this matter to proceed so far, and allowed those people to burn their boats, and allowed them to take occupation of the premises, allowed them to employ these people, all because he made a mistake, and he wants to remedy his mistake at the expense of the workpeople there by throwing them out on the roadside to die of starvation?  That is what it means, but if the Minister thinks that his mistakes are going to be covered up in this matter, he is making the biggest mistake he ever made in all his lifetime, and your mysterious <Col N="827" /> Mr. X. is making the error of his lifetime.  If the Minister listens to what this Mr. X. wants him to do all the time, he is not going to be a Minister very long.  I can foresee that, and only the mysterious Mr. X. is a sort of a fixed star, he would have been shifted, too, out of the position he occupies; but, unfortunately, he cannot be, for he is as far away as Mars.  He is in the Seanad.  Are we going now to allow, as the Minister proposes, to have those people who are in employment in this factory, thrown out because the Minister wants to remedy his mistake by sending a little letter to Messrs. Moore, ordering them to remove all their machinery out of the factory?  We want a direct answer from the Minister, and I hope we are going to have it from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say at the outset that I did not know this matter was coming up for discussion on the adjournment.  I think it is needless for me to point out that I would be only too delighted to see additional factories in Buncrana or elsewhere in Donegal, so that more employment would be given to the workers there at proper rates of wages, and not the sweated rates of wages that some of the Buncrana employers were recently giving.  What I do object to in the whole transaction is the underhand method adopted.  Before there was any letting of these buildings it should have been advertised in the newspaper circulating in the locality, namely, the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  The Minister, in order to satisfy a personal grievance which he imagines he has against the editor of the &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; is using public moneys for his own Party purposes, and he holds back advertisements from that particular newspaper.  I object to this place being let without an advertisement being issued in the &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; the newspaper which circulates in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand a promise was made some considerable time ago to a firm in the same line as Messrs. Moore and Co., a reputable firm, prepared <Col N="828" /> to pay Trade Board rates of wages to workers in the shirt industry, that when these huts became vacant they would be advertised in the ordinary way.  It appears that has not been done.  I understand that, at the instigation of the gentleman referred to by Deputy Carney as Mr. X., the matter was to have been raised by Senator Milroy in the Seanad a few days ago; but apparently that was not considered desirable.  I suggest that any Government property of this sort that is to be let should not have so much secrecy attached to it. As far as Donegal is concerned, there has been far too much underhand work and too much secrecy in regard to many things.</P>

All the other local manufacturers should have been given a chance to compete as well as Messrs. Moore &amp; Co.  I think Deputy Carney's speech on this occasion is rather a storm in a teacup.  Deputy Carney, as far as I understand&mdash;I am open to correction&mdash;negotiated with the Board of Works to get portion of the Army <Col N="829" /> huts for a Six-County manufacturer, without any notice being given to the local manufacturers, or, to put it clearly, behind the backs of the local manufacturers in Buncrana he went to the Board of Works and negotiated for portion of the Army huts for Messrs. Moore.  I do not object to Messrs. Moore getting some of the Army huts, because my opinion is that the more industry of the sort introduced into the district the better; but, at the same time, the other local manufacturers who had to provide premises out of their own capital for shirt manufacture had a perfect right, being ratepayers and employers of labour within the area, to be notified that these Army huts were to be let for shirt manufacturing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained this morning that the usual practice with premises we have to let is to advertise them.  In some cases advertisements have not been issued because the premises concerned were <Col N="830" /> long vacant.  It has been taken for granted that anybody who might have wanted them would have applied. In the case of premises long vacant, if a genuine applicant came along it might only prevent the letting to insist on an advertisement.</P>
      <P>This was a different case, and when the matter came before me personally recently I was satisfied that it was a case in which no letting should have been made without advertisement. The premises were not vacant.  It is even alleged, and I believe it is true, that other local manufacturers desired to make a bid for these premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where it is intended to let premises, the general practice heretofore has been to allow the tenant in before the proposal has been laid on the Table of the Oireachtas, and before it was possible to make the lease, so that they might make preparation for getting to work when the lease was completed. The intention of that was, that any surveys or estimations that had to be done could be done, and the builders and architects and others could see the place, and as little delay as possible should take place.  Allowing people into occupation before the lease was made did not mean that they should assume that they were sure of getting the lease, and that they could get to work as if they had it already.  Messrs. Moore were distinctly warned of the conditions under which they were entering the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22nd December the Board of Works wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;We enclose draft of a lease to you of the site and two huts in this barrack together with the plans.  If you kindly return the documents duly approved, we can arrange for our local officer to allow you into occupation of the premises, provided that you are prepared to take the risk of the statutory sanction for any reasons being withheld, in which event we would be obliged to call on you to vacate.&rdquo;  Again on the 6th January there was <Col N="831" /> further correspondence between the Board of Works and Messrs. Moore, with regard to fencing off this particular part of the site.  The Board of Works wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;With reference to previous correspondence regarding your application for a lease, in order to avoid delay later we suggest that you should now submit for our approval particulars of the wall or unclimbable railing which you propose to erect in order to cut off the site proposed to be leased from the rest of the barracks.  It would, of course, be imprudent for you to incur any expenditure on the premises at the moment, seeing that it was intimated in our letter of 22nd December, that you are allowed into occupation subject to your taking the risk that the necessary statutory sanction may be withheld, in which case you will be required to vacate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were twice specifically warned that they were not to count on the lease, and it was specifically told them that it would be imprudent for them to incur any expenditure. If they have gone ahead and incurred expenditure, they must take the consequences, and I am perfectly satisfied, on examining this case, that it would be entirely wrong to proceed to give a lease of these premises when other possible and, as I understand, probable applicants had had no opportunity of competing for the premises.</P>

By going to various Departments and representing <Col N="832" /> that they were going to start a new industry and give employment, they got the various Departments to write to the Board of Works recommending the granting of the lease.

      <P>Would the Minister say is it not a fact that some considerable time ago the Board of Works made a promise to a firm in Buncrana that when these huts became vacant that firm would be notified by advertisement or otherwise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of Works say they did not make that promise. I am disposed to believe that some sort of a promise, such as Deputy Cassidy has mentioned, was made by the local officer of the Board of Works, but I am not sure of that, but that is one of the factors which seem to make it impossible to proceed with the letting to Messrs. Moore without advertising.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand now from the Minister that on account of that error Messrs. Moore are now to be called on to vacate the premises?  Is the Minister proceeding with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <P>Certainly: Messrs. Moore were warned.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the debate, will the Minister see that in future as far as possible before leases of all land and premises of this kind belonging to the State are given that the premises will be advertised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this case is a proof that no exception should be made to the general rule to advertise before any letting arrangements are entered into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial annual cost of increasing to £70 a year the pensions of retired teachers whose pensions are at present below that figure, would be slightly over £21,000.</P>
