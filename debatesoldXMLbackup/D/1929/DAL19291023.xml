      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. I understand that the Tariff Commissioners are now actively engaged in the consideration of this application, and that they have recently visited a number of factories. The Commissioners propose at an early date to hold a final public sitting to enable the applicants to reply to the evidence already given, in opposition to the application.  It is not at present possible to give any indication as to when the report of the Commissioners will be issued.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if Mr. William Rowe, Dublin, was arrested at 7 a.m. on October 3rd, released at 11 a.m., rearrested at 11.30 a.m., and again released at 3 p.m., and further, if at 7 p.m. on the same evening Mr. Rowe was followed through Thomas St. and Meath St., Dublin, by two members of the Detective Division, who, without warning, fired several shots at him with revolvers, and, if so, to state whether such members of the Gárda Síochána acted under orders and for what purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that William Rowe was arrested twice on the 3rd instant, but it is not true to say that on the evening of that day shots were fired at him without warning.  Rowe's movements were being watched by the police, and he was twice called upon to halt.  He did not halt, and two shots were then fired in the air by the detectives who were pursuing him.  Rowe is a member of a gang who have been responsible for many serious outrages, and it is essential to watch his movements to prevent the perpetration of further outrages.  Information continually comes to hand concerning Mr. Rowe's criminal tendencies, and the events of the 3rd instant in which he figured arose out of the police surveillance to which it has been found necessary to subject him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform us on what charge Mr. Rowe was arrested twice on October 3rd, and why was it considered necessary to arrest him the third time on that day, and to fire shots at him, in order to effect his arrest?  Does the Minister think it necessary in the interests of justice that a man whom the police had in custody on two occasions on one day and released, should be subjected to this fusillade in order, to effect his arrest for the third time?  Will the Minister inform us of the criminal activities with which Mr. Rowe has been charged, and will he say if there is information in his Department concerning the criminal activities, of Mr. Rowe why he has not been placed on trial and given an opportunity of answering the various allegations preferred against him by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Rowe is a well-known and prominent member of an organisation which has for its object the upsetting of established order in this country by force.  Mr. Rowe is a person whose movements it is necessary, in the interests of peace and order in this country, should be very carefully watched. The fact that Mr. Rowe was arrested <Col N="4" /> once in a day is no reason why he should not be arrested a second time, considering that the fact that he might have incriminating documents upon him is more likely after being arrested once than if he had not been arrested at all on that date.  What the Deputy calls a &ldquo;fusillade&rdquo; was, as a matter of fact, two shots fired. I do not think that shots should be fired by Gárdaí arresting persons except for very strong reasons, and I have issued instructions to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Rowe has published a statement to the effect that shots were fired by the Gárdaí without any warning whatever, and that he (Mr. Rowe) can identify the members of the police force who fired them?  If the Minister is aware of that, will he say if Mr. Rowe was interviewed by any representative of the Minister's Department for the purpose of getting, a verification of that statement, or for the purpose of getting information which would enable the. Minister to take steps to inquire as to whether the statement was correct or not?</P>

      <P>Personally, I am not aware that Mr. Rowe made any such public statement except what was contained in the Deputy's question.  I am satisfied, from the account given, that the shots were fired for the purpose of stopping Rowe when he was running away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>By the &ldquo;Blake Millions&rdquo; the Deputy no doubt means the property of Mrs. <Col N="5" /> Helen Blake, who died, at her residence in London on 23rd September, 1876, a widow, intestate, leaving no known next-of-kin, and leaving property valued at upwards of £100,000 (one hundred thousand pounds). This lady was a domiciled Englishwoman, and her property was administered by the Treasury Solicitor in England under the direction of the High Court there.  The usual advertisements were, I understand, issued, but no next-of-kin appeared, and the Crown was declared entitled to the personal estate of the deceased under the provisions of the Statute 39 &amp; 40 Vic., cap. 18.  The real estate escheated to the Crown likewise.  I do not see any grounds upon which the claim suggested by the Deputy's question could be supported, and consequently no representations of the character he indicates have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the property was in Ireland.  It consisted of real estate and personal estate in England.  Even if there were any personal estate in Ireland it would follow the law of the lady's domicile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, because of the licensing regulations, there is a total closing <Col N="6" /> of business premises on St. Patrick's Day and it is very difficult to carry on a fair on that day?  Is he aware also that there is a strong body of opinion in favour of such legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be living in the clouds.  He may be aware that the question of the licensing regulations as affecting St. Patrick's Day has been very recently considered by a Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not get over the difficulty that I have pointed out.  Even if legislation, in the direction the Minister has indicated comes into effect, it will only apply to bonafide travellers.  I want to indicate to the Minister that in certain parts of the country there are fairs held on St. Patrick's Day and also markets and under the present regulations there is a total closing of fully 90 per cent. of the business houses and that would still be the case even under the proposed change in the licensing regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-opening of the Killenien School, which ceased operation owing to the action of local parties in preventing a duly qualified teacher appointed by the Manager from entering on duty, rests with the Manager, who, under Rule 40 (d) of the Code for National Schools, is charged with the direct government of the school and the appointment of the members of the teaching staff. I am supplying the Deputy with a <Col N="7" /> copy of the Rule to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>Following is the Rule:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Rule 40 (d):&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state when the new scheme of technical and continuation education will be introduced, and whether he is prepared to consider the advisability of restoring, in the interim, (a) the bonus to part-time teachers under the Technical, Instruction Committees, and (b) the capitation grants for night-schools; and whether the Minister is aware that many so-called part-time teachers unders the Technical Instruction Committees are solely dependent on the remuneration received for such part-time teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amending legislation will be necessary before the new Scheme of Technical and Continuation Education can be brought into operation.  A Bill for this purpose is at present, actually being drafted by the Parliamentary draftsman, and I hope that it will be introduced before the Christmas recess.  I am, therefore, not yet in a position to name the date on which <Col N="8" /> arrangements will be completed for the introduction of a system of continuation education.  The reference in the question to the restoration of the part-time teachers' bonus suggests that the remuneration of these teachers has been altered or reduced. This is not the case.  Committees employing part-time teachers have permission to continue the payment to these teachers of bonus or temporary additional remuneration on the same lines as hitherto, but the amount of these payments no longer is refunded to the Committees by my Department.  As regards grants to night schools, I explained the position fully in the Dáil on the 27th February last, and I cannot reconsider the decision then announced.</P>

      <P>According to the information furnished to my Department by the Saorstát woollen manufacturers the number of workers employed in the woollen industry (excluding blanket making) in September, 1928, was 1,409. The corresponding figure in respect of September, 1929, was 1,795.  The amount of employment in September, 1928, may be regarded as normal for the period before the imposition of the tariff, so that 386 may be taken as representing approximately the increased employment in the industry since the tariff was adopted in February, 1929.  I am not furnished with sufficient details to enable me to indicate the additional number of workers employed in each class, that is, spinners, carders, weavers, etc. The following are the numbers of workers employed on blanket making at the periods indicated:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (a) whether he is aware that the reorganisation of the hand-spun industry in Co. Donegal is, being seriously retarded by the prolonged and unnecessary delay on the part of his Department in supplying a stamp; and (b) what decision has been reached in regard to supplying breaking and carding machines and dyeing baths to the Ardara district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the reorganisation of the home-spun industry is being retarded for the <Col N="18" /> reason stated at (a).  The mark of guarantee to which it is assumed the reference is made is applied by means of transfers, and any person desiring to have pieces of cloth so marked should apply to the Mart at Ardara or to my Department.  The decision already taken that financial pssistancc cannot be given for the setting up of breaking and carding machines and dyeing baths at Ardara has not been altered.  Great difficulty is being experienced by the Department in finding spinners in that area and it would appear highly unlikely that home-spun in sufficient quantities to justify the installation of the plant suggested can be made in the district for some considerable time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as far back as July 14, 1926, the Gaeltacht Commission recommended that a stamp should be supplied for tweed of a particular quality? Furthermore, is he aware that the industry is being seriously retarded owing to the fact that a stamp has not been supplied?  Is he aware that cloth spun in Galashiels is being sent into the Dublin and other markets as home-spun material?  Is he aware, in regard to (b), that in a letter to a Deputy written in April, 1929, he stated that the question of the provision at Ardara of carding and dyeing plant has not been lost sight of?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back to the stamp.  How exactly can the lack of a stamp retard the development of home-spun there?  In fact, no application has been received by the Department from anybody in Ardara having cloth desiring to have a stamp put on it.  The only cloth being produced at present is under the auspices of the Department itself, and the persons to whom we sell know what the stuff is without the stamp.  The test as to whether or not the industry is being retarded for want of a stamp is the fact that we have had no application for it. Before the stamp could be applied, the stuff would have to be examined to see if it wore stuff that the brand could lie applied to.  In connection <Col N="19" /> with the carding and dyeing plant, the Deputy goes back very far.  It was then under consideration, but it is well over twelve months since I stated that I was not prepared to recommend the installation of carding and dyeing plants</P>

If Deputies make up their minds in the meanwhile that they would not take the Second Stage on Friday, it can be postponed, but I think Deputies might be able to agree that the Second Stage should be taken on Friday and that the Committee Stage might be postponed, if it was desirable.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to regulate the export of fresh meat from this country.  In 1925 the British Ministry of Agriculture made an order, after legislation previously passed, prohibiting the import of fresh meat from countries on the Continent. <Col N="31" /> This prohibition mainly applied to pork, and as a result there was a very big increase in the export of fresh meat from this country.  I have here before me figures showing the export of fresh beef, veal and mutton, and lamb and pork between the years 1925 and 1928.  We exported 3,250 cwts. of fresh beef and veal in 1925.  In 1928 we exported 85,815 cwts. of fresh beef and veal. That 85,815 cwts. is a very illusory figure if applied to this year.  To some extent the big increase is due to the re-opening of the Drogheda factory.  That is now closed again, and the comparable figures would be something like 40,000 cwts., so that really the increase would be from 3,250 cwts. to 40,000 cwts.  In regard to mutton and lamb, we exported in 1925 344 cwts.  In 1928, 20,812 cwts., or practically 21,000 cwts.  In 1925 our pork export was 4,165 cwts., and our export in 1928 was 168,725 cwts.  All that was due very largely to this order made by the British Minister prohibiting the import into Great Britain of fresh meat from countries like Holland and France.  That gave a great chance to the Irish exporters, especially to the exporters of pork, and to a great extent the farmers and other exporters took that chance, but, unfortunately, the organisation to deal with that grew up very quickly, and I can only describe it as imperfect. People got into the business quickly without the technical skill and, equipment, and the result was that at the present moment there are in the country a very large number of slaughter-houses manned by people who are lacking in technical skill, and as a result you have meat, occasionally a poor quality and very often very badly packed and handled, going to England.  For the last three years we have received representations from the British Ministry of Agriculture in regard to the export, especially of beef and to some extent pork, from this country, and particularly from certain districts of the country which for the purposes of this debate I shall not mention. The British Ministry pointed out it <Col N="32" /> would be quite open to them to-apply the regulations to our meat exports that apply to foreign fresh meat coming into their country.  Deputies opposite will be glad to know that from that point of view we are a foreign country, and the legal position is that the British are entitled to apply to us the regulations that apply to foreign meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But at our suggestion they have decided not to treat us as a foreign country up to the present. In any communication I have had with the British Ministers, and I have had some, I stated that it was our object, as soon as possible, to introduce and pass legislation which would enable us to do here what they could do on the other side if they wished to do it.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  When dealing with fresh meat, especially pork, it is of primary importance to the country that it should reach the market as quickly as possible, not only from the point of view of quality, but of getting an early market.  If the regulations that apply to all other fresh meat were applied on the other side to meat exported from this country they would be applied at Holyhead or Fishguard, and that would certainly ruin the pork trade. We propose to apply these regulations here.  We propose to see to it that the pork; and beef, mutton and lamb, but especially the pork, will be such as to be at least a credit to the reputation of the Saorstát for agricultural export.  There is one point specifically dealt with in the Bill here. The commonest disease from which fresh meat suffers is tuberculosis. There is, of course, swine erysipelas and other diseases, but none so important as this.  Tuberculosis is the main disease we are trying to deal with.  It was the habit in the past to cut out tubercular lesions from the pork prepared for export, and to export the balance.  The British Ministry drew our attention to this, and pointed out it was extremely difficult for the officers of their local authorities to decide whether, in fact, <Col N="33" /> beef or pork going over with these glands obviously taken away was, or was not, tuberculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with that specially in this Bill.  We propose to introduce regulations under which no pork from which any glands have been removed shall be exported to England.  I have no doubt, as a result of this Bill, that not only will we consolidate our present position, but that there will be an improvement in the reputation of Irish fresh meat in the British market and, hence, an improvement on present prices.  The Bill though long is simple.  Under it all slaughtering premises must be registered.  A register will be kept by the Minister. There will be a register for beef and veal and their offals, for mutton and lamb and their offals, and for pork and the pig offals.  We are dealing in the Bill, I suppose out of extreme caution, with horses.  There is no slaughter of horses at the moment, but possibly a trade might develop in old horses, and we also deal with goats arid rabbits, in which there is a slight trade.  The Bill mainly deals with beef, pork and mutton. Slaughter-houses must be registered, and the proprietors of such houses must be licensed.  A separate register will be kept for beef slaughter-houses, for mutton slaughter-houses and for pork slaughter-houses.  There is a provision under which premises must be registered in the case of proprietors who let their slaughter-houses as, for instance, in the case of the Dublin Corporation.  There will be another register under which lessees of these premises must be registered as licensed holders.  It is a common thing for public bodies and private individuals to let their premises to butchers and others for the purpose of slaughtering animals. We will also have a register of registered premises and registered licensed holders of premises whether they slaughter cattle, sheep or pigs. Before registering minimum condtions in regard to cleanliness and equipment will be enforced by the Department in regard to each premises.  There will be general requirements in regard to cleanliness <Col N="34" /> and equipment.  There may be other requirements as to the slaughtering of beef, pork and mutton.</P>
    <P>Every licensed holder and registered owner must pay a sum of £1. Every animal slaughtered must be examined before and after death by a veterinary surgeon and must be certified by a veterinary surgeon. Every animal leaving the country in the shape of a carcase or dead meat must be examined by a veterinary surgeon.  We provide in the schedule a system of fees, namely, 1/- for beef, 3d. for pigs, and 1½d. for sheep and goats.  The cost of administering the Bill is estimated at £19,000 and we estimate that we will receive in fees about £16,000.  We think that the taxpayer will get good value for the difference.  There are at present about 106 exporters of these products and there are about 76 premises.  As I indicated in my opening statement, these premises are far from satisfactory and only a small proportion of them could be regarded, after this Bill has become an Act, as being sufficiently equipped for their purpose.  About one-third are entirely unfit for the purposes for which they are used. The balance can be fairly readily made fit for these purposes.  It is proposed to bring the Bill into operation by stages.  It may be brought into operation for, beef and offals at one date and for pork at another date.  I beg to move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, this is a Bill to help the export industry of fresh meat from this country.  Whether it is advisable that we should legislate, apart from the trade point of view, for sending cleaner food to the foreigner and not pay the same attention to our own people is in fact hardly debatable.  No one can deny that we should be more careful about our own people than about the foreigner.  Up to this point, as the Minister has stated, we have succeeded in passing some diseased meat to England hut in future it appears that we will have to eat it <Col N="35" /> ourselves.  Leaving out the public health point of view and looking at it from the trade standpoint, I am not sure that the Bill is going to improve the fresh meat industry.  It is stated in the Bill that meat factories will have to pay a certain fee for each animal that is slaughtered for export and the Minister stated that the estimated amount of fees to be collected in a year is about £16,000. That is going to put a very serious drain on an industry which is doing very badly at present.</P>
      <P>There are at present two ways of disposing of surplus animals: one, that they be exported alive, and the other that they be killed and exported as dead meat.  The advantages appear to be all in favour of the man who exports live animals. This will be a further burden on the dead meat industry.  A man exporting dead meat will have to pay a fee which looks very small when counted per head, and an ordinary person would say that if meat factories pay £23 or £24 for a beast it will not be much of an impost on them to have to pay in future £23 1s. 0d. or £24 1s. 0d.  There is, however, more than that in it.  This regulation about having diseased meat condemned is going to make it more difficult for the factories to carry on because anyone with a knowledge of the inspection of meat will realise that it is much easier to detect disease post-mortem, than ante-mortem, so that the exporter of live stock for shipment will be able to take risks which a dead meat exporter cannot take. According to an Act recently passed, if an exporter of live stock happens to export diseased animals he is compensated more or less through a scheme enacted here some time ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing in it at least.  On the other hand, the factory, knowing that it must be more particular about the animals it is buying, will have to buy them at the <Col N="36" /> farmer's risk and tell the farmer that if a beast is condemned he will not be paid for it, or else the factory will have to buy at its own risk.  In either case the Bill will make it more difficult for factories to compete with buyers of live stock for export. In addition to that, we have learned recently that meat factories in England which slaughter live animals exported from here have not to pay the same taxes as our factories, so that, taking everything into account, the factories here will be at a serious disadvantage as a result of the Bill.  It may be, as the Minister stated, that after some time the quality of exported meat will be improved and that after a few years our factories will get better prices for exported meat; but for the next few years I do not know whether they will be able to survive the burdens placed upon them, as some of them are finding it very difficult to survive even as things are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing running through this Bill, and it has run through most of the Bills that have come before us for some time past. I refer to the giving of powers to the Minister to make regulations which are unreasonable.  This is a Bill under which we would expect that the Minister would have power to make certain regulations, but if officials of the Minister's Department had their minds made up that this Bill was really required, there are certain matters upon which they should have come to a decision.  If we take Sections 24, 26, 27 and 28, they deal with the kernel of the subject. Section 24 deals with the preparation of the meat for export.  Surely the Department should be in a position to state in this Bill what they want in regard to the preparation of meat for export.  They should be able to state in Section 26 in what condition they wanted the meat before export.  In the next section they should state how they want it packed, and again, how they want it conveyed.  These four sections are put there merely to give the Minister power to make regulations on these matters, matters upon which the Department <Col N="37" /> should have their minds made up.  If they had not their minds made up they should have waited a little longer and then come before us and tell us what they wanted.</P>
    <P>The factories will not know where they arc exactly under certain clauses of the Bill.  For instance, one factory put the point to me that a veterinary surgeon in one place may not be nearly as strict as a veterinary surgeon in another, and if the owners of a factory think that the veterinary surgeon is far too exacting, in their particular factory, there should be some means of appealing against the decision of that particular veterinary surgeon.  At present there is no way out left to the factories. They will have to put up with whatever decision the veterinary surgeon comes to and have the particular carcase destroyed.  The Minister, under this Bill, can also refuse to register any particular premises he wishes, and there is no appeal.  Again, having registered a premises he may revoke that licence on a later date, and there is no appeal against it.</P>
    <P>There are matters in the Bill which require a good deal of elucidation before we know exactly what the Bill is going to lead us into.  For instance the Wexford Bacon Factory exports a certain amount of porkers, beef, and mutton.  In addition to that they kill a large number of pigs for bacon, but the viscera of these pigs are exported and the bacon kept for home consumption.  The pigs killed for home consumption would not come under the Bill, but the viscera exported would.  If they are charged 3d. for the viscera of each pig exported, when the viscera is only worth a few shillings, it means that they will have to stop that particular trade.  They find that there is no market for the viscera in this country and the result will be that they will have to lose three or four shillings per pig, which is an enormous loss to any factory in this country.  There is no provision for dealing with cases such as that so far as I can see in the Bill.  I do not know if there is any provision for <Col N="38" /> dealing with a bacon factory such as we have in Wexford, where a certain number of animals are killed for home consumption and a certain number for export, or whether such a factory will be allowed to mark off a certain number for home consumption, or whether they will have to. pay fees for all animals killed, although all are not being killed for export.  There is no mention of what is to be done with condemned carcases. There is no mention of sterilisation such as is done in this country with carcases which are only affected to a certain extent and which can be safely used for home consumption after sterilisation. There is no mention of anything of that kind, or whether the carcases will have to be totally destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said that it was simple enough. I do not know if it is really so simple. For instance.  Section 4 of the Schedule occupies a considerable amount of space.  Having read it again and again, I came to the conclusion that what is meant is that a factory will have to pay a minimum of £75 per year.  That is the best I can make out of it.  That could be stated in a line instead of in a page, if that is all that is provided.  The minimum fee is £75.  In the case of a small factory such as Wexford, they kill a certain number of beef, mutton and porkers.  Does the Bill mean that they will have to pay a minimum of £75 for each of the items, or does that £75 cover the whole three? If it means that they have to pay £75 for each item it is going to be a very serious burden on the factories. It is a small factory and exported last year only 1,500 porkers, some beef and some mutton.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister will be empowered to cancel the registration of any factory which is not exporting more than 3,000 porkers per year.  I do not know why that number should be put in.  This factory is situated in a town where there is much need of employment.  Last year.  I am informed, it paid £5,800 in salaries and wages.  If this provision was enforced, to cancel registration <Col N="39" /> unless they export at least 3,000 porkers, it means that they will be in a worse position than they are at present.  A few more regulations of that sort may mean the closing of the factory.  If the Bill also means that the factory will have to pay £75 each for beef, mutton and porkers, it will mean a very serious burden on them.  Further, if the Bill means that the factory must pay 3d. for the viscera of each pig killed, all these things put together may mean the closing down of the factory.  I would like to have this point explained by the Minister in his reply. I visited that particular factory a few months ago, and the manager showed me how he was saving every single part of the animal to try to make ends meet.  He told me that he went so far as to collect the hair and the bristles of each pig to sell them at the end of the year, and the profit that was realised from that was one farthing per pig.  If they think it worth while in a factory like that to go to all that trouble to try to make one extra farthing on the pigs slaughtered, it is certainly not going to be a trivial matter for them to have to pay 3d. per pig under this Bill.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is perhaps going on the right lines, that is, to try and get clean food both for export and for home consumption &mdash; we hope that the home consumption part will follow before long &mdash; I would not like to oppose it on Second Reading.  But, unless the Bill is very drastically amended in Committee, I certainly would be inclined to vote against it when it comes out of Committee. The proposal in the Bill asking the factories, and particularly the small factories &mdash; of course we must make the same rule for all &mdash; to pay those fees, is going to retard the fresh meat industry.  During the first three or four years, until those factories begin to realise the benefits of legislation in the way of getting better prices for their meat on the foreign markets I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this matter in the light of recommending <Col N="40" /> that the expenses under the Bill be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Personally, what I would like to see is that the exporters of live stock be made pay for this scheme.  I realise that you cannot make them pay, because naturally they will make the farmer from whom they buy live stock pay.  If you ask the Government to pay, they will make the farmer pay, but still I feel that you would have a more equitable distribution if the money were taken from the Exchequer rather than from the buyers of live stock or the factories themselves.  These meat factories not only give the amount of employment that I have already mentioned, but the small factories are also very useful in promoting subsidiary industries. We have almost lost some of these subsidiary industries.  Such of them as we have we would like to see worked up.  There is the tanning industry, for instance. There is no hope of working up the tanning industry, or any of these subsidiary industries that we still have in the country, if we are to lose the few meat factories that we have. Therefore, I think that we ought to try to save them.  It is not going to be a very serious thing for the Exchequer if it has to bear the cost of inspection in those cases.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture should ask the Minister for Finance, or whatever Minister is responsible, that that should be done.</P>
    <P>I should also like if the Minister would be more specific, when we come to deal with the Bill in Committee, with regard to certain provisions in it.  I hope that he will agree to amend the Bill in Committee and make certain provisions in it more specific than they are at present. Every Deputy in the House would like to see groups of farmers all over the country starting this meat industry. They have already done it in a few places, but I am afraid they have not done too well.  I am afraid that if the Bill goes through as it is it will discourage farmers in other places from going into the industry. Surely groups of farmers throughout the country could not be <Col N="41" /> expected to risk their capital in such an insecure industry as this particularly if the Minister is to take power to cancel the registration if he wishes, or to make regulations about the transit of their meat and so on. That will be a hardship on these men, and no one could expect any group of farmers, either co-operatively or otherwise, to start out on this industry unless the provisions in the Bill are made more specific. These groups of farmers should know exactly what they will be up against before they start the industry.</P>
    <P>Then there is a provision in the Bill that contains what I might call a threat.  It proposes to give power to the Minister to cancel a licence unless 3,000 porkers are slaughtered. There is that threat in the Bill that unless they keep up the number to or over the 3,000 mark, their licence will be cancelled.  What is going to be the effect of that?  If, say, a small factory is doing 1,500 or 2,000 porkers, and that those concerned in it are afraid that the Minister is going to use his powers under this particular section, they will have to go out and compete perhaps uneconomically in order to bring the number over the 3,000 mark and in order to hold their licence.  That, I suggest, is not fair to the small factories which are trying to live against the big factories.  I believe that we certainly should not agree to this Bill unless we are assured that we are going to have legislation in the near future &mdash; I believe it is not the Minister for Agriculture but another Minister will be responsible for this &mdash; in regard to food for home consumption. At the present moment there is a small amount of beef and mutton coming into this country from abroad.  There is no doubt that if the people here begin to realise that all our good meat&mdash;I should say not all our good meat but nothing but good meat &mdash; is going out of the country to England and to other countries, and that the meat left here for home consumption is not as good, they probably will begin to say that it would be safer for them to buy the foreign meat than <Col N="42" /> to take the stuff killed at home. Therefore, I think that we should be more particular, both from the point of view of the trade at home as well as from the public health point of view, about the food that is given to our own people.  There is another point that I wish to refer to.  It is as to what we have been told about the simplicity of this Bill.  Why should any official, except through some particular form of laziness or something of the sort, or why should we by legislation, say that the first six months of the year shall be from the 1st July to the end of December, instead of saying that they shall be from the 1st of January to the end of June?  Why should it be necessary to pass a law saying that?  Why not, leave it the 1st January to the end of June?</P>

      <P>This Bill has twofold object: first, the killing of fresh meat for export, and secondly, an enlargement of the paradise which at present exists for veterinary inspectors. I think we will soon come to the day when there will be a veterinary inspector appointed for each farmer, to be paid, of course, out of the farmer's supposed profits. This Bill provides, in the first place, for the payment of a minimum sum of £225 in the case of each exporter of cattle, sheer and pigs.  That is to say, a small exporter exporting cattle, sheep and pips will have to pay a licence duty of £225 &mdash; that is, three sums of £75.  I would like to know from the Minister if I am correct in that.</P>

      <P>I cannot sec any other way out of it.  It is necessary to export 1,500 head of cattle, 6,000 pigs and 12,000 sheep at the rates laid down in order to make up the minimum fee, I think that clearly indicates the Minister's idea that there should be no small exporters and that the dead meat industry should be handed over into the hands of a couple who will pay what they like. The only safeguard the farming community have is competition in trade, and if that is not going to be killed why put this industry into the hands of a couple of large exporter, which, in my opinion, would mean the finish of the trade?  With regard to this £225, we know very well that it is not the exporter but the farmer whose cattle are bought who will have to pay in the long run for all this &mdash; for the vets that are going around inspecting each carcase both before and after being killed.  I have in mind another order that was made here.  Only last week at a meeting of the Cork County Council Finance Committee I went into the list of people who have been paid compensation, and actually half the cattle slaughtered were not suffering from any disease whatever.  That means that the County Council or the Department paid compensation for animals that were killed and that were not suffering from any disease. I think there is such a thing as overdoing it.  A farmer loses a perfectly sound and good cow because a vet has the idea that in order to keep his post he must condemn so many cows a month, or a year, and that if he does not the Department will say he is doing nothing and will dismiss him.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have an idea that there is a trade going on in it, and I do not think I am far out.  Is it the Department that sends down a vet to inspect an animal?  I think this Bill should be drastically amended.  I suggest that the licence duty should be £20 altogether instead of £225.  That would give an opportunity to the small exporter. As the Bill stands it is going to kill the small exporters of fresh meat.  I think the Minister should consider it from that point of view, and from the point of view of how many veterinary inspectors can be paid out of the usual 25-acre farms in the country.  If the Minister would consider that point of view he would revise his ideas on this matter.</P>

      <P>This Bill affects very many traders in the city and county of Cork.  These traders are carrying on a legitimate trade, and one that should be encouraged.  The effect of this Bill, if it passes as it stands, on, those traders will be to drive at least 80 per cent. of them out of trade, and unless the Bill is very considerably altered in Committee it will be impossible for me to support it.  But, while saying that, I would also like to say, and I think I speak on behalf of the large majority of these traders, that the traders thoroughly approve of the principle of the Bill, but in detail they do not approve of it.  As it will have the effect of driving them out of trade, one can hardly expect them to approve of it.  The Bill, as I take it, provides for separate licences for cattle and sheep.  I take it that the minimum licence for each is £75 for carrying on the trade of exporter, and for all three classes it will come to £225 a year.  Taking it at that, and without going into these mathematical calculations which appear to have disturbed Deputy Corry so much, the effect of having to pay a minimum of £225 a year would be to drive these traders out of trade. What I would ask the Minister to do would be to provide, if possible, that only one licence should be issued for all three.  Take the £75 for cattle, the shilling a head rate provided in the <Col N="45" /> Bill would mean that traders would have to export at least 1,500 head of cattle, 6,000 pigs, and 12,000 sheep. I do not think any one of these traders would come up to the minimum in all three classes.  I would ask the Minister, when this Bill readies Committee, to yield to the representations which will be put before him on behalf of these traders, and so amend the Bill that it would be possible for them to conform to the principles of the Bill, which they are glad to see introduced &mdash; to have it so altered that it would be possible for them to carry on their trade without having to pay a licence duty which, under the existing circumstances it would be entirely impossible for them to pay.</P>

      <P>So far as the Bill applies to small factories for porkers around the country it would be fatal. I am not sure whether it is intended that each licensed premises should have to pay a fee of £75, or whether it is intended that the licensed exporter would have the right to export from two or more licensed premises at the same fee.  It appears to be intended that each licensed premises should pay a fee of £75. The efforts made in the western part of the country in the last few years to develop the London pork market will be of no avail, and those engaged in that business in these parts of the country will be inevitably closed down.  The result will be that a considerable increase will take place in the export of live pigs.  I do not think there is any provision in the Bill to prevent the export of live pigs.  In my opinion what will happen is that the small factories will have to close down.  The outlet for them in the London market in the pork trade being stopped would make it impossible for them to continue in business.  These people will, instead of killing their pigs at home, export them to England or Scotland or across the Border as they are doing in the case of eggs that are similarly hampered by excessive overhead charges.  Some drastic alterations should be made here to improve the possibilities of the continuation <Col N="46" /> of these factories that are confined to the pig trade alone, and some encouragement should be given to them to continue their efforts. You could say that the industry has been nipped in the bud and that it was done by excessive overhead charges.  The Minister himself a few weeks ago, speaking in Longford, said that no kind of legislation could increase the price of our exports.  If that is so, he should be very careful on the other hand not to destroy our exports by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of what Deputy Ryan said concerning not so much the purpose as the form of the Bill. The Minister has described it as a Bill to regulate the fresh meat export trade.  I think it should be more fairly described as a Bill to give the Minister power to regulate the export trade.  It is, in fact, the bureaucrat's dream.  Every second section of the Bill provides nothing except that the Minister shall have power to enact legislation by regulation.  I think it would be very unwise for members of the Dáil to permit a Bill of this kind to pass without protest, because it is quite obvious that the whole tendency of the present Ministry is in this direction, and repeatedly the Dáil has surrendered its powers to the permanent officials of various Government Departments. Deputy Ryan made reference to certain sections, to Section 16, which concerns returns to be made by registered proprietors and registered licencees, to Section 24, which concerns regulations for the preparation of fresh meat to Section 26, which concerns regulations as to condition of fresh meat at the time of export; Section 27, concerning the regulations for the packing of fresh meat, and Section 28, concerning regulations for the conveyance of fresh meat.  In relation to every single one of these matters it should be possible to embody the proposals of the Minister in the Bill, either in the text or as a schedule to it.  These regulations will be permanent, and if the Department of Agriculture know what they intend they should be <Col N="47" /> able to submit their proposals to the Dáil so as to enable the Dáil to express an opinion concerning them. It may be that it was just the desire of the Minister to postpone, until after a discussion in this House, the actual drafting of the Regulations, but I think it is not treating the Dáil rightly to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan described these particular sections as the essential parts of the Bill, and we do not know what they are going to be.  We do not know what the Minister intends they shall be.  He is merely asking the Dáil tb give him a blank cheque to do what he likes in relation to all these matters.  There are other sections of the Bill which give the Minister power to make regulations which, in my opinion, should not be allowed to come into operation until the Dáil has had an opportunity of either expressing its approval of them or of vetoing them.  There will be regulations under Section 39 prohibiting the export of carcases within, certain minimum limits of weight, or under Section 40 prohibiting the export of certain kinds of fresh meat.  Orders of that kind issued by the Minister should not, I think, come into operation until they have either been submitted to the Dáil or else laid upon the Table of the House for a certain specified time during which the Dáil will have a right to object to them.  Other sections of the Bill would raise different matters of &amp; more serious nature. Perhaps I may refer the Minister to Section 15.  Power is given to the Minister by Section 15 to revoke a licence if he is satisfied that such licence was procured by fraud or misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or innocent.  To give the Minister power to determine the fact as to whether a licence as procured by fraud and to enable him to deprive an exporter of his licence without any appeal whatsoever is, I think, going a very long way, much further than the Dáil should be prepared to go at this stage.  The decision as to whether the licence as procured by fraud or a decision as to the other <Col N="48" /> matters mentioned here in consequence of which the licence could be extinguished is to be determined in the first instance by the Minister. Then there should be an appeal from the Minister's decision to the courts. It would be, I think, almost a revolutionary proposal to give judicial powers of that kind to a Minister who, because of the very nature of his office, cannot possibly have the judicial frame of mind.  So far as the provisions may be operated by the present Minister for Agriculture, I am sure I can safely say no one in the Dáil believes that he has a judicial frame of mind.  He is, I think, a partisan by instinct.</P>
    <P>The same applies also, I think, to Section 23, which concerns the rectification and cancellation of the registration of premises.  In the section, the Minister is given power to determine the questions of fact and to enforce his decision by very severe penalties without any appeal whatsoever to any other tribunal.  I think also there should be an appeal from the Minister's decision to refuse registration under Section 8, The Bill merely provides that every refusal by the Minister including any refusal on the ground of undue expense or difficulty in providing suitable veterinary examination under this Act shall state the reason for such refusal.  I think there should be some machinery provided by which the applicant who is refused a licence could appeal from the Minister's decision if he thought the Minister was misinformed or had come to a biassed conclusion in consequence of certain statements which had been made to him.  Under Section 12, sub-section (8) the same thing applies only it is capable of a simpler rectification.  Sub-section (8), provides that if a licensed exporter fails or neglects to pay the amount certified by a certificate of indebtedness the Minister may revoke such exporter's licence.</P>
    <P>I do not see that that word should he &ldquo;may&rdquo; at all I think it should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; I do not believe the Minister should be given a discretionary power in a matter of that <Col N="49" /> kind.  Certainly it will give rise to very grave misgivings if one exporter had his licence cancelled for an offence under it and if another exporter's licence was not cancelled would not be prepared to give the Minister a discretion in that matter. In connection with that whole Section 12 I would like to draw the Minister's attention also to the fact that there docs not appear to be any provision made for a refund to an applicant for a licence of the £20 which he must pay with his application in the event of his application being refused.  In Section 20 the same objection arises.  Section 20, sub-section (6), provides that whenever an inspector reports tinder this section to the Minister that any registered slaughtering premises do not comply with the general conditions of cleanliness and suitability of slaughtering premises ... the Minister may serve a notice in the prescribed form upon the registered proprietor of such premises requiring such registered proprietor to do in the manner and time specified in such notice all or any of the things lawfully specified therein under this section.  Again the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the wrong word.  If an inspector reports to the Minister that any registered slaughtering premises do not comply with the general conditions the Minister should have no option but should require the registered proprietor to put the premises right again.</P>
    <P>I would like also if the Minister would discuss the possibility of extending some of the provisions of the Bill, at any rate to cover meat not intended for export.  It would not be possible to apply all the provisions of the Bill to meat intended for home consumption at present, but the point raised by Deputy Ryan is a very serious one.  The Bill is to ensure that only good meat will be exported.  The result will be that meat of a doubtful character, which will not pass the veterinary inspectors as being fit for export, will be consumed at home.  Even if it is not possible set over that difficulty entirely, I think it should be possible to provide that a register of all <Col N="50" /> premises used for slaughtering animals should be kept, whether those animals are for export or home consumption, and that these premises should be made subject to general conditions as to cleanliness and suitability and liable to be inspected from time to time, with the penalty of being removed from the register if the general conditions as to cleanliness and suitability arc not observed. Even if that alone were done in this Bill it would be a step in the right direction.  To leave the question of meat to be consumed at home outside the scope of the Bill altogether is, I think, a mistake, and will possibly have the result which Deputy Ryan fears; that a prejudice against Irish meat will arise amongst our own people and thus encourage the importation of dead meat.</P>

      <P>I was waiting until the discussion of the main points of the Bill had ended, as there were just two small points, which would be matters of regulation really, to which I wish to refer.  As long as the majority of the white race continue to be meat-eaters the slaughter of animals for food will be a sad necessity, but I would like to make the plea that the killing of these animals be made as painless as possible. I have been told by veterinary surgeons that the extreme fear attendant on the method of slaughter in certain places has a bad effect upon the meat.  How far that is true I do not know.  In most slaughter-houses a humane killer is at least on show, but, I believe, not in use.  I wonder could the Minister, in his regulations, make it compulsory to have that method followed.</P>
      <P>Another point is this.  I know of one slaughter-house in which young children and adolescents are present when animals are being slaughtered. I think that has a brutalising effect On these children and makes them callous, not merely in the treatment of dumb beasts, but in their relations with humanity, and that regulations should be made that no unauthorised person or young children should be admitted to slaughter-houses while the slaughter is being carried on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to this Bill from the aspect of the district which I represent.  The question of the minimum fee and the number of animals that would need to be handled in order to arrive at the minimum fee has been referred to by previous speakers. There is not very much guide from statistics of animals as to how many might be slaughtered for export in a particular area.  There are three ways in which pigs are disposed of. In my own area, for instance, there is the local pork market where supplies are not for the local curing firms.  There is the live trade, and there is the question of pigs for the London market.  The latter trade would come under this Bill.  If the Bill were passed in its present form it would cut out competition, because a number of people are in this business in a small way.  It is only developing in our area &mdash; that is, the pork trade for export.  The Bill would be a very great hindrance to trade, and if the minimum is to remain so high as it is in the Bill I could not support it.  I agree with the Minister as to the principle of the Bill.  It is necessary, and it is not a moment too soon, because if we have learned anything from the past we will understand that it would be much better for our own people to make the regulations than for other people to do it.  One Deputy spoke of what happened in the case of eggs.  In the case of the stamping of eggs we know what has happened. In our area the producers of eggs are getting anywhere from threepence to tenpence a dozen less for their eggs than people are getting across the border, only a mile away, because the eggs are subject to British regulations and are treated as foreign. It would be disastrous to our trade if we did nothing until the British authorities took up this matter and treated our exports as foreign.  I am quite in sympathy with the principle of the Bill and with the object for which the Minister says the Bill is introduced; that is, to regulate the export of fresh meat from this country, hut I cannot support it if <Col N="52" /> the minimum fee is to be so high as it is in the Bill at present, because it would kill all competition.  I am only speaking of what I know in my own area.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Haslett, I want to raise the question of the fee, and, like Deputy Fahy, I want to do so from the point of view of preventing cruelty to animals. The Minister has put down the same prescribed sum of one shilling in the case of the exporter of beef and in the case of the exporter of horse flesh.  Horse flesh is not as valuable as beef, and I am afraid the putting of the prescribed sum of one shilling on the horse flesh exported will lead to horses being sent alive across to France and Belgium, where these horses are used for various purposes. There have been great abuses in connection with that traffic, but I think, five years ago, it was brought home so convincingly to the British Parliament that they passed an Act prohibiting it I have met people who have visited abattoirs in France and Belgium.  They have told me stories which, though I discounted them to a great extent, were yet sufficiently alarming and unpleasant.  I think we should not intentionally encourage this traffic in worn out horses, which, because they are of comparatively little value, are liable to suffer both on the boat and in the abattoirs on the other side.  If the Minister would look into that point before the Committee Stage it would relieve our minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to stress some of the points made by Deputy Ryan.  In the first place, I think everybody admits that it is most desirable that we should have a Bill of this kind in order to ensure that good meat is exported, so that the reputation of this nation for agricultural produce might be upheld.  At the same time, like Deputy Ryan, I am wondering why something should not be done to ensure that there should be a good supply of meat for the people of this country.  Everybody knows that in the small towns <Col N="53" /> beasts are slaughtered under such conditions that the meat is certainly not good for human consumption. When it gets abroad that the anxiety of the veterinary inspectors for the purpose of this Act is to ensure that good beef is sent to the other side people will begin to ask what is to become of the meat that is rejected.</P>
      <P>The feeling will prow amongst the population here that it is the meat that is rejected for export that the people in this country arc getting with the result, as Deputy Lemass points out, that more foreign meat and more frozen meat and meat of that kind will be brought into the country.  I do hope, whether it is the Minister's Department or the Department of Local Government that is responsible for it, we will have regulations made to regulate the sale and other things pertaining to meat to the inhabitants of this country.  I would also like to raise a protest against the question of the minimum fee to be paid. Take the Wexford factory.  This Bill would deal very harshly with it. We hope that the Minister, on reconsideration, will have that fee reduced. There is also the question of the offal of bacon pigs being exported, and the same fee being charged for it, and the very small profits that have been made out of this offal.  I hope the Minister will reconsider all these vital matters because the tendency in the country at present is that farmers should come together in their own interests and start establishments such as this Fresh Meat Company in Wexford have done.  If this legislation is to be put into operation as it appears before us at present and if this Bill goes through, I am greatly afraid that it will have a bad effect upon the establishment and starting of small co-operative factories which. one would think, the Minister should encourage.  I do hope that the Minister will reconsider the points made by the various Deputies before the Committee Stage has been reached.</P>

      <P>I believe that the principle of this Bill is good and sound and if it can be carried into effect consistent with preserving the quality of the beef for home consumption it will deserve the support of every Party in this House.  But I think the Minister is going too far iii the matter of the fees.  To my mind the licensing costs should be reduced and reduced very considerably. After all this industry right through Ireland at present is almost just starting.  If the Minister perseveres with a licensing fee of £75 in regard to cattle and pigs he will certainly almost wipe out the small dealers and he will particularly affect the numerous dealers in the city and county of Cork where this industry has only been started a few years and has now developed to something considerable.  He will wipe that industry out of existence if he perseveres in charging the licence fees named in the Bill as it stands now.  I would appeal to him, if he can possibly do so, to reduce the licence fees to a half or even a little less than a half.  By doing that he will be going a long way to get behind him goodwill and support both inside and outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Minister)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Fahy, and which was also made by Deputy Cooper, I want to say that I do not think we can deal with a question like that in a Bill of this kind.  The slaughtering of animals by a humane killer is not a matter that could enter into this Bill.  As far as I know, the arrangements made for slaughtering animals in this country are, all things considered, as humane as they possibly can be.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Fahy and Deputy Cooper in that respect.  I think it is important that we should, as far as possible, take every precaution to see that animals are slaughtered in a decent way.  As far as I can see, the conditions in the country are good, but no provisions could be put into this Bill to deal with the question that the slaughtering should <Col N="55" /> take place by a humane killer or some other alternative principle.</P>
      <P>With regard to horses, horses are not slaughtered in this country at present.  The trade in such horses is with Belgium.  With regard to cattle, sheep and pigs, the fees put into the Bill do not greatly matter. I do not think that the fact that a man will have to pay one shilling for an animal killed will induce him to change his plans.  With regard to the Bill in general, it seems to me that the Deputies have spoken from what I should say is the wrong point of view.  Remember what has happened.  An order was made by the British Ministry in 1925 prohibiting the import of fresh meat from the Continent.  That order gave an obvious opening to the Irish trade, and the Irish trade immediately took advantage of it.  It had to come in at once.  The order was made to-day prohibiting the import of beef from the Continent, That gap had to be filled at once.  Farmers and farmers' organisations rushed into that gap, and in three years they multiplied by more than forty the exports of fresh meat to England.  Quite obviously anybody who goes through the country and is in touch with the trade must know that an organisation built up so quickly by the farmers, who had no technical skill or only a sort of technical skill, must be extremely faulty. A priori the evidence is there, but we have the actual evidence of our own inspectors.  Every Deputy in the House has the actual evidence. Deputy Ryan has it in Wexford; I have it in my own county, and the Cavan Deputies must know it.  All sorts of shacks were fitted up by farmers.  Shopkeepers and individual people merrily started slaughtering.  That is the existing position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately refrain from giving the figures with regard to the percentage of premises which could be regarded by anybody as suitable for this trade.  I do not want to give the figures for obvious reasons.  But I am saving something which every <Col N="56" /> Deputy who has any experience must know to be correct, that far and away the bigger proportion of the new premises which sprung up or which were established since 1925 are totally unfit for the purpose, and that the conditions of actual slaughter in these premises are entirely unsatisfactory.  Every Deputy must know that.  Cork was mentioned specially by Deputy Wolfe and Deputy French.  Cork has had its own share of complaints.  I have got my own share of trouble from, Cork, just as much as from any other county in Ireland.  Complaints as regards meat that left Cork city and its environs arc many and well authenticated.  As I say, they have been many and well authenticated and if anybody wants to know the reason he has that reason in Deputy Wolfe's speech. Deputy Wolfe says that the shopkeepers there are fairly enterprising. They saw a chance of doing a trade, and they established their killing plants and started merrily to export meat under unsuitable conditions.</P>
    <P>What is the reaction of the Dáil Deputies to this?  Deputy Ryan and other Deputies think that, first of all, we should try to consolidate that position.  The precautions we ought to take are to save people who are operating like that from losing money.  Is not that what it comes to?  We have here numerous Deputies talking about the small exporter and about the enterprising shopkeeper. He can not do things properly. How could he?  It does require technical skill and capital and business ability to produce these exports, just as it requires all these qualities to produce other products, when you arc sending them away and when you will be up against the British, and where your quality will be compared with the quality of your competitors.  How can you have anything like first-class staff under these conditions?  And yet there is no market in England of any use to us except the first-class market.  If we go into the second-class market in anything we are up against mass: production and we are to be beaten. <Col N="57" /> The second-class market is a market for mass production, for produce which is not fresh.  We cannot compete against countries like the Argentina, Canada or Australia in second-class stuff; we can only compete in first-class stuff.  Neither Holland nor any other country should be able to compete with us in first-class stuff in the English market, because we can always get our produce there fresh.  We have a geographical advantage which no other country has, and if we do not make full use of this advantage we might as well give up the idea that we can make money by exporting the sort of products which big countries can put on the market twice as cheaply and in far greater quantity.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and if there is no other possible market for us in England except for first-class products, why should the aim be to consolidate the present position in regard to fresh meat?  It must be admitted that the present position in regard to fresh meat is extremely bad.  Luckily, our fresh meat exports are not of great importance; but we have a fairly important pork trade which at present is a sheltered trade.  If the regulation imposed by the British Ministry against Dutch pork were taken off, I wonder would we be able to hold our own in the British market.  How much, pork would go over?  All the small factories, the groups of farmers and shopkeepers who set up shops during the last four or five years, and whom, I am told, I am going to put out of business would go out of business very quickly because they would be up against, not small establishments and groups of decent people who have established trades of their own and not casual groups or small factories, but they would be up against the go-ahead factories of Holland.  The aim should be to have our trade in a few years in such a position that it will be absolutely independent of any action the British Ministry may adopt, such as the taking away of prohibitions that are at present imposed on continental pork and other imports.  Our efforts should be <Col N="58" /> directed towards attaining a position when we will be able to compote with anybody and hold an unrestricted market.  That should be the aim of Deputies.</P>
    <P>This Bill will leave the Dáil an entirely wrong Bill if Deputies approach it from the point of view of seeing how you can buttress up every small group of farmers and every shopkeeper who, because he had a sheltered market, set up a small shop and started to produce fresh pork in order to send it to the English market.  Let us approach this whole question from the point of view of seeing if we will be able to retain the market that we have got and that we will be able to improve matters when the British, if they wish to do it remove the prohibitions that exist against our competitors in Holland.  If you do that there will not be, perhaps, so much consideration for the small groups that have been mentioned.  It may be an advantage to a limited number of people to have a factory under their noses, as it were, so that they could walk across the road with their animals in order to have them slaughtered.  But that is not business, and it is absurd to talk of competition. Half of the existing establishments dealing with this business could be wiped out throughout the country and it would be found that the balance of the establishments could afford to give a better price.</P>
    <P>We are in exactly the same position with regard to bacon.  It has been stated that the bacon factories in this country could handle twice the number of pigs that arc actually handled.  If half the shops dealing with the fresh meat business were wiped out and the other half made more efficient, there would be more profits for the owners and better prices for the farmers.  Competition sometimes puts up prices and sometimes brings prices down.  There are many trades in this country upon which the effect of competition has been to keep prices up.  Every one knows that there are many towns in which a large number of shopkeepers are living on a very small purchasing power.  There is more or <Col N="59" /> less by instinct a sort of competition which keeps prices up.  I do not believe for a moment that the small inefficient factories which have injured our reputation in the export market could ever increase the price that the Irish farmer is getting for his pork.  I am absolutely certain that their effect has been to decrease the price.</P>
    <P>The reputation of our pork and beef on the British market or wherever we arc selling it could certainly be improved.  Surely that cannot be denied.  If we go on as we are going, slaughtering in accordance with present methods and exporting anyhow, and infringing the regulations which the British have a perfect right to make &mdash; surely that is going to have reactions upon us. Surely the price of our produce will go down.  If we have efficient, stringent and drastic control of the premises, if our farmers are compelled &mdash; I make Deputies a present or that &mdash; to handle goods in the right way, and if they market their goods in the right way, that will put up the price.  Will anybody tell me that having our pork properly graded is not worth 3d. a pig?  Is not that what it comes to?  Having our pork graded as the Dutch grade it is worth 1/- a pig.  I admit that this may weigh heavily on small but efficient factories, but that is essentially a point that can be considered on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I protest against the point of view expressed by Deputy Ryan and other Deputies.  According to them our whole aim should be that here we have nice little Irish factories dotted throughout the country, doing things not like the benighted people of Holland or England or other countries, but rather doing things in their own way and they ought to be so encouraged.  The fact is that our people arc doing certain things they should not do.  They are killing tubercular pips and cutting out the lesions.  We are told that our aim should be to let them go on like that, but compensate thorn if they arc at any loss.  We arc told to let them remain in their present <Col N="60" /> position, let them kill tubercular pigs, but give them compensation if they are put to the painful necessity of killing the pigs and the English people will not cat the pigs.  That is an entirely wrong point of view, and we must adopt a different attitude. If we say that tubercular pork or beef may not be exported, what will be the result?  Tubercular beef at the moment consists of cows.  The farmer will not keep his cows very long because there will be no trade for old cows.  Speaking from the point of view of the farmers, nationally it would be the best thing that could occur if there was no trade for old cows.  The old cow trade is injuring us very much in England. The farmers will adapt themselves to that.  They will see that there is no trade for the old cow, and they will take care to see that their pigs are free from tuberculosis.  The whole tendency of the legislation is to force everybody, from the producer to the middleman, to the man financing the product, so to alter his economy that these particular factors which are telling so heavily against our produce will disappear. The whole tendency of the point of view or of the suggestions made by Deputy Ryan was that we should consolidate the present position, but that we should try and provide palliatives and compensations for people who will not adapt themselves to changed circumstances. That is an absolutely wrong point of view.  I am quite tilling to discuss any amendments from the other point of view.  I am quite willing to discuss any amendments put in from people who realise that we must change, that we must conform to the requirements of our market, and that the present position is entirely wrong.  But I am not willing, and it is waste of time, to debate amendments on the lines that we must provide compensation for everybody, no matter how he does his business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fees, we can consider these in Committee.  But let them not be considered entirely from the point of view of seeing that every single exporter in this country, no matter how small, or dirty, or inefficient, <Col N="61" /> no matter how lacking in technical skill, should be kept in business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised a point which was also raised by Deputy Ryan.  He said that the Bill was the usual bureaucratic sort of thing we have to expect from the present Government, and, like Deputy Ryan, he suggested that the regulations should be made part of the Bill.  It is a good enough point at first blush, but you could not put all the regulations in the Bill.  Methods of packing change every day, and also methods of killing. The market itself changes.  You have very often to alter with the market.  You could not say any more about cleanliness than that the premises shall be clean.  When the inspector goes round, he may see that the floors and ceilings and the externals of the place arc quite clean but that the sewerage is all wrong, or that there is contamination coming from some source or cause which could not be anticipated when drafting the Bill.  Cleanliness is a question of degree.  The causes of dirt vary very much; they vary from one premises to another.  There is one section dealing with cleanliness, and I should like Deputy Lemass to set out in mere detail what he wants to do.  I could not cover everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not the Minister be actually drafting the regulations, in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will draft regulations. After that these regulations will certainly have to be amended&mdash; to be extended or, perhaps, something dropped.  That is our experience in connection with every Bill. I invite any Deputy to take the section dealing with cleanliness and put in an amendment amplifying that section or any section he likes.  I might be able to accept it.  Still, I will have to give myself discretion to go outside it, because circumstances which none of us can foresee, and which might apply to one factory and would not apply to another, will arise and make it necessary for me, with the consent of <Col N="62" /> everybody when the facts will be brought up, to make a new regulation which could not be made without another Act of Parliament. There is a very simple way of dealing with these regulations.  I do not think there is any section in this Bill saying that the regulations should be laid on the Table of the House, and that a certain time should elapse before they come into operation, but I am quite willing to consider an amendment to that effect. That ought to meet it absolutely, because the regulations can be debated at great length and there can be a division upon them.  That certainly ought to meet it and prevent us coming to the Dáil every time a new contingency arises.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised a bigger point. He said the Minister has too much power here.  He took the trouble to quote the very best cases.  He said, for instance: What right has the Minister to say whether there has been fraud or not &mdash; that is the business of the court.  I should like to argue any other point &mdash; that is, a Committee point.  Let me just make a few observations on the idea underlying the general criticism that has been made not only of this Bill, but the Dairy Produce Act and the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act.  The Minister has very wide powers under these Acts.  He asks for very wide powers under this Bill. I am absolutely satisfied from my experience of the Dairy Produce Act that if the powers which the Minister has are to be subject to appeal in every case it will make the Act almost impossible to operate.  An ounce of experience is worth a ton of theory.  Every Deputy has sufficient experience to judge the point.  The Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act has been in operation for three years.  I have put my name at least one hundred times to recommendations to remove the licence from exporters.  For every one occasion on which I met Deputies on any other business I have met Deputies about three times on this question of whether the registration of an egg exporter should be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> I have never heard of a single case being brought before the Dáil.  Every case could have been brought before the Dáil, and though at least a hundred times I have revoked the registration of an egg exporter's licence, I have never yet had a single case where a particular instance has been brought before the Dáil&mdash;not one.  I will go further.  I have never yet had a case where the Deputy in question would not admit that the decision was absolutely correct, and would not proceed at least immediately to put his request upon some other basis.  There is an Act where the Minister has extreme powers, where it is essential, as I shall prove, to exercise them in the way they have been exercised for the List three years.  I am sure many Deputies have been written to by constituents on this question, and no Deputy has ever yet got a case that he could bring before the Dáil, or that would stand one moment's examination. That is true.  That is the result of the Eggs Act.</P>
    <P>Look at the other side of the question. For two years we spent our own time and the time of inspectors endeavouring to explain the regulations which we had made to the various egg exporters and to show them, by inducements and otherwise, that these regulations are in their own interests.  During all that period the reputation of Irish eggs increased in the British markets and the price relatively went up.  What happened last year?  It seems to me that during the previous two years they were not so much learning how to do the business properly, but. rather learning how to get around the regulations.  It will be absolutely essential if we are to re-establish the position of our eggs in the British market again, to operate these regulations drastically and ruthlessly.  They arc being operated drastically and ruthlessly, and if anybody gets a single instance. where these regulations are being operated unfairly, I should like him to bring it before the Dáil. am satisfied that unless I have <Col N="64" /> power myself to operate these regulations in that way I might as well put up my hands so far as they are concerned.  If there are to be appeals and arbitrators, and if it is to go to the Court, I would not waste my time endeavouring to put the position right.  It can only be put right, in that way.  I warn the Bail that if they adopt any other attitude in regard to the Bill it will be practically useless.  Deputy Lemass says that I am a partisan.  I am a partisan on the side of clean eggs, and healthy beef.  It is open to any Deputy at any time with full information from his constituents to show where that partisanship has taken the form of unfairness or injustice.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, if the Dáil approaches it from the point of view expressed by the Deputies opposite and succeed in that point of view, the Bill is worthless.  I have no bee in my bonnet about clean meat or tuberculosis.  It is a fashionable thing now in America and in England.  People talk a lot about it who know nothing about it.  I think meat from which the lesions have been cut out is quite good meat.  I have eaten it myself, I am sure, and I think that it does nobody any harm.  I have no fixed ideas.  I do know that our customers for fresh meat want a certain thing done and are prepared to pay for it and to pay a better price, and I do know that if the Bill is altered by hampering the Minister by appeals and arbitrators and all the rest of it, the Bill is worthless. In proof of that, I say this: If at present, under the Eggs Act, there were all these appeals and safeguards that Deputy Lemass speaks about, it would be absolutely impossible to operate the Act and we would have to let ourselves drift into the position that we were in before it was passed.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we ought to deal in this Bill with the home trade. That is a separate matter.  This is a specific Bill for a specific purpose. If we do not pass and operate it here, they will operate the regulations against us and there will be quick conversions on the side of the <Col N="65" /> Bill.  The moment it becomes impossible to export, fresh pork, because it is held up at Holyhead or Fishguard by reason of the fact that they send veterinary inspectors to inspect it, and we miss the London market next morning, there will not be very much talk about opposing this Bill. It will go through quickly, because the country will see that the Bill will go through.  The question of pork or beef for the home market is another question which should be dealt with separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to introduce certain changes into the code of National Health Insurance which will make for simplification and economy.  There is rather a large background to the proposals made in this Bill going back to a Committee dealing with the matter of National Health Insurance and Medical Services which sat in 1924 but did not definitely report until 1927.  The Committee was appointed by the Minister for Finance and its terms of reference were (1) to inquire into and report on the advisability of the continued maintenance of the system of National Health Insurance in its present form and to make any recommendations which the Committee consider proper in that connection.  (2) To consider whether it is desirable to institute a system of medical treatment on a contributory basis, and if so, to advise as to the form which that system should take.  (3) To examine into and report on the question whether the Medical Services at present assisted and maintained out of State or local funds can be improved as respects efficiency and economy, and if so, in what manner, due regard being had to any recommendations made under the preceeding paragraph. Two reports have been published. On the general question of the continued maintenance of National Health Insurance the Committee reported that an overwhelming <Col N="67" /> body of evidence was in favour of its continuance.  The approved societies, the employers' representatives, the Labour representatives, the General Council of County Councils, and the medical profession, were all of opinion that Health Insurance had proved a real benefit to the working classes in the Saorstát.  The Committee, however, recommended that certain changes could be advantageously made in regard to particular features of the Act, and the main object of this Bill is to give effect to these changes.  It may be recalled that the effect of the Insurance Act has proved a real benefit to the working classes as borne out by statistics.  The average weekly number of insured persons receiving sickness and disablement benefit during the year 1928 was 21,250, and the amount expended on these benefits during the year was £563,000. The amount expended on maternity benefit was £54,000.  In addition, these societies which had surpluses at the last valuation were providing additional benefits such as dental benefit, hospital benefit, etc., involving expenditure of about £34,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill the first matter dealt with is that of exempt persons.  It is necessary at the outset to distinguish between excepted persons arid exempt persons.  Excepted persons are completely outside the scope of the Acts, while exempt persons are only partly out; they pay no contributions themselves but the employer has to pay the ordinary employer's portion of the contribution. The exempt class is composed of persons who are given a statutory right on certain conditions to apply for exemption, a right which they may or may not exercise at their own discretion.  There are various conditions set out in the Acts which confer this right but the main grounds upon which exemptions are obtained arc (1) that the claimant has a pension or income of £26 per annum derived from sources other than his employment, or (2) that he is depending on some other person <Col N="68" /> for his livelihood.  Those who apply for exemption are in fact small in number &mdash; there were 726 exempt persons in 1928 &mdash; but they constitute a highly favoured class as they pay nothing themselves and yet they are provided with benefits out of the money provided by their employers and by the State.</P>
    <P>As is usual in dealing with small classes of this nature the administration expenses involved are much higher than can be justified by the small amount of good effected.  The Committee recommend that the right to claim exemption should be withdrawn and it is proposed to give effect to this recommendation, in the present Bill.  Adjustments will be necessary so that such persons as are exempt at the present moment will not lose the rights they are entitled to as exempt persons until they become persons in ordinary insurance.  There are certain statutory provisions dealing with Irish migratory labourers.  As a matter of fact only two persons in 1928 applied to be regarded as in the class of migratory labourers and in fact provision dealing with Irish migratory labourers are no longer required in the Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deposit contributors, the Committee unanimously recommended that if at all possible the class of deposit contributors should be abolished, and that all existing deposit contributors should be transferred to approved societies.  While insurance under the Acts is compulsory, an insured person is not compelled to join a society, nor is a society compelled to take him as a member, and those insured persons who, for one reason or another, do not become members of approved societies constitute a class known as deposit contributors.  The general principle of deposit insurance is that the contributors' right to benefit is limited to the contributions paid in respect of him increased by the usual State grant.  A separate account is kept in the Commission for each deposit contributor.  The benefits are administered by the Insurance Committees and are paid by <Col N="69" /> the Commission out of the sum standing to the credit of the individual accounts.  Insurance of this nature is obviously of very little use to the contributor, and in case of prolonged or serious illness his account is soon exhausted and lie is left entirely unprovided for.  The weakness of the whole position is that a scheme purporting to be a scheme for National Health Insurance fails to provide for the insured person whose health is so indifferent that he cannot obtain admission to an approved society. There are only between 3,000 and 4,000 deposit contributors.  Concurrently with a provision, of this nature doing away with the deposit contributor us a type of person recognised under the Act, it is obviously necessary that the existing rights of societies to refuse admission to members and to expel them should be withdraws except in cases where the constitution of the society requires that its membership should be limited to persons of certain classes. For instance, some societies have special rules limiting membership to men or women only, and to persons of a particular religion, or to residents of a certain area or employed in a particular trade.  Such societies will continue to be entitled to reject applications for membership from persons who do not come within such category.  Provision is also made for the transfer of existing deposit contributors to approved societies.  A suitable interval will be given after the passing of the Bill to enable them to choose their own societies, but any who have not done so at the end of the period will be transferred en bloc to certain societies which will be selected by the Commission as suitable for the acceptance of such members.</P>
    <P>In the case of married women, at present an insured woman who marries and remains in employment continues to pay the ordinary contributions and to be entitled to the ordinary benefit.  If, however, being a member of a society, she ceases to be employed for a certain period she is transferred to a special class, called Class K, in which no contributions are required and benefits are <Col N="70" /> payable on a special scale.  The transfer takes place at the date of unemployment, that is, at the end of eight consecutive weeks of unemployment, excluding unemployment due to incapacity for work, terminating within twelve months of her marriage.  If, however, she had completed eight consecutive weeks unemployment on or before the date of the marriage the transfer takes place at that date.  The special scale of benefits applicable to Class K is:&mdash;(a) sickness or disablement benefit of 7/6 a week for a maximum period of eight weeks in the period between the date of unemployment and the date of the completion of the second year of marriage (not subject to reduction for arrears): (b) maternity benefit of £2 in respect of the first confinement after the date of unemployment and within two years of the date of her marriage (subject to reduction for arrears, but not below one pound); and (c) sanatorium benefit until the end of the half-year next following the completion of a year from the termination of eight weeks unemployment.</P>
    <P>At the end of two years from the date of her marriage a Class K member ceases to be insured and her membership of a society ends.  If she again becomes unemployed while still a member, that is, before the end of two years from the date of marriage, she is treated as a new entrant into insurance and is required to requalify for benefit, retaining the right to any Class K benefit to which she would otherwise have been entitled until she requalifies. Administration of the insurance of this particular class, which came into existence in July, 1918, has proved to be troublesome and difficult, and the Committee recommended a simpler method. namely, that marriage should terminate the woman's insurance and that if she continued to be or again became insured after marriage she should be treated as a new entrant and, further, that in lieu of the present benefit a cash endowment should he paid to insured women on on marriage.  The Bill makes provision <Col N="71" /> for this.  The matters of the greatest importance arc the abolition of sanatorium benefits and the abolition of insurance committees.  Both of these changes have been unanimously recommended by the Committee of Inquiry.  The Insurance Act of 1911 set aside 1/3 per insured person out of insurance funds for the treatment of tuberculous insured persons, and the administration of the scheme for such treatment was entrusted to the County and County Borough Insurance Committees.  In 1912 grants became available which enabled local authorities to obtain recoupment from State funds of one-half of their net expenditure on the treatment of tuberculosis.  There is, therefore, in existence a dual system by which responsibility for treatment rests partly on insurance committees and partly on the local authorities.  In actual fact what has happened is that the great majority of insurance committees have entered into agreements with the local authorities by which they transfer their funds to such authorities in return for treatment for their insured persons so far as moneys are available for the purpose. In all these cases the work of the insurance committees is mainly limited to recommending certain insured persons for treatment to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The system gives rise to two serious complaints, firstly, that insured persons not only have to pay for sanatorium benefit under the Insurance Acts but have also to contribute is taxpayers and ratepayers for the moneys expended on tuberculosis under the local authorities schemes; secondly, that in some areas the money available for insurance funds is not sufficient to meet the number of cases requiring treatment with the result that insured persons although they have already contributed for sanatorium benefit are sometimes called on to pay part of the actual cost of treatment provided by the local authorities if their means enable them to do so.  On these grounds the Committee recommended the abolition of sanatorium <Col N="72" /> benefit and suggested that the treatment of tuberculosis should be left entirely in the hands of local authorities.  As deposit contributors whose benefits were administered by insurance committees are also being abolished there is no further work for these committees to do and their abolition is consequently also recommended. The abolition has been recommended unanimously by the Committee and provision is now being made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On the financial side the Bill provides that 1/3 per insured person hitherto available for sanatorium benefit and the 4d. per insured person available for the administration of insurance committees should now be diverted to meet the cost of medical certification.  This amount of 1/7 together with the 5d. already contributed by approved societies will provide the 2/- per insured person which is required to meet the cost of obtaining medical certificates for insurance purposes. Local authorities will be compensated for the loss of 1/3d. per insured person which they had been getting from insurance funds by an annual grant from State sources of £27,750. which will be provided for in the Vote for Local Government and Public Health.  As the State has hitherto been contributing 1/7d. per head to the Medical Certification Fund which will now cease, there will be a net saving to the State of 4d. per insured person, the estimated figure being £7,400 per annum.  These arrangements put on a permanent basis the provision of money for medical certification and Acts of a temporary nature such as have been passed each year since 1924 will be no longer necessary. The Medical Referee Service will still be provided from State funds.</P>
    <P>A number of smaller matters are dealt with in the Bill.  There has been difficulty in getting the terms of the Act carried out in regard to the stamping of cards for junior assistant mistresses.  That has been due to the fact that while the Minister for Education was responsible For the payment of the employer's share of the contributions the <Col N="73" /> manager was supposed to stamp the cards.  It is proposed that in future the Minister for education will be regarded as the employer.  That arrangement will save the trouble hitherto experienced both by the managers and the Commissioners. In accordance with the further recommendation of the committee an amendment is made in Section 112 of the Act of 1911 which will enable inspectors of the Commission to enter private dwelling houses, if necessary, at reasonable times to investigate cases of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act.  There has been a rather widespread non-compliance on the part of persons employing domestic servants in respect of the Act.  While inspectors have had statutory powers to approach employers in workshops and other places other than private dwellings, they had no power to approach private dwellings.  It is now proposed to give them such powers.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to extend the period within which an insured person is required to give notice of illness to his approved society from the present figure of three to seven days.  A system existed up to now by which if it was found that a person was not complying with the Act the Commissioners took steps to get him to comply with it.  They have no statutory powers to get arrears paid up except in respect of arrears for a period of twelve months.  It is proposed to amend the position by which the Commissioners can recover all arrears outstanding.  The National Health Insurance auditors are given a power of surcharge in regard to the accounts of approved societies similar to that which they already possessed in the case of insurance committees.</P>
    <P>At present their power is limited to disallowing improper payments or payments for which there is no legal authority.  The sums are not charted against any individual, and after investigation they are recharged to the societies' benefit fund or the administration account on instructions from the Commission.  It is proposed to take stops to enable <Col N="74" /> such surcharge  to be levied against the particular individual who was responsible in the matter.  The Bill also contains a  clause which limits the rights of insured person to pay contributions in respect of periods of unemployment.  Under the existing law they are not ordinarily allowed to stamp their cards themselves, but in the 1918 Act they were given a limited right to pay contributions in respect of periods of unemployment due to incapacity or inability to obtain work, in order to bring their total contributions up to the number of 104.  This gave an opportunity to an insured person who fell ill or who became unemployed during the early part of his insurance and in respect of whom contributions consequently ceased to be paid, to pay contributions himself for the purpose of making up the number of contributions required before benefit became payable. Some limitation of this right now becomes necessary having regard to the fact that all insured persons will in future be members of approved societies, and if the existing provisions were not altered unscrupulous persons could become entitled to substantial benefit by entering into employment for a short period with the collusion of an employer &mdash; even a week or a fortnight would be sufficient &mdash; and then paying a comparatively small sum in contributions themselves.</P>
    <P>The point involved will be made clear if we consider that a person going into employment gets a card stamped for three or four weeks and then leaves employment.  He would have the right to pay contributions himself to bring the total number up to 104 and he would then become entitled to a payment of 7/6 a week disablement benefit which might last for the rest of his life.  If we consider the liability involved in that way as distinct from a liability which would arise in a bona fide way it will be realised that some provision must be made to prevent fraud. Such persons, who would not ordinarily lie insured persons at could, if they found themselves in <Col N="75" /> bad health or suffering from a serious disease which was likely to lead to continued incapacity, secure employment for a short period, pay contributions themselves up to the qualifying number and become entitled to benefit which might last continuously during their lifetime.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, limits the existing rights as regards two classes &mdash; first, women, who have gone out of insurance on marriage and have re-entered employment within twelve months, and, second, employed contributors who are over eighteen years of age on entering insurance, and who fail to prove that they are normally insurable persons. The great majority of insured persons enter insurance before the age of eighteen, and if a society finds that the first insurable employment of an applicant for membership commences after that age, they will be entitled to satisfy themselves that such employment is genuine and not taken up for a short period merely for the purpose of being able to qualify for benefit before they allow him to pay contributions himself during periods of unemployment or incapacity.  The Bill also contains provisions bringing the terms of National Health Insurance for soldiers more into accord with the present regulations for recruiting in the Army.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the terms of reference which I mentioned in the beginning that there were two matters of considerable importance which the Committee of Inquiry dealt with.  One was the unification of societies.  That does not appear in the terms of reference, but in fact the unification of societies and the introduction of medical benefits were two very important matters dealt with by the Commission.  I did not introduce into this Bill anything dealing with medical benefits or the unification of societies.  It was the opinion of the Commission that the unification of societies, that is, the bringing about of a condition of affairs in which the large number of approved societies that we have at the moment would be amalgamated <Col N="76" /> into one unified society, was the most satisfactory way to deal with the National Health Insurance scheme, so that there might be a possibility of giving better benefit to insured persons and of economy in administration. At the time that the Committee was inquiring into the matter there were eighty separate approved societies and one approved society with twenty-five branches.  At the present moment there are sixty-five approved societies and one approved society with nineteen branches, so that during the period that has elapsed from the time the Committee sat a reduction has taken, place in the number of societies.</P>
    <P>The Committee, while stating that unification of the societies would be the best possible way for organising the National Health Insurance system, were not prepared to say that that was feasible.  The Executive Council, on considering the matter, were not prepared to say either that it was feasible, but I propose, on the Committee State, to put an amendment before the House that would provide an opportunity of discussing what can be done to improve the position from what it is at present. I said that the number of approved societies has been reduced from eighty to sixty-five.  In my opinion, a very considerable reduction is desirable, and I propose to put before the House an amendment somewhat along these lines &mdash; giving the Commissioners power, in the case of voluntary amalgamations of societies during the next two years, the plan of amalgamation being subject to the Commissioners, to give a certain amount of compensation to those employees of the approved societies whose services will be dispensed with as a result.  That is, in cases where voluntary amalgamation takes place within the next two years, provided that after two years the Commission may compulsorily bring about the amalgamation of societies down to a number not greater than twelve or fifteen, and giving, at the same time, a certain amount of compensation to the employees of the societies whose services will be dispensed with. When I say compensation, Deputies <Col N="77" /> must put out of their minds that in such amalgamation as might take place in that particular way, anything like pensions will be available, because the organisation of the societies from a financial point of view would not make that in any way possible.  There has been no compensation in any of the amalgamations that have taken place up to the present.  The amalgamations have been amalgamations of weak societies, and in the great majority of cases the Commissioners had to step in and compulsorily carry out amalgamation.  However, I will put an amendment before the House that will enable that matter to be discussed.</P>
    <P>On the medical benefits aspect of the question, while the majority of the Committee considered that there should be a scheme of medical benefit and suggested that a medical benefit scheme could be arranged by increasing the contribution by twopence, nevertheless Deputies will find that there were three minority reports.</P>
    <P>What, operated most in the minds of the minority reporters, and what operates in the minds of the Executive Council is the fact that it is shown that a very large proportion of insured persons are already treated free by the dispensary system throughout the country.  It was felt, following the change that had taken place owing to the setting up of Boards of Health throughout the country &mdash; a change that had taken place comparatively  recently &mdash; that we would require further time to judge what kind of a scheme of medical benefits should be introduced as well as to satisfy ourselves that the present system did not meet the needs of the situation.  Personally, I am agreed that the system of medical benefits is very desirable, but we have not come to the time at which we can say what lines the finances or even the organisation for granting medical benefits to insured persons should take.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute <Col N="78" /> therefor the words &mdash;&ldquo;declines to give a Second Reading to the National Health Insurance Bill, 1929, until proposals have been laid before the Dáil providing for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The administration of National Health Insurance through one society, and</P>
    <P>(2) Medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I wish to say, speaking generally and subject to certain amendments that we expect will be introduced at a later stage, that we do not desire to be taken as being opposed to the greater number of the amendments that are set out in this Bill to the National Health Insurance Acts.  We have no desire whatever to oppose any amendments of these Acts that will tighten up and make more efficient the working of National Health Insurance. Above all, we have no desire to oppose any amendments that will lessen the cost, I should say the high cost, of administration of national health, both so far as the headquarters of the Insurance Commission and of the approved societies are concerned.  As the Minister said, the amendments to the Acts that are set out in this Bill are the result, I think, in all cases of recommendation made by the Committee of Inquiry that was set up, as the Minister said, in 1924.  With these recommendations, and the amendments that are based on them, there is, as I have said, fairly general agreement so far as we are concerned with perhaps two or three exceptions.  There are minor amendments, however, that some of our friends would like to see made in the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the House will understand from the amendment that I have on the Order Paper, our objection is not to the Bill.  We do not wish to see the Bill defeated, and we would not like, even, to see it held up very long, except for the reason that, in my opinion, there are two grave omissions from the scope of it. These have been alluded to by the Minister.  One is what is called in the report of the Committee of Inquiry, unification, and the other is the question of medical benefits. <Col N="79" /> That Committee was set up at considerable expense, and I am sure it gave considerable time and consideration to the whole question of national health insurance.  The Committee produced a report that made numerous recommendations. The Government has embodied the greater number of those recommendations in this Bill.  We believe that the two principal outstanding recommendations contained in that report are ignored in this Bill, and that is the major fault that we have to find with it.  The Bill has been expected for a long time.  There has long been a promise that it would be brought in to amend the National Health Insurance Acts in the various ways which have been found necessary. It was generally expected by many insured persons and by approved societies that, when the National Health Insurance Acts were being amended, an attempt would be made under the Bill introduced for that purpose to bring in for consideration and legislation the subject of medical benefits.  The fact that it has been ignored has led, as far as I have been able; to gather, to very grave disappointment.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry, in their interim report, stated that there were 81 approved societies in existence at the time the inquiry was held.  In the last report issued by the Commissioners it was stated that there were then 74 approved societies in existence, and the Minister tells us now that there are only 65 approved societies in operation in the Free State.  Whether the number be 81, 74 or 65 it is our opinion that any such number is far too great to be in existence in the twenty-six counties.  We believe, and I think anybody who has taken any time to consider this matter believes with us, that a drastic cutting down of the number under a scheme of unification of some kind is necessary, and that such a cutting down would redound to the benefit of all concerned.  The Government would save money by it as well as the insured persons.  The saving of this money would mean that there would <Col N="80" /> be more money available for the insured persons in the matter of the medical attention they get at present, and that they would be likely to get as the result of the additional surpluses made available.</P>
    <P>According to the last report of the Commissioners there arc at present 492,594 insured persons in the twenty-six counties.  If there are 74 approved societies, that means there are, roughly, 6,500 members on the average in each society; if there are only 65 approved societies in existence &mdash; the Minister gave us that figure to-day &mdash; it means there would be between 7,000 and 7,500 members in each approved society.  I imagine that in a certain number of the approved societies the number of members would be considerably greater than that, but, at all events, in a considerable number of the societies there must be 6,000 members or less. Every one of these approved societies has to have its own office its own committee of management, its own secretary, its own clerks and book-keepers, and all the other para phernalia required to run any properly organised office.  The multiplication of these societies and the multiplication of officials leads to waste.  I do not want to labour the question, but I think that the amendment that I have put down has already fructified to some extent by inducing the Minister to make the promise that he has made &mdash; that he will introduce an amendment which will seek to hurry up the question of the abolition of the number of these smaller societies.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government ought to have taken its courage in its hands and tackled this question in a bolder fashion.  They could cut the losses at present being made by the Government itself and by the approved societies, losses which cost considerable sums annually to the insured persons.  The amount of benefit they would get as a result of their payments would be very considerably increased if the whole organisation of national health were put oil a more efficient basis than that under which it is now operating.  <Col N="81" /> At present the societies are allowed 4/5d. per head per insured person per year for administration. That is a large sum out of the amounts paid by the insured person, and that could be considerably reduced if there were a more efficient scheme in operation.  The report tells us that the cost of administration at headquarters is 3/8¼ per insured person, as against 1/4 per head in England.  Of course it may not be quite fair to compare the cost of administration per head in the Free State with the cost of administration per head in England.  We know that England is highly industrialised with a vast population, and the cost per head would be considerably lower than here.  Nevertheless, 3/8¼ per head per insured person is a sum far above what it ought to cost to run National Health Insurance in Ireland, and above what it should cost if there were more efficient management. The interim report says on page 7, on the high cost of central administration:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Commission submits that the method of calculating the expense at cost per head of the insured population is misleading and unfair; for it points out that there are over 12½ millions of insured persons in England compared with 450,000 in the Saorstát and that the overhead charges must be greater proportionately to numbers in the Saorstát than in Great Britain for administering the same type of machine. There are, the Commission states, other reasons why the cost of central administration is relatively higher in the Saorstát than in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are reasons, but I think those reasons could be made to disappear to a large extent if the law were altered so as to enable more efficient management to be introduced. In giving evidence before the Committee of Inquiry the National Health Insurance Commission set out a number of reasons why some policy of unification ought to be adopted.  Those interested will find them on page 6 of the interim report.  I will refer to some of them. It gives a list which includes:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" />&ldquo;(a)  Inequality of benefits for members arising on a valuation because of the particular character of the society to which they belong. (b) Want of uniformity of administration. (c) Overlapping rival organisations, leading to disputes as to membership.  (d) Inadequate agency system, and lack of supervision of sick members.  (e) Number of transfers from one society to another and resulting disputes between societies as to membership. (f) Necessity for keeping on the deposit contributor class owing to expulsions from societies and to refusal of membership on account of health or other grounds.  (g) Unfairness of the present arrears system, which is based on a higher average frequency of contribution payments than exists in the Saorstát. (h) Resulting high cost of central administration owing to (i) the necessity for keeping separate accounts for separate societies; (ii) constant supervision of societies by the Commission's indoor and outdoor staff; (iii) the large number of complaints, appeals and the like.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again on page 32 there are set out what are, I think, more or less a duplication of what the National Health Insurance Commission sets out as objections to the present system.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission calculates that there would be a saving of about 45 per cent. on the present total cost of its administration, the accounting work would be reduced to a minimum and on the secretariat side would disappear most of the work of the Approved Societies' Branch.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be a considerable saving if it could be introduced at once and the Government had the courage to do what the Committee of Inquiry recommends.  For these reasons we on these benches are of opinion that the Bill ought to be held up for some time to give the Ministry time to reconsider this matter, and to again read over the recommendations that have been made by the Committee of Inquiry <Col N="83" /> and take into consideration the strong recommendations on these lines that are contained in the report. The personnel of the Committee was not one that to my mind was representative of the approved societies or of the opinion of the general run of insured persons.  It was composed to a large extent of officials of one kind or another of the Government, and others, quite good enough people in their way no doubt, but not in as close touch as we would imagine persons inquiring into health insurance ought to be with ordinary insured persons and with approved societies.  The Committee of Inquiry was: Professor William Magennis (Chairman), Sir Joseph A. Glynn, J. Hurson, James Gray Kyd, Canon MacHugh, P.P.; William J. Maguire, Robert J. Rowlette, Edward F. Stephenson, with Mr. Kavanagh as secretary.</P>
    <P>In all probability if there had been on the Committee of Inquiry direct representatives of the insured persons, members of approved societies, and officials of approved societies who are in daily touch with insured persons, the recommendations in this report would have been somewhat different.  I do not know that officials of approved societies would be in favour of unification, but they would certainly favour the cutting down of administration costs.  They must approve of that, and such recommendations would have been put in, perhaps, even in stronger language than is to be found in the recommendations of this report.  As it stands the recommendations are strongly put, and are such that greater notice ought to have been taken of them by the Ministry when considering the legislation they should bring with regard to this matter.  As for the method of unification, we are not ourselves tied, and we do not wish to be taken as recommending any specific method of unifying or bringing into one body all the approved societies. Some would prefer nationalisation. From our point of view we do not mind what it is called, provided unification is brought about, and <Col N="84" /> brought about in an efficient way, and that as a result the savings that must accrue will go to the benefit of the insured persons.</P>
    <P>On page 14 there is one short paragraph of the report that summarises the views of the Committee of Inquiry.  In paragraph 53 the Committee says: &ldquo;We have carefully considered the three modes of simplification put before us, and we have come to the conclusion that unification&mdash; if feasible&mdash;affords the best method of simplifying National Health Insurance in the Saorstát and of effecting very considerable economies in the cost of its central administration.&rdquo; As we say, we are not tied to any particular method, call it simplification, unification or nationalisation, but we certainly are insistent on a more efficient and less costly management of National Health Insurance.  I think it is worth while referring to some remarks made by Dr. Rowlette, who was one member of the Commission who added a note when signing the interim report.  On page 22 of the interim report he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree in thinking that the method of administering National Health Insurance through approved societies is cumbersome under the conditions that are found in Ireland.  The method was introduced to Ireland, merely to give uniformity to a system common to Great Britain and Ireland, but designed to meet English local conditions.  It had no relation to Irish needs or customs, and with any re-casting of the insurance system in Ireland there appears to be no reason why the existing method of administration should be continued, if a better, or one more suitable, can be devised.  The whole problem should be considered without prejudice.</P>
    <P>The arguments put before us were convincing that a unification of society administration would lead to considerable saving, but the saving would, I believe, be greater, if the unification were carried a step further, and the <Col N="85" /> entire administration committed to the care of a Department of Government, as is done in other countries where schemes of national insurance have been most highly developed. Such concentration in a Government Department would have the following advantages:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The direct responsibility of a Minister to Parliament for the entire adiministration of national health insurance;</P>
    <P>(2)  The co-ordination of national health insurance with the health policy of the country, and with the whole scheme of preventive medicine;</P>
    <P>(3)  The possibility of readily fitting in national health insurance with any other form of social insurance which the country may decide to adopt in the future;</P>
    <P>(4)  A greater immediate economy than can be attained, without loss of efficiency, by any other method.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of Dr. Rowlette, who, I understand, has given very considerable time and energy to studying this matter.  With regard to the question of medical benefit, the second reason why we would like our amendment passed is because medical benefit has not been dealt with in this Bill.  I think it will not be denied that it was the original intention, when the Bill was put into operation in Ireland, that at some time or another medical benefit would be given to the insured person in Ireland or in the Free State as was given to the English members of approved societies or English insured persons.  Under the law as it stands the three main benefits granted to insured persons are sickness, disablement and maternity benefits.  Certain approved societies, those that have surpluses for one reason or another have, as a result of those surpluses, been able in recent years to grant additional benefits.  Some have granted dental benefits to a certain extent, and others optical benefits to their members, but there is no uniformity, <Col N="86" /> and all or a great number of the approved societies are not in a position to grant these additional benefits. They have not all got surpluses available.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, as I say, a want of uniformity in the system, but outside that altogether we believe that the time has come when an effort should be made by the Ministry to introduce medical benefit. We believe there is a demand for it.  We believe that it is just that it should be granted, and we believe that it is necessary if we take the state of public health into consideration. In Great Britain, and in the Six Counties medical benefit, consisting of medical treatment and attendance and the provision of proper and sufficient medicines and the medical and surgical appliances, with the free choice of a doctor, is also given to insured persons.  I do not know if there is any doubt as to whether there is a persistent demand for the introduction of medical benefits, but in case anybody would have any doubts in their mind I think these doubts could be resolved by reference to the final report, where, on page 54 in Appendix 8, there is cited the opinion of the Approved Societies Association of Ireland on this particular question of medical benefit.  I will not read it all; it is a long document.  Anyone interested can see for himself.  In paragraph 3 of Appendix 8 it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was the unanimous opinion that medical benefit should be a statutory benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, and not an additional benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of the Executive of the Approved Societies' Association of Ireland on the question of a medical benefit scheme.  I read somewhere, I think it was in this report, that the approved societies represented could speak for about 70 per cent. of the insured persons in the country.  The trade union approved societies represent also a considerable percentage of the insured persons in the country.  They gave evidence before this Committee of <Col N="87" /> Inquiry.  In Appendix 9 there is printed here in this report a statement from them dealing with this question of medical benefit.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Association of Trade Union Approved Societies believe that a national scheme of Medical Service is preferable to any other scheme that can be suggested, and they claim a scheme of this kind must be introduced without delay. They believe that medical benefit for the working-class, whether insured or not, is absolutely essential in the national interest and is their absolute right.  It appears to them that the worker's claim to medical service should not depend entirely on his ability to find an employer. The system responsible for the slums, the disease and the wreckage of human life should pay for its ravages.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Meantime, as it appears unlikely that a national scheme of Medical Service unassociated with the contributory insurance scheme will be forthcoming in the immediate future the Association favours the extension of medical benefit under the Insurance Acts on a contributory basis, as a temporary expedient.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Medical benefit, however, in our view cannot be provided as an additional benefit, but so long as it forms part and parcel of the insurance machinery must be a statutory benefit guaranteed to the insured persons.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Association is further of opinion that the scheme should embrace both the insured persons and their direct dependants.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We believe the total cost of such benefits should not exceed 3d. per week, and we are of opinion that the State should assume responsibility for a substantial proportion of that contribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two organisations speak for the vast body, perhaps for 90 per cent., of the insured persons.  Such bodies as the Dublin Chamber of Commerce have also given evidence <Col N="88" /> in favour of medical benefit.  On page 27 of the final report, in a minority report appended to the final report by Mr. J.J. McElligott and Mr. J. Hurson, they quote the opinion of the late Mr. William Martin Murphy.  Giving evidence before some previous committee, and speaking in regard to the extension of medical benefit, Mr. Murphy is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The witness said that the Chamber (meaning Chamber of Commerce) advocates the extension of medical benefit to insured persons, and that the views given by the late Mr. William Martin Murphy before the Medical Benefit Committee in 1913 are still the views of the Chamber on the question of medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to qualify that to some extent.  Anybody who is interested will find it on page 27 of the final report. There was one section of the community that sent witnesses to give evidence before the Committee of Inquiry with regard to the value of health insurance itself, particularly with regard to the value of health insurance so far as it affected their members.  That organisation was the Irish Farmers' Union.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 19 of the Interim Report this appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the Irish Farmers' Union and some country witnesses contended that agricultural labourers did not derive much benefit from the Act. When, however, figures submitted to the Committee by the Insurance Commission were placed before the witnesses they frankly confessed that the case made on behalf of the farmers was not borne out by the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So I think it can be fairly said of all classes of the community to whom health insurance has been of benefit. The Minister himself quoted the opinion of the Committee&mdash;their final opinion, having heard witnesses of all classes, of all kinds, and representative of every shade of opinion, I suppose, in the community&mdash;that the overwhelming body of opinion was in favour of the retention of <Col N="89" /> health insurance.  I think it is equally true that all classes are in favour of the extension of medical benefit.  You have had the opinions of such widely divergent classes as the employers and the trade unions.  You have, in between, the opinion of a body speaking for insured persons in general, people belonging to different classes of the community, organisations of one kind or another that have added to their work insurance work.  The organisation of approved societies have unanimously and in the strongest terms recommended the adoption of medical benefit.  The opinions of these bodies naturally would carry much greater weight than anything I could say in the matter. That is why I have gone to the trouble of quoting their opinions. The opinion of the Committee of Inquiry itself on the subject is to be found in paragraphs 67 and 70 of the Interim Report.  I would like to refer you to these.  Paragraph 67 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The evidence submitted to the Committee shows that the majority of insured persons would welcome the introduction of a system of medical benefit on a contributory basis.  Only 9 approved societies do not favour the extension of medical benefit to insured persons. The membership of these societies is about 12,600; and it is worth noting that some among them are already provided with medical treatment schemes of their own. Eight other approved societies&mdash; with a membership of nearly 12,000&mdash;would not favour the introduction of this benefit if it involved any increase in the present contribution under the Insurance Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 70 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Medical treatment on a contributory basis should form part of National Health Insurance.  Most of the witnesses examined as to medical benefit were of opinion that a proper system of medical treatment for the insured persons on a contributory basis is the main reform requisite.  There is no doubt that National Health Insurance <Col N="90" /> in Ireland has suffered from the absence of medical treatment as part of the statutory scheme of benefits.  This was felt from the inception of the system of National Health Insurance.  In the preamble to the original National Insurance Act, 1911, the Act is described as insurance against loss of health `and for the prevention and cure of sickness.' In 1913 the Committee appointed `to consider the extension of medical benefit under the National Insurance Act to Ireland' reported in favour of the immediate extension of such benefit to the county boroughs.  That Committee did not see its way to recommend any further extension at the moment owing to being unable to arrange terms between the approved societies and the medical profession as to the inclusion of the dependants of insured persons which the societies demanded. That Committee also stated that the British system was unsuitable to rural Ireland and that the extension of medical benefit to areas outside the county boroughs should await the comprehensive reform of the Poor Law and the creation of a State medical service.  No action was taken on this Report owing to the World War of 1914-18.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Public Health Council considered the question of the extension of medical benefit and in paragraph 11 of its Report stated `that the absence of any provision for medical treatment of insured persons has an injurious effect on the health of the working classes, and we feel that some system such as we indicate in Part III. should be made operative as soon as possible.'  The system referred to was the proposed creation of a medical service as set out in paragraphs 40 to 56 of that Report.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be seen, therefore, that the two Committees which considered the question of medical benefit were of opinion that medical treatment on a contributory basis should form part of National <Col N="91" /> Health Insurance.  With that opinion the Committee is in agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In several paragraphs of the Final Report a similar opinion is reiterated. I will only refer to one or two of them.  Paragraph 1 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Interim Report which this Committee had the honour to furnish you (paragraph 70) agreement is expressed with the verdict of the Medical Benefit Committee in 1913 and of the Irish Public Health Council in 1920, that medical treatment on a contributory basis should form part of National Health Insurance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It now appears to this Committee that such a comprehensive scheme as that discussed in the Sub-Committee's Report, whereby medical treatment of every description would be available for the working classes and their dependants whether insured persons or otherwise&mdash;is the ideal solution of the problems proposed in the second and third of the terms of reference.  For various reasons, however, and particularly on account of the estimate of expense prepared by the Sub-Committee, the members of this Committee, while regarding it as otherwise providing a solution of all the problems involved, are not unanimous in recommending it for immediate adoption.  Disappointed in the expectation of the immediate establishment of a medical service of national scope, embracing, that is, both the insured and `poor persons,' this Committee turned its attention to the one practicable alternative, a scheme not so comprehensive, but providing a solution of the lesser&mdash;yet, perhaps, more urgent&mdash;problem of how to secure medical treatment for insured persons.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The weight of the evidence submitted to this Committee, as indicated in Part II of the Interim Report, has been overwhelmingly in favour of the instant introduction <Col N="92" /> of an adequate system of medical treatment for the insured population on a contributory basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are other places in the report where that opinion is stressed. Paragraph 8 is one of them.  It goes into detail in paragraph 8, giving the opinions of the Approved Societies Association and the Trade Union Association, and the opinions of other societies like the Prudential Health Insurance Society and the Irish Amalgamated Health Insurance Society, all in favour of the introduction of medical benefit.  The heading of paragraph 18 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Medical benefit would provide a natural check on irregular certification.&rdquo; It goes on to give its reasons for that in the paragraph.  The heading to paragraph 19 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The necessity for separate expenditure on certification would disappear on the introduction of medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 20 says medical benefit would effect a large saving in sickness benefit expenditure.  There are arguments adduced to prove these contentions which perhaps Deputies interested will read for themselves. It says in paragraph 21: &ldquo;Accordingly this report recommends that medical benefit be extended to insured persons in the Saorstát through some such scheme as is therein outlined.&rdquo;  That is the scheme drawn up and submitted by and on behalf of the Insurance Commission. I do not think that there can be any doubt in anyone's mind as to the fairly unanimous demand there is for medical benefit.  If there is one reason that appeals to me more than another why I would like to see medical benefit secured and extended to the insured persons, it is because of the backward position-of public health in this country.  I will not go into it now, but I would like to see a total reorganisation of the medical services, somewhat on the lines of the schemes mentioned in the report and recommended under the third heading of the terms of reference given to the Committee of inquiry.  But as there <Col N="93" /> is no suggestion that any scheme of that kind is going to be put into operation in the near future, I would like to see the additional benefit that would accrue from the extension of medical benefit to insured persons given to those people who have paid and are paying, and who would be, I submit, prepared to pay whatever additional sum would be demanded of them&mdash;2d. is suggested&mdash;for the medical treatment now denied them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one or two remarks of Dr. Rowlette in the letter he sent in when giving adherence to the Final Report of the Committee. He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority of the Committee state in paragraph 3 of this report that the ideal solution of the problems set in the second and third of the terms of reference is to be found in the immediate establishment of a medical service of national scope, on some such lines as the scheme discussed in the report of the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For `various reasons,' however, and particularly on the ground of expense, this ideal solution is not recommended for immediate adoption. In my opinion a comprehensive scheme of this kind is not only the ideal but by far the best practical solution of the problems before the Committee.  Moreover, it is the only solution which shows any fulfilment of the hope expressed by the Minister for Finance at the first meeting of the Committee, that the Committee would be able to recommend cooperation between the National Health Insurance and Poor Law systems.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In postponing the solution that they regard as ideal, my colleagues seem to have lost sight of the general principle to which they commit themselves in the closing words of the report (paragraph 47):&mdash;`The health of the people is a prime consideration; economy secured at the expense of the people's health is prodigal waste of a national asset.'</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The almost unique position held by the Irish Free State as regards <Col N="94" /> population makes the danger of subordinating health to pecuniary considerations greater here than in other countries.  The Irish Free State is losing its population at a more rapid rate than any country in the world except one.  The following figures taken from the Preliminary Report of the recent Census (p. 6) show the average annual increase or decrease of population per thousand of the several countries for which figures are available, based on the most recent Census returns:&mdash;</P>
    <P>He quotes figures and points out that France tops the list in the way of losing population, and that Saorstát Eireann comes next.  The average annual decrease per thousand in the case of France is 5.6 and, in the case of the Saorstát 3.7. There are two other countries, Austria and Belgium, losing population to a less extent than.  France and the Saorstát.  All the other countries&mdash;I suppose about 20 are quoted here&mdash;are to a greater or less extent, increasing in population. That makes me feel that anything we can do to help to improve public health, to help to stop the wastage of human life that goes on all over the Saorstát, we should do, and it appeals to me especially with regard to the city of Dublin, where, on the north side, the population is so dense and overcrowding so common that infants under 12 months old die at the rate of 170 per 1,000.  That condition of affairs should not be allowed to continue and if we can help to improve it by the introduction of medical benefits into the insurance scheme the sooner we do so the better.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with the other items in the Bill, or the various suggested amendments that are set out.  On one or two there will probably be from our side at any rate a fair amount of discussion and a number of amendments submitted. The two big things that appeal to us, and on which we would like to do all we could to impress on the Ministry the desirability of holding back this Bill for the purpose of reconsideration, <Col N="95" /> are the questions of simplification of the organisation&mdash;unification if you like or nationalisation&mdash;but simplification with a reduction of the cost of administration and the inclusion of medical benefit.  The other matters are, I think, less important. They are perhaps important so far as the daily routine working of the societies and the Commission are concerned, but the matters of big national import that we think ought to have been dealt with courageously by the Executive are the two I mentioned.  They have been ignored; the Executive for one reason or another decided not to legislate upon them, but to ignore the recommendations of the Committee, and the clamant demand that, I think, we have evidence of from insured persons&mdash;the inclusion of medical benefit.  Because these two things have been ignored, because the Government for the time being has not thought fit to deal with them we ask that the amendment be adopted, that the Government be asked to reconsider the Bill, and bring it in later, including in it some scheme of simplification or unification, but certainly medical benefit.</P>

      <P>This Bill is rather a difficult one to discuss on Second Reading, because it consists of a series of reforms or amendments of the existing Acts, and each section is more or less independent in itself, so that it is difficult to say what is the general principle running through the Bill that one could address oneself to at this stage.  It is not a very easy Bill to understand or to follow.  I was looking forward anxiously to the Minister's explanation of it, but he got through it so rapidly that it was not easy even to follow that.  This is an exceedingly bad example of legislation by reference, as anyone can see who looks for a moment at paragraphs 2 and 3. There are numerous references there to old Acts which one would require to look up and study very carefully before he could form a definite opinion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> Undoubtedly, as Deputy O'Kelly said, the Bill does contain some administrative reforms that are, I think, generally accepted by the approved societies and by most people as being improvements on the present system of administration. The Minister mentioned some of them.  There was, for instance, the question of the deposit contributors. That clause is being removed, and I think it is generally admitted that that will be an improvement.  So far as the Bill facilitates general compliance with the Act in giving a right to insurance inspectors even to enter dwelling-houses at reasonable times, I think that that, too, will be approved, because the more general the compliance, the better it will be for all, concerned, and there is no doubt that this disability in the Act did have the effect of increasing non-compliance with the law.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the abolition of exemption certificates, there is the question of specially giving power to follow up defaulters and to get them to pay up arrears, and there is the extension of the time for lodging claims from three days to seven days.  All these, as I say, are generally taken to be improvements. But then again, there are some things to which serious objection is taken.  For instance, serious objection is taken to the abolition of the insurance committees, and some of my colleagues who are more intimately associated with the work of these committees will perhaps have something to say on that aspect of the Bill.  The question of the limitation of the rights of insured persons particularly in the matter of sanatorium benefit, and the question of the transfer of that to the boards of health are also objected to, and likewise there is objection to the fact that no provision seems to have been made in the Bill for the officers of the committees that are about to be abolished.</P>
    <P>The question that arises for consideration is what action should be taken.  In a matter of this kind, one has to weigh up the reforms that <Col N="97" /> seem to be of advantage against those to which objection may be taken and see whether it is worth while to go on with the Bill at all. I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy O'Kelly's point of view, although I am not quite sure what exactly would be the effect of carrying his amendment.  It would send back the Bill to the Government, but, at the same time, would that commit them or commit the House to the administration of National Health Insurance through one society?  I would not like to give a vote, here and now, that would commit me to that policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly seemed to treat simplification, unification and nationalisation as if there were no great difference between them, but he must know that there is a very great difference indeed, and I am sure if he would proceed a little further and read the whole of Dr. Rowlette's note in the Interim Report he would see that the difference between nationalisation and unification was stressed there.  Dr. Rowlette wound up his note by saying: &ldquo;Administration by a Government Department is the natural, logical, and economic method for a National Health Insurance system, and is in accordance with the most successful precedents established by other countries, with the exception of Great Britain.  I recommend the adoption of this method in the Saorstát.&rdquo;  He says, of course, that if the Government were unwilling to adopt that method he would take unification as the next best thing.  I would like to see an examination, not alone of the nationalisation of National Health Insurance, but of other insurances, as to why there could not, and should not be a national scheme for other types of insurance as well as this.  For that reason, I would not like to give a vote that would commit me simply to the unification of National Health Insurance by itself.</P>
    <P>On the question or medical benefit, I have much sympathy with Deputy O'Kelly's point, of view again, although what I would like to see would be what was recommended by <Col N="98" /> the trade union society&mdash;a national scheme of medical service, which is not exactly the same as the extension of medical benefits to insured persons.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a question of what line ought to be taken with regard to this Bill.  I do not know that anything would be gained by rejecting the Bill here and now.  I feel that what ought to be done would be to allow it to get a Second Reading, and that we should then do what we could to amend it.  I do not know that the extension of medical benefits might not even be brought in as an amendment to the Bill as it stands, and discussed by itself on the Committee Stage.  Perhaps that is a matter of order, but I cannot see why it could not be done.  But I feel that each one of these reforms ought to be discussed fully by itself and on its own merits, and for that reason I think that the Bill ought to get a Second Reading.  Subject to that, and subject to how far certain amendments which will be submitted will be dealt with, I would hold myself free to vote against it when it has left Committee or on the Final Stage.  Therefore, I think the wisest thing to do would be to let the Bill go to Committee and endeavour to amend it in accordance with what we believe to be the wishes of the approved societies and of the insured persons generally and what would be to their benefit.  If we thought that the Bill, after it had left Committee was not worth going on with, we could then vote against it.  But I think that nothing would be gained by simply putting aside now such reforms as are in it and waiting.  Undoubtedly the two questions of unification or nationalisation and of medical benefits or medical services require very careful investigation, investigation even more careful.  I would say, than what has been given by this Committee, the report of which Deputy O'Kelly quoted.  I think that that would take a very considerable time, and I do not think we should wait to get such reforms as we are getting in this Bill until those questions were fully <Col N="99" /> gone into.  Therefore, I will vote for the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in approval of this Bill dealing with the administration of National Health Insurance.  It has been obvious to everybody for a very long time that the Act of 1911, passed eighteen years ago, requires amendment after those years.  When it was introduced, I was a member of a county council which had more or less to deal with it, and of the Insurance Committee, and I was of the opinion that it was then very faulty and that many things had been forced on the country which, if it had been left to itself, it would not have agreed to.</P>
      <P>There was a very strong attitude taken by certain people in power, and they expected that what they said should be done and nothing else.  They listened to no amendment or change that other people thought might be an improvement.  I think that was the generally accepted thing at the time.  I think this Bill has great possibilities in it.  It removes a great many anomalies which ought never to have been in the original Act that was passed in the year 1911.  I think the abolition of certificates of exemption is a very excellent thing.  It will work well. This ought never have been included in the Act, and the provision, has worked out, as the Minister mentioned himself, most unsatisfactorily. I think it will be a great improvement that all members entitled to enjoy National Insurance should belong to a society and be more or less under more control than they are simply as deposit contributors.</P>

      <P>As regards leakages, there is no doubt that in the matter of domestic servants alone a very large number of people make it their business if possible to evade paying for their servants.  More shame to them.  The servants have not, in many cases, insisted on their rights.  This is a matter that will be <Col N="100" /> set right by this Bill.  That is a very necessary thing too.  I think it is very difficult to say what the leakage in regard to this particular point has been.  I think it will be found to be a very large one when the matter is investigated.  I do not think that anybody has a right to complain if an accredited officer comes into a house and asks to see the cards that the domestic servants have, and see if they are kept in proper order and that each one has a card.  I found in my own experience that a great many have passed through my employment who have come to me with no cards whatever, but who have been in many employments before. These cases are not exceptions.  That is one thing, and an important thing, that will be stopped right away by this Bill which the Minister has introduced.  I have never been myself a very great admirer of Insurance Committees.  I never thought they were very arduous, nor did I think that the results were commensurate with the amount of fuss created when they first came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in many cases a very unwise choice was made of the places for the establishment of sanatoria. Certain strong-willed people selected these places and insisted that the sanatoria should be built on these particular sites and on no other.  To my knowledge, most unsuitable places have been chosen for these buildings.  At least to the ordinary lay mind sites have been chosen that ought not have been chosen.  That is a matter that calls for considerable attention.  There is no doubt that sanatoria treatment is necessary, and I believe it has done a certain amount of good.  The exact amount of good or the exact number of cures I have never seen set out. The doctors, no doubt, can tell us that.  I think that a great deal more might have been done with regard to making them more efficient, to make them work better, and to induce people to go to them, which is sometimes a very difficult business, and one that has been found so from the very commencement.  Deputy O'Kelly has an amendment on the <Col N="101" /> paper with the principle of which we would all agree more or less if the amendment were feasible.  One would have thought at first that when the Bills dealing with insurance were introduced in 1911 that that should have been done.  It might have been done more easily then than now.  In principle we would all agree that one society would be the best.  But against that we have got to consider what the expense of this amalgamation would be, as well as the cost of a new Ministry which would be involved and all the other necessary expenses in connection with the suggested change.  After all, this is not a matter to be lightly regarded.  But perhaps in time, as the Minister says, if it could be carried out, some sort of amalgamation might take place which, of course, will reduce the number of societies down to a very low point, if not into one.  The Minister is evidently most friendly to the idea contained in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Medical benefit is a thing that everybody would approve of if that also could be done.  It was given in the English Act, but, of course, it was more expensive, and for that reason it was not adopted here.  Of the usefulness of this provision no one could have any doubt, but its feasibility is another question. Whether it could be done at this time is also another question.  The Minister expressed his approval of the idea, as we all do.  I think it is a very good thing that the matter of medical certificates should be settled, because that, in my opinion, has always been the crux.  One doctor says: &ldquo;It is not my business to certify about this man; where am I to get my fee for doing so; who is to pay me for this?&rdquo;  That is a matter that will be set right, and it is not a small matter, for while doctors are differing patients are dying.  I think this Bill is a very good one, and a great improvement on what has hitherto been the law.  Altogether I feel that in this Bill there are great possibilities, and I have great hopes that when it passes on to the Statute Book the combined genius of the <Col N="102" /> Dáil will have put into it certain necessary improvements which no doubt will meet the approval of the majority of us and possibly of the Minister, too.  I am sure the country will welcome this Bill.  The people have been looking for this Bill for a long time.  I hope and believe it will work well and will offer benefit to the poor of the country and to the workers of this country for the betterment of whose position it has been introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much surprised to hear Deputy O'Connell announce that he intended to vote for the Bill as against the amendment. I think that his decision to do so was possibly due to a misunderstanding of the amendment.  Deputy O'Kelly moved his amendment because it was obvious that when a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee was introduced which omitted any reference to the recommendations dealing with medical benefit and the unification of approved societies, it was tantamount to a declaration by the Executive Council that they rejected the recommendations of the Committee in these matters.  If Deputy O'Connell and his colleagues persist in their attitude towards this amendment they will, I think, appear to be supporting the Government in this matter.  Of course Deputy O'Connell did not positively state that his Party favoured the institution of medical benefit or the unification of approved societies, but he said they were prepared to give these proposals sympathetic consideration. I think I can say, however, without appearing to be a carping critic, that one would have expected the leader of the Labour Party to have made up his mind upon questions of this kind before now.  Whatever agitation there existed in this country in favour of the institution of medical benefits and the unification of approved societies, it was largely due to the efforts of persons associated with the present Labour Party.  That fact makes it very difficult for me to <Col N="103" /> understand Deputy O'Connell's attitude now.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell said one thing with which I am in complete agreement. He said that if we are going to amend the system of social insurance in this country we should go much further than a mere patching up of the existing law and should endeavour to embrace within its scope a number of services which are now excluded.  I think it is possible, and not merely possible but obviously desirable, that a scheme of social insurance should be enacted that would include health insurance, industrial insurance, pensions for widows and orphans and compulsory insurance for employers against their liability under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  I can see no reason why it should not be possible to include in the one scheme provisions dealing with all these matters.  If unemployment insurance could be included as well, although that would be very difficult, you would thus be guaranteeing the worker against any of the various evils that he will have to meet and that may bring poverty and destitution upon himself or upon his family&mdash;unemployment, sickness, accident, old age or, finally, death. In other countries they are working towards the establishment of comprehensive schemes of that nature. It is only here we appear to be content with mere patchwork legislation that seems to have no particular aim at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we cannot get the Executive Council or a majority of the members of the Dáil to take the step I have suggested of embarking upon a thoroughly comprehensive scheme of social insurance, I think we should expect to receive at least the support of the members of the Labour Party and a large number of the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in pressing for the enactment of the improvements in the National Insurance Acts which have been recently effected in Great Britain.  The provision of additional facilities under these Acts, such as has been enacted in Great Britain, was recommended very strongly in <Col N="104" /> the report of the Commission dealing with the relief of the sick and destitute poor which was published here in 1927.  They point out in the report that for a combined contribution of 1/6d. for men and 1/1d, for women there would be provided sickness benefit for twenty-six weeks at 15/- a week (12/- to women); disablement benefit at the rate of 7/6d. a week for men and women up to the age of 65; an old age pension from 65 to 70 at 10/- a week.  At 70 years the old age pension would be paid under the Old Age Pensions Act, but without any further inquiry. If a husband has been insured for 104 weeks and dies, leaving a widow, the widow would receive a pension of 10/- a week.  If she has children she would receive an additional allowance for every child beginning with 5/- for the first child and 3/- for every subsequent child.  The children's allowance would continue if the widow marries again.  Each orphan would receive 7/6 per week until he or she would reach the specified age, which is 14 years.</P>
    <P>That scheme is in operation in Great Britain and they were able to graft these additional benefits on to the existing Insurance Act which is now in operation in this country. There seems to be no administrative difficulty in adopting similar legislation here.  We have constantly heard Ministers tell us that the way to have unification in this country is to make conditions so attractive here that the people of the Six Counties will be very anxious in their own interests to come in.  Instead of moving in that direction, we are going actually in the opposite direction.  The gap between the Free State and the Six Counties is widening to our detriment.  In the Six Counties, social legislation is being enacted for the benefit of the people there, and here we do not appear to be moving in that direction at all.  I admit that these things cannot be done without money, but money must be found for them.  If the job of financing such schemes is properly undertaken, I have no doubt it would be possible to bring them to achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> That does not apply to the proposals made in this amendment.  The recommendation of the Committee, that at least medical benefit should be given to Irish insured workers, is one that has received the consent of every Committee that examined this question since a scheme of National Health Insurance was first instituted.  Committees or Commissions have been repeatedly examining this question since 1913 and every one of them recommended that some system of medical benefits should be instituted. The reason is quite obvious.  The National Health Insurance Acts were not passed merely to provide insurance against the loss of employment through sickness, but that is all, in fact, that they are doing. These Acts were intended to operate for the prevention and cure of sickness, and in that respect they have been a complete failure in Ireland. Nothing has been done to prevent sickness, particularly industrial diseases.  Nothing has been done to cure them.  We merely provide a payment to the worker for twenty-six weeks while he is suffering from incapacity, or 7/6 a week for life if he is permanently disabled.</P>
    <P>The case for instituting medical benefit is that the Acts are not fulfilling their main function without it.  The main function of the Acts is to improve public health, to provide for the prevention and cure of sickness, and to enable the State to have information at its disposal which would enable it to trace the causes of diseases, particularly of industrial diseases, and enact legislation that would be directed against their removal. Of course, there are other arguments in favour of medical benefits besides that.  I am prepared to admit that the arguments against medical benefits are very strong, and any person coming to an examination of this question with a purely financial outlook upon it will probably find himself influenced against the institution of any system of medical benefit here, on the ground that some percentage of the insured population have already medical services <Col N="106" /> provided for them free of cost under the Medical Charities Act.  I am not at all sure that the percentage is anything like as high as that stated by certain members of the Committee. They allege, I think, that it is 75 per cent.  I do not think that it is anything as high as that.  Undoubtedly, a very large percentage of insured persons are in a position to get free medical service under the poor law, but they object to doing so because of the taint of pauperism which attaches to all charitable provisions of that kind.  The ideal solution of the problem is to provide free medical services for all.  There is no doubt whatever that Deputy O'Connell is quite right when he said that. This Committee recommended it as the ideal solution, but also pointed out that it would cost something like one and a half million pounds a year in excess of what we are now paying for the dispensary system, and that they could hot see any possibility of getting this sum made available for the purpose of providing free medical service.  But if we cannot have free medical service, we at least can devise some scheme of medical benefit which will meet the particular difficulties that exist in this country.  I cannot see why it should not be possible at least to provide medical benefit for the workers in urban areas, or why any scheme devised must apply uniformly to them all.  There may be administrative difficulties.  In fact, the whole plea made by the Minister against medical benefit and unification was the fact that administrative difficulties would arise.  I think we have heard the phrase, administrative difficulties, so often in relation to the work of the Department of Local Government that we are beginning to wonder if there is any difficulty which the Department is capable of overcoming. They always seem to take the line of least resistance when they come up against a difficulty.  Undoubtedly, it is not going to be an easy matter to devise a system of medical benefit for insured workers that will fit in with the medical charities system without considerable overlapping, but it can be done, <Col N="107" /> I believe, if a serious effort is made to do it by people who realise the necessity for some such provision being made.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we had a system of medical benefit in operation it would be possible to reduce very considerably the claims made for sickness benefit upon the Insurance funds.  There is no doubt that if workers were in a position to get, free of charge, medical advice, there would be much less illness and consequently a much smaller drain upon the funds of the societies, which would result in the societies being able to pay additional benefits to their members.</P>
    <P>Medical benefit would also provide, as has been pointed out, a very valuable check upon irregular certification. It will be generally admitted that there is a very considerable amount of what is called irregular certification.  It is noticeable that some 40 per cent. of the cases referred to the medical referees have been declared by these referees as being fit for work, and every approved society meeting in the country that is reported in the Press always contains some reference to irregular certification.  I have here the annual report published this year of the G.S. &amp; W.R. Health Insurance Employees' Benefit Fund, and they say: &ldquo;We are of opinion that the cause of the excessive sickness claims is due to lax and indifferent medical certification.  We have no reasonable complaint against a great number of medical certifiers whose certificates come before us, but there are several who require a little more backbone in the faithful discharge of their duties to approved societies.&rdquo;  If a system of medical benefits were in operation, of course any necessity for a separate expenditure upon certification would not be necessary, and irregular certification would cease to be one of the evils attaching to National Health Insurance.</P>
    <P>The Committee on National Health Insurance elaborate in great detail a scheme of medical benefits.  I believe that that scheme was workable if it had been attempted; but if, for any <Col N="108" /> reason, it does not appeal to the Minister, or to the Executive Council, surely they are not going to let the question stand at that?  They should go ahead and work out some other scheme of a less elaborate nature, if they think it is so advisable, but, nevertheless, some scheme to provide medical benefit for those insured workers who need it.  It is not every worker that likes to secure medical advice under the Medical Charities Act.  In fact, it is well known that there are a large number of workers who insist on paying for medical advice, even though they are not in a position to do so, sooner than come under the Poor Law, and these workers would be very glad to be in a position, as a result of their own contributions, to be able to demand free medical attention and medicine as a right.</P>
    <P>While I am on that, I would ask the Minister to explain to us what will be the position of insured persons with respect to sanatorium benefit.  In the past, insured workers paid a contribution which entitled them to such benefit.  In other words, they got sanatorium treatment as a right, free of charge.  They will continue to pay the same contribution, and we are told they will get sanatorium treatment now as in the past, except that it will be administered by the Board of Health instead of the Insurance Committees.  But will they be entitled to get it as a right, free of charge?  That is an important point that should be made clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanatorium benefit is abolished, but the local government bodies who were getting money out of insurance funds and in return giving free sanatorium treatment to insured workers will still be getting that money, except that it will come from the State instead of from insurance funds.  The insurance money, however, will be used to pay the cost of medical certification, which was heretofore borne by the State.  The State is being relieved of a great part of the cost of medical certification <Col N="109" /> which it met, and in exchange is taking on a liability to pay a contribution in respect of the upkeep of sanatoria for the local government bodies.  The worker's contribution is not being reduced.  The State's contribution is not being increased. Somewhere somebody is making something if the workers are being deprived of the right, which they had heretofore, of free sanatorium treatment. I can see no reason why the local government bodies cannot continue to give the insured workers free sanatorium treatment, as in the past, even though the Bill as it stands becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>I think also that the case for unification&mdash;I will use that word as the best one that comes to me&mdash;of approved societies is very strong. It has been stated, and not contradicted, that 40 per cent. of the total contributions under the Act is now spent in administration.  If that is correct, it is an abnormally high proportion, and I think it is greater than in any form of commercial insurance with the possible exception of industrial insurance. It is also said that with the unification of approved societies the cost of administration would be reduced by some sixty per cent.  If that is correct, and I believe it is, then the case for unification is overwhelming because it means that insured workers throughout the country are being deprived of increased sickness benefit, or dental benefit, or hospital benefit, or some other form of benefit which they could have, in order to keep those numerous societies with their numerous staffs in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that unification would result in cheaper administration, I hold that the pooling of results over the entire population when insurance is compulsory is really fundamental.  We have at present various societies. One society is composed of certain members in certain sheltered, well-paid, comfortable occupations&mdash;a society that caters for bank clerks, for instance.  That society will have a very small number of claims in relation lo sickness.  Their members <Col N="110" /> are in continuous well-paid employment and they will have at every valuation a big disposable surplus, with which they can give additional benefits to their members.  Another society caters for dock labourers, who are in casual and unhealthy and dangerous employment, and it will have a very much higher number of claims for sickness benefit; the regularity of the contributions will be less and there will not be any surplus when the valuation comes about, and they will find it difficult to pay the minimum statutory benefits to members.  That is not right.  If we are to have compulsory insurance for all workers as the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is defined under the Acts, the results should be spread over all and every single member of the society.  Every single insured person who pays a contribution&mdash;and they all pay the same contribution&mdash;ought to be entitled with every other person to any increased benefits that may be possible in consequence of a reduced number of claims over the three-year period or should be compelled to bear the loss if there is no disposable surplus in consequence of an increased number of claims over the three-year period.</P>
    <P>There is no country in the world except Great Britain that devised that extraordinary system of administering a social insurance scheme.  Here we have sixty-five societies, with sixty-five staffs and sixty-five sets of agents, who are often in competition against each other for members&mdash;healthy members, of course&mdash;eating up the funds that should be made available for the payment of benefits to insured workers.  I believe that if we were starting this health insurance scheme now there is no one in this Dáil would be mad enough to suggest that we should adopt the system adopted in 1911 in order to meet the conditions that existed in England at that time.  Opinion in favour of unification throughout informed classes of the population is very strong and not confined to any one class.  I have here a report of a lecture given by Mr. L.J. Duffy before the Statistical Society, in which he <Col N="111" /> said, speaking as a representative of the workers: &ldquo;In my opinion the outstanding defect in the National Health Insurance scheme as administered in this country, is the approved societies system,&rdquo; and, in elaborating that view, he described it as &ldquo;wasteful, inequitable and inefficient.&rdquo;  At the same meeting Mr. J.C.M. Eason expressed similar views on behalf of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce; so when we find representatives of employers and employed who are all of the opinion that the present system of administration is wrong, surely it is not right that it should be continued merely because the Department of Local Government sees certain administrative difficulties in changing it.  It can be changed, I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech gave me the impression that the only difficulty that was worrying him was the necessity of having to make certain provisions for redundant staffs of these approved societies.  In other words, that they might possibly have to be supported out of the Exchequer for a period instead of being on the funds that should be available for the payment of benefit for the sick insured workers.  The system is entirely wasteful.  It could not be anything else when you have sixty-five societies very often in competition with one another.  It is inequitable. The result of a compulsory insurance scheme should be spread over every person included in that system.  It should not be possible for any one privileged section to cut themselves off from the rest and enjoy additional benefits.  It is inefficient. There are, I am sure, a number of towns in this country with three or four hundred workers and twenty or twenty-five approved societies competing among themselves to get these three or four hundred workers included on their membership roll.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that he is going to put certain proposals before us at the Committee Stage. He is apparently under the impression <Col N="112" /> from the figures relating to the number of approved societies that there is a tendency towards amalgamation.  There is possibly a tendency towards amalgamation, although it is not unlikely that a number of those societies that disappeared, disappeared because they had not been properly managed, and the Insurance Commissioners wound them up when they found they were not able to carry on.  The tendency, therefore, is bound to become less noticeable as the number of approved societies decreases. When we see a drop of ten or twelve societies at the end of the two or three years' period we think we are making fast progress, but as the number of societies grows less and less the tendency towards amalgamation will grow less.  I do not think the proposals the Minister has put before us to give certain facilities for compensating redundant staffs is likely to help the process towards unification to any great extent.  Even if it did, and if in five or six years' time we found there were eight or nine or ten or twelve approved societies I still think that there would be seven or nine or eleven too many.  My view is that we should administer the National Health Insurance through one society.  I am against nationalisation.  Amongst the workers of Dublin with whom I discussed this matter the strongest argument they could advance against unification was that the ultimate result would be that National Health Insurance would be administered as Unemployment Insurance is administered. No one will say that the administration of the Unemployment Insurance is right.  In Dublin at present it is administered very much as outdoor relief is administered. The workers are getting unemployment benefit not as a right for which they have contributed but as a form of charity, and they fear the same spirit would come into National Health Insurance if it was administered as a State Department.</P>
    <P>Our view is that a new organisation should be started by the State with branches throughout the country, controlled by regional committees, <Col N="113" /> to which there should be transferred all members of existing approved societies just as in this Bill you are proposing to transfer deposit contributors to approved societies.  I cannot see any administrative difficulty in getting that done. There may be certain temporary provisions which will have to be made and certain precautions which will have to be taken to ensure that no insured person will suffer in consequence of the new arrangements. Certain provisions will have to be made to provide for the redundant staffs of approved societies.  These things could and should be done. Even if a certain amount of expenditure may be involved at this stage to bring about that change it will more than repay itself in the saving in administrative costs which will result. If we can get down the administrative costs by 60 per cent. through unification then let us get unification.  If the Ministry of Local Government see too many difficulties in the way I suggest that they should set up a Committee of the Dáil to show them how to do their work in that connection.  The same remark applies to medical benefits. If they desired to set up a proper system in the Department of Local Government they would long since have got over the administrative difficulties about which the Minister talks.  He tells us that the time has not come when we can come to a conclusion as to the most satisfactory method of administering or financing a system of medical benefits. If we wait for the Ministry of Local Government to come to a conclusion as to the most satisfactory system of administering medical benefits we will have to wait a long time.  I believe that the Dáil should force them to take action by refusing to pass the Bill until they have made provision, as the amendment asks, for the administration of National Health Insurance through one society and for initiating a scheme of medical benefits for insured workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the statement made by the Minister he pointed out that the effect of the Bill would be to make certain economies.  Certain <Col N="114" /> economies are proposed under the Bill which would be desirable, but there are other economies which in my opinion would be very undesirable. I agree with what has been said in regard to getting rid of the term &ldquo;exempted person.&rdquo;  I believe that it is desirable that we should have unification in that respect at any rate.  That would apply to people who are called deposit contributors. I want to touch on what I consider to be a very serious proposal, a proposal to confiscate the rights of insured persons in regard to sanatorium benefit.  This is confiscation pure and simple, and it is entirely unjust.  In so far as my view of that matter goes, I am opposed to that proposal anyway.  It is also proposed that the work carried on by the insurance committees in the matter of administering sanatorium benefits is in future to be carried on otherwise.  I heard with some surprise the statement made in the course of the debate that insurance committees did little good and that there was too much fuss about them.  I do not think that that is a fair statement of the facts.  I think that the major portion of the work to educate people in the matter or the treatment of tuberculosis and to eliminate tuberculosis has largely been carried on by insurance committees. From that point of view I feel that it is quite wrong that that work should be taken out of their hands.  What are we going to get in return?  Boards of Health will be asked to administer sanatorium benefits in addition to their ordinary work.  Members of these boards are up to their eyes in work in connection with labourers' cottages and so forth, and cannot be expected to take on themselves this additional service.  The service will be materially injured if that course is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, what right has the Department morally to steal from people who are paying National Health Insurance contributions for certain State benefits and to ask them to go to boards of health to receive treatment as if they were destitute persons? <Col N="115" /> They are not destitute, because the Act of Parliament that provides benefits for them settles their rights.  It is unfair to filch these rights from them and to put them into the category of people who are destitute and who have to receive treatment in that way.  In some cases, at any rate, insurance committees have gone far in their efforts to treat cases of tuberculosis, even to the extent of sending people out of the country at considerable expense to get treatment.  Does the Minister believe that the Boards of Health, having many other financial commitments and being mainly composed of people who are out to save money at any cost, will give the same facilities to insured persons as were given by insurance committees? I say that they will not. It will simply mean that consumptives will be dumped in the county home.  That is a serious position, and I will oppose that proposal so far as I can.  On the other hand, I am glad that there is a proposal in the Bill to enable Commissioners to recover all arrears of contributions.</P>
    <P>While offences committed for retaining contributions of this kind might be met by a fine hitherto, the person who had to be insured would suffer, because all the contributions could not be recovered.  In that connection, in my opinion, one of the reasons why there is such irregularity in the matter of paying insurance contributions is, to some extent, the manner in which the Commissioners deal with cases of this kind. Ordinary cases of non-compliance are dealt with in a too round-about way.  In my opinion the interval that is allowed to elapse between the time when the inspector reports cases of non-compliance and when the file comes back from the Department is too long, much longer than is necessary and too much time is taken up in dealing with cases of that kind.  I think that the National Health Commissioners have to shoulder a good deal of responsibility for that position, and I am glad to see that an effort is being <Col N="116" /> made in this Bill to put an end to it. I think that a Bill of this kind should contain provisions for medical benefits, but I am quite clear that it is not the best way to secure that by simply rejecting this Bill.  There are valuable provisions in the Bill, and I am not prepared to take the responsibility of voting for the rejection of the Bill because of the omission that has been referred to. I cannot see any reason why this whole matter could not be gone into on the Committee Stage by an amendment brought in on that stage.  I remember when the National Health Insurance Act of 1911 was being passed a very strong demand was made in this country for the inclusion of medical benefit. One has only to remember what the position was then and how useless it was to criticise an Act that was brought in with the benediction of our own representatives at that time.  I think the attitude taken up by Deputy O'Connell in this matter is the sensible attitude, because it permits of an examination of the whole question.  While I am opposed to the elimination of insurance committees and the filching away of the rights of insured persons to sanatorium treatment, I am prepared to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill and to reserve my right to change my attitude on certain points on the subsequent stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Connell has stated, this is a very difficult Bill for the ordinary individual to understand.  The one thing that I am anxious to ascertain is whether insured persons enjoy under the Bill the same advantages they enjoy under the 1911 Act.  I have been informed that the 1911 Act was not the perfect instrument that some of us here have been led to believe it was.  I have been told that under the 1911 Act funds were frequently insufficient to give sanatorium treatment, and that under that Act it was a case of first come, first served.  I am assured that under the present Act everybody is entitled to sanatorium treatment, and that the position of insured persons <Col N="117" /> will be identical with the position they enjoyed under the 1911 Act, except for the difference that everybody suffering from the scourge of tuberculosis will receive treatment under the Act.  Nobody will be neglected.  It is a decided advantage to insured persons, and even to uninsured persons, that persons who are or are not insured under the Act will be entitled to this treatment.</P>
      <P>Two objections were made by the Opposition to the Second Reading of the Bill.  The first was under the heading of unification, and the second on the question of medical benefit.  I think the Minister has very effectively dealt with the first objection under the heading of unification. He has promised to introduce, on the Committee Stage, an amendment dealing with unification, first dealing with it on a voluntary basis and then, after a period of two years, dealing with it on a compulsory basis.  I think that that is a very reasonable amendment and one that should meet the opinion of all sides of the House.  A period of two years will not be very long to wait until we have compulsory unification introduced, if it has not been completed in that time.  I think the attitude of the Minister on the question of medical benefit was eminently reasonable, because he pointed out that the whole question of medical benefit was an exceedingly difficult one, and that admission was made by those who spoke against the Second Reading of the Bill.  He said that in his opinion it would be necessary to survey the whole question in conjunction with the Free State dispensary system.  Much has been said against the Free State dispensary system, and suggestions have been made that the taint of pauperism is connected with it.  In my experience of the City of Dublin, I know a great many people who avail themselves of the dispensary system who could afford to pay a doctor, and I do not agree with the contention that any taint of pauperism attaches to that particular system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one reason I rose to speak on the Bill was to ask what will be done <Col N="118" /> for the redundant officials whose redundancy will arise under the abolition of the Insurance Committees. The Minister has promised compensation for disemploycd officials under the voluntary scheme of unification which he proposes to introduce on the Committee Stage of the Bill, but the Minister has said nothing at all as to what will be done for those disemployed under this Bill when it becomes law.  These are difficult times, as everybody knows, for a person who becomes disemployed to endeavour to find any means of earning a subsistence.  I ask the Minister will it be possible for him to introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage to give disemployed persons, who are disemployed owing to the passage of the Bill, some reasonable compensation for the loss of employment.  I would urge that there have been many precedents for that, and I cannot see why these people should not receive the same treatment under this Bill as other officials have received in different places on similar occasions. In England compensation for displaced officials has been given under two Acts.</P>
    <P>I understand that under the Transport Act of 1919, and also by Section 121 of the Local Government Act of 1898, such compensation is given. Under the latter Act, for an actual service of twenty years there was an addition of ten-sixtieths, and there was a graded scale of compensation for officials whose services ranged from twenty years down to five years.  I would ask the Minister to incorporate a similar provision for the compensation of dismissed officials in this Bill.  There is an analogous case and a Free State precedent for the incorporation of provisions for compensation such as I ask.  Under the Railways Act of 1924 a similar basis was adopted in the case of displacement of officials, and those who had less than five years' service received a payment of one-sixth of the annual salary and emoluments for each completed year of service instead of an annual allowance.  Why should officials who <Col N="119" /> have rendered good and faithful service to the State on the Committees not receive the same compensation as has been meted out to other officials?  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to give us a promise on the Second Reading of the Bill that he will at least mete out the same measure of justice to those who will be displaced by the passage of the Bill, as has been given to similar individuals on similar occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the plea of Deputy Byrne on behalf of the officials.  The Insurance Committee formerly consisted of representatives of the Commissioners, representatives from the insured persons, and representatives from the contributing bodies.  Under the 1911 Act an insured person was entitled to sanatorium treatment for either himself, his wife, or his dependants. Under the present Bill an insured person will continue to pay for sanatorium benefit, but he will be at the mercy of the Board of Health as to whether he will receive the treatment or not.  At the present time non-insured persons are being given treatment under the county scheme. Non-insured persons, children and others, are entitled to receive sanatorium treatment, but no such treatment as insurance committees give will be given by the Board of Health.  In the first place, a large number of the members of the Board of Health will have no experience of the administration of sanatorium treatment, and I doubt if many members of the Board of Health will sanction treatment in a sanatorium or treatment in a foreign country, or give treatment to dependants of an insured person, children and others, for two or three years in the various hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this Bill has been brought in with a view to assisting ratepayers and with a view to assisting in reducing the cost for sanatorium treatment under your new county medical officers scheme.  The Minister stated that nearly all the insurance committees had made <Col N="120" /> agreements with county boards of health.  I am aware that the Minister's Department sent out circulars to county boards of health urging them to endeavour to make agreements with county insurance committees&mdash;to get the insurance committees to make agreements with them so that the boards of health could use the funds of the insurance committees to give sanatorium treatment to non-insured persons.  I am also aware that certain insurance committees refused to come to any agreement with the boards of health. They took up the attitude that as they were appointed to look solely after the interests of insured persons that their funds would be used solely in improving the health of the sick people insured with them.  A number of county councils had a scheme for the treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis.  Other county councils refused to provide anything of the kind.  They took up the attitude: &ldquo;Let the county insurance committees appoint persons.&rdquo; One Deputy said that he was not aware of any great fuss being made by the insurance committees. That, I suggest, shows a want of knowledge of the work done by insurance committees.  Insurance committees desire to treat all their afflicted members in secret.  They do not want the Press to be present, because reports might be published indicating that the number of afflicted people had increased within a certain period.  The work is done quietly.  I might say also that the work is being carried out at a very small cost to the Government.  I should say that not 5 per cent. of the cost of the administration goes for sanatorium treatment.  The proposal is to displace the existing officials.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed the work will be under the control of the County Boards of Health, and you will have to appoint extra officials.  Existing officials deprived of their positions will have to be pensioned.  It will also mean the creation of new positions under the Boards of Health for the purpose of carrying out the Act. <Col N="121" /> I appeal to the Minister to leave the administration of sanatorium benefit for insured persons as it is at present with the Insurance Committees.  The insured persons have their representatives on those committees.  The Government, through the Insurance Commission, have their representatives on them as well as the contributing body.  But if the administration is to be carried out by the Boards of Health the insured persons will cease to be entitled to any benefit, because Section 22 of the Bill says that benefits in the matter of sanatorium treatment will cease after the 1st January.  The result will be that the insured person will have no voice in the administration of the Act.  Speaking from my experience of members of Boards of Health, the insured persons paying for benefits that they are now being deprived of by Act of Parliament will have my greatest sympathy.  At present in my county the Board of Health is carrying on work that was formerly done by five rural district councils and four boards of guardians. That Board is obliged to hold two meetings in the month.  When the work under this Act is added on the Board will have to hold an extra meeting each month.  As it is, the members of the Board are overburdened with the amount of work they have to do.  I defy any member of a Board of Health to say that all the work relating to the housing schemes, sanitation and various other matters connected with the social welfare of the people can be properly attended to in the few hours allotted each month for a Board meeting.  The work is being rushed, and is not getting the attention that it received formerly when you had five district councils and four boards of guardians attending to it.  I agree that some of the amendments proposed in this Bill are good.  At the same time I would appeal to the Minister to bring in amendments to meet the points that have been put to him from these benches.  If he is not prepared to do that, then we intend to bring in some amendments.  I, like Deputy O'Connell, reserve to myself the <Col N="122" /> right, if the amendments which we have indicated are not accepted by the Government, to vote against the Bill on the final stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputy Lemass that we are not out against medical benefits.  Deputy O'Connell has clearly stated our position.  We want to consider the matter carefully. Speaking for myself, I am not prepared to rush in and vote for a Bill to give medical benefits to men who are only in receipt of 30/- a week.  At the present time 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the insured people in my constituency are entitled to free medical benefit.  They avail of the Charities Act for their benefit.  Therefore, I am not going to give any promise before I see the Minister's Bill, which may increase the contributions from those men who are only in receipt of 30/- a week merely for the sake of giving to 30 per cent. benefits that they can afford at the present time.  An insured person getting medical benefit may have to pay an increased contribution. He cannot very well afford to do that out of a wage of 30/- a week.  Until the Minister brings in a Bill, or until Deputy Lemass introduces an amendment giving an indication as to how the money is to be raised, I for one am not prepared to Support this Bill.  On the Committee Stage, I propose to introduce amendments with a view to improving it.  The Minister has made a promise as regards the voluntary winding-up of certain insurance societies that he will treat the officials by giving them compensation for loss of office.  I say that the clerks engaged by insurance committees are entitled to no less generous treatment than officials received under the amalgamation scheme.  I hope that the insured people throughout the country will realise the seriousness of this Bill.  This Bill has been brought in for the purpose of dealing with insurance.  It is good in some respects, but I certainly object to the section which proposes to deprive insured persons of rights and benefits for which they have been making provision by their contributions since 1911.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly.  Some members of the Dáil seem to be prepared to take this Bill very easily. They know that when the Estimates are discussed here annually we are precluded from discussing matters upon them which should rightly be dealt with by legislation.  The National Health Insurance question is one that has been considered by several Committees and Commissions. This is the first opportunity that this Party, at any rate, has had of discussing the question from the legislative point of view.  We, therefore, are anxious to impress upon the Government the necessity for taking steps to reorganise the whole system, if possible, before this Bill passes through all its stages.  The Minister's opening statement, in which he gave us a brief explanation of the different clauses in the Bill, was, to my mind, unsatisfying.  I could not gather from him what are the ultimate intentions of the Government.  The amendment of Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly has done good work in so far as it has forced from the Minister the promise that the question of unification will have to be considered, and that definite steps will have to be taken, to bring it about after two years, whether or not progress may be made before that time.  But, I wonder why the Minister could not have taken steps before this, because the Commission which sat in 1924 recommended unification.  Surely the National Health Insurance Commissioners, in collaboration with the Minister, must have discussed this question.  It seems extraordinary that the only reply of the Minister to the question for or against unification is to rush along when he has failed to include it in the Bill in the first instance and to say, &ldquo;I am going to bring in an amendment to deal with that.&rdquo; We want to know the arguments against unification.  If there are such arguments I have not heard of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only people opposed to unification, it would seem, are the approved societies.  If that is clear <Col N="124" /> we have advanced so far.  The question is what are the arguments the approved societies are able to put forward?  One of their arguments. I suppose, would be that in the future National Health Insurance was liable to be extended.  &ldquo;The system will expand,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;as in England, and if you want to expand and improve the system you will want us, the approved societies.&rdquo; The Minister has not given the faintest indication that there is going to be any extension of benefits, and, therefore, that makes the case in favour of unification very much stronger.  I cannot for the life of me see why any member of the Dáil should not force the Government to take this question in hand now and not in two years time.  As regards the question of medical benefit, it seems to me that if medical benefit is not in our National Health Insurance scheme why call it a health insurance scheme at all?  As an English writer said recently, call it a burial insurance scheme if you like, or some other insurance scheme, but if you are not going to provide for the health and proper treatment of your contributors do not persist in calling it a National Health Insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne says that the present scheme is not perfect.  We know it is not perfect.  It is almost twenty years in operation, and there is no reason why our Irish Government should not attempt to improve upon it drastically if they see fit. If the position is that they feel their difficulties are too great and they cannot overcome them; that the expense is too great, or that the trouble of organisation cannot be undertaken for some reason, let us know the reason.  It may be the case, and I believe it is, that the Government have not been able to make up their minds on this matter, and that they are taking advantage of the fact that this whole question of national health insurance, which is a very technical question, as it is obscured in a maze of technicalities that the ordinary man in the street cannot understand, and I think that even the ordinary T.D. no matter <Col N="125" /> how much he burrows will fail to get to the labyrinthian recesses of the operations of the approved societies; but no matter what the difficulties and technicalities are the fact is that the keystone of the are is not there &mdash;that is medical benefit.  In my opinion the National Health Insurance scheme without medical benefit is like the famous canal we have in the west of Ireland which connects Lough Corrib with Lough Mask, and which like more of our canals is sadly in need of traffic and navigation, but it is also in need of water owing to the fact that it was made of porous limestone and the water could not be got to stay in it.  The money for the National Health Insurance scheme seems to be going through some porous limestone or other represented by the central administration, the approved societies and the various other expenses of administration, and the thing that ought to be there as a very real safeguard for the people, the original idea of the whole system of national health insurance, the prevention of disease, is not there.</P>
    <P>There are a number of arguments against medical benefit.  The Labour Party have refused to support this amendment, but they have stated no arguments against medical benefit. I do not think they could very well do so.  They say they are compelled to vote for the Bill as against the amendment.  In doing so, in my opinion, they are putting back the question of medical benefit, and this is an opportunity for the Labour Party, as well as for any other members who are interested in this question, to take up the question of medical benefit and try to get the Government to do something, for goodness knows when legislation will be introduced again.  Deputy Murphy says that valuable concessions have been given.  I would like to know what the valuable concessions are.  He seemed to be talking against them most of the time as if they were disadvantages.  As far as I can gather from the trend of his remarks, he is highly dissatisfied with the idea of taking away sanatorium benefit.  He thinks that is <Col N="126" /> very bad, and he does not approve of the abolition of the Insurance Committees.  How he can come around later on and say that the Bill gives valuable concessions while those two features are radical parts, and of which he disapproves, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how he can get in his amendments on the Committee Stage. The important points outside administrative changes are the abolition of insurance committees and the abolition of sanatorium benefit. I fail to see how any other question, although there are many bigger questions, can be brought in.  The Second Beading is, to my mind, the time to point out what is not in the Bill, and not to be trying to get things in afterwards, as the Ceann Comhairle has often explained, that should be brought in on the Second Reading.  It is going to be pretty difficult to do so later, if I know the Ceann Comhairle.  There are a great number of arguments against medical benefit.  The Local Government medical expert says that one argument against it is that we are very well provided with medical attendance at present.  He says we have a perfect network of medical facilities in Dublin.  I doubt that very much. You have facilities in Dublin because you have a large number of hospitals which look after the sick poor, but the Insurance Commissioners are not paying the hospitals for the treatment the hospitals are giving the sick poor.  In any case, whatever treatment the poor people may happen to get gratis in hospitals has nothing to do with the question of dispensary service, which, in the opinion of this expert, is a thing that makes additional medical benefit under the Insurance Act unnecessary.</P>
    <P>He says we have three-fourths of our insured persons getting dispensary service free.  Dispensary service, if I might say so without offence to those who practise it, very often consists of a bottle of medicine. What the bottle of medicine is nobody knows, least of all the people who are getting it.  They have the <Col N="127" /> idea that since they are entitled to free treatment and since there are bottles of medicine going, if they can get a bottle of medicine that is all right.  That is the great idea with many people as regards free dispensary service.  At its best dispensary service can hardly he said to be treatment for the prevention of disease.  You want to carry on that treatment for a long period of time, and you want to have a place for hospitals in your scheme, so that people will not have to rely on a bottle of medicine and a few words from the doctor, but that they will have continuous visits from the doctor.  If necessary the scheme should provide for the transfer of these people to the hospital. The dispensary system, in many places, is not satisfactory.  I do not know whether the doctors or the patients are to blame, but I am sure every Deputy knows that the red ticket system is not operating as it was intended to operate, and that the sick poor are not getting the benefit of that red ticket system.  In the west of Ireland it is well known that the dispensary doctors are paid, though the medical expert says that the dispensary doctors are giving free treatment. In the report of the Poor Law Commission, which has gone so far uncontradicted, you have evidence given that the poor people always pay the dispensary doctor when they get his advice and his bottle of medicine, but I am not concerned at the moment with whether they pay or not.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with is to try to build up a proper organisation under National Health Insurance.  The National Health Insurance Commission themselves said that the dispensary system should be taken over; either transfer the whole thing to the Department of Local Government and make it a public health branch, or else abolish the dispensary system and create a new system on the lines of the panel, where you will not have the present <Col N="128" /> system where the poor people are paying perhaps out of proportion to their means, and other people who can well afford it avail of the dispensaries and pay nothing.  If that is the case in the city of Dublin it is not the case in the country.  I know rich people, who can well afford it, come up to the city of Dublin hospitals and take advantage of whatever free treatment they can get there.  We ought to try to distribute the expense.  Our contributors have been paying the same as the English contributors for the past 20 years, and they have not got this medical benefit, and although sanatorium benefit was abandoned in England lately the English seem to have given a great number of additional benefits, so that nobody can say we are following the English example.</P>
    <P>We are following the English example all right in cutting off sanatorium benefit, but we are not following the English example in trying to effect economies or give additional benefits.  We have the position that our contributors at present are paying, I think, 7d. and 8d. per woman or man as against 4d., which was the cost to the contributor weekly originally, and there is no improvement practically in the value of the service given.  At the same time the Minister for Local Government, when he sees fit, increases the salaries of dispensary doctors in Mayo without consulting anybody.  Now I ask him to turn around and consider the condition of the people whom those doctors are supposed to look after, and if he is reorganising this scheme and wants to improve it, to weigh up the whole question of the dispensary system and try to put it on some basis such as the panel basis</P>
    <P>It was mentioned by Deputy Sir James Craig last year in a debate here that some 18 out of 31 societies had some forms of medical benefit. They call it medical benefit, and the Minister told us in his opening speech that those societies which are giving extra benefits to their members are expending £34,000 yearly on that.  Is not that an argument in <Col N="129" /> favour of medical benefit?  Certain societies have had to go out of their way and make special arrangements for hospitals and practitioners for giving extra treatment to their members, and other societies have no treatment whatever, and the position exists that a member of one society has certain extra benefits, dental treatment or some other medical benefit, and a member or members of some other society has no such benefit.  The whole thing ought to be reorganised and uniformity enforced, so that people in the more distant country districts, who have to suffer heaviest in this particular case because they have not the facilities at their door and because the cost of administration is altogether too heavy to enable them to be catered for properly, would get as good treatment as the people in the cities.</P>
    <P>The dispensary system is not enough to start with if we really want national health insurance, which means cutting out disease, reducing the number of deaths, and keeping the largest possible number of people in employment.  As has been pointed out by other speakers, you have a system of medical certification. You are going to take this £36,000 from the tuberculosis people and leave them at the mercy of the County Boards of Health.  The County Boards of Health are already grumbling about the unsatisfactory provision made for the tuberculosis patients they have to treat in the ordinary way.  Only yesterday I received a letter from the Kilkenny Board of Health asking me to try to get the Government to increase the amount which is available per head for the treatment of tuberculosis patients from 1/2 to 2/6.  In Kilkenny there are only a small number of tuberculosis cases. Perhaps that is the reason that there seems to be such disparity between the costs.  They are only getting 1/2 and they have to pay 2/6.  They complain that in other matters, such as mental homes, they are not getting the support, which is still based on pre-war, which they ought to get from the central Government, in <Col N="130" /> view of the new conditions and the great increase in wages and the cost of living.  Now we are going to hand over the tuberculosis patients, as Deputy Murphy pointed out, to the Boards of Health, who are concerned with reducing expenses, reducing the rates, and who feel that the eyes of the ratepayers are upon them at all times.  As Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, in reading Dr. Rowlette's statement, you cannot carry on public health departments from the efficient point of view of maintaining the health of your population, of doing your utmost to preserve them in the healthiest condition possible, if you are going to be concerned in cutting down expenses at every turn.</P>
    <P>You cannot therefore throw the whole responsibility for this work on the Boards of Health.  In any case if the Boards of Health were experts in this matter and knew exactly how this whole question should be tackled in their respective areas they are too small in numbers to cover the areas. You cannot have tuberculosis patients going to the members, of the Boards of Health.  On the other hand it extra provision will have to be made, as I am sure it will have to be made, how is the Minister going to get the Boards of Health to make it? They are already complaining everywhere that the cost of home assistance is too high.  This, in my opinion, is a confession of failure, it is burking the issue.  You are shifting on to the local bodies something you have not even attempted to solve yourself.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Sir James Craig or somebody else who knows something about tuberculosis will tell us how tuberculosis should be tackled in a national way.  Certainly that is not tackling it to put the whole onus as an additional side-show on the local bodies.  You are taking, as I said, this £36,000 and you are no longer going to spend it on sanatorium buildings.  Where are you going to put it?  The approved societies say that this money is going to go into medical certification.  While we are abolishing sanatorium benefit because we are told it is uneconomic and that the expense and trouble of <Col N="131" /> the insurance committees is too much and should no longer be maintained, we are turning around and giving this £36,000 for medical certification. What use is medical certification without something following it?  If it is part of medical benefit it is all right.  If you are going to stop there, just paying a doctor for issuing these certificates, what on earth is the use of that to the nation? Let us for goodness sake increase that £36,000 and give an inducement to the doctors to give treatment.  Let us try to build up a system whereby not alone the dispensary patient but any other patient can get, in the very beginning, a better system than they are getting at present, a better service than the ordinary dispensary and the bottle of medicine which they are so anxious to have, so that they will get proper diagnosis and proper treatment from the local practitioner.  Let us try to build that up, giving them hospital treatment. Let us try to establish contact. That is the way in which I believe the Minister could save a great deal of his expenses when he does amalgamate all these societies. When he does make up his mind to establish medical benefit let him get into direct contact both with the doctors and the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have not a word to say against insurance committees.  I believe that such bodies should be kept in existence where possible.  It is a very bad thing to leave everything in the hands of paid officials, even if they are doctors.  By all means, have nominated committees if you like.  Not that these committees can control the doctors.  If the doctors do not want to do the work properly no coercion will make them do it. Let us take them into our confidence and start this business of medical benefit properly.</P>
    <P>I see in this an argument in addition to the argument that the dispensaries are already catering for the sick poor, that the cost of medical benefit would be too great&mdash; the case that is suggested by the insurance committees which, I think, lacks that special knowledge of the <Col N="132" /> matter that Deputy O'Kelly referred to, special acquaintance with the details of administration that would make their estimate very valuable or would make it absolutely beyond question, the estimate that medical benefit would come to 2d. per week, a penny for the employed person and a penny for the employer.  In England under this system of hospital treatment a patient can get treatment for a whole week in hospital for a contribution of 3d. per week. Of course, these hospitals work cheaply, and, in fact, one of the necessities of the scheme is to try to get, as I have been emphasising, as much voluntary labour as possible, and not to leave everything to paid officials.  If in England the cost works out on an average at 3d. per week for medical treatment, surely the cost of contribution in this country ought not to work out at 2d. per week.  There ought not to be such disparity, and I believe that that 2d., which undoubtedly would be a burden upon the population, could be reduced.  It could be reduced very largely by unification of the societies, as has been suggested. It could be reduced very largely by including all the classes of the community that are still outside the national health insurance and who are getting less than £250 per annum in any kind of employment, as in England.  To bring everybody in would bring in additional finance, and additional finance would mean additional economies in administration. You would have more money coming in and you could reduce your overhead expenses.  As well as that I believe the Minister should have at his disposal men&mdash;medical men preferably&mdash;who know this business and who would organise a system of medical benefit and put it on a proper and up-to-date, basis, who would have direct contact with the hospitals and the local practitioners. At the same time, they should have advisory bodies, some such bodies as the organising committees which the Minister is now abolishing.  A great many complaints have been levelled against <Col N="133" /> these committees, that they never did their work.  But, unfortunately, public opinion was not in touch with these committees.  These societies, as Deputy Murphy said, worked in the dark.  Nobody was interested in their work.  That is the case of a great number of voluntary workers in this country.  Before we scrap all the voluntary work that is being done&mdash;good work in connection with public health&mdash;and appoint paid officials, let us hear what these people have to say.  Let us try to keep them on.  They do not cost anything, and it is useful to have impartial people who have given their time to one branch or another of philanthropic work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>For personal reasons, I did not intend to take any part in this debate.  I came in to listen, but I have heard so much that I feel forced to make some remarks. Deputy O'Kelly has dealt with two aspects of the Bill, or rather with two aspects that the Bill does not provide for, that is medical benefit and the unification of societies.  Take the unification of societies.  Like Deputy O'Connell, I would very much prefer nationalisation.  I need not go into any details as to why I would prefer nationalisation to unification.  Enough has been said in the debate to show that nationalisation is very much preferable to unification.  Sanatorium benefit has come in for a good deal of criticism.  Sanatorium benefit has been very unsatisfactory in the past, but I cannot conceive any change in this Bill that will put it in a worse position.  Taking it merely from the Insurance Committee to the Health Board is not in itself a defect.  We have too many local bodies administering health matters in this country with the result that it is nobody's business in the end.  Sanatorium benefit had one great defect in the past.  Even where a patient had too long to wait to get his treatment in a sanatorium, when he had made substantial progress in the sanatorium and when he came to be discharged he had to go back to very unsuitable and unhygienic surroundings. <Col N="134" /> There was no suitable work provided for him, and it was a grim necessity for him if he was the father of a family to find something for his dependants.  The work that should be provided should be suitable work for a convalescent from a sanatorium.  The housing with which we are making considerable headway, but still comparatively slight, is a very important fact in combating and preventing tuberculosis. Sanatorium benefit, whether administered by the Insurance Committee or by the Health Board, should be purely dealt with as a question of contract.  I believe that the Minister for Local Government will see that it is dealt with as a contract and that the insured people will get the benefit of the contract without any undue delay.</P>
      <P>The question of medical benefits has been referred to.  I think that Deputy O'Connell's attitude when he said that he would prefer a national medical service, was misunderstood. He and the Labour Party have been charged with being against medical benefit.  The fact of being in favour of a national medical service is certainly in favour of medical benefit, but on a very much larger scale.  A national medical service and the abolition of public health boards would not only provide medical benefit for the insured person but would also provide free services for the dependants of the insured person and for poor people generally.</P>
      <P>The poor law medical service has come in for some criticism.  I am thinking that Deputy Derrig's medical colleagues will resent or feel inclined to resent his description of the treatment given by dispensary doctors.  I was a dispensary doctor myself for twenty years, and I consider it a slander on me and on most of the men I knew who did that work.  I am not saying that the Poor Law medical service is an adequate service.  I will give you some figures in a moment that will show you how it must fail in giving a proper medical service to the people, be they insured or be they poor persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> I will take figures for the city of Dublin, and I will quote statistics from what I call a normal dispensary district.  This district has two dispensary doctors who are euphemistically described as part-time officials.  When you hear the work they have to do you will see what truth there is in that description.  I admit they are part-time officials to the extent that they get miserable salaries.  Taking the average for three years there were attended at the houses of the sick in one year by these two dispensary doctors&mdash;which I shall call domiciliary visits, meaning acute cases which were not fit to come to the dispensary&mdash;3,316 persons under the Medical Charities Act.  At the dispensaries they attended 19,944 new cases.  That makes a total between the domiciliary cases and the cases attending the dispensary of 23,260, persons.  These were attended by two doctors, and taking the average attendance, which might mean anything from four to six visits for each person&mdash; in one case it might mean only one attendance, but in another case it might mean ten to twenty attendances&mdash;they had to give anything from 80,000 to 100,000 attendances. How could any two doctors do that? Two doctors were called to afford medical attendance to 23,260 persons. Under the Insurance Act in England you cannot have more than 3,000 persons on your panel, and I believe that is considered too many, and is about to be reduced.  These two part-time officials get a salary of £260 a year each.  I do not know if you will believe that these doctors applied for an increase of salary and that the Poor Law Commissioners turned them down and would not give it, notwithstanding all the work they had to do.</P>
    <P>Fault has been found with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health because he increased the salaries of the Mayo doctors.  I hope he will increase the salaries of the dispensary doctors in Dublin.  If he does he will be doing not only justice to the dispensary doctors but, I <Col N="136" /> believe, a great service to the poor people who are dependent on them for medical attendance.  I cannot imagine how any doctors with that sense of ill-treatment, arising out of being paid so inadequately as they are, and being refused an increase of salary can give the best services that are within their command; it would be against human nature.  It has been said of Mayo and the west of Ireland that the doctors there do not attend poor persons, that they charge fees, I have never heard of a doctor in the west of Ireland, any more than in the south of Ireland, who refused to attend on a ticket, where it did not mean very serious consequences to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Hennessy is referring to what I said, perhaps I may be allowed to explain.  I did not say that any doctor refused to attend.  I said that the red ticket system was a bad system.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to emphasise is that the wardens, in every instance where they consider a person is a poor person, issue a ticket, and I hold that no dispensary doctor dare refuse to attend.  At that I will leave it.  In the Free State the dispensary doctors are liable in the first instance for medical attendance on between 50 and 60 per cent. of the population, and for doing so they get £160,000 yearly. It does not cover the travelling expenses. That is the whole crux in this case&mdash;that the service is so cheap and is costing so little to the State.  The same argument was made under the British Government, though the British Government were prepared to give medical benefits, but the Irish Party, under Irish duress, had to call for their deletion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession favour a national medical service in preference to medical benefits.  They are not going to make very much profit out of one service or the other, but a national medical service, as I said before&mdash;and I think it will bear repetition&mdash;gives not only medical treatment to the insured person, but <Col N="137" /> also gives it to the dependants of the insured, and to numbers of other poor persons.  There was a very valuable scheme of national medical service drafted which would have conferred a great national benefit, but, while not of great profit to medical men, it was undoubtedly expensive, because it provided for proper institutional and preventive treatment from the public health point of view.  It has been often stated that we need no national medical service and no medical benefits. We have already a dispensary medical service.  While a dispensary medical service is, I believe, adequate for rural areas, it is a lamentable failure to cope with the work it has to do in the larger urban areas. I have given figures that are incontrovertible. There might be some chance for it if those doctors were whole-time officials and had nothing to do but to treat the poor.  But a man with £260 yearly is expected to do some private practice, and I do not know how he manages it.  However, you have a discontented service, and a discontented medical service is not a great asset.  You have a dispensary medical service that is giving free treatment to between 50 and 60 per cent. of the population.  I say if it is giving that medical treatment it is owing to abuse of the Medical Charities Act. The Medical Charities Act was only intended for poor persons.  If a person were called a pauper&mdash;and that is only the Latin for a poor person&mdash; it would be very offensive, but, nevertheless, that is what the Act was for&mdash;to afford medical treatment to poor persons and paupers.  At the time the Medical Charities Act was instituted in Ireland wage-earners had only 15/- or £1 a quarter, and were destitute enough for anything.</P>
    <P>I am not asking, as Deputy Everett suggested, that a man in receipt of 30/- a week should pay 1½d. or even 2d. a week for his medical treatment, but I believe that a service should be found to give proper medical treatment to a wage-earner of that kind without any contribution from him.  It would not be so expensive.  Of course, I <Col N="138" /> know that the Minister is afraid of the expense, and very reasonably afraid of it, because the commitments of a national service, though necessary if it is to deal with the question properly, are very expensive.</P>
    <P>An inquiry was held in Northern Ireland, and for the first time an effort was made to define a &ldquo;poor person.&rdquo;  In Southern Ireland, and when Ireland was a unit, the great fall-back was not to define the term &ldquo;poor person&rdquo; so that it might be more freely abused and so that 50 per cent or 60 per cent. of the people would be treated free.  The Northern Ireland Committee was, to some certain extent, a Departmental Committee, but it had extern representation of all interests.  It defined a &ldquo;poor person,&rdquo; and amongst the classes that it stated were not poor persons was the case of a man or a woman-servant in receipt of £50 a year wages, with board and lodgings, that such a person was not entitled to be treated under the Medical Charities Act.  You know that these persons are very freely treated under the Medical Charities Act in the Free State.  Of course, it is an abuse of the Medical Charities Act that these people should be treated, but they have come in for want of a contributory scheme and have to be treated. The natural result that followed from the definition of a &ldquo;poor person&rdquo; in Northern Ireland is that the Northern Ireland people are now making provision for medical benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made reference to the unsatisfactory and irregular way in which medical certification was done by doctors.  Of course, that was meant as a reflection, although he did not stress the point, from the Report quoted.  He quoted the number of insured persons whom the ordinary medical attendant certified as unfit for work, but who were sent back to work by the referees.  The difference between the medical referee and the medical practitioner is this: The medical practitioner adheres to the professional interpretation of unfitness for work.  The statutory definition which more or <Col N="139" /> less governs the medical referee is a different thing; it means: &ldquo;Is the man fit to do any work&rdquo;; not his ordinary work, but any work.  That is how there is often such a discrepancy between the medical practitioner as a certifier and the medical referee.  It is a matter of statutory definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in a general way, but I am telling the House that that is accounted for in a number of ways.  I know medical men who might even be statutorily bound to certify in accordance with the definition in the Act, but who ignore it and only consider if the man is fit or unfit to follow his ordinary occupation. Sometimes there are doctors, possibly soft-hearted, possibly careless, who do not make an examination sufficiently extensive, and some cases will go in that should not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining that.  The National Health Commission will naturally&mdash;and there are many other explanations&mdash;uphold the attitude of the medical referee, and the medical referee may be as fallible as the medical practitioner. Approved societies will find fault with legitimate certification and refuse to pay sickness benefit on legitimate certification until compelled by the National Health Commission.  I will leave it at that.  I do not say that there are not faults, but taking the thing as a whole, it is as I have explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of displaced officials.  They are mostly clerical officers, and I have a good deal of sympathy with the claim made by the Labour Party that they should be compensated.  They are losing their employment, and if they cannot be absorbed into another service, I think the Minister should <Col N="140" /> give them some consideration, because it is a very serious thing for a number of these men.  They have given ten or twelve of the best years of their lives to uphill work, and I think they are entitled to some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell's attitude seems to have been misunderstood by Deputy Lemass, who professed to express surprise that the Labour Party are against medical benefits.  I think I am right in assuring Deputy Lemass that the Labour Party are not what might be called against medical benefits, but favour a greater scheme than medical benefits which could be derived from a State Insurance Act, that is, by a national medical service, because no matter how tight the Commissioners endeavour to make the Insurance Acts a certain number of people will be left outside of them who will require medical attention.  I believe that a State medical service is the proper institution to set up in order to deal equitably and properly with the poor.</P>
      <P>The dispensary service has been mentioned.  At present it is almost impossible to define the persons who are entitled to be treated by a dispensary doctor because of the fact that the value of money is different now from what it was some years ago, and guardians and wardens are sometimes asked to discriminate as to whether a person should receive a ticket or not, with the result that on a great many occasions people do not get the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain provisions in the Bill which go to strengthen the Insurance Acts and to ensure that a greater amount of money will be made available for insurance purposes. There are certain clauses for tightening up insurance.  But like my colleagues and others who have spoken, I want to protest strongly against the abolition of insurance committees.  According to statements made here, a great many Deputies are of opinion that insurance committees have not been used for anything but to see that people suffering <Col N="141" /> from tuberculosis are placed in sanatoria. As far as the County Wexford Committee is concerned, they do a great deal more than that.  When they come across an insured person who suffers from tuberculosis they are able to provide him or her with milk, butter and eggs as nourishment in the home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy referred to what has undoubtedly been a fact&mdash;that the difficulty about sanatorium treatment up to this has been the period of waiting.  Patients were allowed to suffer on account of the waiting period, but in my opinion patients will suffer still more if you do away with the insurance committee, because they had these patients under their supervision; they saw to it that they were provided with proper nourishment before admission, and when a patient left the sanatorium they made it their business not alone to get the doctor and the nurse attached to the committee to visit the patient but members of the committee themselves visited him.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Derrig has pointed out, to hand over sanatorium treatment to county boards of health is a ridiculous proposition.  Since the abolition of the boards of guardians and district councils, the county boards of health find themselves unable to cope with the amount of work they have to do in the time at their disposal.  Immediately after the amalgamation scheme was brought into operation, county boards of health used to meet once a month.</P>
    <P>Now they find it impossible to do the work which they are called upon to do during one day in the month, and in many cases they have to meet three times during the month in order to do the work they are called upon to do.  To my mind tuberculosis cases will be neglected if they are to be left to the county boards of health.  In that event very deserving cases would be neglected, because the county boards of health who are to deal with tuberculosis cases will not have the time to deal with them in the way in which they should be dealt with.  I think what I <Col N="142" /> stated is true, and that committees in the past saw to it that when patients were sent to a sanatorium the patients were kept under constant supervision and on their return from the sanatorium they provided them with nourishment and looked after them when they came back.  In that way an earnest effort was made to have proper surroundings for the patient.  In many cases I have known committees, in the case of patients who were living in bad houses, approached people who had better houses and tried to secure for the patient better housing accommodation. That is a very important thing, to see that when a person does go to a sanatorium and is sent back that proper accommodation is provided for him.  That is what these committees have been doing in the past.  If these committees are abolished tuberculosis cases which are decreasing will increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy said there were too many local bodies administering public health. That is a very wrong statement.  The one body dealing with public health since the amalgamation of our unions is the board of health.  The only portion of public health work which they did not take over was that in regard to the tuberculosis scheme of insurance connected therewith.  Now we find that the insurance committees take up this part of the work once a month and deal with the subject. If this extra work is given to the board of health, it will be neglected. The committee with which I am connected has been constituted of people who have not been elected. This committee is largely composed of many charitable ladies who, as Deputy Corish said, administer the Act and make it a point to visit the homes.  Through schemes like the Jubilee Nurses centred in Athlone and other places they have done immense work in the home in the way of cleanliness and other measures to prevent tuberculosis.  In a quiet way they have done Trojan work.  You are going to take away the services of these people who devote practically all their time to this <Col N="143" /> kind of work and you are going to throw it in at the end of the monthly board of health meetings, at perhaps 7 o'clock in the evening and ask the members to deal with this matter of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>If you do that you will find before long that that arrangement will not work at all.  The amendment put down by Deputy O'Kelly dealt with unification.  As far as I am aware, if other Deputies' duties are like mine I should say that half the time of a representative is taken up getting the Insurance Commissioners to run after the various societies and get them to do their work.  Repeatedly after medical certification, some of these societies have refused again and again to pay benefits.  In that way they have caused great trouble and privation to the people. You would have unification with one society not out to make money. Most of the small societies are out to get the most money out of the scheme.  You would have one insurance society which would be better looked after by the Insurance Commissioners. Personally, if I were asked what would be the best scheme and I advocated it last year On the Vote, it would be nationalisation. The next best thing is unification. The worst thing is to leave the matter as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Labour Party in choosing to leave the thing as it is instead of taking up a scheme of unification. We heard the defence here of dispensary work and sanatorium benefit. My idea of dispensary work is &ldquo;Come in, come on, put out your tongue, have you a bottle?&rdquo;  The bottle is generally a bottle of cod liver oil.  Until you find some other way of dealing with tuberculosis there is nothing very much to be said in favour of the dispensary scheme.  There is one point here in the Report which was quoted by Deputy O'Kelly previously.  There is no harm in emphasising it.  I quote from Dr. Rowlette when he said: &ldquo;I agree in thinking that the methods of administering National Health <Col N="144" /> Insurance through approved societies is cumbersome under the conditions that are found in Ireland.  The method was introduced into Ireland merely to give uniformity to a system common to a different island, but designed to meet English local needs.  It had no relation to Irish needs or customs, and with any recasting of the insurance system, there appears to be no reason why the existing method of administration should be continued if a better or one more suitable can be devised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One could not emphasise half enough the cumbersome way that the National Health Insurance is administered in Ireland, particularly in rural districts.  There is a network of by-laws in the administration of insurance which would suit a big industrial centre.  But you find in the rural parts of Ireland that a man has to walk ten miles to the nearest centre of his society.  He is told when he goes there that he is a fortnight late with his card, and that even if it is stamped he cannot get sickness benefit out of it.  One begins to realise that what Dr. Rowlette said is not over-exaggerated when one considers what has been happening. I could give numerous instances of cases of little technicalities like that in the administration of health insurance.  I know of cases where persons, were it not for home help, would, during sickness, he destitute because of these matters.  The whole thing needs to be simplified.  These technical regulations which were intended for industrial centres need to be done away with as regards this country, and especially as regards the rural parts.  I do not think that there is much fear, as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health indicated, that an insured person here, because he or she has two or three stamps on his card, will come in and stamp up the card so as to draw benefit.  There are very few in this country in a position to do that.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I want to protest against the idea of abolishing local committees, and to appeal for a simplification <Col N="145" /> of the rules of health insurance as applied to Ireland, so as to make it more in keeping with the needs of the insured.</P>

      <P>I merely intervene in this debate because it seems that some speakers on this side have got a wrong conception of the work of dispensary medical officers.  I want to say that those who speak as some speakers have spoken on the work of dispensary doctors do not seem to know what they are saying, nor did the last speaker either.  I would suggest to Deputy Kennedy, who is, I understand, chairman of a local board of health, that it is his duty to see that the dispensary doctors in the county of Westmeath do more than ask the patients to put out their tongues, and give them cod liver oil.  The statement was made here that there was no attempt at the prevention of disease and no attempt at real treatment; that bottles were given indiscriminately to people who came into the dispensary. I wish to place on record my emphatic protest against such a statement. Such a slander should not be used without proof.  It was also said that red tickets were a failure. They did not say what the alternative is.  I am sure that there is no one interested in the poor law medical service who would not be glad to see a better system than the system at present in operation, but for want of a better system the present system is the only system by which the poor can be treated. Figures have been given to show that all this talk about the work of dispensary doctors is moonshine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also suggested that there was a certain looseness in medical certification.  If there are one or two medical certifiers who have been loose and who have given certificates when they should not be given, the whole body of medical certifiers should not be slandered.  One may as well say that it is dishonesty on the part of the insured person to come for a certificate.  Does anybody in his sane moments dream that a <Col N="146" /> person will seek 7/6 disablement benefit and get certificates in order to do so, when he can obtain 35/- or 40/- a week working?</P>
    <P>As regards the medical referee, I would like to point out that generally he is called in at the end of an illness.  He is not called in by some societies for six or twelve months but other societies call him in after six or seven weeks.  As far as the society for which I do a good deal of certification is concerned, the referee is hardly ever called in.  I will quote the A.O.H. as a case in point.  It is one of the biggest societies in this country.  As a rule that society calls in the medical referee after four or five weeks.  I suggest that where the referee is called in after four or five weeks, and where the certifiers know that he will be called in, it is wrong to think that there is any looseness in regard to medical certification, and Deputies should not think otherwise. I feel that I could not allow those statements to pass unchallenged and that is the reason that I intervene.</P>

      <P>I desire to announce to the Dáil the terms of reference of the Inquiry set up in connection with the proposal to mix Irish grain with imported maize.  The terms of reference are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  To ascertain and report whether, having due regard to the interests of</P>
      <P>(a)  Producers of cereals in Saorstát Éireann; and</P>
      <P>(b)  Consumers of maize meal in Saorstát Eireann,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>it would be in the national interest to enact that all maize meal before being offered for sale in Saorstát <Col N="147" /> Eireann shall be mixed with some one or more of the following home-grown cereals, namely, wheat, barley, oats or rye, so that the resultant mixture shall contain a definite percentage of such cereals; and, if so, what that percentage should be.</P>
    <P>(2)  To consider and report upon the effect, if any, which such enactment would be likely to have upon tillage and the production of cereals in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(3)  To consider and report upon the administrative machinery necessary to make such enactment operative.</P>
    <P>These are the terms of reference. It is proposed to ask Professor Whelehan, Mr. McElligott and Dr. Hinchcliff, the present members of the Tariff Commission, to act as the members of that Inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>An inquiry set up in that way would not have any such powers; it would be purely voluntary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The presence of witnesses would be voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have no doubt the Tariff Commission will make arrangements under which any witnesses that they think necessary for the purposes of the Inquiry will come forward.  For instance, I think arrangements could be made to deal with their travelling expenses, and so on.  There is a certain sub-head in my Vote which would enable that to be done.  This inquiry is just an ordinary inquiry, and no powers exist in connection with such a body to compel the attendance of witnesses. If a tribunal were to be set up with such powers, it could only <Col N="148" /> be set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, the first section of which roads: &ldquo;(1) Where it has been resolved (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) by both Houses of Parliament, that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter described in the Resolution as of urgent public importance, and in pursuance of the Resolution a tribunal is appointed for the purpose either by His Majesty or a Secretary of State, the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto may provide that this Act shall apply, and in such case the tribunal shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court, or in Scotland the Court of Session, or a judge of either such Court, on the occasion of an action in respect of the following matters:&mdash;(a) the enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, affirmation, or otherwise...&rdquo; I presume that would include cross-examination.</P>
      <P>If it were desired to have a tribunal of that sort it would be necessary to bring forward a resolution in the Dáil.  I have no decided views one way or the other.  I believe that the sort of inquiry it is proposed to set up can get all the information that is really required.  I take it the various interests concerned will be willing&mdash;it will cost them nothing&mdash; to come forward and give their views and answer any questions put to them by the tribunal.  As a lawyer with some experience of courts, I do not believe that in an inquiry of this sort the cross-examination of witnesses will lead to very much additional information.  Most of the information will be elicited by the court itself from the witnesses.  If the House feels very strongly that a tribunal of the sort contemplated by the Act I have referred to should be set up, it would be necessary to bring forward a resolution, put that resolution upon the Order Paper and pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to whether this <Col N="149" /> matter could be properly described as one of urgent public importance. Possibly it could.  I do not think, however, that there is any advantage in that.  I believe the inquiry I have suggested will get all the information that is wanted.  I believe the parties interested on both sides will come forward.  As regards anybody who does not come forward&mdash;well, he would have nothing to say that would be worth hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be much better when a witness comes forward that he should be cross-examined? It is only by cross-examination the different points for or against, will be brought out.  Any witness can come in and read a statement and if he is not cross-examined neither the tribunal nor the public at large will be satisfied.  I think it would be much better if the witness were to be subject to cross-examination. After all, that is the way evidence is taken in the law courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The word cross-examine may lead to misunderstanding. After all, cross-examination mainly consists in asking questions although they are asked by the other side.  I presume the witnesses who will come forward voluntarily in this way will answer any question asked.  I think in practice that is almost absolutely certain.</P>

      <P>We have, but this is an important matter, and the Tariff Commission seems to be a body, as constituted, eminently suited for such an inquiry.  It is undoubtedly a body without any vested interests. It is undoubtedly a competent body, when we consider the men who are on it, to make such an inquiry.  I think this is a very important inquiry, and I should like to see every aspect of the proposal brought into full relief.  I want to see all the issues, direct and indirect, that arise stated fully, and I am more concerned with getting what I call a full, competent report in the matter than with any other consideration. I think that this body can give us that.  They have experience of sifting evidence; they are impartial; they have no vested interests, and, from their past experience they are bound to be competent to deal with the case. These considerations have overborne the fact which Deputy Lemass states that they have a fair amount of work on hands.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is the opinion of the Dáil that the Executive Council should take up with the British Government the question of providing adequate compensation for Miss Alice Doyle, Mr. Felix Mackin, Mr. James O'Hare, Mr. Patrick O'Hare, Mr. Terence McCourt, Mr. McKnight, Miss Minnie Smith, all of Camlough, Co. Armagh, whose homes and property were destroyed in December, 1920, by British forces, and who were refused compensation because British military witnesses swore that the destruction was done by them through military necessity; also for James McGuill, Dromintee, Co. Armagh; Frederick Joseph Slater, Curry, Belleek, Co. Fermanagh, and Mrs. Anne James Byrne, Tullyorior, Banbridge, Co. Down, whose homes and property were destroyed in June, 1922, by British forces, and who were refused compensation for the same reasons; and</P>
      <P>That, if the representations referred to in the foregoing paragraph be not successful, it is further of opinion that the Executive Council should take steps to make provision for the payment of compensation to the persons named out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been on the Paper for some time, and what I want to do is to get the Dáil to say that the Government should either get the British Government to compensate the people in the North of Ireland who suffered the loss of their homes and got no compensation, or that they themselves should make provision for them.  I examined the whole question.  I tried to get all the cases where people were burned out and were refused compensation on the plea of military necessity by the British forces.  The amount of money claimed by these people in the courts amounted to £21,600.  I believe that if a judicial committee went into the matter they would find <Col N="156" /> it would be somewhat less than that. I believe that this assembly of Irish representatives have a duty to compensate these people; they suffered the loss of their homes because of the fight that was made by the people of Ireland for freedom.  The Government, and those supporting them, have claimed that this portion of Ireland, at least, has got freedom and, certainly, whatever measure of freedom was achieved here was achieved because of the sacrifices of the whole of the people of Ireland, including the people of the Six Counties, and including the people whose names are contained in this motion.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government has been stated by the President. On 17th November, 1927, on page 1613, vol. 21, of the Official Report you will find the following statement by President Cosgrave:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people of Saorstát Eireann have paid in full the compensation payable for damage done within the 26 counties; it would neither be equitable nor feasible to ask them to pay for damage which was done by others in an area outside their jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to note that the President says &ldquo;damage done by others in an area outside their jurisdiction.&rdquo; Again he said that same day: &ldquo;This is a liability in respect of another Government.  It is nonsense to come here and say we should out of our bounty do this.&rdquo;  Again he says: &ldquo;I state not alone what was true but what I have verified and what is in accord with my distinct recollection. Surely I am a man of sense, having had a lot of experience in administration.... I have had the records examined and there was no authority given for any attack in Northern Ireland.  I repudiate and deny any such statement and I say it is an untrue statement.&rdquo;  That is on page 1623 of the same volume.  Again he said: &ldquo;The matter which the Deputy has described is outside the area of our jurisdiction.&rdquo;  That is on page 1617 of the same volume.  Again: &ldquo;I deny absolutely any responsibility on the part either of the second <Col N="157" /> Dáil or the Provisional Government in respect of that particular act.&rdquo; That particular act was the burning of James McGuill's house, Dromintee. Again at page 1621 he said: &ldquo;No authority was given by the Second Dáil or by the Provisional Government for any military activities in Northern Ireland after the Treaty.&rdquo;  Again at page 1522 he said: &ldquo;Northern Nationalists is rather a large term, and they have been abandoned by more than me.&rdquo; Note, however, he admits that they have been abandoned by him.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said on 19th November, 1928, page 1845: &ldquo;I feel a great deal of sympathy&rdquo;&mdash;he did not say what sort of sympathy, lip sympathy or anything else, but he said: &ldquo;I feel a great deal of sympathy with the people who during the pre-Truce period suffered substantial losses in the Six Counties and were afterwards unable to obtain compensation from any source.  I certainly do feel that their case was one of great hardship.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance on the same date asked for particulars: I sent him particulars of all cases I had discovered and I got a letter from him yesterday, 22nd October. His letter boils down to this: &ldquo;The Minister regrets, therefore, that he cannot see his way to recommend to the Oireachtas that funds should be provided for the payment of compensation to persons resident in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  He gives a few excuses of course before he comes to that.  One of them is that &ldquo;payments of compensation made in respect to similar damage in the Irish Free State are, of course, a charge upon the taxpayer of the Saorstat, and the effect of the various measures taken to afford such compensation has been to spread over the general body of citizens a burden which would have otherwise fallen heavily upon a few.  In other words, to even up the loss amongst the people of the State generally.&rdquo;  He says, in another part of the letter, &ldquo;there are cases of great hardship.&rdquo;  But he does not say that although he claims the people of the TwentySix Counties have obtained freedom&mdash;and <Col N="158" /> I say that whatever freedom they have obtained was helped by the people for whom I am now claiming compensation&mdash;he does not say that these few should be helped by the general body of the citizens throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Another excuse in the letter. He said:&mdash;&ldquo;In any event in the circumstances which now obtain and which have obtained since 1922 it would be impossible to set up machinery responsible to this Government which would be capable of examining in a judicial manner the claims of persons resident in Northern Ireland and of assessing the amount of their losses.&rdquo;  However, by some means or other, a lot of pensions are being paid to people resident outside Saorstat Eireann, but the Minister did not come and tell us that he had no means of assessing the amount of pension which they should obtain. Another excuse.  &ldquo;The period of time which has elapsed since the occurrences referred to is so great that even if other difficulties were removed the task of assessing damages in a manner equitable alike to the sufferer and taxpayer would be almost impossible of accomplishment.&rdquo; The Minister has in his Department a branch at work trying to sift out the evidence of the claims of people who subscribed to the Dail Eireann Loan and I think he should take into Account the help that was given to the people of this country in their fight for freedom by the people in the North.  That is evident by the large number of subscribers from the North whose names appear on the list of subscribers to Dail Eireann Loan.  I think also that the Minister should be as careful of the interests of people who supported the Irish cause during the Black and Tan war and until the fighting ceased as the British are of the interests of their supporters in this country.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that no later than last year the British gave money to the so-called loyalists in the South of Ireland and also that many years after the fighting ceased, in 1926, President Cosgrave went <Col N="159" /> over to London and put in Clause IV.  of the Boundary Agreement agreeing to give an additional ten per cent. to people who suffered losses here and a large portion of that sum of £270,000 involved in the agreement passed into the hands of Southern loyalists.  President Cosgrave even admitted that the payment of that additional ten per cent. did in a number of cases bring the total amount of compensation paid to these people to more than they claimed.  The total amount obtained by some of these people was more than they actually claimed. President Cosgrave had £270,000 of the Irish people's money to throw away in that fashion but he has not got £20,000 or less to spend on compensating people who not only did not get a penny but who were at the loss incurred in legal proceedings which they instituted in the Northern Courts to obtain their rights. He can give £270,000 to his friends in the South, but for the friends of Ireland in the North whom he admits he has abandoned he cannot even get £20,000.</P>
    <P>As I say, the people in the North of Ireland did their share in the national fight, which resulted in the setting up of this establishment.  Not alone did the people who are enumerated in my resolution suffer the loss of their homes, but many others throughout the Six Counties suffered the loss of their lives, and I can state that the people in one town area, from which most of these people came, suffered more casualties than any other urban area in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork, and inflicted more casualties on the British than any other urban area outside Dublin and Cork.  I believe that these people particularly should not have been abandoned.  I know that the dependants of some of the people who were killed got compensation, and that some of those who were wounded got pensions.  You have heard the case of a number of people in Camlough whose homes were destroyed, and who got no compensation. I know that some of the men who were wounded on the night <Col N="160" /> of the attack on the barracks got pensions, and I know that the dependants of a couple of men who were killed, also got pensions.  I maintain that these people have an equal right to compensation, and an equal right to the consideration of this Assembly.  I am borne out in my statement by many of the men who are responsible for setting up this State.  I will give you a quotation from Arthur Griffith.  Speaking on February 1st, in the City Hall, to a deputation of Northern representatives, he said: &ldquo;If there were any fears or rumours in the North that they were going to be let down, they could get them off their minds at once.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>February 1st, 1922. That is Arthur Griffith.  Michael Collins, on February 4th, 1922, said: &ldquo;We have repeatedly said that the North-East had nothing, to fear from us, that we would not coerce them or place them under disabilities; equally, however, our people must not be coerced, and must not be placed under disabilities.&rdquo;  The people who President Cosgrave said are in an area outside their jurisdiction, the people whom President Cosgrave refers to as &ldquo;others in an area outside our jurisdiction,&rdquo; and the people whom President Cosgrave admits he has abandoned were, according to Michael Collins, not to be placed under disabilities, not to be coerced.  That was his promise to them.  Michael Collins, when setting up this State a few days after the Provisional Government was in operation, called together a number of representatives of local bodies in the North in the City Hall.  I was present and introduced the deputation.</P>

      <P>Might I remind the House that the question at issue is purely a question of compensation? I thought I made that clear before.  Deputy Aiken is entitled to make a preamble and entitled to make his speech, as far as possible, in his own way.  I will allow him to make it as far as I possibly can in his own way, but the question at, issue is merely a question of making representations <Col N="162" /> to the British Government, with regard to compensation, and that is not sufficiently wide to cover a great many things that have been brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that I am referring to statements made by the President, who disclaimed responsibility. I wonder does the President object, or could he in any way object, to my statement, that as a result of the meeting in the City Hall when Michael Collins met the local bodies, the local bodies in the North who pledged allegiance to Dáil Eireann continued to refuse to recognise the Northern Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want my answer now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>You may answer now or at any time you like, but the fact is that they continued to refuse to recognise the Northern Government, and not only did they refuse to recognise the Northern Government, but a large proportion of the teachers in the North-East refused to recognise the Northern Government. These teachers were paid by Dáil Eireann.  These people, who might easily be described by President Cosgrave&mdash;would now be described, and have been described&mdash; as others in an area outside their jurisdiction, were paid by Dáil Eireann.  Shortly after that meeting Dan Hogan, who was then O.C. of the 5th Northern Division, was arrested on his way to Derry, and there were some prisoners in Derry who were under sentence of death. They were I.R.A. prisoners who had been kept after the general amnesty and, of course, throughout the whole of the country, both in the North and in the South, much feeling was aroused, and steps were taken to take hostages for Dan Hogan and his comrades, and also for the men in <Col N="163" /> Derry Jail who were under sentence of death.  A large number of &ldquo;B&rdquo; Specials and other active supporters of the British and the Northern Governments were arrested and taken to prisons throughout the Free State.  One general raid took place, and it was reported in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on February 9th.  It took place on February 8th, and some of the men, who were under Seán MacEoin's command, were arrested in Enniskillen.  Many of them are pretty well-known.  One of them, Seán MacCurtain, at least should be known to every Minister opposite, because he was a member of their Party.  He was elected by them as a T.D. and sat in their Party.  Of course, he was another person for whose action President Cosgrave now disclaims responsibility, but he did not then.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether he now disclaims responsibility for them or not, because I understand when these people who were arrested in Enniskillen, or some of them, I can give the names&mdash;Seán Flood, Seán MacCurtain, Frank Reynolds, Joe Lee, Seán Griffith, Seán Maguire, Seán McCarroll, Charlie Reynolds&mdash;were detained in British, prisons up to January 20th, 1926, some of them were actually paid out of Army funds.  President Cosgrave says he can take no responsibility for their action.  &ldquo;No authority was given by the Second Dáil or the Provisional Government for any military activity in the North of Ireland after the Treaty.&rdquo;  The area of the North was outside the jurisdiction of these men, but he says, &ldquo;Surely, I am a man of sense.&rdquo;  Yet he paid them allowances when they were imprisoned for carrying out war in the North, and he also pays them pensions.  I do not know.  I suppose it is only in public that he disclaims responsibility for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Cosgrave says &ldquo;I state not only what is true, but what I have verified and what is in accord with my distinct recollection.&rdquo;  He goes on to say, &ldquo;Surely I am a man of sense, having had a lot of experience in administration.  I have <Col N="164" /> had the records examined, and there was no authority given for any attack on Northern Ireland.  I repudiate and deny any such statement, and I say it is an untrue statement.&rdquo;  I do not know what influence President Cosgrave had then on the Executive of Dail Eireann, but surely anyone might think that he would have at least as much influence and as much knowledge of affairs as the ordinary man in the street, and the ordinary man in the street read the following statement on February 9 after these raids, on the North&mdash;a statement from Eoin O'Duffy, Chief of Staff of the Volunteers under the control of Dail Eireann.  Eoin O'Duffy said:</P>
    <P>In reference to these raids, that there should have been spontaneous and determined action in Ulster is not surprising.  The patience of our people there has been sorely tried lately by the continued raids, arrests and tortures inflicted on them by the agents of the (Northern) Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority of those in prison,&rdquo; says Eoin O'Duffy, then Chief of Staff of the forces of Dail Eireann, &ldquo;in Belfast and Derry are suffering because they carried out my orders while I was the <i>liaison officer.</i>&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;There is a limit to human endurance,&rdquo; and further, &ldquo;There can be peace in Ulster if and when the North-East wills it, but there will be no peace while a number of our people there are held in custody.&rdquo; There was war then, and &ldquo;there will be no peace while a number of our people are held in custody.&rdquo;  But President Cosgrave has examined all the records.  He is a man of sense, and he repudiates any such statement that Dail Eireann, or any of the forces under its control, were responsible for any trouble in the North after the signing of the Treaty.  Michael Collins, with reference to the same thing, said&mdash;you will find this quotation in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; of February 9 regarding the raid&mdash;&ldquo;that it was <Col N="165" /> what any sensible person, would expect.&rdquo; But one sensible person, according to himself, did not expect it.  He says now that he did not expect it.  One record at any rate that you would expect a man of sense, even if he is a man of sense according to himself, would have read was one on his own files.  That would not be asking too much from a man of sense.  We have a letter signed here by Liam T. MacCosgair dated the 13th April, 1922.  He addressed this particular one to the Chairman of the Guardians of the Newry (No. 2) Rural District Council, and in it he says:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>It has been decided to hold a meeting of the Chairmen of Local Authorities of North-East Ireland who have pledged their allegiance to Dáil Eireann so that their position and future action may be discussed.  This meeting will be held at the Mansion House, Dublin, on Monday, 24th April, at 3 p.m., and you are requested to attend. In the meanwhile you are also requested to forward to this office as soon as possible full particulars of the position of your Board at present, and with regard to the action of the (Northern) Government in attempting to enforce recognition, namely, have your Board been replaced by Commissioners and if so under what alleged authority? Documents which explain the legal position are important and should be sent.  Discussion at the meeting would include the various aspects (a) Boundary Commission; (b) Local Government; (c) Patronage. Decisions will be taken as to action generally or in particular cases.</P>
    <P>(Signed) Liam T. Mac Cosgair,</P>
    <P>which some of President Cosgrave's friends may not know means William T. Cosgrave, Minister for Local Government.  That was sent by the Minister for Local Government, Liam T. Mac Cosgair, to people whom he would describe now as in an area outside his jurisdiction but who were then of course his own subjects, to whom he sent ministerial or royal commands to attend at the <Col N="166" /> Mansion House.  He says &ldquo;alleged authority.&rdquo;  Any authority other than his own would be an alleged authority to him then, but now a lawfully constituted authority.  There is another letter which is valuable when one is considering the amount of responsibility which this Assembly has for the sufferings incurred by the people set out in my Resolution. It is a letter sent out by Rory O'Connor shortly before his death. The letter says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At that stage, we actually discussed co-ordinating military action against North-East Ulster and had agreed on the officer who would command both Republican and Free State troops in that area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was the, officer on whom they agreed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were also to send from the South some hundreds of our rifles for use in that area.  The reason given was that it would never do if rifles which had been handed to the Government for use against Republicans and which of course could be identified were found in use against Craig.  An exchange of rifles was effected.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is altogether a case for compensation, and, as I said before, that whole question will have to be debated in connection with the two examples given in the Resolution.  I think that the Deputy should come to the question of compensation for these people rather than give a recital of historical facts, and continue the reading of documents.  I desire to allow the Deputy, as has <Col N="167" /> always been the practice, to make his case in his own way.  Deputies frequently object to other Deputies making their cases in their own way. I want to allow the Deputy to make his case in his own way, but the question of recognition, the question of local authority, and the other questions raised, do not seem to have any relevancy to what action should now be taken about the particular people set out in the Resolution. I think the Deputy ought to come to the Resolution.  I wonder is he really coming to it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear about this.  The unfortunate position of the Deputy at the moment is that he is not coming to it in the way that the Chair deems to be the proper way.  I want to give the Deputy every possible liberty, but I am not prepared to deal with the question on the basis that the Deputy will do it solely in his own way and without regard to the view of the Chair.  The Deputy will have to come to the question very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we are discussing is whether or not this Assembly has any responsibility for the destruction which was done on these people's homes.  That is the question that we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  The Chair is definitely of opinion that that is not so.  The Deputy has not told us anything yet about the first set of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution cannot give rise to a wide debate on the whole question of responsibility.  I agree that there is some relevancy in the matter, but <Col N="168" /> the relevancy has not yet appeared. We will have to hear something about these particular people first, and then some statement about responsibility, but as to any prolonged reading of documents or prolonged investigation into a period of history, the House, as I said before, is not in a position to come to a decision on a difficult point of history. No Assembly of this nature is in that position, and I think the House itself is clear about that.  It would be impossible for the House to come to a decision on a vexed point of history, and perhaps it would be more difficult for the House to come to a decision on a vexed point of recent history than on any other point of history.  For that reason we will have to come to this particular question now.</P>

      <P>I submit that what Deputy Aiken is coming to is not a point of history.  I entirely agree with the Chair that this House would not be the place to decide a point of history, but what I gather from Deputy Aiken is that he is endeavouring to establish a point of fact as to certain responsibilities in certain limited cases&mdash;in regard to these cases for which he claims compensation.  He has made the case setting forth that there was certain authority recognised by persons responsible here for certain actions.  That was denied in the letter that the Minister for Finance sent.  The Deputy, I take it, is endeavouring to establish that there was certain authority given for those acts which entitled those people to compensation.  Outside that I submit, with all respect, he has not gone, and if he is able to establish the fact of authority there, I think he would have established his claim for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy O'Kelly has said, Deputy Aiken has not yet come to any point dealing with either of these two cases.  I do not know whether the Deputy intends to deal with them in chronological order and take 1920 before 1922, but he has not dealt with 1920 at all, as far <Col N="169" /> as my recollection serves me.  In the case of 1922 he did not give the date of the last letter he read.  Up to the time that I intervened he had not got beyond February, 1922.  A question of history is always established from what the facts were.  I want to give Deputy Aiken every liberty, but I do want to hear something about these cases.  There is, a fundamental difference of opinion on the question of responsibility for certain actions, and the House cannot be used as a tribunal to decide who was responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Boland bear with me and I will hear a statement from him afterwards? I made up my mind on this matter a long time ago.  On the general question, I allowed this question to be put on the Order Paper, and I allowed Deputy Aiken to make a statement on it before.  I allowed the matter to appear on the Order Paper, because although I think at least the second part of it might be technically ruled out I wanted to give the fullest possible liberty for debate in the House.  The House is not in the position&mdash;I repeat that&mdash; to hear evidence and arrive at a decision on the question of who is responsible for a particular act done at a particular time.  In fact, there is hardly any other Assembly more unfitted to decide such a matter as that.  If the Deputy will come to the question of compensation I am prepared to allow him to make a statement giving from his point of view evidence of what he considers responsibility in the matter.  But we cannot have an elaborate examination of all these mattters because we are not competent to decide them. If they are to be decided they will have to be decided by a wholly different tribunal to this.  I have no objection to Deputy Aiken making assumptions of any kind, but as he is giving a certain amount of proof about the matter from his point of view I do not want to have to take up consideration of this question in <Col N="170" /> that fashion.  I do not think it can be done.</P>

I submit that all along Deputy Aiken throughout his statement has been concentrating on the efforts to prove that there is direct responsibility on the Executive Council and on those who were with him at the time for these particular actions.</P>

      <P>There again it is not a question of who was there at the time.  Remember that the matter would have the same relevancy precisely if no single person now having the right to sit on the Front Bench had been there in 1922. There is no question of that.  It is purely, in the particular sense which I now use the word, &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; that there are persons in the House who have personal knowledge of the matter.  No matter what relevancy there may be, we cannot have an examination into disputed facts of that kind which go back so far.  I am prepared to allow the Deputy to make a statement, but we cannot have a long examination drawing us into all kinds of matters which a vote of this House would not decide in any shape or form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want the House to do is to vote some money for these people who have suffered losses.  I maintain that they have a <Col N="171" /> better right to compensation than others who have received moneys called compensation for losses out of public funds at the disposal of this Assembly.</P>
      <P>Now one of the cases mentioned is the case of Miss Alice Doyle. There were two houses destroyed and two others partly destroyed by British police and military forces on the night of 12th-13th December, 1920.  You will notice I am going back.  Her claim for compensation was turned down in the County Court because the officer in charge of the British forces&mdash;Captain Armstrong&mdash;lyingly swore that the house contained bombs and was loopholed.  Miss Alice Doyle's architect estimated the cost of re-building and repairing at £741 12s. 4d.  I know that case very intimately.  I was in charge of the attack on the barracks, after which this house was destroyed.  I know that the lady, of course, was favourable to the Republican cause, and helped the national movement, but she was not in the attack, and we did not use her house for the attack on the barracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and decided that she could not obtain compensation because Captain Armstrong, who was in charge of the British forces, alleged that the houses contained bombs and were loopholed for the attack on the barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> Another case is that of James O'Hare, of the same parish, and living in one of Miss Doyle's houses destroyed on the same night.  He claimed £336 15s. for furniture and personal belongings, but his case was dismissed on similar evidence being put forward by the British.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Michael Conlon whose belongings were also destroyed claimed £62 but was refused compensation.  There were a few other tenants of Miss Doyle who also were refused compensation on the same ground.  James McKnight, Lislea, Co. Armagh, was the owner of two other houses destroyed at Camlough on the same night.  He claimed £2,000 compensation and was refused for the same reason as the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it also in the Spring of 1921 that that decision was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they were all tried at the Quarter Sessions in the Spring of 1921.  Another case mentioned in my Resolution is that of James McGuill, Dromintee, Co. Armagh, who had his home destroyed by British troops on 15th June, 1922. He applied for £15,000 compensation, but was refused on the evidence of the British officer who swore that he destroyed the premises because of military necessity.  Many members here might remember that case, particularly those on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, because a lot of them were entertained from time to time in that particular house.  James McGuill was well-known to be a Republican.  He was Chairman of the No. 2 Rural District Council. He was an active worker in the Sinn Féin movement and housed me, at any rate, when I was on the run and housed many members of Cumann na nGaedheal when they visited that district.  During the Black and Tan wars his house was fired into many times.  An attempt was made on his life one night and he escaped by a very narrow margin.  His wife also escaped by a very narrow margin, because she was fired on by the party <Col N="173" /> of Specials or British forces of some description who entered the house with a view to shooting her husband. She was standing at the top of the stairs and was fired at.  I remember going back there after the Truce and they described the incident to me. She said: &ldquo;Of course it must have been a blank shot; otherwise I could not have escaped.&rdquo;  It was a narrow stairway.  She was standing at the head.  I said: &ldquo;I cannot imagine men going on a mission like that having blank cartridges in their guns.&rdquo;  I examined the head of the stairway and in a spot which must have been a few inches from her head I found a revolver bullet.  I remember being in this particular house with Michael Collins when he attended the Armagh meeting in August of 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Treaty the British forces took steps to drive out those who were in favour of the Republican movement and who were a danger to their supremacy there.  Naturally enough, they picked out men like James MeGuill, who were well-known Republicans and who had entertained people like Michael Collins, and they raided him time and again.  One night a party of Specials with blackened faces broke into the house and attempted to rape Mrs. McGuill and other womenfolk&mdash;her mother and the maidservants.  Mrs. McGuill was a short time before her confinement. I saw her the next day in the most frightful state, and I swore that if I could take it out of the skins of the men who did it I would do it. We went the following night and we laid ambush for the Specials from the Camp who were responsible for the attempted rape.  We shot a few of them.  I am sorry we did not get them all.  Following that, Mr. McGuill's house was destroyed by the British on the plea of military necessity.  Another case is that of Mrs. Anne James Byrne, Tullyorior, Banbridge, Co. Down, whose house was burned down by the Specials in June, 1922.  She made a claim for compensation amounting to £2,067 5s. 0d.  Her claim was turned down because of the evidence given by the <Col N="174" /> Specials that the burning was a military necessity.  Mrs. Byrne, of course, was the mother of two boys who were officers under my command during the Black and Tan war.  They were officers in Banbridge, where a man had to be a good man to be in the Volunteers.  Her home was destroyed because of the help her sons gave to the Volunteers who were fighting Ireland's fight during the Black and Tan war and following it.</P>
    <P>Another case is that of Frederick Joseph Slater, Curry, Belleek, Co. Fermanagh, whose home was burned on the night of the 30th June, 1922, during Curfew hours by the British military and police forces.  Mrs. Slater was given a decree for £1,070. This decision was appealed against by the Fermanagh County Council, and the case was dismissed.  At the first trial Captain Beatty, who was in charge of the Specials at the time, swore that he was fired at from Mr. Slater's house, but at the later trial he was not called.  These are the cases, all cases of people who suffered because of the actions the people of the North took to support the national fight.  Undoubtedly, this Assembly is responsible and has a duty in the matter.  It has an absolute responsibility for the compensation.</P>
    <P>After the Treaty Michael Collins maintained that it was going to secure the unity of Ireland.  He stated in an article which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on 1st February, 1922:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our claim was clear.  Majorities must rule, and in any map marked on that principle we secure immense anti-partition areas.  If we go by counties, anti-partition has a clear majority in two of the six.  Under other headings anti-partition gains much in Down, Derry and Armagh.  These are facts, and we can only come to an agreement with Craig and the British on a recognition of these facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, on February 5th, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the Treaty Ireland is about to become a fully constituted nation.  The whole of Ireland as <Col N="175" /> one nation is to compose the Irish Free State.  That is the whole basis of the Treaty.  It is the bedrock from which our status springs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was that statement and statements like it that caused the people of the North to refuse to recognise the Northern Government and take military action against it.  Statements like that also were the cause of the teachers refusing to recognise the Northern Government and taking instructions from the Dáil Ministry of Education.  They took their instructions from the Dáil Ministry of Education up to 25th November, 1922, and it was from the Dáil Ministry of Education they drew their salaries.  Many months after all the occurrences I mentioned, the teachers in the North got this letter.  It is headed Dublin, and dated 25th November, 1922:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>It has been decided that salaries of teachers under the Six Counties Government paid by us are no longer to be so paid.  The monthly returns and any claims for salary for the month of November, 1922, are therefore to be submitted to the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland on the forms supplied by that Ministry.  It is very desirable that uniform action on the lines indicated should be taken immediately by all teachers concerned.&mdash;Sinne le meas, O'Mahony and O'Daly, per P. O'Mahony.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This letter was addressed to one of the teachers in the North.  It is an interesting document.  It comes from Dublin, and tells the teachers in the North who had incurred the enmity of the Northern Government because of their national stand, that they were no longer to be paid.  They were to go to the Northern Government, and the people responsible for sending it had not the courage to send it themselves.  They got somebody else to send it.  It is signed by P. O'Mahony, whoever he is.  This document and the fact that there is no address, shows what they thought <Col N="176" /> of themselves when they were sending that letter, and what they thought of themselves then, all Irish patriots will think of them in the future.  President Cosgrave disclaims responsibility for the actions that were taken under the authority of the Dáil Ministry of Defence. Many months before the teachers in the North had ceased to be paid.</P>
    <P>This letter was sent out from the Office of the Adjutant-General, General Headquarters, Portobello Barracks.  It is a letter &ldquo;re the men of the Northern units.&rdquo;  It is dated 25th January, 1923, twelve months after President Cosgrave said there was nobody in the North for whom they could accept responsibility. The letter is signed Gearoid O Suilleabhain, Major-General, Adjutant-General. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Officers and men of the Northern units at Keane Barracks will be informed that the present arrangements by which they are in receipt of pay and allowances from Army funds, must cease forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It did not cease on 7th January, 1921.  It was to cease as from 25th January, 1923.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All persons in receipt of money from Army funds must belong to the National Army and be subject to whatever regulations or instructions the Army Council may issue from time to time.  The Army Vote is passed for very definite matters.  At the end of the Financial Year (31st March, 1923) there can be no further payments to these units.  They must, however, get precedence in recruiting the new Battalions&mdash;but if they remain at the Curragh they must be there definitely as attested soldiers of the National Army.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What I want Deputies to do is to declare by their votes that those people who suffered in the national fight should be helped out by those who are in a position to help them.  The members of this Assembly have public funds at their disposal, and they should not allow the burdens of the war that was carried on to fall so severely as they have fallen on those people that I have mentioned.  No matter what side a man was on, or what opinions he might hold, we say that when people go to war they should make provision, if they have attained any measure of success, to distribute as evenly as possible the burdens that the war has imposed.  One of these people in particular has been rendered absolutely destitute, a man who owned a house, premises and a farm worth up to £12,000 or £15,000, and he is existing at present only through the charity of his neighbours. That is eight years after we were supposed to have achieved freedom.  Surely to goodness if we have £270,000 to give in additional grants we should have at least <Col N="180" /> £20,000 or less to give to these people.  Surely if we give people more than they ask in compensation in many cases here in the South, we should give those people a little of what they ask.  I hope that between now and the resumption of this debate the members of Cumann na nGaedheal who asked the support of the people for the Treaty on the plea that it was to bring unity and freedom to the country will bring pressure to bear upon the Government to meet these cases.  I do not care how it is done; I only want it to be done.  We only raised this question in this Assembly when all other means had failed.  Remember, it is eight years since these things happened, and every month since the Government have been approached in one way or another to do something for some of these people.  I do not care whether it is by an Act of this Assembly that the money is provided, or whether it is provided from some other funds that are at the disposal of the Government, but I believe that these people should be compensated, and I hope that members of Cumann na nGaedheal particularly will realise that it is their duty to see that the people who suffered so severely are not left destitute.  Surely to goodness if they put their heads together in their own Party, if they thrashed this thing out with the Government, with the evidence I have given them of the responsibility that the Government has for the action that was taken, they could force their Party to do this little thing in the national interest.  I move the adjournment of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to raise the matter of Question No. 3 upon the adjournment because I thought it involved matters of very considerable importance in which all Deputies and Parties should be interested.  I chose to put down a <Col N="181" /> question on to-day's Order Paper&mdash; relating to the treatment given to Mr. William Rowe&mdash;on the first day on which the Dáil assembled, not because there are any peculiar circumstances relating to this case but because it is typical of quite a number of cases which have occurred in and around the city of Dublin during the past two months.  The facts of this case have been generally admitted by the Minister.  On October 3rd of this year this Mr. Rowe, against whom no charge has been formulated and against whom no evidence to sustain any charge can be produced, was arrested at 7 o'clock in the morning by members of the Detective Division of the Civic Guards.  He was released at 11 o'clock on the same day and rearrested at 11.30, and he was again released at 3 o'clock.  That evening at 7 p.m. when he was walking in Meath Street, Dublin, he noticed that he was being followed by two men.  They followed him along Meath Street and Thomas Street. Whether or not the members of the Detective Division who were following him called upon him to halt does not really matter.  Mr. Rowe says that he heard no call to halt; the Minister for Justice says that the members of the Detective Division called on him to halt.  In any case apparently he did not halt, with the result that the members of the Detective Division drew their revolvers and commenced firing shots&mdash;the Minister says in the air; Mr. Rowe says at him.  He was not hit, anyhow.</P>

    <P>If a man against whom there is no charge and no evidence to sustain a charge, is arrested twice in the one day by the police and twice released it is quite obvious that there is no particular urgency involved in his arrest for the third time.  If the Minister for Justice or the members of the Civic Guard had no other concern except the lives of the ordinary unoffending citizens of Dublin, surely these men should hesitate before firing revolvers in the public street in order that this <Col N="182" /> formality of a third arrest might have been completed.  The Minister has stated that he disapproves of the firing of shots.  It is about time that he disapproved of the firing of shots.</P>
    <P>I have said that this case of Mr. Rowe's is not the only one.  There have been quite a number of cases in and around Dublin recently in which members of the Detective Division have been firing off shots without any apparent cause.  It will be, no doubt, a matter of considerable amusement, at any rate, to the members of the Detective Division, to know that the Minister disapproves of the conduct.  But does the Minister seriously think that they care a rap whether he disapproves or not?  Apparently not.  It is quite obvious to me that a large number of the members of this force are out of control, and that the Minister for Justice is either unable or unwilling to bring them back under control.  I would like him to tell us whether this campaign which they are conducting in Dublin City was planned and ordered by him, or whether members of the Detective Division decided upon it themselves, and put it into operation, and that he is taking upon himself the rather unpleasant task of defending it without having any responsibility for it.  If the Minister is responsible for this campaign I want him to tell us what exactly is the object he is driving at, what does he hope to achieve by it?  These repeated arrests are continuing day after day.  I got a report yesterday of another young man in Dublin, a graduate of the National University&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I will confine myself to the particular matter that arises out of my question. The campaign that has been conducted against this Mr. Rowe is similar to the campaign conducted against a number of other individuals, and is apparently designed to make it impossible for him in the first instance to get employment.  A number of other men are continuously arrested at work.  School teachers were arrested while teaching classes; others in different forms of employment have been repeatedly arrested at work, until their employers becoming unwilling, and in many cases unable to continue employing them, dismiss them.  Is the object of this campaign against Mr. Rowe and the others merely designed to make it impossible for them to earn a living in this country, or is it designed to break down their self-control and to induce them to take retaliatory action?  Personally I am convinced that this campaign, whether it was designed by the Minister for Justice, by the Executive Council, or by individual and irresponsible members of the Civic Guard has for its object the creation of a state of affairs in which Ministers will be able to pose again as strong men battling with lawlessness. But I would like Deputies to realise that if lawlessness does result from the illegal activities which the Civic Guard are responsible for in Dublin, and of which this campaign against Mr. Rowe is but a small example, Deputies who permit these things to happen without protest <Col N="184" /> must bear prime responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>In speaking on this matter I feel that words are very largely useless. I feel that it is impossible to get the Minister for Justice to realise the possible consequences of the policy for which he, at any rate, is taking responsibility.  We have had ridiculous excuses offered for various illegal activities of the Civic Guards. The excuse which the Minister for Justice has offered for the repeated arrests of Mr. Rowe is equally ridiculous. We are told that he is a member of a gang which has been responsible for many criminal activities. What right has the Minister for Justice to make that statement? Has he one iota of evidence to support it?  If he has that evidence surely it is his duty to give a jury an opportunity of investigating it. But he knows that he has not that evidence.  He is not merely endeavouring to persecute these individuals but wants to slander them as well.  A statement of that kind, made in a public assembly like this, which cannot be supported by evidence, is slander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is anxious to inquire into the activities of members of the Detective Division.  If he is, surely this case gave him an opportunity. Statements were published in certain weekly papers in Dublin by Mr. Rowe that he believes the firing on the 3rd October was a deliberate attempt to kill him.  He says he can identify the men who fired at him.  If a man, even a man whom the Minister suspects to be a criminal, makes a statement of that kind, is it not the duty of the police to investigate it?  If Deputy Shaw came into the Minister's office tomorrow and said he had been fired at by two men while on the way to the Dáil and could identify the men, would the Minister say that Deputy Shaw, being a member of Cumann na nGaedheal, could only expect to be fired at, or something of that kind?  That is a perfect example. Is it merely because Mr. Rowe does not happen to agree with the Minister <Col N="185" /> as to what the political status of this country should be, that no action will be taken in his case, no matter how often men in the pay of the State use revolvers supplied to them by the State to fire at men such as Mr. Rowe?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister admit, what a very large number of the public are beginning to believe, that he cannot control members of the Detective Division?  Will he say that he has ever at any time attempted to exercise control over members of the Detective Division even when they were engaged in an activity of which he disapproves?  He disapproves of their firing shots in public. I would ask Deputies to look at this whole affair from a normal point of view.  We have lived through abnormal times in this country and our outlook may be a bit cock-eyed, if I may use that expression.  We may see things perhaps not in their true perspective, but, if conditions are as normal as we are constantly told they are by the Minister and his colleagues, is it not an outrageous thing for the Minister to stand here in a legislative assembly and say that he has to disapprove of members of the Civic Guard firing shots in public and firing them for no reason?</P>
    <P>If they wanted to arrest Mr. Rowe they had him twice on that day and they let him go.  They had no reason to arrest him the third time. Why did they not keep him when they had him first?  They let him go and he walks the whole length of Meath Street and Thomas Street &mdash;and that is no short distance&mdash; and two detectives follow him the whole way.  At the end of Meath Street they proceed with their shooting. Mr. Rowe says that he heard no challenge.  Was it necessary to give a challenge?  What was to prevent the two detectives walking up to Mr. Rowe and arresting him? He was not running; he was walking. They did not want that.  It is all part of the campaign to drive these men out of the country or else to drive them into taking the action that I believe the Minister for Justice wants them to take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> I do not think, and I have no hope, that raising this question here this evening is likely to produce any alteration in conditions.  I do not believe any such alteration will be effected until we have succeeded in arousing public opinion on this matter so as to demand a cessation. The difficulty in arousing public opinion is this, that the Minister has succeeded in gagging the Press.  I do not know how he did it.  He may have issued orders or he may have met the editors at a dinner party and suggested to them that, in the interests of law and order, lawless acts by the detectives should not be reported.  There have been quite a number of these shootings in and around Dublin during the last month and not a single one of them was reported in the Press.  The public do not know what is happening.  I am certain many Deputies in this House do not know what is happening. Only those of us who are informed by the victims of the campaign understand exactly what is going on. When we have the whole Press of the country in a conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to keep public opinion misinformed, it is very difficult to make a protest.  The Minister knows that if the public were informed of the one incident on October 3rd there would be such an outcry against the administration of the Gárda Síochána that he could not possibly continue to remain in control of them; that is, if he is in control of them.  I have reason to believe that the great majority of the uniformed police force are anxious and willing to preserve order and respect the law as well as they can; but there is a section which has no respect for law and this is the section now responsible for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to give him plenty of time to reply and if he gives us as amusing a ten minutes as he did over the Clare case he will be helping to bring the whole administration of his Department into ridicule.  If we cannot bring it into contempt we will at least bring it into ridicule.  The sooner the public is informed of the fact that there is something wrong with the Department, the sooner will they demand a reorganisation and, if necessary, a change of personnel, in order that the machinery which this Dáil established and for which the people are paying to preserve order and enforce the law in this country will not be used as an agent of lawlessness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I am able to agree with one thing that Deputy Lemass said in the very eloquent oration which he has just delivered to the House.  He said he took rather a cock-eyed view of the matter under discussion.  I entirely agree with the Deputy.  I think his whole view is absolutely a cock-eyed view, to use his own expression.  The Deputy, through a good deal of his statement, was making the sort of speech which we usually hear on the Gárda Estimates and on other occasions in the House.  I do not intend to follow the Deputy through his wanderings.  I will just only say this, that the Detective Division of the Gárda and every single member of the Gárda are under complete and effective control and any statement that the Deputy makes to the effect that the Gárda, any portion of the Gárda, or any single individual member of the Gárda is out of control, is entirely without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the particular question which is now under discussion, I think the Deputy is hardly fair to the House when he seems to suggest &mdash;and he did seem to suggest it&mdash; that Mr. Rowe is, to his knowledge, a law-abiding citizen, a person who simply holds certain political views <Col N="188" /> and who wishes to advance these views by lawful means.  Does Deputy Lemass suggest that to the House? Does he himself know nothing about Mr. Rowe?  Is he a complete stranger?  Does Deputy Lemass think that Mr. Rowe is not a person who is engaged in criminal activities to upset this State by force of arms? Deputy Lemass was once Minister, I think, for Defence in a certain so-called government.  I think I would not be wrong in saying that Mr. Rowe was one of the persons who then served under him to his knowledge and, when Deputy Lemass ceased to hold that position and there was a successor appointed, Mr. Rowe was one of the persons who went away.  From that day to this Mr. Rowe has been an active person in what calls itself the Irish Republican Army.  What the objects of that Army are everybody knows.  The things which that Army has done lately in the City of Dublin everybody knows.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rowe is a person who is looked upon, and rightly looked upon, by the Guards as dangerous, and as a person who is engaged in a criminal conspiracy against the State.  It is a conspiracy which leads to terrible overt acts.  It is necessary that crime should be prevented, and surely now, at any rate, Deputy Lemass will agree that it is better that crime should be prevented than that crime should be perpetrated and that the country should get into a condition of disorder.  The Guards saw Mr. Rowe and examined him as a person very likely to have incriminating documents upon him.  It is a fact that they did it twice.  Then, no doubt, Mr. Rowe thought himself safe for that day.  The Guards come along behind him&mdash;they saw him in Meath Street&mdash;and he begins to run away; they shout to him twice to halt, and he shouts back to them &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and continues to run.  Then one of the Guards fires two shots over Mr. Rowe's head.  These are the facts of what happened.  I have already stated that to effect an arrest shots should not be fired except in very exceptional circumstances.  Of course, the Deputy, as he and those <Col N="189" /> associated with him always do, is prepared to accept every word of Mr. Rowe and persons like him.  The Deputy says that Mr. Rowe made a statement.  I take it that is the statement that I have seen since I answered the Deputy's question to-day. It is a statement which appeared in &ldquo;An Phoblacht.&rdquo;  I presume that is the statement to which the Deputy refers.  I will draw the attention of the House to that statement and see how falsely it is based.  It runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;At 7 o'clock Billy&rdquo;&mdash; Billy is the way in which this paper refers to Mr. Rowe&mdash;&ldquo;returned for his tea.  Two men came towards him in Francis Street.  He went on through Thomas Street to Meath Street.  Mark you, he was walking&rdquo;&mdash;that is put in very large type&mdash;&ldquo;neither cycling nor running.  Two C.I.D. men were walking fifteen yards behind him.  He can identify both of them.  There was no call to halt.  Shots rang out, one to five or seven, in rapid succession.  Billy heard the bullets whistle around him. It was a clear and deliberate attempt to murder.  Had it succeeded there would be as little chance of convicting the murderers as when young Coughlan was done to death.  It would have been said that Billy ambushed the C.I.D. or that he was shot by his comrades.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, take this story.  Billy is neither running nor cycling.  Billy, as they call him, is walking.  Fifteen yards behind him are two armed men.  They walk after him a considerable distance, and in Meath Street they fire seven shots with the intention of hitting a walking man fifteen yards in front.  And they do not even graze him.  And the gentleman still continues to walk.  What becomes of him then?  There the story stops.  We hear nothing further.  He is left walking with the bullets whizzing round his head.  Is that true?  Does any Deputy in this House believe that story?  Now take the next paragraph &ldquo;Murdered like Coughlan.&rdquo;  Well everybody in this <Col N="190" /> House knows how Coughlan met his death.  It was the subject of an inquiry by a Committee set up by this House.  It was proved beyond question that Coughlan met his death because he endeavoured to assassinate a man named Harling and that Harling fired back killing him.  That has been proved.</P>
    <P>If you get the facts of the Coughlan case so extremely distorted as they are distorted in that paper which Deputy Lemass read and in which Mr. Rowe's account is given, how are you to think that this paper is giving anything like a truthful statement with reference to the occurrence?  If where a matter has been the subject of judicial investigation this paper can lie as it lies about the death of Coughlan, how can you accept as truthful this other statement?  Yet Deputy Lemass appears to accept as Gospel truth every word contained in it.  Now just consider for a moment.  One story is true.  Rowe has been arrested twice; he is running.  Why is he running?  He is running, obviously, because he had on that occasion something in his possession. Is not that the conclusion which most persons would draw?  The Guards pursue him and they cannot catch him.  One of them fires twice. Do you think if Rowe's story were true, that if this walking man were fired at five or seven times from fifteen yards behind that he could have been possibly missed?  That story does not sound the slightest bit truthful.  This is done in Meath Street at 7 o'clock in the evening, and the Guards are supposed to commit murder in a lighted street at 7 o'clock on an October evening; does the Deputy believe that?  Surely every single statement that Mr. Rowe has made in that paper rings untrue and surely Deputies opposite must admit that the whole thing is untrue.</P>

It was not until after the passing of the Companies Act, 1900, that is on 1st January, 1901, that it became obligatory on companies to file a copy of the prospectus or statement in lieu of prospectus with the Registrar.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that acute congestion exists in the townlands of Rathgranagher, Thomastown, Davris, and Roose, in the parish of Kilcommon, and if he will state what.  steps, if any, are being taken by the Irish Land Commission to acquire the large untenanted grazing ranch on the De Clifford estate held by Mr. R.T.

      <P>Proceedings were instituted under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of the lands of Greaghans, containing 163a. 1r. 26p., in the occupation of R.T. Crawford.  These lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, will become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.</P>
      <P>These lands are subject to a Land Purchase annuity, and the owner's objection to their acquisition is pending before the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Congestion in the neighbourhood has already been relieved by the acquisition and distribution of some 117 acres of the lands of Greaghans acquired from James Brannick.</P>
