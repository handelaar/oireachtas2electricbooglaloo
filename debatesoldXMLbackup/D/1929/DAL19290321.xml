      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in dealing with a recent application for the old age pension made by Timothy Hurley, Lettergorman, Dunmanway, the Pension Officer estimated the applicant received five pounds per year from his daughter in America; if he will state whether this is a general practice in estimating claims, and what justification there is for making such an assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that grave inconvenience is caused to the business community in Sligo and Ballina, due to the absence of telephonic communication between Skreen and Beltra Post Office, in the barony of Tireragh, Co. Sligo, and whether in view of the fact that a distance of only four miles separates these Post Offices he will have them connected telephonically.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President (for Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not aware that grave inconvenience <Col N="1682" /> has been experienced as a result of the non-existence of telephonic connection between Skreen and Beltra.  As was explained to the Deputy by letter on the 28th November last, the linking up of these places telephonically would involve heavy expense, and would be out of all proportion to the revenue likely to be derived from calls.  The Minister would, therefore, not be justified in authorising the connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the Roads Department have made any survey of the bridges on the roads of the Saorstát; whether it is known how many of them require constructional improvement in order to make them safe for heavy <Col N="1684" /> motor traffic; and, if so, whether local authorities have been informed of the results of this survey, and whether the necessary action by local authorities has been taken in the matter of reconstructing or improving such bridges; further, whether local authorities have taken any steps to compel the railway companies to improve and maintain bridges crossing a railway line; and whether the Roads Department have any programme of work of this kind for the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries of the nature indicated by the Deputy were initiated in December, 1926, in so far as concerned railway bridges carrying main roads over railways and it appeared that at least 37 such bridges were subject to restrictions as to the weight of vehicles passing over them.  Full particulars as regards each county were already in possession of the County Surveyor, but local authorities have no power to compel railway companies to improve bridges crossing a railway line.  The companies are usually bound to maintain such bridges.  The question of improvement rests primarily with the local authorities and would probably be one for negotiation between them and the railway companies.  In the case of non-railway bridges the responsibility rests solely with the local authority where such bridges form part of a public road.  There has been no general demand for a programme of the nature indicated by the Deputy in the concluding part of his question and it is not proposed in the coming year to frame such a programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct to state that in respect of the grants being given now it is insisted that the money be used only for maintenance and that there is to be no reconstruction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the present year it is proposed to expend a total of, approximately, £600,000 from the Road Fund.  The Road Authorities have been asked to say what they are spending on maintenance this year, in order that the particular fraction of that £600,000 which must be kept aside for maintenance will be kept aside.  Until the Road Authorities have enabled us to say how much of that £600,000 will be required for maintenance, I <Col N="1686" /> am not in a position to say how much of it will be available for improvement. I anticipate that maintenance charges will require about £200,000, but if local authorities were more up-to-date in letting us know what they were going to do under the head of maintenance, we would be in a position to let them know earlier how much was to be distributed to them in respect of improvements.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 6 (1), to delete lines 43 to 58 inclusive, and substitute the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  develop and perfect such invention;</P>
      <P>(b)  form or promote an incorporated company or an unincorporated association of persons to develop and perfect such invention;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  take an assignment of any <Col N="1690" /> patent or of a share or interest in any patent theretofore or thereafter obtained for such invention;</P>
    <P>(d)  sell or lease any such patent or grant licences under any such patent on such terms as he shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, think proper;</P>
    <P>(e)  form or promote an incorporated company or an unincorporated association of persons to work commercially any such patent;</P>
    <P>(f)  do all such things as may be necessary for the maintenance or preservation of any such patent or be otherwise incidental to the ownership thereof.</P>
    <P>This is the best suggestion or offer that I can make to the Dáil with regard to the points discussed on the original Section 6 when the Bill was under consideration in Committee. The changes made are simple enough. I have taken out paragraph 6 (e) as it existed, under which the Minister was given power to work a patent commercially.  I have, however, still retained for the Minister the power to form or promote a company to work a patent commercially.  I have kept paragraph (a), and have, in addition, given power to form a company for the purpose of developing and perfecting an invention.  I have kept paragraph (b) as it was, and I have amalgamated paragraphs (c) and (d) with a slight change in the wording which does not make any material difference to the powers given.  Paragraph (f) is amended so as to leave it solely to deal with the formation and promotion of a company to work any such patent commercially. Paragraph (g) remains as it was.</P>
    <P>The important part is what follows in amendment 2.  The two amendments will have to be considered together, and for that reason I will now move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 3, line 59, before Section 6 (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Every Minister shall, before <Col N="1691" /> the 1st day of April in every year, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report of every (if any) exercise by him in the next preceding year of the several powers conferred by paragraphs (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of this Section and also, if and so far as he considers expedient in the public interest, of the several powers conferred by paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of the said sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under that amendment the Minister must lay a report upon the Table of each House if he has exercised any of the powers under (d) and (e), selling or leasing a patent or granting licences under any such patent, or the formation or promotion of a company to work a patent commercially; and if and so far as he considers it expedient in the public interest he shall also lay a report on the Table of the several powers conferred by paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f).  The distinction is that I must bring to the notice of the House every year anything that is done with regard to the selling or leasing of a patent, the granting of licences under any such patent, or the formation or promotion of a company to work a patent commercially.  With regard to the other paragraphs in the first amendment, if and so far as the Minister considers it expedient in the public interest he may report with reference to the several powers conferred upon him under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f).  I may say that I do not consider it expedient in the public interest to lay a report on the Table with regard to what has been done under (a), (b), (c) and (f) already, if this be passed; that is, with regard to the particular invention which has been somewhat vaguely discussed.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to be noted in the first amendment arising out of paragraph (d) under which the selling or leasing of a patent or the granting of licences under any such patent is now subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Before any evil use can be made of the peculiar powers granted under this there will have to be two corrupt, evil-minded or irresponsible Ministers, the Minister handling this and the Minister for Finance.  They will have to bring their peculiar action or their irresponsibility before the House prior to the 1st of April in each year.</P>
    <P>That is the best I can offer with regard to the points raised the last day.  I may take it that if these two amendments are accepted it would be regarded as pretty well guaranteed that once a matter has been the subject of discussion here and has reached the point of being brought before the public in a proper way, when that matter has been enquired into by the Public Accounts Committee there should be such further amendment of the clause as the Public Accounts Committee's examination of the transaction would seem to make necessary.  In other words, this is being put forward as provisional legislation.  Of course, that is subject to all the fluctuating circumstances of the future and the guarantee may not be worth a great deal.  As far as I am concerned I would apply myself to that, that paragraph 6 would be regarded as very provisional.  If one desired to secure that very definitely and precisely, I presume one could take out paragraph 6 and bring it under the heading of expiring laws legislation so that it will have to be reviewed year by year.  At the moment I would prefer not to do that unless there is a very strong feeling in the House on the matter.  I would prefer to patch it up in this way although that may not satisfy those who expressed themselves upon the subject during the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>We have discussed this suggested amendment, and it seems to us to be a fair effort to meet the objections raised to the wide powers proposed to be given to the Minister originally.  We would be inclined to allow this procedure to be adopted for the purpose of seeing how it would work if a case arose where those powers <Col N="1693" /> would be called into operation.  Very often inaccurate or incomplete information is worse than no information at all, and if the Minister proposed to make a statement with respect to the exercise of the powers conferred upon him by (a), (b), (c) and (f), only in so far as he considered it expedient in the public interest, I think either in the document laid on the Table it should be stated: &ldquo;Important information relative to these matters is being withheld, as it is not expedient in the public interest to publish it,&rdquo; or else the Minister should make no statement at all.  I feel it is better that he should not be under any obligation to make a statement than that he should make a statement which might, to a person not fully conversant with the facts, be misleading. On the other hand, he might put it that the information could be supplied, but that certain matters necessary to the proper understanding of the subject were being withheld, as it was not expedient in the public interest to publish them.  I would like the Minister to consider that suggestion or alternatively stop after paragraph (e) of amendment 1.  It is really the information relating to the exercise of the Minister's powers under (d) and (e) that is essential.  It is not equally essential that the Dáil should have information under the other paragraphs, because in the exercise of them certain moneys will have to be expended and a statement will have to be made in the House for the purpose of getting the sanction of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>With regard to the new sub-section it is proposed to insert before Section 6, the Minister proposes to lay before the Dáil a statement in connection with probably liability under certain proposals that he has in mind.  Supposing a matter arises between Ist April in one year and Ist April in the following year which necessitates immediate action, what step would the Minister purpose taking to meet the situation?  Would he purpose waiting until he would have <Col N="1694" /> an opportunity of laying the matter before the Dáil?  It might not be desirable to delay it so long.</P>

      <P>I do not see how any expense can be so incurred.  If there is expense which involves any financial liability on the State that expense has to be met out of the moneys voted by the House.  The expense cannot be incurred by the Minister save in so far as the Contingency Fund may be raided except he goes for a supplementary estimate, and that supplementary estimate would always have to come before the event.  If there is liability in the nature of expense that matter must be brought before the Dáil before the expense is incurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said already unless it came out of the Contingency Fund.  But in any other liability that might come under the head of selling or leasing that would <Col N="1695" /> not apply.  I do not know if the Deputy means that there might be in certain cases a contingent liability&mdash;a liability which had not accrued.  In that case I suppose the Minister might go ahead, and when the liability had become an actual one he would then come to the Dáil. Naturally the Minister would have to look forward to having to do that and to contemplate the possibility that the Dáil might refuse.  If the thing could be foreseen at all, he would be certain to come before the Dáil.  In that event the Dáil would again get notice.  With regard to selling or leasing or forming companies there is nothing in the nature of a sacrifice.  The Minister would afterwards have to report.  It is a question of selling or leasing or granting licences.  The Minister would report, but then it would be too late to prevent the exercise of the powers.</P>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Lemass raises, why this was put in was because I cannot conceive circumstances in which the Minister would give such a mangled report so that the information given to the House would be misleading.  Rather than do that, the Minister would say: &ldquo;It is not expedient in the public interest to give any information.&rdquo; Without that provision in the Bill Deputies could not call for information. It is better to have that there, because by a Parliamentary question there can be got from the Minister a statement on the matter if there is anything withheld, and if so what the reason is.  It may be that the statement of the Minister in reply to that would be that it is not in the public interest to disclose the information. It would be a completely wrong thing for the Minister to place such a mangled statement before the House as would mislead the House.  If the phrasing remains as it is now, the matter will be clear.  I ask that it be left in.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> In page 4, line 52, Section 10 (1) (ii), after the word &ldquo;language,&rdquo; but within the inverted commas, to insert the words &ldquo;provided also that the Governor-General may, by order made on the advice of the Executive Council, exclude from the operation of the foregoing proviso all or any class or classes of works, the authors of which were at the date of the making of such works citizens of any country not a party to the said International Union which the Governor-General, on the advice aforesaid, shall think fit to specify in such order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a simple point.  It has to deal specially with the case of America and with the obtaining of copyright privileges there.  We find that in order to get the Presidential Proclamation which is necessary in the United States before our citizens can obtain copyright in America or in the United States, it is for us to show that we are granting exactly the same copyright conditions here. This is conferring on American citizens the same privileges here as their law confers on our citizens in America.  But the American law makes no reservations for translation, and we have to make provision for the case where the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive Council, may except from the provisions with regard to translations. It really applies to America, and before we can get copyright in America we must give the same right as our citizens get in their country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing problem is admitted by everybody to be one which is having a serious reaction on the country generally. Appeals are being made that the matter should be looked at from a national standpoint.  There are some of us who have given this matter consideration in our own way.  The President, speaking on this Bill, yesterday, indicated clearly the difficulties that the Government were confronted with.  The President did stress chiefly that house building would be gone on with, in the first instance, if the operatives and master builders could be got to bring down the cost of building and increase output.  That is to say, that on the one hand there would be increased output by the operatives so as to lessen the cost of production and that the master builders would agree to a smaller profit on the other hand.  I have been discussing this matter from various aspects and in one particular case I discussed the matter from the operatives' point of view.  I wonder does the President realise that the tradesmen in the building trades suffer from one great difficulty, and it is this&mdash;that they have no security of continuity of work.  The operatives are faced with a scheme.  A number of houses are being put up in a certain area. These men are employed and they see so many months' work ahead for them.  They start with a will and they give a proper output.  But I was told, anyway, that it is possible to be quite human in the matter, and that when the men are near the completion of the work and see nothing else before them but unemployment they cannot be expected to have the <Col N="1698" /> same interest in the construction schemes as if there were a series of building schemes going on where they would have security of work for five years.  If the master builders get, on the one hand, a satisfactory output in exchange for the wages paid, and, on the other hand, get materials at reasonable prices this would warrant houses being put up that could be let or sold at economic rates.  The President states that there is a difficulty and asks what can we do; he asks what is our solution in the matter? I consider that it is the Government's duty to bring about a solution of the matter.  I wonder if they ever consider the people who are suffering as a result of the houses not being built?  Evidently a deadlock has been reached.  Meanwhile, everybody sits down and the people living in these broken-down old houses, these ramshackle buildings in the slums sit down and wait and the difficulties that arise out of that situation go on developing.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest this: I do not know whether the Minister has considered this point that I am going to put before the House.  I believe his Department is anxious to help in this problem of housing. Have they ever considered using the Combined Purchasing Board for the purpose of getting materials for the smaller master builders at competitive prices or at prices cheaper than they can get them to-day?  I would think that instead of giving a monetary grant of forty or fifty pounds, if they gave instead materials which cost them that amount they would be helping in the matter of the building of these houses much more than by the giving of a grant in the ordinary way.  I do not say that I am sure that this is possible.  I do not say it is impossible, but I was wondering if it had ever been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a group of people in Dublin anxious to build artisans' dwellings in the suburbs.  The great difficulty they experienced was the tremendous cost they would be faced with in connection with sanitary arrangements.  We have in Dublin, <Col N="1699" /> not very far from the centre of the city, groups of cottages with oldfashioned sanitary arrangements.  I am told that in England at present a new idea has been adopted in connection with sanitary arrangements which does away with all the expense of putting in sewerage.  I indicated that on one occasion to the Department.  I was asked if I could give any further information, but I do not happen to be an expert in the matter.  I had heard about this new arrangement, and I thought it might solve the situation for people anxious to build in the suburbs.  The President laughs at any suggestion made. I take this matter quite seriously. The President does not happen to get requests, as I do, to visit the tenements in the slums and see the conditions there.  He can very well laugh when he is away from these particular conditions.  I do not feel like laughing, because I feel just as responsible as anybody else for not being able to do something that will solve the problem.  I have not at my disposal the expert staff that the President has, and I cannot get all the information I should like to have.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that the President knows more about it than I do.  I have not, nor have Deputies on this side, access to the different departments for the discussion of these matters in order to put up a solution for this problem.  The President on one occasion said that the housing problem was a baby that the Government were not going to carry.  It was suggested by Deputy <Col N="1700" /> O'Kelly that as we had reached a deadlock and nothing was being done a housing board should be set up to consider the matter, and the President's reply was: &ldquo;You do not want the baby.  You want to hand it over to a housing board.&rdquo;  We have not the baby at all&mdash;it is the Government's baby, and they have got to do something.  It is all very well to say to us: &ldquo;What is your solution?  Let us have your suggestions.&rdquo; We cannot put forward a suggestion unless the Government means business in the matter.  The President also told us about the cost of building houses seven years ago. He said that the cost of building had fallen as much as seven per cent. in the last seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. The President indicated that when the cost of house building fell to a figure which would make it an economic proposition to build houses then they would go on building houses.  As against that, I say that as soon as houses can be built for sale or letting at an economic figure the people will not wait for the Government to do it; they will do it themselves.  The difficulty is that it cannot be done now on that basis; there is no hope of it being done in the near future on that basis, and, therefore, it is a national problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It would not be an unsolved problem then. The people whose business it is to build houses would build them at a rapid rate, because people would buy or rent them at an economic figure.  The difficulty we are confronted with now is that it does not pay builders to build houses, because they cannot sell them at an economic price.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The President indicated yesterday that a time would come when the problem could be solved.  I say that when that time comes the Government will not have to solve it, because it will be solved by the people themselves.  The master builders will be able to build houses that can be set at an economic rent, out of which they can make a profit.  It will be the same as an investment to them.  As long as there is no hope that that situation will arise in the near future, I say that it is a Government problem; it is a difficulty that they will have to face and find some solution for.  This Bill may, to a certain extent, remove some of the difficulties. Half a loaf is better than no bread, but certainly it is going away from where we were.  In introducing this Bill, the Minister quoted certain figures which meant nothing to anybody in this House.  We were told that a scheme cost so much on a particular occasion and that another scheme cost so much less; therefore the cost of building had fallen by so much.  Before I could give any opinion as to whether the cost had fallen, I should like to have more details.  I should like to know, for instance, whether wages were reduced. The scheme the Minister had in mind might be one undertaken by the Dublin Commissioners where a wage of 30/- per week was paid to operatives.  I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept that from the Minister without any hesitation or doubt.  It indicates, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, that certainly it is not wages.  In spite of what the master builders say, that they have got their end down to the limit, it is proved by the Minister that the main reductions are made elsewhere without reducing wages.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rice's Committee indicated that the operatives would not meet in this way and the master builders in the other way.  If it is not a question of wages then it is that the operatives are suffering from lack of continuity of work as borne out by the Committee.  They say in one paragraph if a scheme was undertaken which would last for five years something could be done on the basis of getting nearer to the point of meeting each other. Now it may seem a small and peculiar point to talk about the effect of the non-continuity of work upon the individual.  I understand that in housing schemes undertaken in the Dublin area you have got a certain number of bricklayers and a certain number of plasterers, but not enough of either to suit a gigantic scheme or a scheme where everyone of them would be sure to be employed at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hear that at one end, and at the same time the builders in charge of a scheme employ a number of bricklayers for one week, plasterers for another week; they employ one particular <Col N="1703" /> type of workers at one time and another for another space of time, so that the workers are migrating round about and then are idle for three or four or six months of the year.  But tradesmen have got responsibilities in regard to their household affairs.  They have wives and families and ordinary liabilities to meet, and if they have not that continuity of a certain amount of work over a period of years, clear enough to see ahead three, four or five years, how can we expect them to give the best on a job, after perhaps four months of idleness, and to work with the same amount of strength, energy and good-will as they had shown when they left off?</P>
    <P>There is the human element in it and it should be taken into consideration. This Bill which is before the House will not guarantee continuity of work for the operatives.  It will not help very much in the building of new houses.  The Minister is just taking the saving, or a little bit more than the saving, that has been brought about in the last few years in the building of houses and, by doing that, he is going to stop again for a time any further building of houses.  If the Government itself were serious in an endeavour to solve this problem, even if there was a reduction in building cost of ten or twenty or thirty per cent., instead of taking full advantage of that they would leave it for the benefit of the people for whom these houses will be built.  I do not know whether Deputy Good will agree with that, but I do not see any more reason why the Government should take, by means of a reduced grant, the saving in cost from people who will ultimately get these houses than that the operatives should get it in increased wages or the master builders in increased profits.  I say if you want to get houses built by the master builders and operatives working together, and if it be possible for both of them to benefit somewhat under the existing terms, then it is unfair for the Government to take advantage of the situation and rob them of the benefit they are bringing to the people <Col N="1704" /> who would ultimately get the houses.</P>
    <P>The rates are reduced for five and seven roomed houses and you now have an all-round grant.  Under present conditions the price is not going to give any impetus either to the operatives, on one hand, or to the master builders on the other.  When speaking on this particular subject of housing on the last occasion, I said it was a matter that the Government should face on lines similar to those on which they faced the electricity scheme; that they should take it upon their own shoulders as a national matter and pay for it for the benefit of the community out of the taxpayers' money.  Where does the Government get the money which it gives as a grant for housing? They get it from the people and now they will not give those people whom they tax any benefit in the shape of some return or service.</P>
    <P>We are told the postal service is going to be reduced somewhat.  As far as my constituency is concerned, and as far as the slums in the city are concerned, the most important social service is housing.  I say that housing is the one thing that the Government of the future will have to take on its back and carry as a social and as an essential service. The housing of the people is something the people cannot do for themselves. The people in these areas in Dublin cannot build their own houses and the Government cannot afford to see them living as they are living now.  And, therefore, I say it is a matter for solution by the Government. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health or the President has not told us one single thing as to the solution they may have in mind.  They simply ask &ldquo;What would you do if you were in our places; what is your solution?&rdquo; That is not treating the matter in the manner it deserves.</P>
    <P>This Bill no doubt will be passed because, as I said already, half a loaf is better than no bread.  But I say this Bill does not go far enough. There are people in the country living in wretched houses and now there is no longer a grant for the reconstruction of such houses to <Col N="1705" /> make them habitable.  I hope if this thing cannot be done now to hear that in the near future the Department and the Minister will be working out the problem and trying to find some solution&mdash;that they will be able to give to the House some indication that they are getting down to the point at which they will be able to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned at all with people living in residential palaces.  I am concerned with people living in the north and south side of the city in slum areas&mdash;in Gloucester Street and in the Coombe. These are the people for whom something must be done.  I have had occasion to go to the Commissioners and try and get accommodation for people living in wretched houses.  On one occasion I went on behalf of a man who had applied five years ago for housing accommodation.  He was told his family was not sufficiently large.  He had three children, and the cellar he was living in was condemned by the Commissioners' own medical officer as reeking with tuberculosis. I tried to get something done in other cases.  We have all these difficulties individually and collectively, and they will continue so long as houses are not erected to keep pace with the demands.  This particular Bill, instead of helping us, is going to lessen the pace at which this problem can be solved by a reduction of the grant, while the Government have taken the advantage of the savings so far in the cost of building which should really be given as an extra grant for the building of houses.</P>

      <P>One of the most disappointing features of the present proposal, in my opinion, is contained <Col N="1707" /> in the statement made here in the House yesterday, without justification, as far as I know, for the refusal of the Minister to make long-term loans available for local authorities. Deputy Lemass and other representatives of the City of Dublin have complained a good deal about the failure of the Dublin City Commissioners or, I suppose, in effect, the failure of the Department of Local Government to enable the Dublin City Commissioners to proceed at a quicker rate than they have been doing with housing schemes for the City of Dublin.  Looking at the figures given to us by the Minister yesterday, we find that grants will be provided under the terms of this Bill up to 1st April for 10,717 houses to be built by private individuals. For the City of Dublin there will be 2,575, and for all the public bodies throughout the State there will only be 4,842 houses.  These are the figures I have taken from the statement made by the Minister in the House yesterday.  The Minister knows perfectly well, and other Deputies representing constituencies outside the City of Dublin know perfectly well, that the cause of the failure on the part of local authorities to make provision for the needs of the people in regard to housing is due to the fact that they are not prepared to build houses under the present loan conditions, that is, confining themselves to ten or fifteen years.  The Minister has, in his Department, from my constituency and I know from other constituencies, demands from several local authorities and information to prove quite clearly and conclusively to him that these local authorities are determined to proceed if they will only get reasonable financial facilities to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known also, and Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies know this too, that speeches were made from platforms in the June and September elections of 1927, indicating, and by the President more than anyone else, that the Local Loans Fund would be made available if the <Col N="1708" /> Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies were returned to enable local authorities to get the long-term loans that they were in the habit of getting when the British Government was in control here.  We have the Minister for Local Government reported in the newspapers&mdash;I have no other evidence but the paper report of his speech&mdash;as saying: &ldquo;There had been considerable demand that the local Boards should be given loans from the Local Loans Fund at nominal terms where shortage of houses existed.&rdquo;  Will he give us some evidence in support of that to show that the demands from the local authorities were, to any great extent, for the provision of money at nominal terms.</P>

      <P>The reason I ask is because I did not understand it myself and I wanted to find out from the Minister, if he made that statement, what it meant.  Anyway he says now that it was not proposed to open the Local Loan Fund to give assistance to local bodies in the way asked for, in spite of the fact that we had these plausible promises made from June <Col N="1709" /> to September all over the country and also made by Deputy Rice in the famous by-election held in the North City area and by those in the recent by-election.  Probably we will have to wait until the next by-election or general election to have a repetition of promises already broken.  I know, speaking from the knowledge I have of my own area, and other Deputies representing that area if they are in the House&mdash;if not, they should come into the House&mdash; can confirm or contradict me, but if they contradict me I will be glad if they will produce evidence in support of it, that local authorities throughout the counties of Leix and Offaly, particularly boards of health, are anxious to proceed but are unwilling to do it unless money is made available over a reasonable period; certainly 35 or 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good, Deputy Rice, the President and the Minister also have been more or less insinuating that the cause of the failure of the Government to allocate money which they say is available, but which they will not give, is due to the fact that building costs must come down to a reasonable percentage over pre-war building costs in order to enable them to allocate the millions they say they have locked up somewhere but will not give to anybody.  Insinuations are also made that they consider the operatives are responsible for the failure to bring down the cost of building.  I am willing to invite the Minister or the President, if they hold that opinion, to publish the correspondence which has taken place by and on behalf of the building operatives with Mr. Rice, who was chairman of what is called the Unemployment Committee, and let the correspondence on the part of the workers associated with that conference, and also on the part of the master builders, be published and let the public judge.  If the conference is supposed to have failed, I want to know who is the cause of the failure. The local authorities were looking for the money to enable them to carry out building schemes which were urgently needed.  I am personally <Col N="1710" /> anxious that the correspondence should be published and let the public judge.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rice when speaking of the proposals put forward by the building trade operatives referred to them as the nationalisation of housing.  I want to know what is the difference between the proposal put forward on behalf of the building trade operatives and which was put before <Col N="1712" /> the conference of which Deputy Vincent Rice was chairman and the present policy of the Dublin City Commissioners.  There is no difference. You may transfer the financial liability from what is supposed to be the municipality to the State. I do not see any difference between nationalisation and municipalisation, and Deputy Rice, I am sure, knows that perfectly well.  At any rate, if the Government is convinced that nothing is ever likely to come from the conference held as a result of the recommendations of the Unemployment Committee, then the Government is responsible and we should know from them, as the responsible Government of the country, whether they are prepared to leave things as they are until some conference of some other kind comes to some agreement.  The Government have responsibility, apart altogether from the proposals of either the master builders or the building trade operatives. Very often we are told at election times what their policy is, but it is very hard to force them to put that policy into operation when the elections are over.  Elections have been fought and won on false promises.</P>

      <P>It is pretty evident from the speeches that have been made that Deputies on this side and the Government Party approach this question from two very different points of view.  It would appear from the statements coming from the other side that they regard this question as an ordinary industrial question.  To us it is quite a different matter.  We regard it as being in the same plane&mdash;as already indicated by some members here&mdash; as education, old age pensions, or any other social service, and when we were dealing with these social services we were convinced that they were necessary for the general good.  We have to make up our minds that we cannot get a definite money return that we can calculate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the question of education.  We are all satisfied that it is necessary for the community to arrange for that social service, and we do not ask whether or not it is an economic proposition, in the ordinary understanding of it as an economic proposition.  We say it has to be done, and what we are anxious about is the return that we should get for the money spent upon it.  It seems to me that that is the line on which we should approach this whole question of housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister who introduced this Bill was, I think, at one time the proposer of a certain declaration which said that it was the duty of the Republic to take measures to safeguard the health of the people and ensure the physical as well as the moral well-being of the nation.  If he meant what he said on that occasion, I think he ought to be on our side and approach this question from our point of view.  We approach it as a question with which it is necessary to deal if we are going to safeguard the health and ensure the physical and moral well-being of the people.  The need for attacking that problem has been pointed out by a number of speakers who gave us figures.  It may be no harm to remind the Dáil of the figures that appeared in the last Census.  In Dublin we have 78,934 persons living in single rooms.  If that is so, what is the use of a large part of the education which we are giving them? Think of the money that is being spent on education, and realise that it is very little use to have educational systems in the schools if the effects of education are going to be undone owing to the conditions under which children are living at home. Thus anybody who believes in the social services, in maintaining infirmaries, in dealing with education and with any of the public health services, must be on our side when we say that this question ought to be approached as a social service and not from the point of view in which it has been approached, namely, as if it were a simple industrial matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental question seems to me to be, what proportion of his <Col N="1715" /> wages is a workman able to pay in rent?  I have not been able to get at the moment the figure used in calculating the cost of living, for example, but I think about one-sixth would not be far out.  If the rent payable by the worker is much more than about one-sixth it becomes a burden which is too heavy for him.  Therefore the State, or the community, has to step in and deal with the remainder. It has been pointed out that if we are to bring down the costs to give a rent approaching that figure, and to have the amount to be bridged as small as possible, there are two things that must be done.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must provide loans for a long period so that the cost of the sinking fund to replace them will not be too heavy.  Secondly, the cost of building must be reduced. Deputy Lemass, I think, quoted from an article that appeared in &ldquo;The Irishman&rdquo; of December 8th, indicating the lines upon which a proper national organisation to secure a reduction in the cost of building could be brought about.  There is the question, of course, of the possibility of buying in large quantities, standardisation, and so on.  I need not repeat them.  As I have mentioned this particular article, I should say that I think it was a great pity that the Government did not take advantage of the proposals put forward by the building trades unions to deal with this whole question.  I think it is on some such lines as those that it will have to be dealt with.  I see no other way in which you are going to reduce the cost of building and make the gap that has to be bridged between the rent which a workman can pay and that which would be called an economic rent as small as possible except the way that has been indicated.  It is necessary to tackle the problem as a national enterprise. Whether you can use the local authorities or make use of the present contractors is a matter of detail, but there should be one authority responsible for carrying out the work and defining a definite programme for a definite time.  We have <Col N="1716" /> heard it stated that there are something, like 30,000 or 40,000 houses required.  Suppose we made up our minds to have an expanding scheme over a number of years, averaging 5,000 houses per year, we could not at first reach that figure.  I have not the figures at my disposal.  It is possible that we could not within the first year or two organise ourselves to build that number, but I believe we could at a later period make up the shortage in average that would occur at the beginning.  That is our point of view definitely on the question of the reduction in costs.</P>
    <P>Now as to the question of the provision of money.  I notice that the proposal in the Bill, as in previous Bills of the same kind, is to give definite money grants in lump sums. That has proved in practice not to be sufficiently attractive to local bodies and I think the reason for it has been pointed out here, namely, that local bodies cannot get loans for sufficiently long periods and, therefore, the amount of the sinking fund in proportion to the amount of interest is very high.  Take, for instance, the grant of £60.  You are going to give the local authorities in this Bill a grant of £60.  £60 at 5 per cent. would produce a perpetual annuity of £3.  60 years is a sufficiently long period to leave out the question of the present value of £60. Let us take it at £3.  What you are giving is something about £3 at five per cent.  If the Government undertakes the responsibility for borrowing itself and if it borrows money at 5 per cent., lends it as required to the local bodies, and if it made up its mind to have a sinking fund over a period of, say, 40 years&mdash;that is regarded roughly as the life of the average type of house that might be built though it might run to 60&mdash;I calculate that the sinking fund that would be necessary to pay off a £300 house would be slightly less than £2 10s. 0d.  It we adopt that as a way of financing housing for local bodies it would be less expensive to the State and would, I think, be accepted far more readily by local bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> The question is, can the Government borrow money for that purpose? I see no reason why it cannot. I believe that the Government can issue stock, issue a loan, for housing purposes, and get it at about 5 per cent.  The advantage of borrowing would be that if the rates change you could take powers in issuing the loan for redemption at par after a certain period, say, ten years.  If the rate materially altered that would give the Government an opportunity of taking up the bonds issued for that stock.  It seems to me that the two difficulties in cutting down as much as possible the amount to be met by the State &mdash;on the one hand, the reduction in building costs, and on the other, the question of the provision of money&mdash; can be met by the two ways which have been definitely stated.  From the statements made by the representatives of the Government and of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, I certainly thought that they had in mind some such scheme.  It has been pretty well worked out for them already.  The bodies who have been interested in that have been working at it for a number of years.  The Labour Party and others have indicated the lines upon which this question should be tackled&mdash;that is, if there is any real seriousness on the part of the Government to end the present intolerable position.  As I have said, the two difficulties are, first, a reduction in the building costs and getting a national authority which will take charge, and secondly, that the money should be found by national borrowing.  The Government apparently has made up its mind to wait and sit on the fence until it has forced, on the one hand, labour to work at lower terms, or, on the other hand, forced the master builders to come to some agreement with them.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Government ought not to sit on the fence.  Neither ought they to say that money is too dear at the present moment.  It may be at this particular instant, but it seems to me that we have no guarantee that we are going to get lower terms very soon, and are people to still continue&mdash; 78,000 of them, roughly one-fourth of the population of Dublin&mdash;living in single rooms?  It seems to me that simply waiting for something to turn up is not the attitude the Government ought to adopt in respect of this particular problem.  Another matter is the size of the houses.  I was listening to Deputy Good talking about beauty, or something of that kind, in respect of houses.  I think it was a most inappropriate remark in regard to the question whether a house should be three-roomed or four-roomed.  That is a matter of ordinary necessity.  If the State is going to build houses, it ought to build them so that families can live in them in decent comfort.  It is obvious that a mixed family of fairly grown children cannot comfortably exist in less than four rooms.  You want to have at least three bedrooms and a sitting-room or kitchen.  With a grown family you cannot do with less.  I suppose it would be easy enough to find a number of families who could be accommodated in a three-roomed house&mdash;we will say some older people, whose children have gone away and with, perhaps, only one of the older children living with them.  You will also probably get a young married couple who for some years can live in a three-roomed house, so that there is a definite proportion of the people who may not require more than a three-roomed house, but we should be careful not to exceed that proportion.  A four-roomed house is the minimum, I think, for the average family, and a National Housing Scheme ought to consist of houses of at least four <Col N="1719" /> rooms, except for a small proportion which would be suitable for certain families.  As has been said, we have got to support this Bill, but I doubt if I ever voted for anything with less satisfaction than I will vote for this, because we had thought that after all the spade work, that had been done on this problem for a number of years, the Government would be prepared to set out on a decent programme and bring it to a finish.</P>

      <P>I rise with great pleasure to support the Bill.  I consider the last sentence that Deputy de Valera used, when he announced his intention of supporting the Bill, very cheering and a very good gesture.  I sincerely hope that he will continue, when the Government are endeavouring to do good work in the Saorstát, that policy.  I heard Deputy Briscoe say a while ago that the Government were not sincere in their work with regard to housing.  Since the present Government took office seven years ago they have expended £2,000,000 on housing, and they were instrumental in erecting 21,000 houses. The sum of £200,000 which they are going to make available by this Bill will come to the assistance of the poorest of the poor.  I felt it my duty some months ago to bring down an inspector of the Local Government Board to Myross Bridge in my constituency, and his report is at present in Dublin.  He stated that the houses in which the poor fishermen there lived were unfit for human habitation and that they were unfit to house pigs in them.  That condition cannot remain as it is, and as a member of the West Cork Board of Health it will be my duty to promote a scheme that will come to the rescue of those poor people&mdash;those honest, hard-working, industrious fishermen who, when we are all in our beds, are out on the deep trying to bring home a little fish to the people.  At the West Cork Board of Health I will also have promoted the building of nineteen labourers' cottages that were granted to the labourers nineteen <Col N="1720" /> years ago in that district.  They held their little plots, but there were no houses built up to the present. This £200,000 may look a very small sum to Deputy O'Kelly, who spoke about £12,000,000.  Where can he find £12,000,000?  If he can find that amount he will be supported unanimously by every section of the Dáil. When he said that, I took it as a mere platitude and I knew there was not sincerity in it, because, according to the President, Deputy O'Kelly had a great opportunity to build cheap houses in Dublin some years ago and they were not built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is up to the city of Dublin, and the present Commissioners are doing their utmost, to remove the difficulties.  They built more houses in Dublin for the last five years than were built for 37 years previously. Who can say that the Government or the Commissioners are neglecting their duty?  One thing with which I thoroughly agree is that this housing question should be treated as a national question and be supported by every shade of opinion. We ought all put our heads together as to the best manner in which we can house every single family in the Twenty-Six Counties who are now badly housed.  The Government all along the line since I came here have endeavoured, within their limited resources, to come to the rescue of those who were without houses.  I am certain that if Deputy de Valera and his Party are sincere, and if they are anxious to help in this housing question, they will drop other portions of their programme and will show the people that, as far as they are concerned, their one great anxiety for the future will be to house properly the Irish race at home.  They talk about emigration and hunting people out of the country. What is hunting people out of the country is the fact that we are disunited, that some of us want to upset the State, and pull up the foundations of the State and the Treaty.  It is propaganda of that kind which has made people with money keep a fast hold of it in their pockets.  If Deputy de Valera now <Col N="1721" /> proclaims to-day in the Dáil that he is prepared for the next five years to devote himself to this question, the pressing question of housing in towns, we will all be in agreement with him.  Let him, in the name of God, devote himself to that and co-operate with General Mulcahy.  If they come together in the matter this question will be settled in a few short years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. J. Broderick Mr. J. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that in the remaining stages of this Bill and in Committee especially, the Minister will give more consideration to the question of rural housing.  The Bill, as it stands, and as Deputy Anthony stated last night, is mostly confined to three-roomed houses. In the constituency from which I come we built, under the last two Acts, between 600 and 700 houses. At least, 75 per cent. of these were five-roomed houses.  Now five-roomed houses meet the needs of the ordinary farmer.  I am speaking in this matter not for the local bodies, but for the farmer who builds a five-roomed house and builds the house on a new site.  The advantage of building it on a new site is that the house is taken completely away from the insanitary site on which he lived for years. Now I fear what will happen under this Bill is that with the grant of £45, he will build the three-roomed house adjacent to the existing building. The result will be that his housing accommodation will still be left in an insanitary condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving the figures yesterday, the Minister said that there was a reduction in the building cost.  Well, I think he can see one instance in my own constituency, in Tuam, in which the building costs for 1927 and 1928 have been reduced in or about 10½d. per foot.  That is, on a scheme of houses the cost can be reduced, because when one is building a number of houses together, one can get the materials certainly much cheaper than the ordinary individual can who is building a house for himself in the country.  For that reason, I do not think it is fair to apply the same rule to the individual <Col N="1722" /> builder who is building one house for his own accommodation, as might be applied to a local authority. I welcome the statements made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  One of the statements which we most welcomed was that the £75 grant would be available to persons starting building operations before the 1st April.  That is most welcome, because a number of people who were on the point of starting building operations had their prospects of getting the grant cancelled, but now they will be able to qualify for these grants.  The next point in the Minister's statement that I welcome is that the remission of rates is to be mandatory on the local authorities. That is a very necessary provision. Under the last few Housing Acts, great trouble arose where the local authorities refused to give a remission of rates.  These bodies apparently were not inclined to give any consideration to the increased valuation of their area consequent on the increased building that had been carried through.  As regards the reconstruction section, I might say that I have never been in favour of its application to rural areas, and for the reason that I found in several places, as the Minister admitted yesterday, that very little in that direction was ever done.</P>

I know that we can get a better class of house if we continue building the four and five-roomed houses in preference to the three-roomed houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say that as far as this Bill is concerned, for a certain section of the people, it <Col N="1723" /> caters all right but it will not be of much benefit to us in the urban districts inasmuch as it gives no facilities to the local authorities for carrying out schemes of housing. Local authorities are prepared to shoulder their own burden in the way of building houses for ordinary working men if they get long term loans at a lower rate of interest.  If that can be done it is the one and only way that will give local authorities any chance of carrying out building schemes in the urban districts. In the different towns and urban districts in East Cork, the local bodies have purchased sites for the building of houses.  In some of these towns, only a few houses have been built on these sites.  A good deal of the sites have not been built on.  The authorities would be fully satisfied to complete these schemes if there was a possibility of borrowing money on long term loans either from the banks or from the Government. We approached the banks on different occasions.  We could borrow the money for a term of fifteen years at, I think, 6¼ per cent. or at any rate ½ per cent. underneath the usual rate of interest.  We found, in calculating the rent to be charged per week for the houses, that the ordinary labourer would have to pay a rent that he could not possibly afford to pay.  The houses built at present in the urban districts cannot be let at a rent under 10/- a week.  Now as far as the urban districts are concerned, the wages paid there would not permit of a man paying a rent of 10/- a week for a house.  The Government I know have to cater for the rural worker.  The rural worker is as entitled to a habitable house as is the urban worker. In cities, the question is a different one altogether because the cities are over-populated.  That is because from time to time, the country people flock into the cities for employment and that of course naturally brings about a scarcity of houses.  That scarcity is more in the cities than in the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Midleton, the town I come from, we have a very fine site on which a <Col N="1724" /> number of cottages can be built. Already the sewerage scheme and the waterworks have been seen to, and everything is complete, with the exception of raising the money for building.  I would appeal to the Minister to give us a chance of borrowing this money through the medium of long term loans.  If that is done, there would be no necessity for giving a grant.  We, in Midleton, are fully prepared to shoulder the burden of building houses ourselves if we can borrow the money on a long-term loan.  I would go further and say that at no time were those houses that were built for the class of workers for which they were originally intended let at a profit.  We have had four or five schemes of houses and we have never made a profit, because the rents charged really only met the cost of repairs of the cottages.  The rent we get is more or less line-ball with the cost of repairs.  Of course later on in the years to come those houses will be an asset to the ratepayers of the district.  Some time ago the Minister promised that he would fund the Labourers Acts of 1906 and 1908 for the building of rural dwellings.  I am sure that the time will come when he will do it.  I believe that.  I do say this with all earnestness, that at the rate at which money can be at present borrowed on short-term loans, the building of houses on borrowed money is not a sound financial proposition.  I say that as a business man.  Who will be mulcted in the repayment of this money?  If you build houses at present for workers who will have to pay to finance the building of those houses?  It will be those occupying the houses.  You cannot let those houses at less than 10/- a week, and at present there is no labourer paid a sufficient wage to allow him to pay 10/- per week rent for a house.  I am speaking of rural Ireland.  The rural workers will have to be taken into consideration as well as the urban workers.  Anyone who is connected with the Boards of Health knows that when a cottage is vacant in a rural district there are at least fourteen or fifteen applicants. <Col N="1725" /> I know people myself who would never emigrate if they were given an opportunity of settling down in the country and getting married.  I am speaking with all earnestness.  I know people who have gone to England after having got married, and they went there purely and solely because they had no house in which to live here.</P>
    <P>I met a man in Dublin City the other night caricaturing on the street, and he told me that every night he would make about three shillings.  I asked him where he was living, and he said he lived in a room with his wife and two children and he was paying ten shillings a week for it.  We will have to get away from that state of things in this country.  We will have to get a better way of housing the workers.  We will have to make adequate provision, even at the expense of the country, because, after all, every man you keep in the country is an asset. A scheme must be formulated under which local authorities can get money on long-term loans at a low rate of interest.</P>

      <P>Nil mórán agam le rá ar an mBille seo tar éis a bhfuil ráite agam cheana.  Ach tá cúpla poinnt agam le chur ós cómhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>This Housing Bill reminds me very much of a theme that was expressed in a song which we used to have in one of his Majesty's hotels in this country, the hospitality of which I enjoyed under the Government of Saorstát Eireann a few years ago. It was a very nice song, and it seemed to express the sentiments embodied in this Bill.  There was one verse with which Deputies at least on this side of the House are familiar, and the end of it ran something as follows:</P>
      <P>Work and pray, live on hay,</P>
      <P>You'll get pie in the sky when you die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be the considered opinion of the Government that if the people who are looking for facilities to build houses pray enough and wait long enough, some day in the <Col N="1726" /> Utopian state which the Minister expects will come about some time before the end of the world, they will be able to secure a decent house. But before then nobody knows what may happen, because the chief conditions that bring about unrest, turmoil, discontent and eventually social revolution are the conditions created by bad housing.  Those conditions exist to a great extent in this country to-day, and no attempt is being made under this Bill to remedy them, especially in the rural areas. This is merely tinkering at the problem.</P>
    <P>The suggestion put forward by Deputy O'Kelly with regard to a national board or housing authority seems to have been treated more or less with ridicule from the Government Benches.  In my opinion there is no other way in which the question can be adequately tackled so as to bring it to a successful conclusion by providing the number of houses the people need.  When we are confronted with a Bill of this nature, which postpones, or at least delays, the final Governmental proposals with regard to housing, and when we are told that this Bill is a sensible, honest attempt to solve the problem, we can only conclude that the Government are lacking in ability or courage to tackle the problem which has been before them since the inception of the State.</P>
    <P>One point strikes me forcibly, and that is in connection with a question I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health two weeks ago with regard to recommendation 55 of the Gaeltacht Commission Report.  I hoped that some proposals with regard to that recommendation would be embodied in this Bill.  Probably the Minister will give us an assurance when he is winding up the debate that a separate Bill will be introduced to deal with housing in the congested districts and the Gaeltacht areas.  If he does not, there is no doubt the statement made by Deputy Sheehy is absolutely not founded on fact. That statement is that the fishermen and people in the rural areas in his <Col N="1727" /> constituency would be in a position to build houses under this Bill.  They will not be in that position.  I am sure the same applies to other coastal areas in the Free State.  Anybody who knows those areas will realise that under this Bill, far from being able to provide houses, the fishermen will be faced with even a more hopeless position than before.  The Government grant is only £45.</P>

      <P>The people will not be able to build houses with such a small grant as that coming from the Government, and the desirable situation that Deputy Sheehy visualises will not come about under this Bill. I am sorry no provision has been made for housing in the Gaeltacht. Bad housing is the chief difficulty there, and unless the Minister can assure us that he intends to embody proposals for the implementation of recommendation 55 of the Gaeltacht Commission Report in a separate Bill, I am afraid every hard thing said about the Bill by Deputy Tubridy, and the doubts expressed by Deputy Mongan, are certainly founded on fact and are well deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made to the absence from the Bill of a reconstruction clause.  In Section 1 the wording is: &ldquo;erection does not include reconstruction and the words erecting and other cognate words shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo; We had hopes that some provision would be made for reconstruction. Anybody associated with a local authority, especially in Co. Cork&mdash; whether it would seem they are more anxious to improve their living conditions than the people in any other part of the country, I do not know&mdash;and Deputy Carey will be able to bear me out in this&mdash;is aware that during the last couple of years the Cork County Council were faced with hundreds of applications for reconstruction grants.  They were compelled to turn them down because there was no provision made <Col N="1728" /> for them.  We hoped some provision would be made, but unfortunately there is none, and the people who need such grants have as large a grievance as before.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated local authorities were not prepared to give the full co-operation in the building of houses which is desirable.  As far as bodies with which I am connected are concerned, that statement would not stand the light when examined. Kinsale Urban Council, for instance, found themselves faced with very grave housing difficulties.  Something like 85 to 90 houses were condemned by the Medical Officer of Health as unsuitable for human habitation. Adjacent to the town is a splendid military barracks, the site of which would be given by the Department of Defence if a housing scheme were embarked upon.  The members of the Council hoped that under the Government's housing proposals some endeavour would be made to extend the credit facilities given to local councils.  We now find that the Minister does not propose to extend the Local Loans Fund, and local authorities must rely on the present short-term credits, which are absolutely useless.  Nothing less than loans extending over 45 to 50 years would be any good under the present conditions in order to enable local authorities to embark upon a housing scheme.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, those of us connected with local authorities, who would be quite prepared and would wholeheartedly endeavour to embark upon any sort of decent housing scheme if credit facilities were given, are very disappointed that the Bill does not contain something of that nature.  The Minister for Local Government said yesterday that local authorities were more inclined to pay higher wages for work under the grants than for work under the rates.  The actual fact is that the condition under which Government grants were given laid it down that the maximum wage to be paid for road work was 29/- per week, while from the rates we are <Col N="1729" /> able to pay something like 35/-, so that the statement of the Minister is not founded upon fact as far as Cork county is concerned.  I have nothing further to say with regard to the Bill, except to express disappointment that it does not embody the proposals which we had hoped it would embody, especially with regard to the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  I trust that the Minister will give some indication of the Government policy with regard to these areas.</P>

      <P>I have been requested by several small farmers in Cork to ask that a reconstruction clause should be inserted in this Bill.  These small farmers were neglected in the good old days when labourers cottages were being built.  Those of us who took an interest in the labourers at that time promoted schemes of cottages in our area, but there was no law passed then to improve the dwellings of the unfortunate small farmers, who are now reduced to a lower level even than the labourers. Some days ago, five or six of these small farmers from different districts asked me to stress that point, and for that reason I asked the Minister, and I know I am knocking at an open door, to take note of what I have said.  He knows that I always state the truth.  There is another point.  Houses for labourers are becoming scarcer every day, because many farmers, in order to avoid paying rates on workingmen's houses on their farms, have taken the roofs off these houses.</P>

      <P>I am appealing for everyone of them&mdash;I have no choice any more than you have when you go down to Wicklow.  All I want is fair play all round.  In my district, everywhere I go I can see the skeletons of these houses which were once inhabited by workmen.  For that reason, I should like the Minister to give the power to the boards of health that rural councils enjoyed before 1914.  If that were done there would be plenty of cottages <Col N="1730" /> built under the supervision of the Minister's Department.  No house could be built until a sworn enquiry had been held; and, if these houses were built, it would remedy a want that exists not alone in my county, but all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the statement of the Minister in reference to the attitude of public bodies and the reasons he gave for not extending long-term loans to these bodies.  If I might interpret his statement, it meant that if long-term loans were given to public bodies, these bodies would take such advantage of the loans that the housing problem might soon be solved, but he feared that if the public bodies took advantage of the loans to that extent the contractors would charge exorbitant prices for the houses.  That is not so.  He stated that the public bodies would, in consequence, be saddled with a pile of debt, and the houses would be dearer.  His point was that the public bodies would avail of the loans to such an extent to enable them to solve the problem that the contractors would take advantage of the fact that such a large number of houses were being built to look for more profit than they are getting at present.  The Minister alone has the power to sanction loans.  No public body can obtain a loan without the sanction and approval of the Minister. No contract for a house can be given without the sanction of the engineers in the housing department. Public bodies are only too anxious to proceed with the building of houses if long-term loans are given to them. I disagree with Deputy Carey when he states that public bodies do not require a free grant.  They will require it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the cottages would cost ten shillings a week.  Co. Wicklow, up to a couple of years ago, took advantage of all the grants available from the Government for building houses.  The Minister has now ordered that a <Col N="1731" /> whole-time medical officer be appointed in the county.  I have supported that appointment.  This medical officer is to look after the health of the people.  No matter what the medical branch of the Local Government Department may say, tuberculosis committees know that that disease is on the increase.  Provision is being made for the treatment of tubercular patients by whole-time medical officers, but after these people are treated in hospitals or homes they are sent back to live in hovels and houses which have been condemned by the public health officials.  In that way the money is wasted.  Thousands of pounds are spent in trying to cure these persons of the disease, and after they are treated they are sent back to these hovels to spread the disease.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that a grant should be given for the clearing of sites and in order to enable public bodies to provide sewerage, so that houses may be erected.  The Minister stated that public bodies do not co-operate in this matter and that they have refused to strike rates. As far as I know, the public bodies, where there is a majority of labour representatives on them, look upon the building of houses for the urban workers as a business proposition. They are not prepared to strike a rate and borrow money for a period of ten years only to build houses, when the people for whom they are intended cannot afford to live in them owing to the policy of the Government in fixing wages at 30/- per week, as they did in connection with the Shannon scheme.  The rates have to be considered.  The Government know that the rates are too high and that the people are unable to pay them.  The proof of that is that the Minister for Finance has said he is considering the question of de-rating or giving some consideration to the farmers, who seem never to be satisfied, and who are putting pressure on the Government in order to get relief through de-rating.</P>

      <P>On the question of reconstruction I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the case of people in the urban areas who submitted plans in February and who had been notified that grants were not available, although the Act was extended to the 1st April.  They complied with the Act and put in their claim before the prescribed day only to be notified that there would be no grant available.  Under this Bill the Minister should give some facilities to those people who attempted to comply with the Act.  The President stated money is too dear; that you cannot ask banks to-day to do this and that.  Then he asks public bodies are they prepared to make sacriflces as other people are prepared to make sacrifices.  I want to know will the banks be asked to contribute their share, or are they going to get their pound of flesh without doing anything in return.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a man who was going to build a four-roomed house on the bungalow style.  The facts and figures were submitted to the Housing Department, but he could not agree with <Col N="1733" /> the contractor, luckily for himself, and he built a four-roomed house on bungalow principle for £300.  The contractor's price for the house was double that.  He built his house with direct labour, paid the trade union rate of wages, and as a result has the house for half the contractor's price.  So much for the generosity and support of the master builders, who are coming in to try and solve this problem.  Public bodies are anxious, not only in urban areas, but Boards of Health are also anxious to build houses for the working classes.  The Board of Health is a subsidiary body to the County Council, and a rate must be struck by the County Council to enable the building of houses for agricultural labourers.  If the Minister would extend the long-term loans even in the area where houses have been taken away by coast erosion and where a number of houses have been destroyed, we could put into operation a scheme started in 1914 by the British Government for the housing of the working classes in Greystones and Rathdown area. We have been unable, owing to the high rate in Wicklow and the high rent we would have to charge, to build these cottages.  But with a free grant and a long-term loan we would be able to solve the problem as far as the Co. Wicklow is concerned. I make a special appeal to the Minister to continue the reconstruction clause in connection with those people, at least, who made application previous to the expiration of the Act.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate with much interest. It is indeed a pleasure to realise that every party in the House has approached this question of housing in a fairly good spirit.  It requires the co-operation not only of Deputies in this House, but of the taxpayers and ratepayers if the question is to be solved.  I cannot agree with some of the proposals I heard coming from the Fianna Fáil side of the House as to a Housing Board or that a Housing Board is the best means of solving the problem.  As a practical <Col N="1734" /> builder, I do not think that it is so at all.  A little while ago in the Dublin Corporation the idea got abroad that builders and contractors were making huge profits, and that it would be much better to set up a Building Department in the Corporation. Therefore it was decided to set up what was known as the Stanley Street workshop.  We know that that cost the ratepayers a great deal and that in the end it was a failure and had to be abolished.  I do not think a Housing Board is the best means of solving this problem.</P>

      <P>It is not all a matter of building of houses I am speaking of, but on the principle of the Housing Board&mdash;the principle of getting somebody else other than the builders to do the work by direct labour.  I may be wrong, but it is my candid opinion that that is not the right way to approach it.  Great play is made of the fact that Deputy Rice did not make a great success of the Committee of which he was Chairman. We must be very lenient to Deputy Rice, because he had an almost impossible job of settling a dispute between labourers and employers.</P>

The cost of building is very high at <Col N="1735" /> the moment, and the reason is simply that wages are three times what they were pre-war&mdash;that is, every person employed in the building of a house, whether plasterer, bricklayer, carpenter or hod-carrier, gets exactly three times what he was getting pre-war.</P>

      <P>I am out for anything in reason.  I am out for co-operation. There is no other way in which you are going to solve this problem except by friendly co-operation. <Col N="1736" /> There is no need for labourers looking on their employers as their enemy.  They are not.  But whatever spirit has got abroad for the past ten years or thereabouts, the feeling has permeated through the mind of the worker that the employer is his oppressor.  He looks on his employer as a capitalist, someone who is out to crush him.  That was not the spirit in the old days, and things will not be any better, and if we get back to the old feeling between the worker and his employers we will be nearer to solving our troubles.</P>
      <P>How we are going to reduce the cost of building is the serious problem which is before us.  Sometimes when I think it over very seriously it almost looks hopeless, and I do not see how it is going to be done. Lately we find Civil Servants and people of that kind asked to accept a reduction in their salaries because the cost of living has come down.  We know wages went up, rents went up, the cost of living, prices of food, etc., all went up.  Wages were increased to meet that situation.  When the cost of living is coming down and Civil Servants are asked to make a reduction, would it not be reasonable that tradesmen and workers in general should face the same thing? It is a very unpopular thing to say, and that is our great trouble, reduce wages.  The President said yesterday that it is up to labour and contractors between themselves to come together and hammer out a job because money is dear, and there is no possible chance of solving the housing problem unless we approach it in a sensible way and a good spirit. Deputy O'Kelly remarked yesterday that owing to the great shortage of houses in Dublin we would require 1,000 houses per year to meet that demand.  I would like to tell him that if a big housing scheme like that was contemplated and started and set going, you would not have tradesmen.  There is a shortage to-day of plasterers, and you cannot get them.  The different contractors are coaxing them from one another by offering them a higher rate of wages than the Trade Union rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it means that as a result some few thousand houses will be built in the Saorstát, but I hope and trust that in the near future the Government will think fit to introduce their comprehensive building scheme.  I have listened very patiently to all the arguments for and against the Bill, and also to some of the reasons that have been advanced as to why house-building is not being carried on in the same manner as it had been carried on in pre-war days.  There seems to be a good deal of fencing about the matter, playing for position, so to speak.  To my mind, some of the principal reasons for the high cost of building are that in the erection of houses here in the Free State almost 80 per cent. of the materials used have got to be imported.  That means so much is added to the cost of these materials owing to the cost of freight rates from England to the <Col N="1738" /> Free State on every article almost that is used in the erection of houses.</P>
      <P>I often wondered why the Government has not taken the question of the establishment of a few brick yards on a national scale here into consideration, so as to provide this most necessary commodity for the erection of houses.  I referred to this in the last Bill.  Bricks have to be imported either from Northern Ireland or England, thereby adding to their cost.  If the Government would undertake to set apart a certain sum of money for the establishment of a brick-yard to manufacture bricks it would be the means of supplying one of the most essential materials used in the construction of houses.  Another reason advanced as to the high cost of building is wages.  That has been advanced also in this House.  As to the truth or otherwise of that assertion I am not going very deeply into the matter, but this thing I say, it is not a question of wages so much as output.  I happen to be one who knows a little about the business and I think a good man is not too dear at any price.  If the workmen of this country are trusted a little more I believe they will give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.  At the same time, one cannot close his eyes to the fact that there has been a tendency in this country more or less to shirk a fair day's work.  That has been the result of the great war when money could be got for nothing, so to speak, but those times are past and the time is at hand in this poor little country of ours when it is absolutely necessary that the workers should give of their best and in return the employers must give a fair remuneration to the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by the President that the reason why the Government are not going on with a comprehensive building scheme is that if they were to place at the disposal of the public authorities of this country a sum of from ten to fifteen million pounds it would be the means of keeping wages up for a considerable period.  I do not know that he is right in that, and I do not <Col N="1739" /> think it is fair that Deputy O'Connor should confine his remarks to the wages paid to the workers in the city of Dublin.  I am not concerned about Dublin so much because I know that the rest of the Free State can live without Dublin, whereas Dublin cannot live without the rest of the Free State.  It is not fair to put forward an argument here that because brick-layers are paid 1/10½ an hour in Dublin this comprehensive building scheme should be postponed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the building scheme should be postponed because of high wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to say that there is a sort of suspicion in the mind of the President that if this comprehensive scheme were introduced it would be the means, more or less, of standardising wages for the next five years.  My argument is that Dublin should not rule the rest of the Free State.  The scale of wages paid to the workers in the building trades in the provinces is from 1/6 to 1/8.  In fairly big towns like Dundalk, Drogheda, Limerick and Waterford the average wage is about 1/8 an hour.  The average wage paid to unskilled men engaged in the erection of houses would be about £2 a week.  Their wages have been reduced during the past few years from 52/- to £2, so that I do not think it is fair to quote Dublin alone. Wages have been reduced considerably in every county in the Free State.  Perhaps they have not been reduced in the city of Dublin.  To my own knowledge, they were as high as 2/6 an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the business, I think, of the Master Builders and their workmen.  The only reason I refer to the matter is because I think it has been responsible for keeping <Col N="1740" /> back this housing scheme.  On the other hand, it has been argued here that the builders are making excessive profits out of the houses.  I do not agree with that.  I would like to be fair to all parties.  My experience is that any money that the present builders have was made previous to the war, and perhaps during the war.  I think any builder will tell you that he finds it very hard to make ends meet.  In the past six or seven years a lot of small builders have started, and the fact that nine out of every ten of them have disappeared shows that builders are not making exorbitant profits, because, owing to the fact that business in the building trade is so scarce there is very keen competition amongst the builders, and, I think, all things taken into consideration, it must be agreed that the builders are not making the huge profits they are supposed to be making, and they are not responsible, as some people believe they are, to some extent, for the high cost of building in this country.  I believe, with Deputy O'Connor, that this matter will require the co-operation of all parties concerned.  It will require, above all, a less tendency on the part of the people not to observe the agreements they make.  You cannot consider this question of house building without considering other things.  At present we have different sections of the people more or less clearing the pitch for a battle in the future as regards the rents of houses.  These are the landlords and the tenants.  I believe, if these people were only honest and fair to one another, there would be no necessity for the wrangling and recrimination that exists at the moment.  If landlords were fair to the tenants, and if, on the other hand, tenants were fair to the landlord, I think it would do much to give a fillip to house building in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another element that has not been referred to in this discussion as being in some way responsible for the scarcity of houses.  That is the private investor, the man who, say, has four or five hundred <Col N="1741" /> pounds and who would like to invest it in the building of a house.  He is outside the question altogether as far as the builders and the builders' operatives are concerned.  He goes to an architect and asks him to prepare a plan and specification.  He tells him he has about £500 to invest in the building of a house, and when the architect produces his plan and specification and advertises for tenders he finds that the cost of the house will be somewhere in the vicinity of £700 or £800.  The man has not got that money, and ultimately the erection of the house is abandoned as far as he is concerned. That is an element that has got to be brought into play again if house building is to make the progress we would all like to see it making.  That can only be done when the cost of house building is reduced.</P>
    <P>The cost, as far as wages are concerned, is a matter that depends also on the cost of living.  All these things must be considered along with what is really the standard of of life that the people in this country can afford to maintain.  In this connection in comparisons between wages here and in England we must not forget the fact that the difference between the cost of living in the Free State and in England is 10 per cent.  That is a very material difference.  To my mind, what is really wanted at the moment is the wholehearted support of the people in general in an endeavour to solve this very pressing problem.  It cannot be solved, in my opinion, by any government unless it has the support of the people.  All parties must help to solve this problem.  I do hope that this Bill will be the forerunner of the big comprehensive Bill we are promised, which I hope will once and for all settle the question of housing in this country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to make some provision in future Bills of this sort in regard to long-term loans.  Nearly every Deputy has referred to that fact.  It is impossible to build houses on loans extending over a period of ten or fifteen years. The British Government give loans <Col N="1742" /> for the erection of urban dwellings and labourers' cottages extending from forty to sixty years.  I cannot see how, if the will is there, our own home Government would not be in a position to give loans extending over a period in the vicinity of twentyfive or thirty years.  That is the only way that urban authorities can afford to let houses at rents which the workers can pay, because the tendency at the moment is that wages will be reduced according as the cost of living is reduced, and the capacity of the people to pay will thereby be reduced.  I know cases in which houses erected by local authorities are set at rents of 10/- or 11/- weekly.  I do not know what will happen in future, but I know that the people will find it very difficult to pay these rents.  They may do so for a year or two, but in five or ten years they will not be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>The only way in which urban authorities can provide houses for workers in towns is, as I have said, by long-term loans.  I hope that the Government will see their way to have that provision inserted in the next housing Bill.  I think that there are also other means of obtaining money.  I think the Minister should be aware of the fact that at the moment there is money lying in certain quarters that could be used for the building of houses and that could be issued on loan to urban authorities over a period of from twenty to thirty years.  I hope that the Minister will take steps to have that money put into circulation and placed at the disposal of the local authorities who need it.  As I have said, the Bill has the general support of all parties.  The general hope is that the Government will in the near future introduce their comprehensive Housing Bill which, it is hoped, will go a long way in settling this important question.</P>

      <P>I should like to re-echo the hope expressed by the last speaker that this Housing Bill would be the forerunner of that great, comprehensive measure which the Government have led us so long <Col N="1743" /> to expect, but I regret to say that I cannot find in the present Bill any justification for that hope.  I listened with great attention to the debate, and I think that the prevailing tone in all the speeches, irrespective of the benches from which they were delivered, was one of disappointment and, so far as some of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies were concerned, one of disillusionment. Everybody in the Free State for the past twelve months, at least, has been looking forward with a great deal of expectancy to the Government's proposals on housing.  They were deliberately led to that belief by the action of the Government themselves.  Only twelve months ago the Government appealed to the electors in North Dublin City and asked them to return a gentleman whose assistance would be of the greatest possible value in the solution of this problem.  The electorate were told that if this gentleman were returned the scheme which matured under his chairmanship of the Unemployment Committee would immediately be put into force, and that as that scheme involved an expenditure of about fifteen million pounds, not only would the problem of housing be solved, but also the problem of unemployment. That gentleman has taken part in the debate here.  He spoke yesterday, but I have not seen him during the course of the debate to-day.  As I say, he was present yesterday and delivered a speech, a speech which I will not say was not helpful.  I think it was helpful, and I think it will do some good in opening the eyes of the people regarding the real policy of the Government on this matter.  I think that the speech of Deputy Rice was the most devastating expose of the Government's policy that has ever been delivered in this House, because Deputy Rice gave the game away.  He explained that the promise to expend £15,000,000 on housing was purely conditional. The Government policy was, he said, conditional on an agreement <Col N="1744" /> being reached between the master builders and the building operatives.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rice explained that the Government policy was conditional on an agreement between the master builders and the operatives.  I would like the House to throw its mind back to the speech delivered by Deputy Rice and to recollect how he endeavoured to secure this agreement which the Government regarded as all important for the proper fruition of its housing policy.  Deputy Rice, as he admitted, chairman and all as he was of the conference called at his behest, withheld from the conference an important document which was handed to him for submission to it.  I think that that exposes once and for all the nigger in the wood pile, because, so far as I could see, though the Deputy declared that the workers' proposal which he held up was one which not in two years <Col N="1745" /> would he bring forward to the conference, he disclosed to the House the grounds on which that document was withheld.  I would like the House to think over what these grounds are.  First, the document stated that not more than 25 per cent. of the workers engaged in building houses were engaged in building houses for the working classes.  On the basis of that statement, the document proceeded to say that it appeared that the master builders, in making certain demands, seemed, under cover of the necessity for building houses for the workers, anxious to worsen the conditions of labour.  I submit, when you analyse that, that there is nothing in either of these statements which should have prevented the document which was handed to Deputy Rice being submitted to the conference.  The statement is there, and I do not think that it could be held that it is one that would have created conditions of antagonism between the master builders and the operatives.  The statement that not more than 25 per cent. of the workers engaged in building houses were engaged in building houses for the working classes is not a statement that would embitter the relations between the builders and the operatives.  It could have only one effect, and, after all, it is an effect that could be easily determined.  In regard to the statement that the master builders in certain conditions were taking advantage of that fact, I am sure they would have proceeded to controvert that, and, if it had been controverted to the satisfaction of the operatives, instead of producing a feeling of antagonism in the conference it would have produced a feeling of understanding between the parties.  Therefore I say that Deputy Rice had no justification on the grounds which he disclosed for withholding the document. I ask the House to go further and say whether, in its judgment, Deputy Rice was sincere in calling this conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he, as representing the Government in this matter, anxious to secure that agreement between the master builders on the one hand and the builders' operatives on the other which would clear the way for this big housing scheme which was going to involve an expenditure of £15,000,000?  In view of his own statement I submit he was not sincere in that, and the one purpose of imposing these conditions was in order to secure that that £15,000,000 would remain intact for housing at another by-election.  In regard to the Bill itself, I think that Deputy Corish put his finger on the weak spot.  This Bill, as he pointed out, by reducing the grant previously given to those people who proposed to undertake the building of houses, whether they are private individuals, speculative builders, public authorities or utility societies, is going to increase the net cost of houses to the builders.  Because it does that, and because the economic price at which an article can be sold is determined by the cost of production, by the cost at which the lowest quantum of that article can be produced, this Bill is inevitably going to increase the rent of houses throughout the country.  Deputy Corish pointed out that this was the weak spot in the Bill, and I agree. I do not think there is any justification for decreasing the grant towards houses.  I think, on the other hand, a case could be made for increasing the grant because one of the big factors in the case of building is the rate of interest which the builder, in the first instance, will have to pay on his money, and the rate of interest which the local authority will have to pay on loans in some places.  That rate of interest has increased very considerably <Col N="1747" /> since last year and, as far as I can see, it is not likely to be decreased for a very long period.  Therefore, so far as the cost of money is concerned, a case could be made for increasing the grant under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another great defect in the Bill is that which was pointed out by Deputy Dr. Tubridy in the first place and which has been emphasised by Deputy Broderick and Deputy Mongan.  They pointed out that the proposals in the Bill relate entirely to conditions in urban areas and that so far as the Government is concerned they give no indication in the measure, whatsoever, that they have any concern for housing conditions in the Gaeltacht.  A suggestion was thrown out by Deputy Briscoe which I think might be applied to those areas.  He suggested that instead of a grant being given in the form of money there might be a grant of material.  I feel that if some provision of that sort were made, a good many people in the Gaeltacht would take advantage of it.  I know there are many people in the Gaeltacht who have nothing much to do and if the materials were made available for them they would proceed to build houses.  I know that of my own knowledge of the conditions there and I have that opinion reinforced by a number of people who live in the Gaeltacht, medical men and others.  They stated that one of the ways in which housing conditions could be improved in the Gaeltacht was that instead of making a grant of money, a grant of material should be made to a man to build his own house.  Most of these people are handy men and many of them can do masonry work. I do not say that such a house would be on the same standard as we are accustomed to get in this city; nevertheless there would be a considerable improvement on the hovels in which these people are living to-day.  As I have said, I have made the case against the Government that they were not sincere when they stated from the hustings in the election for North Dublin City in March, 1928, that they proposed to spend <Col N="1748" /> £15,000,000 on housing provided a certain agreement could be arrived at.  I say again that Deputy Rice, a member of their Party, whom they nominated to the Chairmanship of the Committee on Unemployment, in withholding from the Conference which he called a certain important document, proved that insincerity up to the hilt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has told us that prior to his coming into office he had learned practically everything that was to be known about housing.  I do not profess to know anything about the technicalities of any scheme for the solution of the housing problem, but when Deputy O'Kelly yesterday evening advanced a suggestion which amounted to a proposal that we ought to set up a National Housing Council&mdash;I think that was the suggestion put forward&mdash;the President interjected to say that that was handing over the child.  Evidently the President has learned so much about housing that he has come to the conclusion that the problem is beyond solution, but I think there is no person in this House who is so adept at handing over the child as the President is.  He handed over a child to a body known as the Agricultural Corporation, a child which turned out to be a white elephant, and on this occasion he simply tells us that he has learned so much about housing that he finds the problem is beyond solution, and he demands that the other Deputies in the House should shoulder the responsibility for finding that solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress a point which has been already stressed here with reference to this mythical £15,000,000 which was prophesied by Deputy Rice some twelve months ago as an absolute certainty in the event of his being elected.  The President told us yesterday evening that the £15,000,000 is still available on certain conditions.  What are the conditions?  Housing, he tells us, is not an economic proposition.  Deputy Good re-echoed that statement &mdash;&ldquo;Not an economic proposition.&rdquo; I think the House is entitled to know <Col N="1749" /> what exactly is meant by that statement&mdash;&ldquo;An economic proposition.&rdquo; Are we to continue viewing this question in the light of profit from the people who want houses and cannot get them?  Are they to be exploited to the last halfpenny?  If they are not able to come across with the amount which will satisfy the building rings are they to remain homeless?</P>
    <P>Is that definitely to be understood? Is that the attitude of the Government?  I think we are entitled to know exactly what is meant by the economic proposition which we are told housing is not considered to be at present.  So far as this recent conference between the master builders and the building operatives is concerned, the same question arises.  No agreement was reached.  And we are told that until building costs are reduced there is no hope of any real progress being made towards a solution of this problem.  I think it only fair that we should ask who are the people responsible for the high costs.  Can it be held that the workers are responsible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate I am perfectly well aware that the building operatives are not men of leisure. They are not living in mansions. There is not a member of any profession in this country going around looking for houses.  The people who are earnestly looking for houses and wanting to get them belong to the building operatives and the common labourers throughout the country. There lies the real cause of this scarcity of houses.  It is class legislation, and this is another demonstration of class legislation. We have plenty of mansions for those who are able to pay for <Col N="1750" /> them.  The beautiful villas around our suburbs are occupied by the bellowing slaves and genteel dastards, as John Mitchel termed them. But in our slums dwell the real remnant of the Celtic race, the people with more spirituality and more nationality in them than would be found in the villas.  They are living there under conditions which are beyond description.</P>
      <P>On last Thursday here we had Ministers getting up and prating about observance of the moral law. I would like to bring those Ministers through these slums and ask them how they are to reconcile their responsibilities to the people with the conditions that prevail there, conditions in which you have families ranging in numbers from 5 to 10 of both sexes living in one room.  How can those Ministers come here and declare themselves as responsible Ministers in a so-called national Government and not come forward with any definite declaration of any desire to end this evil?  Over five million pounds could be found for the Shannon scheme.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds can be found to create embassies and legations abroad with a view to carrying on the bluff that this great sovereign State is something that it really is not.  No money can be found for the solution of the housing problem. There is another aspect of this housing problem which has not been touched upon.  How much of the £200,000 in this Bill will go into circulation amongst the people of this country?  Most of the material which will be used in the erection of these houses will be imported.  As a matter of fact, due to the operations of the building ring and some other ring which I cannot name, the money which we are voting now is going to help the unemployed of other countries more than it is going to help the unemployed in this country. That is an aspect of the problem which I think should be considered seriously and tackled in the right manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about the mythical fifteen million pounds reminds me <Col N="1751" /> of another promise and a definite undertaking.  An undertaking, I am given to understand, was entered into by Deputy Rice during the time he was soliciting the votes of the citizens of North Dublin. Representations were made to him with reference to a number of houses known as &ldquo;Donnelly's Orchard,&rdquo; situated, I understand, on the Clonliffe Road, wherein provision had been made for baths, on the same basis as obtained in Marino and Croydon Park.  The Minister for Local Government was interviewed, I understand, and gave an undertaking also to consider this matter sympathetically.  The residents of those houses offered to pay more money than the residents of Marino and Croydon Park were asked to pay to have baths installed there.</P>

      <P>You will hear of them at the next election anyway.  I would seriously urge upon the Minister <Col N="1752" /> in view of the criticisms that have been offered by various Deputies in this House to withdraw this Bill and to bring it forward in a more presentable fashion.  This Bill as other Deputies have said is simply nibbling at a problem which should be tackled in a big manner, and I think apart from party politics we could tackle this scheme in a manner which would indicate that we were prepared to act up to our responsibilities as representatives of the people and to recognise that houses are an essential thing and not a luxury and that we cannot have any standard of morality in a country where you are not prepared to provide the necessary conditions for the rearing of children.  Anyone who knows the conditions obtaining in the city of Dublin knows perfectly well that there are thousands of children being reared there under conditions which make it almost impossible for them to become upright, moral citizens.  From that point of view alone I think it is nothing short of a crying shame that this question is not tackled in a big way.  I am not by any means getting up to exploit that evil or to make political capital over it.  I do not believe that any of us gloat over the fact that such conditions obtain, and perhaps if we can apply ourselves to that problem in a manner which would indicate that we could on some issue raise ourselves out of party politics I believe a solution can be found.  It is a national problem and the resources of the national treasury should be used if we are sincere in the efforts to solve it.  That is what I urge upon the Government to do in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a time when in the first place we are told that this is not a local question and cannot be solved by the local authority. There is a time when to understand at all some of the statements made both on the Labour Benches and on the Fianna Fáil Benches the whole building industry in the State and the whole business of distributing builders' material is absolutely bankrupt of capacity.  We are asked to face, by the application of large <Col N="1753" /> sums of money, a very wide problem. It has been extended before us from the slums in the city to the ordinary urban housing problem in the smaller towns, to the problem of the rural labourers, to the problem of the house in a country district that is falling down and has to be propped up with sticks, to the private person, whether in the town or city, and to the housing of the people in the Gaeltacht or the congested districts.  All these aspects of the problem in all their magnitude are served up to us to be attended to by the application of money when, from the point of view of the Labour Benches and the Fianna Fáil Benches, the machinery for dealing with housing in this country has collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told this is not a local question, that it is a national question, and the implication of the invitation to make this a national question is that the money must be found as far as possible away from the people who are talking about it and the people who want the problem solved.  The situation cannot be dealt with in that particular way. The problem of housing from one end to the other of the spectrum that has been put before us is a national problem, and as a national problem it demands to be looked at from that particular vantage point which must be taken up when a national problem is being considered, and it demands to have thought applied to it from that particular stand-point&mdash; thought as to how the problem is to be tackled, as to, if money is wanted, where the money is to come from, and on whose shoulders the burden of the money-finding is going to be placed.  The kind of thought that has been served up to a very large measure here is that this is a national problem, and then all the vacant spots, all the half-formed or forming nebulae in the minds of people speaking on the matter have been taken and ranged as ciphers one after another.  Some figures stick before them.  We have one million, three millions and fifteen millions.  The ciphers are turned into millions of <Col N="1754" /> pounds, and you are told that is the solution of the question.  Then, easily got, easily spent, and the millions are distributed amongst the people who want houses in the slums, on the one side, and the people who want ramshackle houses rebuilt or improved in districts here and there and the private person who wants to build a house, on the other side.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the Executive Council have not a policy, and that in that position they have turned to other benches in this House and said: &ldquo;What is your solution?&rdquo; I do not know any occasion when any of the other Parties in this House have been asked by the Government to supply them with a solution of the housing problem.  The matter is one that requires co-operation, but as far as the policy is concerned we have put the policy plainly before the House.</P>

      <P>I want to leave no one under the impression that in this particular matter we have not a policy.  Deputy Rice has been spoken about a lot on this matter of housing, principally by people who want to shirk the issue, principally by people who will not get down to the facts of the case, principally by people who, instead of taking the <Col N="1755" /> final report of the Committee on the Relief of Unemployment as it stands, and seeing there the contributions made by Deputy Rice and by those others associated with him on that Committee, will do anything but start off from that point and will not realise the contribution in thought to the solution of the problem that is given there.  I want, again, to direct Deputies' attention to the report, on page 7 of which paragraph 35 sets out: &ldquo;If the problem is to be solved in the present generation this can only be done by (a) a drastic reduction in building costs, and (b) the provision of housing loans for local authorities on terms which would enable them to build and let houses at rents which will not throw an intolerable burden on the taxpayers and the ratepayers, on the one hand, or on the poorest tenants on the other.&rdquo;  If Deputies who want to go further than that, and who desire to examine what took place and what proposals were put to Deputy Rice from one side or the other at the conference which he, as an individual, endeavoured to get working in order to get some progress under (a), they will look at the names of the persons who formed that Committee and see what they brought forward in their report, they will be much more profitably occupied than in going further, endeavouring to see to what extent progress has been made in getting that drastic reduction brought about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing is very important, and the Minister is simply talking round the question again. He is not getting down to it at all. He says there is a problem.  Everybody who has spoken agrees that there is a problem.  The important thing is, is his Department or the Government trying to get away from the problem or trying to solve it?  Might I suggest to the Minister that he should ask the different local authorities in the country to send representatives to meet him in Dublin in order that he may go into the question from their point of view? <Col N="1756" /> Then he will find out whether they are or are not serious.  The Minister refers to a conference.  That is only dealing with Dublin.  It cannot be said that in other parts of the country they have settled all their housing difficulties.</P>

      <P>I regret I cannot meet the desire of the Deputy to be as crystallised in my contribution to this particular question at the moment as he and other Deputies were.  I am dealing with a very important point that has been talked black, white and blue in an endeavour, I suggest, to obscure a position that exists.  The names of the Committee that went into this matter are worth examining, and their report is worth examining.  They stated that what was necessary was a drastic reduction of building costs, the provision of housing loans, and the avoidance of an excessive burden on the taxpayer or ratepayer, or the person building houses.  It has been suggested that the Government Party, in connection with the 1927 election, made a statement as part of their policy that they were going to open the Local Loans Fund for houses.  In June, 1927, the President made a very elaborate statement of policy immediately prior to the general election.  Speaking on the question of long-term credit facilities for local authorities he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We realise that in present circumstances local authorities are hampered by lack of long-term credit facilities in the undertaking of certain essential local services, such as drainage and waterworks schemes.  We intend to elaborate a scheme to enable long-term loans to be available for these projects.  While we do not feel that, in all the circumstances, housing is a service for which these facilities can be justified, we are prepared, nevertheless, in very necessitous cases, to consider how far it may be possible to include housing schemes among the projects for which borrowings may be made.&rdquo;</P>

Then we come to what the Deputy is anxious about, and what I say is perfectly clear: what is our housing policy?  Our policy is that in the last eight years, including the present Bill, and the proposals for housing for the year 1929, 21,600 houses are being provided at a cost to the taxpayer of £2,050,000.</P>

      <P>It is because I am in doubt as to what the policy is, that I am asking the question.  A housing policy has been in existence since 1922.  Last October a Bill was introduced which the President declared was the completion of a policy which had been in operation since 1922. Now we have a Bill similar in broad outline to the policy which had been in operation since 1922.  Are we to take it that the Government, having decided to wind up the 1922 policy last year, have since changed their minds and decided to continue it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should realise that the policy of grants in 1924 was not, in terms of money, the policy of 1922.  The grant of one million pounds in 1922 finished that section of the Government's progressive housing policy. The Act of 1928 finished the policy of giving differentiated grants to local bodies and private persons according to the number of rooms in their houses.  This is the continuance of the progressive policy.  As I say, after the first 21,600 houses, under this policy of reduced grants, not necessarily grants keeping as high as they are in the present Bill, but under a further policy of reductions like that, the second step in the Government policy of meeting the housing shortage is to provide a second 21,000 houses, if you wish, at a less cost to the State.  In the process of doing it, we must bring about what is stated by the Committee that examined it as necessary if the problem is to be solved in the present generation, namely, a reduction in building costs, and, at the same time, getting a more accurate appraisement by throwing further responsibility on local authorities in connection with the work required to be done; also the extent to which there are classes in the country who want houses built for them with the aid of public money, and throwing the responsibility in a more equitable way than it has been up to the present on the ratepayer and taxpayer, because of very good reasons.  The position practically has been that almost the total brunt of the present contribution to the partial solving of the problem has fallen on the shoulders of the taxpayer, and that is why we have such a generous outlook on what can be done in dealing with the different classes of people who want houses, apart altogether from whether they are people of a class that ought to have their houses provided for them partly at the public expense.  It was necessary that the <Col N="1760" /> State should put on the shoulders of the taxpayer a very large part of the cost that it put on them in connection with the one million pounds' scheme.  Practically no local authority lost anything on that scheme. Very few local authorities have lost anything on subsequent schemes.</P>
      <P>If we are going to be realistic with regard to the problem of what is required, if we are to be realistic as to whether building costs are at a reasonable point or not, we have to get an examination of the problem closer down than it was possible to get it up to the present, and we have to put the responsibility for bearing a large portion, if not all, of any payment which is to be made in the matter closer down and more upon the shoulders of the ratepayers than the taxpayers.  If we have to deal with the whole problem from the end of the spectrum that we find in the Rosses and in Connemara, where you have people whose rent-paying capacity cannot be regarded as anything equal to the rent-paying capacity of the people in the slums; if we are to deal with it from the slum end here in the city there will be a sufficient amount of ground to be covered by the application of the taxpayers' money to take as much of that money as may be available. If the normal housing of the working classes in the ordinary Dublin districts or large town cannot be solved by the operation of the ratepayer alone as regards bearing the burden, however the State may assist in accumulating credit for the ratepayer in the matter, then your housing problem is not going to be solved, and we are going to hear wild and irresponsible statements with regard to national housing boards and millions of pounds that we have heard here to-night.  I feel we are, in fact, much closer to one another in a practical way in the appreciation of the problem, and much closer to one another as to how it ought to be tackled, than the speeches delivered here would lead people who did not know us to believe. I say that is the Government policy in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> We are invited to borrow at present a large number of millions of pounds at 5 per cent.  We would not be invited to do that by people shouldering any responsibility in connection with the actual borrowing or carrying out of the work.  But that is the policy.  We must transfer a large portion of whatever loss there is going to be in the provision of houses for the working classes in the ordinary way, on to the shoulders of the ratepayers.  In places where there are large insanitary clearances to be done and where really an insanitary state of things has to be dealt with, the State will find sufficient call upon its resources in dealing with that.  As I say, we are closer to one another as to how the housing problem should be dealt with than our speeches would lead one to believe.  We are closer to one another, I think, in placing the housing problem in its proper perspective with regard to other problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned the problem of housing in connection with the expenses of education, old age pensions and the expenses for other social services, and Deputy Everett brought in the consideration of the County Medical Officer of Health.  This all indicates that we have come closer in our appreciation of housing.  But if the housing problem cannot be solved&mdash;personally I am not as pessimistic in the matter as the report on unemployment would suggest we ought to be&mdash;and if it cannot be solved in a normal way, we have to stand back from all our social services and see whether education should sacrifice some money to housing, whether old age pensions should sacrifice some money to give to housing; and the question will arise whether in a county like Mayo old age pensions should be paid at such a rate that if put on the rates they would be 13/11 and perhaps no money at all found by the rates towards the housing of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputies suggest that they could find lines here in which reduction in expenditure could be made; that they could find lines locally in which reductions could be made.  Certainly. <Col N="1762" /> And these reductions will have to be made if only for the reason that perhaps more expenditure is necessary on more important services.</P>
    <P>If on examination of the State expenditure we can bring about still further reductions than are being brought about, there are other directions in which that money should be spent than, say, in assisting private persons to build houses, or in assisting ordinary urban authorities to build ordinary working-class houses &mdash; these ordinary working - class houses due to increased population, as distinct from houses that have to go hand in hand with the demolition and clearance of insanitary areas.</P>
    <P>The slum question is going to take money.  In this connection I ought to answer a question put by Deputy Lemass when he asked why something is not done to give effect to certain recommendations with regard to giving more power to local authorities to clear derelict sites and put on the owners of some of those insanitary areas the cost of making them less insanitary or more sanitary. There is every reason why action should be taken in that matter at the earliest possible moment.  The matter has been given a very considerable amount of thought, particularly, at any rate, as regards the Dublin area.  There are perhaps difficulties in dealing with the matter, but I am satisfied it will have to be dealt with, and will be dealt with, as soon as I can have the proper legislation drafted to deal with it.  But building in large city areas to replace slums that had been removed is a costly matter.  One scheme of the kind was carried out in Dublin in Crab Lane, and for 40 flats the total cost amounted to £21,000, or, approximately £200 a room.  Now you cannot deal with the slum problem if flatted buildings in the city areas are going to cost £200 a room.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what proportion of that cost is represented by the price paid for the site?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The price paid <Col N="1763" /> for the site is not involved in the matter at all.  The actual building cost itself was £19,540, and the other money that brought it up to £21,000 for the lot was based on an estimate for the electric wiring, hot water service, and services of that particular kind.  But the cost of the site is not in it at all.</P>

      <P>I could not. Everything we can do to help to reduce building costs, to help to see that the type of flat, in such a house would be of an inexpensive kind is being done.  Before we leave the point of the slums, it was suggested by different Deputies here that different classes in different places have been neglected.  Deputy O'Kelly, at any rate, complains that Dublin was shamefully neglected. The total amount of grants that have been given by the Government to the City of Dublin since 1924 is £801,000.  If that is shameful neglect of the City of Dublin, I wonder what would be adequate. In so far as Dublin City is concerned, <Col N="1764" /> houses have been built at a rate higher than ever before.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister departs from the slum problem, might I ask him if it would not be worth consideration to have this problem dealt with and a policy decided upon, and then see how far we could finance that policy, each year to do a certain amount of it?  No one here suggested that we should face immediately the one big thing which is really the most difficult part of the housing, that is, dealing with the slum problem, but if we had it dealt with from the point of view of the planning and a policy decided upon, then we could see how far we could finance each year portion of it and then solve what really is a very difficult problem in housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Good, we may examine the slum problem and see how it should be tackled.  There has been a very considerable amount of examination of it, but until you get the economic part of your building problem solved&mdash;that is, get your building costs down to such an extent that <Col N="1765" /> your ordinary normal working-class houses in an ordinary town or in the Dublin area can be built without throwing an undue amount on the ratepayers&mdash;you cannot approach your slum problem unless you throw a certain number of thousands of pounds into it.  Out of 2,897 of the houses built in Dublin and occupied on the 31st of January, 1929, 2,145 were five-roomed houses.  The economic state of affairs dictated to the Commissioners that it would be five-roomed houses that would be built, and to have a very large number as against houses of the smaller kind, because there was a greater return on money and we are housing a bigger number of people.  We are housing the large families.</P>
      <P>These economic facts operate on people and on local authorities to such an extent that until they settle themselves to a certain amount, at any rate, you have not the financial capacity and you are not able to bring yourself to deal with the slum problem directly.  As I say, as far as the examination of the problem goes, a very considerable amount of the examination has gone ahead.  To a certain extent, you have to treat the Crab Lane experiment as a definite piece of work to provide houses for the slum dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It means further examination of the general position and of your whole financial position. The farmers, it was stated, were neglected.  Out of 10,717 houses built up to and under the 1928 Act, 7,706, or 72 per cent. of the whole lot, were built in rural areas, so that the rural population have not anything to complain of in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did that apply to the whole 26 counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to the whole 26 counties.  To get back to another aspect of the matter, the question of co-operation and of getting closer down to the problem <Col N="1766" /> locally in order that we may see more clearly where we stand with regard to what is to be done, and in order that we may see more clearly the implication of shouldering people with a debt in connection with this matter of housing.  Deputy Coburn made, from my point of view, a very acceptable and satisfactory contribution to the debate.  If Deputies would look at the &ldquo;Dundalk Democrat&rdquo; of the 16th March, they would see where a discussion was entered on in Dundalk between members of the Urban Council, of trades bodies, and of the business community.  They are facing up to the question, in the first place, of whether a brick works might not be established in Dundalk for the development of the town and of industry.  They are making a census of insanitary buildings and of the housing requirements that are necessary.  They are also to go into the financing of housing.  I feel that we ought to get more of that kind of thing from the ratepayers as distinct from the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the ratepayer should be saddled, considering that in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties less than one-third of the £2,100,000 went back to the ratepayers themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take a place like Drogheda, the national contribution to housing there was £19,243.  A penny has not gone on the Drogheda rates to co-operate in the shouldering of the cost of these particular houses.  In Dundalk, £15,559 went in grants to private persons and public bodies.  There is a small housing rate in Dundalk, but I think the greater part of it, if not the whole, is for houses built before 1922.  I do not think that since 1922 a penny has gone on the rates in respect of house building.  As regards Wexford, a town with which Deputy Corish is closely in touch&mdash;he takes a serious interest in housing and has endeavoured to make the problem understood from his particular point of view here&mdash;since 1922, between grants to private persons and the <Col N="1767" /> local authority, £11,867 of State money has been given.  I do not think a penny of Wexford money has gone into these schemes.</P>

      <P>The rate for housing at the present moment in Wexford is about 3¼d.  They struck a rate of approximately £1,000 in 1922 in connection with the £1,000,000 grant, but the Wexford Corporation did not lose any money in that scheme.  Wisely, they sold their houses and they made use of the money available to go into other housing schemes.  But I do suggest, as against the State's £11,867 to Wexford, the Corporation has made no contribution.  Deputy Corish, who is seriously interested in housing, has done a lot to interest his council in the matter.  He comes here and tells us that he has been excusing the Government to the Wexford people.  He has been offering excuses to people who did not contribute anything on behalf of people who for seven or eight years have contributed £11,000.</P>

      <P>On the question of long term loans, I have quoted from the President's statement in June, 1927, with regard to housing and long term loans.  The money that the State contributed to the housing problem up to the present moment was money paid out of revenue, because with housing costs so high and with housing costs falling, and with the value of property falling year by year, it was unreasonable and unsound that a debt should be saddled on the people in respect of property that at that particular time may not be worth the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to long-term loans, I say again, is with building costs at their present height, with the cost of money at its present height, the Government cannot look with any kind of equanimity on local authorities saddling themselves with a large amount of debt.  We are catering&mdash;and we have to keep our minds on the future&mdash;for the shortage of houses at present, the normal wastage in respect of our houses here, and we are catering for a population that has been reduced considerably through economic, political and historical causes and a population that we must regard, under the present circumstances, as being on the increase. For that reason, if, in order to meet the immediate and pressing problem, local bodies saddled themselves with heavy debts for a period of, say, thirty-five years they might deal with their present problem or a reasonable percentage of it, but they would leave themselves with a similar problem recurring within the 35 years, because the debt they would undertake would prevent them from tackling the normal wastage and the normal increase necessary.  It would also tend to keep up the building costs which have been steadily declining under the influence of the Government's policy which rehabilitated <Col N="1769" /> the building industry here and put State funds into the hands of the building industry to get ahead, and draw private money out of the hands of individuals to meet it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if we are to understand from what he said that the Government definitely rejects the conclusions of the Committee on the Relief of Unemployment, in which they state that the continuance of the contributions under the Housing Act, even on an extended scale, cannot in itself bring us within sight of a solution?</P>

      <P>I quoted a long array of figures yesterday to show that, steadily under the influence of the Government policy, building costs have been coming down.  I think I have left one important point out.  Deputy Rice made a suggestion yesterday that in the case of local bodies who struck a housing rate an increased grant might be given.  I must say that I would like to hear that point developed, because the amount that we propose as a grant for local bodies is, in our mind, sufficient to help in getting houses erected.  It will be said that local bodies are empowered under this Bill to grant a sum of an equivalent amount.  I have no desire to interfere with the judgment of local bodies in doing that, but I do say that much is being done in some of our urban districts in the wiping-out of insanitary houses and in their replacement by other houses.  I would like to see, associated with all the money that local authorities can put into housing, the demolition and clearance of insanitary areas.  If the local authorities are invited to strike a rate for housing and if an increased grant is to be given, I would like to examine the question, having heard what further can be said on the matter, to see whether the adoption of an attitude like that would not tend to increase or keep up the cost of housing.  I am very favourably inclined to the idea that at this particular moment local bodies should strike a housing rate, because as the Government have shouldered the heavy end of the problem up to the present, owing to the general conditions that existed and according as our judgment of the situation dictated, our judgment of the situation now dictates that local bodies should shoulder their end of the burden.  I am inclined favourably to consider what Deputy Rice suggested, but I would like to hear the matter further discussed and to have further consideration of the likely effect that an increased State grant, apart from what local bodies might do with a housing rate, might have on keeping up housing costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Bill.  Most of the items in this measure have been already dealt with.  Sub-sections (2), (3) and (5) of Section 1 are identical with the resolutions adopted here on the 6th March.  In Section 1 there is a slight variation in sub-section (1) from that contained in the resolutions.  It is proposed to exempt from duty tissues which are less than twelve inches wide.  This has been inserted to allow for the free importation of ribbons and similar narrow tissues which it was not intended should be included in the scope of the duty. Section 2 of the Bill raises the duty on woollen wearing apparel from 15 per cent. ad valorem to 20 per cent. ad valorem.  Part II. of the Bill has for its purpose the granting to the Agricultural Credit Corporation of exemption from payment of stamp duties on debentures and certificates of charge issued by it, and also on deeds of trust and transfers in connection with the securities to be transferred to trustees, as securities for an issue of debentures or certificates of charge.  The loss to the Exchequer under the provisions of this particular section will amount to a few hundred pounds and the loss under sub-section (3) will amount to £5,000 if the capital of the Corporation is doubled.  The margin of profit on the loans of the Corporation is very low, and it is necessary to relieve the Corporation of as many burdens as possible if it is to pay its way.  Other parts of the Bill deal with the admission of tractor cars free of duty.  The number of tractors purchased annually in the country is somewhere about 100 or 120.  It is unlikely that tractors will be imported in the future, and this particular remission of duty will <Col N="1773" /> facilitate the manufacture of tractors, such as are being undertaken on a very extensive scale in the one motor factory in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to re-open the question which was discussed here on the Report Stage of these Resolutions.  With reference to the effect which the increasing of the duty on wearing apparel to 20 per cent. only is likely to have on the ready-made clothing industry in the city, the President may possibly recollect that in speaking on those Resolutions the Minister for Finance stated that he understood the clothing manufacturers would make a representation through the Advisory Committee for the trade, established in connection with the Department of Industry and Commerce, for the purpose of putting their point of view.  He undertook, if they brought any new facts to light, which did not appear to have been properly or adequately examined by the Tariff Commission, that the Tariff Commission would be asked to consider these special points separately.  I would like to be informed if such representations have been made through the Advisory Committee, and if so, with what result.  When I was listening to the speech delivered by the Minister for Finance on that occasion, it seemed that there was a very reasonable case against increasing the duty beyond 15 per cent. Since then, the printed report has been circulated, and I have had an opportunity of reading what he said. On detailed examination the case appears to be less convincing. Statements which have been made by those engaged in the ready-made clothing industry, to the effect that their interests will be seriously prejudiced by the operation of this new set of duties, appear to be quite seriously founded and would require very serious consideration before they are finally rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance appeared to be under the impression, as he said himself, that they just wanted to make things beautifully easy for themselves, and he appeared to think, of course, that any proposal to make things beautifully easy for <Col N="1774" /> an Irish industry was not worth considering. The Minister also stated that the clothing manufacturers will continue to exercise a substantial advantage over importers, even though the advantage which they exercise will be much less than that which they hitherto enjoyed.  That seems to raise a question which I would like answered and with which the Minister did not deal.  The question is whether the 15 per cent. ad valorem duty which was originally imposed was required, and if it was required in 1925, in 1926 and 1927, why is it thought that it is not required in full now?  Has the industry, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance or the Tariff Commission, so developed itself and so established itself that it can now do with the very substantial reduction in duty which it is proposed shall come into operation?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, of course, made the point that the clothing manufacturers who use Irish cloth in the suits they make will, in fact, have an increased advantage under these proposals. We would not like to see any lessening of the inducements to the clothing manufacturers to use Irish cloth, but I do not think&mdash;and I have carefully considered the matter&mdash; that the increase of the ready-made duty to 20 per cent. would in fact lessen the inducement which the clothing manufacturer has to use cloth produced in this country. There will be still 20 per cent. on the cloth and there is competition between manufacturers.  A manufacturer anxious to beat his competitors will have a strong inducement to purchase Irish cloth if he can get it and thus be in a position to cut his price by the 20 per cent. duty which the other man has to pay.  The Minister also said that even if the cloth, which they require, is not available from Irish mills now it is likely to be available. That is in part true.  In a very short time it is not at all unlikely that the cloth required will be available in quantity, but we have got to bear in mind that a very large part of the trade in ready-made clothing is represented by suits bought by <Col N="1775" /> young men who are more concerned with the cut, design, shape and pattern of the suit than with the wearing quality of the cloth, and if the Irish manufacturers are not, and it does not appear that they will be able for a considerable time to supply cloth in the designs which are in demand, and in a sufficient variety of designs, one result will be to increase the importation of British ready-made suits despite the duty. The woollen manufacturing industry, as I said in the discussion on the Report Stage of the Resolutions, is more important than the ready-made clothing industry, but we want to keep both, and there is no reason why we cannot keep both flourishing in this country.  It only requires the increasing of the duty on ready-mades by something more than the 5 per cent. which the Tariff Commission recommended.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government appears to be that anything which might possibly make things too easy for an Irish industry must be bad. Without giving the matter thorough examination, they just reject the suggestion because it appears to operate too favourably in the interests of the ready-made clothing manufacturers. There is a large volume of employment given by that industry, which has developed very rapidly under the protective duty imposed in 1924.  It will probably be seriously hit if the measure of protection which it has hitherto enjoyed is reduced.  These proposals do reduce that measure of protection.  Of course, they still leave the Irish ready-made clothing industry with some protection, but it is only one-third of the protection that it had before.  If a man in the business can use Irish-made cloth and can get what he requires in the quality and the variety of design he needs, then he will have an increased advantage.  But from the statement made by the Minister for Finance on the Report Stage, and from the report of the Tariff Commission, it does not appear that the Irish woollen manufacturers themselves <Col N="1776" /> believe that within anything like a reasonable time they would be able to supply that cloth.  In quantity they could possibly supply it forthwith, but in quality and in variety of design they do not even appear to be contemplating its manufacture.  The suggested increased duty on ready-made clothing will not lessen the inducement to the ready-made clothing manufacturer to buy Irish cloth if he can get it.  If our suggestion is carried out, he can even afford to pay 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. more for Irish cloth than for the imported cloth, and at the same time he can sell the suit cheaper than he otherwise would be able to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 3 of the Bill, the section dealing with the exemption of tractor parts from the motor car duty, we are in thorough agreement.  The establishment and continued development of the motor factory in Cork has been of great advantage to Cork and to the country as a whole.  We are anxious to facilitate the development of an export trade from this country, particularly a trade in goods, a large part of the final cost of which represents wages paid to labour.  Our views upon matters of this kind have been constantly subject to misrepresentation. I recollect on one occasion reading a speech by the Minister for Agriculture, in which he said that the Fianna Fáil Party wanted to stop all exports.  I suppose the Minister gets so accustomed to talking nonsense that he cannot deviate into common sense even when he is quoting the policy of Fianna Fáil. Those who have even a most elementary knowledge of that policy know that the stoppage of exports is no part of it.  We are anxious to encourage exports which are of direct value to the people, and they include those exports in the final cost of which the highest percentage is represented in wages paid to labour.</P>
    <P>There is one small point in connection with this Bill that I am not quite clear about.  We are going to permit motor tractor parts in free of duty.  Is it proposed to permit motor tractors free of duty?  If not, <Col N="1777" /> how far must the assembly of parts have proceeded in order to become a tractor?  It is proposed to let in tractor parts and permit the assembly of the parts.  Does that include tractors themselves, or what percentage of parts must be absent in order to permit what is left to come in free of duty?  There does appear to be some ambiguity about the matter.  We are anxious to develop that industry and give it every possible chance to expand.  In the last fortnight that firm paid £25,000 in wages to Irish workers. That is a very great asset to the country and we would like to see it preserved.  We are glad this step is being taken and we hope it will result in the creation of a very large export trade from Cork in motor tractors.  As the President said, the actual sale of tractors in the country is small.  The bulk of the factory products will have to be exported. With regard to the remaining portion of the Bill, which deals with stamp duties, I have nothing to say. I suppose the Agricultural Credit Corporation must receive all the assistance possible.  Certainly, it appears to be in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to welcome this Bill.  As far as the first two sections are concerned I am largely in agreement with Deputy Lemass that something should be done by way of adjustment of taxes as far as the readymade industry is concerned in order to meet a new situation which has arisen as a result of the protective duties on woollen goods.  I am more immediately concerned with what is contained in Section 3.  I must congratulate the President on his foresight in making these provisions in regard to motor car parts.  He and those associated with him have shown some prudence and good judgment in that matter. I may mention that already there are a couple of thousand workers employed in the Ford factory, and as week succeeds week much new machinery and plant is arriving on the Cork quays, all of which goes to show that the Ford people are making provision for a very large <Col N="1778" /> output of tractors.  As most Deputies are aware, the wages paid to those workers are on a fairly liberal scale, and it has undoubtedly been a source of wealth so far as Cork City is concerned.  The workers are all contented, the conditions of labour are good and they are adequately, if not liberally, remunerated.  For that reason amongst other reasons I welcome this Bill, and I congratulate the President on the part he has taken in the framing of this measure, for I understand he had a good deal to do with it.  So far as the other portions of the Bill are concerned, I suppose that at a later stage we will have something to say by way of amendment or otherwise.  On the whole I do say that this is an attempt on the part of the Government to respond or react to certain economic thought in this country.  I think if they were to lean, perhaps, a little more to economic thought of this kind we might have a still more prosperous country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned principally at the moment with the provision which is made here in relation to tractors.  I have read that very carefully, and what I want to be perfectly clear about in relation to this is that it is the intention of the Government in doing this to remove all the present administrative difficulties. I think it is, but I want an assurance that it is so.  The actual position at the present moment in relation to tractors is that Messrs. Ford, in Cork, are contemplating a two-shift day of eight hours, in which they will turn out three hundred completed tractors per day.  That is the present proposal, and each unit of the line of construction is based upon an output of 150 completed tractors per eight hours day.  The actual consumption of tractors in Ireland, in all probability, will not absorb the output of that factory for six hours in the year; say six to eight hours in the year, would probably cover the immediate visible consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment the motor parts which come in and which are incorporated into tractors are liable <Col N="1779" /> to duty on import, and, on export, a drawback is given practically to the amount of that duty.  The duty would still be charged upon the imported motor parts of tractors which were internally consumed, if one may use such a term in relation to tractors. Now the actual existing amount of net taxation would be very small.  But the administrative difficulty of keeping track of invoices and prices of goods, bills of lading and the rest of it have involved a very great deal of trouble and a good deal of expense, utterly unremunerative trouble and expense, on the part of Messrs. Ford.  It has also involved a very great amount of completely unremunerative expense and trouble on the part of the Government. The object we had in getting this provision made was that that administrative difficulty, as distinct from the mere amount of taxation involved, would be dealt with.  Personally I think the total amount of actual net taxation relief under this whole section will probably not be much more than one thousand pounds, if it is as much as that.  But the amount of trouble and administrative expense which may be removed under this section, if the section is interpreted in the widest possible sense so as to get rid of that administrative difficulty and trouble, may be very great.  The Minister for Finance is fully aware that this administrative difficulty, and not the taxation difficulty itself, was the main trouble.  I take it that this section has been drafted for the purpose of getting rid of that administrative difficulty.  I have read that section through, and as far as I can see if it is liberally interpreted by those who have to interpret it, it will get rid of that difficulty, and, to that extent, at no cost whatever to the State, a considerable saving in my opinion to the State, and a considerable saving of expense and administrative trouble on the part of this firm, will be brought about.  A very great and a very real welcome to Irish industrial activity has been given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> Deputy Lemass gave you the figures of about the last fortnight. That was about £25,000 for fourteen working days.  Now that hardly conveys even the present condition, because even during that particular time the number of men had increased very largely.  The last figure that I had was somewhere about £18,000, that is before I got this figure of £25,000.  The actual number in employment now is somewhere about 2,600 men, and I believe it is possible that in a few days the number will exceed 3,000.  I hope to see 5,000 men employed in Messrs. Fords, not as a limit, but merely as the beginning of the industrial plant of Henry Ford in the City of Cork and in the South of Ireland.  I think there are very much larger possibilities behind the Ford works in Cork and their tractor germ than a mere 5,000 men.  I think that every possible aid and assistance should be given by every Party in this House, absolutely clear and distinct from any Party suggestion of using or abusing that thing for Party purposes.  Fords is one of the things that should be kept perfectly clear of any possible Party advantage and Party controversy.  I suggest that when we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill that we may be able to extend it in another direction, again in a direction which, in my opinion, will take practically nothing, if anything, from the revenue of the country and yet will be of very definite benefit to Messrs. Fords.  At any rate it will show upon our part a welcome and a glad hand to that enterprise which at the present moment is employing more people and paying more wages as a single unit than any other industry we have in the South and which I believe even at the higher hopes that I have already stated is only at the beginning of possibilities of benefit for the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When Fords were manufacturing cars here in this State and not manufacturing a great many of them, and when they were employing a considerably less number of men than they are now employing and when they were employing them <Col N="1781" /> on a basis which was infinitely more casual than the present basis which is tending to be a permanent basis of employment, certain concessions were given in relation to that manufacture. All Ford cars, for instance, with horse power nominally twentyfive, really about ninety, were given a certain concession.  I have seen a Ford car driven at the rate of 94 miles an hour.  It had to have a special arrangement for oil-cooling. The engine in a Ford car was about 50 h.p.  A concession was given that the total tax upon that car would be £10 per annum quite irrespective of its nominal rating which I think is about 25 to 27 h.p.  I suggest that we might consider that again in relation to this act of goodwill and welcome which is shown in this Bill. There are two types of passenger Ford cars now being made.  There is a 15 h.p. and there is a 25 h.p. They are absolutely similar in outside appearance and, what is of infinitely more importance from the point of view of the public, they are absolutely similar in price.  You can buy a 25 h.p. Ford car for exactly the same price that you buy the 15 h.p. Ford car.  That is certainly rather an amazing proposition.</P>
    <P>That is probably due to the fact that they are manufacturing 25 h.p. Ford cars in amazing numbers for a very much larger market than is here at present, and they had to construct special engines for Europe and countries in which the taxation is based upon a h.p. basis.  At present I think 99.9 per cent. of the Ford cars imported into this country are 15 h.p. cars.  The 25 h.p. car people are not buying, simply and solely on the ground of the tax.  I bought a 15 h.p. Ford car, as I could not see that I was doing any benefit to Fords by buying a 25 h.p. car, and I could see good reasons why I should not pay unnecessarily, because the 15 h.p. Ford car is a magnificent car in every possible respect.  In speed, comfort, springing, hill-climbing, appearance, dignity, and in value for money, it is unimpeachably good value, and I am glad to be able to say that in this Assembly of the <Col N="1782" /> Irish Free State.  But, if people could get a 25 h.p. car for the same price in tax contribution, as they can get a 25 h.p. car for the same capital cost, I think a very considerable number of people who are buying cars, and who have no association of any sort, kind, or description with this country would tend to buy a 25 h.p. Ford against some of the other cars.</P>

      <P>Possibly I am.  With that little vague suggestion to the President, on a line of country which he and the Minister for Finance might later investigate, I will leave the matter.  I understood there were some negotiations, or possibility of hope, that by an arrangement between the ready-made clothing manufacturers and the woollen manufacturers this difficulty of the balance of proportion between the two might be got over.  My information is that there is a very good spirit of co-operation between these two trades, who have, for the moment, been thrown somewhat into a conflict of interests.  I hope when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister for Finance will recognise that it would be a tragedy that, in an attempt to benefit one particular industry he should seem to risk damaging another industry which has considerable possibilities.  I know, for instance, that individual cloth manufacturers in this country are making experiments and trying to find a material which they can give, of suitable quality, design and price, to the ready-made clothing manufacturers from which to manufacture goods here for which at present Irish material is not available.  My information is that there is a very good spirit of co-operation between these two trades, and without going further into it, or pressing the point, I hope the Minister for Finance, when he comes to reduce this Bill into its definite and final form in Committee, will find that he himself will be able to make a step forward in the direction of developing that <Col N="1783" /> co-operation and removing the difficulty which this Bill undoubtedly does create between a trade which we want to have and a trade which, in helping that other trade, we may to some extent harm.</P>

      <P>Before the Second Reading of this measure is passed I hope the President will tell us if the Government have examined the question of whether it would be profitable to remit all duties on motor parts. I think representations have been made to them within the last year or two by people who are very much interested in this question.  These people have been doing a little in the assembling of cars and, I understand, have had some success.  They are very anxious to go ahead and have shown a certain ability to deliver the goods.  I am not competent to say whether or not they have shown the necessary ability, but they have shown a certain ability, at all events, to deliver the goods.  When we take into account the tremendous boon that even a small amount of additional employment would be to this country, it would be a pity if the question were not examined, particularly on an occasion like this when we are making a certain alteration in favour of tractor parts. There is the great authority of the Fiscal Committee, which sat in 1923, for believing that the duty on parts is not a paying one.  That Committee stated in its report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The existing duty upon accessories and component parts, on the other hand, yields a comparatively small return to the revenue, is productive of a great deal of delay and inconvenience to the motor industry in An Saorstát, especially to that section of it engaged in repairs, and discourages any attempt at assembling being undertaken in An Saorstát.  The Committee, therefore, recommends the withdrawal of the duty upon motor accessories and component parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of that recommendation would not now, I admit, be so applicable, because there has been a great improvement in the facilities for clearing <Col N="1784" /> goods, but there are still awkward delays in connection with consignments of motor parts which are urgently required, and it is still very doubtful, I would almost say it is certain, that the collection of the duty on parts is not a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>The amount of the tax raised from the duties on motor cars, cycles, parts and accessories for the last financial year was £255,119.  Taking into account that there were probably at least 4,000 cars brought in, in addition to a large number of cycles, it is obvious that the proportion of that amount represented by duty on parts is very small. When one takes into account the trouble the Customs officers have in examining invoices and certificates of origin&mdash;and I believe they have at present to see affidavits from the exporter and the importer&mdash;and in going through various other forms before allowing the goods to pass, it is obvious, to me at least, that the duty cannot be a paying proposition. Could there be any real opposition to the removal of the duty on parts? I can think of none.  If the people who are interested in the assembling of cars here&mdash;and they are by no means incompetent people&mdash;got a little encouragement and were even able to produce 50 or 60 cars, that could be called Irish cars, it would be a good deal done.  It would inevitably lead to greater interest in motor engineering.  It would, of course, give a good amount of employment, and, I think, it is a thing that the country would be rather proud of.  Canada gets a very considerable income from the industry of assembling motor cars, and altogether there seems to be a very definite case for considering the point. I hope the President will be able to tell us that it has been considered, and I will be surprised if he will be able to tell us that it is either impracticable or not desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass enquired about a matter which had been the subject of a good deal of discussion on the last day&mdash;that is, the alteration in the duty on ready-made <Col N="1785" /> clothing.  The cloth manufacturers have been requested to place their case before the Department of Industry and Commerce, but up to the present the result has not been furnished to the Minister.  No action can be taken until the views of the Department on the report made by the cloth manufacturers have been received.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Moore, instances which happened in 1923 and judgments arrived at then have not much relation to what might happen in 1929.  In 1923, for example, the entire customs system was very much altered.  Up to the 1st April, 1923, cars and parts came in here free of duty.  After that the staff of the Customs and Excise was placed on entirely different duties.  Naturally there should have been delays.  There were various complaints with regard to delays at that time, and I think it was with a view to seeing how improvement could be effected that that Committee considered the question of motor parts.  In any case I would say now it is rather a matter that should come before the Tariff Commission.  It is scarcely one which the Executive, in the light of all the circumstances, would like to pass judgment on, especially in view of the information which I think is available in some Department that the opinion of experts on the subject is that you would require very considerable output to justify an alteration in respect of removing the duty from imported motor parts.</P>
      <P>Something like 4,000 or 5,000 cars come here in the year, and a factory with an output of 1,000 cars would be very desirable.  But I think in the absence of a more favourable return than the Deputy has shown, something more would be necessary in order to get the duty on parts removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention that is behind Section 3 is to remove all the difficulties affecting the great Ford industry in Cork.  I think Deputy Flinn and Deputy Anthony were quite right when they said that this was a very important industry.  It is a matter <Col N="1786" /> of very great satisfaction to everybody in this country that one of the foremost of the American industrialists has seen fit to establish a factory in the Southern capital.  I believe that the firm are well satisfied with the workmen and with the capabilities of the operatives there. It is everybody's desire that this factory should grow.  There is I believe a desire on the part of practically all our people that our industries and manufactures should increase, but this particular factory and the two that we have in Dublin&mdash;Guinness and Jacob's&mdash;are of the most satisfactory kind, Ford's, perhaps, even more so than either of the others, because Ford's output will be more than 95 per cent. exports.</P>
    <P>In the case of the factories I have mentioned in Dublin, their major business is export.  In every big industry the real advantage to the country is in the export trade.  I hope and imagine that the number of tractors in use in this country will be increased.  I think they are an economical method of locomotion and that their advantages are not yet realised to the full here; but the intention, of course, is to facilitate this factory, and I believe that in this matter all parties in the State would be at one in easing the difficulties, if there are any, attending any industry in the country.</P>
    <P>I think these are the only points raised in the course of the discussion.</P>

      <P>The President said that negotiations in relation to getting over the difficulty as between the ready-made clothing trade and the woollen manufacturers have been held up by the fact that certain preliminaries have not been fulfilled. If they had been fulfilled, the Minister for Finance might be in a position, on Committee Stage, to make the amendments required.  I take it that if the negotiations are satisfactorily brought to a head there would be no difficulty in moving again in some portion of some Finance Bill to remove that difficulty. If we leave this over for the result of these consultations, we would expect that facilities would be provided to give that effect afterwards.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of pensions, allowances and gratuities payable under any Act of the present Session to extend the class of persons to whom pensions, allowances and gratuities may be granted under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and to authorise the payment of pensions, allowances and gratuties to the widows of persons who at their deaths were in receipt of pensions under the said Section 5, and to the widows of certain other deceased members of the Royal Irish Constabulary.</P>
    <P>The Bill authorises the grant of pensions, allowances or gratuities&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  To men who retired from the Royal Irish Constabulary with gratuities on the plea of ill-health, but whose retirement was, in fact, in the opinion of the Committee of Inquiry, caused by national sympathies.</P>
    <P>(b)  To the widows of men who die while in receipt of pensions granted under the new Act or under the earlier Act of 1923, and to the widows of men who would, but for their death, have been granted pensions under one or other of these enactments.</P>
    <P>Under (a) above, in fact, pensions only will be paid.  These pensions will commence from the passing of this Act.  The scale of pensions will be that laid down in the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924.  The annual charge for such pensions will be at most between £2,000 and £2,500.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> Under (b) above, a widow's pension will commence from the date up to which pension was last paid in advance to her husband.  Otherwise, a widow's pension will be paid from the date from which a pension would have been paid to the husband if he had survived&mdash;i.e., in the case of men under the original Act from the 8th August, 1923, and in the case of men coming under the new Act from the date of the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>The rate of pension for the widow of a constable or sergeant will be £30 a year.  Of the 20 pensioners who have died while in receipt of pensions, only five were described as &ldquo;married&rdquo; at the date of their application in 1922.  Assuming all these five cases satisfy the condition of marriage before the man left the Royal Irish Constabulary the cost of pensions would be £150 a year.  The arrears payable are estimated at a lump sum of £450.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of view that Deputy Ruttledge embodies in this amendment was possibly the view that would have been taken a year or two ago.  It is possible that if we were very flush financially we might do it but I do not think that these men have just the same claim as the other resigned and dismissed men.  I do not want to rule men out of the right of pension.  Certainly it was not the intention when the original Bill was being passed to rule these men out of having a pension simply because they succeeded in convincing the R.I.C. authorities that they were suffering from ill-health and succeeded in getting a gratuity. Nevertheless their position is a little different from that of the men who went out and got nothing but simply threw up their positions.  This particular group were trying to have the best of both worlds.  They were trying to make sure to have the best they could out of the R.I.C. in case nothing came of the national movement and consequently, I do not think their claim to absolute equality of treatment with the men who remained on is the same as that of those others who were classified <Col N="1791" /> under the original Act as resigned and dismissed.</P>
      <P>There is a factor&mdash;I do not disguise its importance to my mind in this matter&mdash;and that is to adopt this amendment or anything like it would involve a payment of some £14,000 or so in the present year. We are effecting all sorts of economies which impose hardships on individuals and it seems to me that as these men have not an absolutely water-tight case for precisely equal treatment with the others who took their courage in their hands and also went out without getting a penny I do not think they should be given these pensions.  They will do pretty well if they get their pensions from now on.</P>

These men or others with them who resigned or were dismissed at that time got a definite promise of no less generous terms than the men who remained in the force.  The Minister will find that a large number of cases were not dealt with. Pensions should be given to these men, many of whom are in a stronger position than people who have already got pensions greater than they will get now.  In that way it seems a hardship will be inflicted in many desirable cases.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After the passing of this Act the powers conferred on the Minister and the Minister for Justice by virtue of the provisions of Section 5 (1) of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act shall be exercisable on the recommendations of a Committee consisting of three persons, two of whom shall be nominated by the Minister and one of whom shall be nominated by the organisation known as the `Dismissed and Resigned R.I.C. Organisation.'</P>
      <P>Of the two members of the Committee to be nominated by the Minister one shall be a Barrister of at least five years' standing. The Minister shall have power to make regulations for the conduct of its business by the Committee constituted in accordance with this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Bill was receiving its Second Reading a certain form of Committee was indicated.  I suggested the composition of a certain form of Committee to investigate the claims of those men whose cases were still outstanding.  Seeing that the other proposal that I put before the Minister as regards the Committee of members of the House did not meet with the Minister's approval, I now move an alternative amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the previous Bill dealing with resigned and dismissed R.I.C. was before the Dáil such a Committee was set up to investigate their claims.  As was pointed out in the Second Reading of this Bill, the Committee operated at a time when it was very difficult to get all these cases inquired into, or to get evidence brought before the Committee to get cases investigated in the <Col N="1793" /> way in which they might be investigated now.  Civil strife was in the country at the time, and a large number of these people had no opportunity of putting their cases before the Committee.  As well as that, no particulars were given as to what were the decisions of the Committee in a very large number of cases.  I think it is only fair and reasonable that a Committee such as that which is now proposed by this amendment should be set up to inquire into these cases, to investigate them and to report to the Minister. Two or three members of that Committee will be selected by the Minister himself.  One, a barrister, might be a guide to the Committee in the way of following the regular procedure. I think it is a very reasonable amendment, and one that will make for the more satisfactory and easy operation of this Bill than if every case had to be gone into by the Minister in the way that has been going on for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the principle of the amendment.  The Minister is aware that in the cases of those who felt they were entitled to receive pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1925 a statutory body was set up to investigate the claims of the individuals concerned and in all cases an opportunity to appear before the Board was given.  The same principle, to a certain extent, was included in the Military Service Pensions Act, 1927. A Board consisting of legal men was set up to inquire into the claims of those who had reason to believe that they suffered physically as a result of their activities, both pre-Truce and during service in the National Army.  I do not know whether the Minister will accept or reject this amendment to set up a Committee, one member of which shall be nominated by the organisation known as the Dismissed and Resigned R.I.C. Association.  The Minister may object because there is a demand made for the inclusion of a representative of a particular section.  I felt, after having heard the cases of <Col N="1794" /> certain individuals who put their cases before the original Committee and whose claims were passed by the Committee and eventually turned down by the Minister, that they have not been fairly and justly treated.  I feel that there is a good case, particularly so far as a small section of individuals are concerned, for review of those cases, and, to that extent, I agree with the principle of the amendment moved by Deputy Ruttledge.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will agree to set up some body to investigate the claims of about 50 or 60 persons whose claims were passed by the Committee and who were eventually refused pensions under the Pensions and Superannuation Act of 1923. There is something to be said for a revision of a certain number of the cases, whether it be by the Minister himself, a Departmental Committee or a Committee such as is suggested by Deputy Ruttledge.  I hope that some Committee will be set up and that these cases will be reviewed by a proper body.  I think that proper consideration has not been given to quite a number of cases and, therefore, there is a case for some such Committee as that suggested by Deputy Ruttledge.</P>

In so far as the Committee could go into other cases, not contemplated by this particular Bill, the Minister's point would probably be sound.

      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  First of all, so far as people dealt with under Section 2 are concerned, there is no need for it and it does not arise.  So far as the other applications are concerned, it is true that certain cases <Col N="1796" /> were passed by the Committee and were not afterwards allowed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  A certain number of cases which had been before the Committee were not even examined by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice until recently. There are some cases the examination of which has not yet been completed, but I certainly am not prepared at this stage to agree to setting up a statutory board, and I do not think that any examination that would be any more satisfactory could be carried out by such a committee at this stage than could be carried out departmentally.  I would not be prepared to set up a sort of committee, such as that suggested, which would be able to give a decision which must be acted on.  If I were setting up a committee of that kind, I would simply appoint a legal man and set up a legal tribunal, but not a committee of this sort giving it powers of decision. If it was intended not to give it powers of decision, then, in my opinion, it is not necessary, nor would it be useful at present to have such a committee set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the matter was investigated by a Committee on which there were representatives of the Resigned and Dismissed R.I.C. Association.  There was a Chairman appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs, as he then was; there was a representative of the Department of Home Affairs, a representative of the Department of Finance, and, as I say, two representatives of the Resigned and Dismissed R.I.C. Association. That Committee passed a considerable number of cases.  In a good number of these further investigation revealed additional facts, and, consequently, grounds were found to exist for refusing pensions to individuals whose claims had been passed. In other cases it was decided, as a result of short service, that pensions would not be given, and, except, I think, in one case, men under four years service were not given pensions. A small number of cases which were not before the Committee have come in since and have been <Col N="1797" /> examined in precisely the same way as those which came before the Committee and which were recommended. In one or two cases where it was felt that a man who was rejected by the Committee had not, owing to disturbed conditions of the time, a full opportunity of bringing his case before the Committee, pensions were allowed where they had not been actually passed by the Committee. In general, cases that were turned down by the Committee were not looked at at all.</P>
    <P>As I stated before to Deputy Ruttledge, if there are cases which have not yet been examined, I would be prepared to have them examined departmentally as if they were before the Committee, and I would be prepared, after that examination had been carried through, to deal with them as all other cases were dealt with, but I would have to have some better evidence than that given previously, because there can be no doubt that with the lapse of time evidence has become generally somewhat less reliable.  Men do not recollect so well and, if somebody comes to them and asks them to recollect facts, we are liable to have obliging letters written.  Consequently, it would be necessary to examine these cases a little bit more carefully.  They can be, and ought to be, examined by practically the same machinery that ultimately passed the other cases.  I would not, however, think of letting a Committee loose on all cases turned down. Men whose cases may have been rejected on political grounds before, or whose cases may not have been considered because of their activities, are now getting the same sort of consideration and examination as other people.  They cannot get anything different.  They cannot claim to have the advantage of the support of some special tribunal which other men had not.  It would neither be necessary nor fair to set up some sort of new tribunal at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this proposal to set up a tribunal or one <Col N="1798" /> somewhat similar to that suggested in the amendment.  I do so for two reasons.  In the first instance, I am satisfied that the Minister for Finance should not be expected, and has not the time, to go into cases which Deputies or other people might think call for re-consideration or revision.  On the other hand, I know perfectly well that the original Committee composed, as the Minister for Finance has said, of representatives of the Department of Home Affairs, of the Department of Finance and, for a short period, of the Dismissed and Resigned R.I.C. Association did not consider the claims in an atmosphere of reality. The whole question was considered in a warlike atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had recommendations, character references, and so on, in support of applications for pensions on behalf of A or B.  One individual, for instance, might have come with a recommendation from an old member of the I.R.A., who, in 1922, went into the so-called Irregulars.  Another person, perhaps, had a recommendation from an officer of the I.R.A. who remained neutral, and another individual had a recommendation from an old I.R.A. officer who, perhaps, went into the National Army and was serving with it at the time.  I suggest&mdash;I do not do it with any disrespect to the opinions of the Minister&mdash;that any recommendations coming from individuals who had service with the I.R.A. pre-Treaty, and who went against the Treaty afterwards and fought against the Government, did not count very much, and, perhaps in the long run, prejudiced the Minister in his consideration of those recommended by the Committee.  I will pay this tribute to the Minister for Finance.  I believe that he is the one member of the Ministry who, since the Fianna Fáil members came into the House, has endeavoured to create a better atmosphere.  That fact is proved by the consideration he has given to the claim submitted by Mr. McElligott.  In my opinion, if a Committee had been set up, such as that suggested by Deputy Ruttledge, <Col N="1799" /> with a legal Chairman, the Minister would have had more respect for such a Committee when he considered Mr. McElligott's claim. People may think what they like about the consideration which influenced the Minister eventually to sanction the payment of a pension to Mr. McElligott.  He gave his reasons in the House, and he said that the entry of Fianna Fáil created a different atmosphere and that his own original decision was not based on proper information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the Deputy is wrong.  There was no decision except that none of these cases of men who were believed to be mixed up with the Irregulars should be considered at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the cases of persons who have not received payment of pensions so far, but Mr. McElligott was one of the lucky ones?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise that Mr. McElligott's case was considered by the original Committee and naturally any Committee who knew anything about anybody who had such claims as Mr. McElligott had, would not deny that he was entitled to a pension.  If there is any justification for the payment of pensions under the Superannuation and Pensions Act of 1923, there certainly should be for awarding pensions in the case of the three men who seduced, the R.I.C. from their allegiance, and Mr. McElligott was one of them.  The Minister knows that perfectly well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I think the Minister has touched upon some of them.  The Minister is too busy to be asked to go into the cases of men who feel they have a grievance. I therefore support the amendment proposed by Deputy Ruttledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a difference in my mind and in that of the Minister as to the number of cases.  My impression is that there is a very large number of cases.  The impression the Minister conveyed is that there are very few cases.  If my information is correct there is a considerable number of cases.  It may be that the Minister is thinking of the few cases that make an impression on him as being genuine cases whereas, if other evidence were brought before the Minister, it might transpire that there is a large number of these people who have genuine claims that should be brought before some judicial Committee. If the Minister has any objection to the composition of the Committee, I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment in favour of a judicial Committee, or some judicial body&mdash;let the Minister nominate it&mdash;that will examine and go into these particular cases.  As Deputy Davin pointed out, when the claims of these people were considered before, they were considered in a warlike atmosphere and at a time when many of them could not come forward or were not able to vouch their claims in a way that they would have vouched them at a different time or in a different set of circumstances.  If there was a reason for setting up a Committee then and if there is now a large number of cases or even any considerable number of cases outstanding, it is only reasonable that a Committee should be set up to inquire into them now.  I would be satisfied if some judicial Committee were set up to investigate these claims and let us finish with them once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is probably some confusion about the matter. <Col N="1801" /> I am not asking the Deputy to withdraw his amendment, but I would be prepared, before the next stage of the Bill, whatever happens the amendment, to try to give some information to the Deputy which would satisfy him as to the numbers. My impression is that the number of cases that require reconsideration is very small indeed.  I am not prepared, in cases which were definitely turned down with the consent of the Minister for Justice, after examining all the facts, and in exercise of the discretion given under the previous Act, to re-open these cases at all or to set up any tribunal to re-open them.  There is also a considerable number of those which were passed by the first Committee which have since been rejected, because we were able, by additional evidence that was obtained, to show that the award of pensions was not right.  We were able to show that men were discharged from the R.I.C. for drunkenness and various other reasons, cases that had no political complexion, cases in which it was never suggested that the applicants were in any way associated with the opposite Party, but in which we were satisfied that the applications were improper.  These were properly considered and properly turned down.  I am not prepared to reconsider these cases unless some fresh evidence has come to hand.  There is a great number for which no case can be made, and I am satisfied that no fresh evidence can be brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to have some new set of cases that have not yet come forward or been fully considered, or to allow cases in which there was some political element, to be put to a tribunal which did not deal with the main bulk of the cases. For that reason I am not prepared to agree to set up a tribunal to consider cases which were set aside and were not considered, although reported on by the Committee, because they have been associated with the Irregular forces or were believed to be associated with them.  I am prepared to consider cases which did not come before the Committee and <Col N="1802" /> to have them examined in precisely the same way as if they had been passed by the Committee, cases which did not come up and in which we had good reason for believing a man had not an opportunity of applying.  He might have been in internment, or perhaps something else prevented him from applying.  I am prepared to have these cases considered in the same manner by the Departmental officials as if they had been recommended by the Committee, but if they had not sent in applications the lapse of time does make one rather more doubtful about them.  If the Deputy thinks of this problem in terms of large numbers, probably what has happened is that people who were turned down and who perhaps had no associations with his political Party until recently, have been approaching Deputies of that Party, having done all they could in other directions in previous years, to get their cases re-opened.  I am satisfied that cases which would merit any further consideration are really very small in number.  As I say, independent of the fate of this particular amendment, I would be prepared to see the Deputy with the officials who have been dealing with these cases and at least satisfy him whether he is right or wrong about the numbers, and give him all the information that is available so as to come to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I find a difficulty in putting the question on the amendment, in so far as the amendment applies to cases already decided upon under the Principal Act.  As I read the amendment, it is to create an Advisory Committee to the Minister in the exercise of the power given under Section 2 of the Bill.  That is, of course, absolutely within the scope of the Bill to that extent, but in so far as the amendment, as it is worded, indicates a Committee that is to deal with cases already decided upon, then undoubtedly, <Col N="1803" /> on the point of order, it is outside the scope of the Bill.</P>

I want to ask the Minister if his information is based on hearsay, on verbal conversations that the heads of his Department had with officials of the Colonial Office in London, or if he has on record copies of statements from the Colonial Office showing that these men were dismissed for drunkenness.</P>

    <Title>Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Bill, 1928&mdash;Third Stage.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of Article 52 now contained therein <Col N="1808" /> and the insertion in lieu of the said Article 52 of the following Article that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;52.  The Ministers who form the Executive Council shall include the President of the Council, the Vice-President of the Council, and the Minister in charge of the Department of Finance.  The President of the Council, the Vice-President of the Council, and the Minister in charge of the Department of Finance shall be members of Dáil Eireann and all other members of the Executive Council shall be members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;The President,&rdquo; line 34, to and including the word &ldquo;Oireachtas,&rdquo; line 39, and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President of the Council, the Vice-President of the Council, the Minister in charge of the Department of Finance, and the other members of the Executive Council shall be members of Dáil Eireann save that one of such other members may be a member of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to carry out what I indicated on the Second Reading of the measure I approved of, namely, to remove the bar to appointing, if it were so desired, a member of the Seanad as a member of the Executive Council&mdash;one member only.  This is permissive; it may not be exercised, but it simply removes the bar which has existed up to this, and it permits a member of the Seanad, if the Dáil so approves, to be a member of the Executive Council.  In other words, it limits what was originally proposed.  What was originally proposed was that at least three members of the Executive Council should be members of the Dáil.  Now all the members must be members of the Dáil, but there is a provision, if ever it were so desired, allowing one member of the Seanad to be appointed a member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that not even the modification which is proposed in this amendment to the Bill will induce us to support it.  Like the cities mentioned in Bible history, the promise that the Executive Council cannot be diluted by more than one member of the Seanad will not stave off from them the wrath to come.  I wonder, however, if the reason for the amendment is just what the President has mentioned. There were two objections to the Bill as it originally stood, (1) that it permitted a majority of the Executive Council to be composed of members of the Seanad, and (2) that it permitted a certain individual, who is neither a member of the Seanad nor the Dáil, to become a member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>One can never be sure.  However, it is quite obvious that by this amendment the danger, if there was a danger, has been removed. There can only now be one man, if this amendment is passed&mdash; and I think it is likely to be passed &mdash;in the Executive Council who is not a member of the Dáil.  But why one?  The President appeared to think that there was a strong reason for having members of the Seanad in the Executive Council, and in order to meet certain objections which had been raised it was merely necessary to reduce the number from the number proposed in the Bill to the number proposed in the amendment.  But the President gave us no reason at all in support <Col N="1810" /> of the contention that there should be even one member of the Executive Council a member of the Seanad.  It is true, of course, that on the Second Reading it was pointed out that should the Labour Party come into office they might find it a great advantange to include in their Executive Council a member of the Seanad.  It might also be true that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party believe that the ability, vigour and virility of the Executive Council would be improved by having in it a certain member of the Seanad.  One member of the Seanad has been induced to accept some portfolio.  Who that member is has been worrying me all day.  I cannot possibly think of a single member of the Seanad who deserves this promotion.  There is a Senator&mdash;perhaps I would not be in order&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the gentleman whom it was intended to promote came from Donegal.  He is the only member of the Seanad who, in my opinion, has that style of oratory and that concise manner of putting a case in which the members of the Executive Council excel.  I thought that that Senator whom I have possibly indicated was the person in mind.  I would be very glad to be assured that that is not so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  We hope to make this Dáil of some use to the country, and it can only be made of use if we are to have serious debate on all questions that come before us.  I do very strongly fear that if that particular Senator were added to the members of the Executive Council who delight in turning the Dáil into a bear garden, then the chances of serious constructive work being done here would be very considerably lessened.  The Executive Council must have some person in mind when they actually go to <Col N="1811" /> the trouble of introducing a Bill to amend the Constitution, the fundamental law of the State, in order to permit one member of the Seanad to become a member of the Executive Council.  They must have strong reasons for doing so.  We know that they do not think much of the Constitution really, no matter what they may say during election times, and a mere amending Bill is a matter of no consequence to them.  But even the expense of printing the Bill must have been considered before it was decided to introduce it.</P>
      <P>Is there a single member of the Seanad whose inclusion in the Executive Council would justify the cost of printing this Bill?  I cannot think of one.  Perhaps the President would enlighten us on the point.  Of course, I am now excluding from consideration the six just men to whom I already had occasion to make reference, like the cities in Bible history.  But six just men do not redeem the Seanad.  I think it is extremely unlikely that the Executive Council would be thinking of any one of these six individuals as a colleague in the Executive Council.  It must be some one of the remaining fifty-four, and there is not a single one of the remaining fifty-four capable, in my opinion, of acting as a member of the Dáil, much less as a member of the Executive Council, although I will admit that it is possibly easier to get members of the Executive Council than it is to get members of the Dáil; the standard of knowledge and ability is not so high, and the entrance examination is possibly easier.  I would like, however, to get the information as to whom the Executive Council have in mind. They come here, produce a Bill, and put that Bill before us, they ask us to pass it, and they succeed in getting it a Second Reading.  Then they come to amend it&mdash;possibly they had the amendment in mind all the time&mdash;and we find that the whole purpose of the Bill is to enable one member of the Seanad to be brought into the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much straighter, much <Col N="1812" /> fairer and better to say: &ldquo;We think that Senator X., Senator Y or Senator Z is the man on whom the fate of the country depends.  If we get him in as Minister for anything, or as Minister for everything, we will be able to solve all the problems that have heretofore baffled us.&rdquo;  If that is the case let us know.  If it is merely to provide for some possible contingency, the contingency that someone might be elected to the Seanad who was capable of acting in a ministerial office, I think this Bill is useless, and that it was only wasting the time of the Dáil to have brought it before us, because it is extremely likely that, by the time any vacancy will arise in the Executive Council to be filled, the Seanad will not be there at all.  I read in last Sunday's edition of the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; that there is likely to be a General Election this summer. If that should happen, we can see the end of the life of the Seanad; it disappears before the end of the year, in which case probably this Bill will have proved so much waste of energy.  Not that very much energy was displayed, either in its introduction or in the manner of its presentation, because it was very listlessly placed before the House, as if the Executive Council was not enthusiastic about it, but then I can understand that the President cannot be enthusiastic about any of his colleagues.  I would ask the President, as a matter of courtesy, to tell us what is behind this.  There is obviously something behind it, and we would very much like to know what it is, if for no other reason than to satisfy our curiosity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The President is not to be congratulated on the way in which he has handled this Bill to amend the Constitution.  I quite agree with what Deputy Lemass has said, that the amending of the Constitution ought to be a serious matter and ought to be treated as such.  I am afraid that this amendment&mdash;one of sixteen or seventeen&mdash;has not been so treated. The President put this Bill before us last week and said he would <Col N="1813" /> recommend it to the House as it stood.  I think he said he would leave it to a free vote of the House. But the official Whips were put on for the Division, and of course that was a sign to all of his Party who had not heard his declaration that they had to follow him and that they should not worry about exercising their own judgment with regard to it.  Listening to the President on that occasion, it struck me that he did not mind very much whether the Bill was defeated or not on the Second Reading.  The House passed the Second Reading in the way that I have indicated, and now the President comes forward with this amendment. I was rather expecting the Chair to rule the amendment out as being contrary to the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point to me is that because the operative section of the Bill is amended, and the long Title is amended consequentially, the amendments are outside the principle of the Bill.  I could not rule in his favour on that showing.  If the Deputy would put to me a point of order to the effect that there is a particular principle in the Bill and that the amendments are contrary to that principle, then I would give a ruling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That at least one member of the Seanad ought to be eligible for nomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President mean that out of sixty members there should be only one eligible? Does he mean that he or some future President would like to have one member of the Seanad on the Executive Council?  As Deputy Lemass has said, the President has not given us any reason why that should be so, or what particular advantage it would be to the administration of the nation's affairs.  That is the kind of argument I would like to have heard <Col N="1815" /> from the President on the particular merits of this measure.  As regards my own view, I believe that people who are on the Executive Council ought to be people who would submit themselves, or be forced to submit themselves, at stated periods, to the people for election.  Otherwise we might have the position that there would be a Senator who would have a nine years' period of office, and he would be put into a position on the Executive Council, and possibly be given an unpleasant task as a member of the Executive Council, because he would not have to submit himself for election to the country for at least nine years.  Possibly that is what the President has in mind.  If it is not, I would like to hear from him what exactly he has in mind. My view is that every member of the Executive Council ought to be in the position of having to submit himself at stated periods for election; he should be obliged to go before the electorate and experience their approval or their disapproval of his actions as a Minister.</P>

It occurred to me there is a peculiar situation in Kerry and that the constituency there might not be considered very safe.  One way out of the difficulty would be to put the Minister for Education into the <Col N="1816" /> Seanad instead of attempting the impossible task of finding someone in the Seanad fit for promotion to the Executive Council.  The same would apply to other Ministers.  Quite a number of them would be only too glad to get transferred to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Or possibly there is a spirit of revolt in the Seanad at the prospect of seven members of the Executive Council being obtruded into that body.  I think this Bill is an exemplification of the old adage that second thoughts are better.  I suggest that possibly, in view of the amendment which the President has introduced, he might go further and say that succeeding thoughts might be best and, in view of the manner in which he has proposed to limit representation of the Seanad in the Executive Council, he might be disposed to withdraw the Bill.  I listened to the speech of Deputy O'Connell and I must say that I did not appreciate altogether the force of it.  I noticed that he was <Col N="1817" /> endeavouring to find some germ of principle in this Bill upon which he could base a point of order.  All I have to say with regard to that is that not only this Bill, but the whole series of Bills which preceded it, are absolutely bad and devoid of principle. They are the very stultification of constitutional principle, if constitutional principle ever existed in the minds of the Executive Council. They are the outcome of a colossal bargain, something that was conceived in a dark corner, and the Principal Bills which have gone through have torn up the Constitution as it was originally put to the people of this country.</P>
      <P>This Bill is no different from the others.  I think it would require a microscope to see principle in this or any of the other Bills.  I wonder what purpose the President has in mind in desiring to introduce a member of the Seanad into the Executive Council, because I take it that he is only preparing the way in this Bill for future action.  I do not know.  He, of course, knows the composition and the personalities of his own Executive Council best.  He will therefore be able to tell the House, in attempting to bring in a Senator, whether he desires to temper it with wisdom or to vitiate it with folly.  I cannot see that any member of the Seanad, with notable exceptions&mdash;those who, because of their own political principles, would not be included in the present Executive Council&mdash;could temper that body with wisdom, and I certainly cannot see that any Senator would vitiate it with folly, because its folly is at present all-sufficient.  I say that because of what it has been doing during the past twelve months, and their repercussions on the electors, as Deputy Byrne reminded us last night, show us there is no limit to the political folly of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I would like to stress the point, and I ask the President to justify his proposal to the House. As has been said by Deputy O'Connell, the members of the Seanad, <Col N="1818" /> are, on the whole, irresponsible people.  Most of them, and particularly those who have been elected by the Government, are there because of the past services which they have rendered to a Party.  We made an attempt, I must say, to galvanise the Seanad into life by the return of a number of Senators who would endeavour to serve the nation in the capacity we have enforced upon them.  But I must say that we would not be responsible for this Bill; we would not have introduced a Bill of this sort.  We do not believe that the Seanad should have any representation whatever in the Executive Council or should be in any way responsible for shaping the policy in the State, beyond such in fluence as they may exert in the course of discussions.  We would like to know what is the purpose of the Government in making these persons, who are mainly, so far as the Government's actions in the Seanad are concerned, irresponsible superannuitants&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking what is their purpose in trying to make one of these people responsible for shaping the policy of the country. I cannot see any justification for it. The members of the Seanad are irresponsible. They have never to come before the people to ask the people either to endorse or to reject the policy to which they have given shape.  Therefore I submit that they have no title or right to sit in what is the High Council of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any reason for this amendment, or indeed for the Bill itself.  It seems to me that the Executive Council has ample powers to put its views before the Seanad.  If there is any limitation upon the powers of the Executive Council to send members to the Seanad to represent their views, it would be a different matter. <Col N="1819" /> If there is any obstacle in their way that would prevent them doing that, then there might be some reason for having a member of the Seanad on the Executive Council to represent the views of the Executive Council in the Seanad. But it seems to be an extraordinary insult to the dignity of this House to give the right to one who is not a member of this House to attend and to speak in this House.  It seems to me to be a blow at the dignity of a representative assembly, at an assembly of the people elected by the people of Ireland, that someone should come into this House, have the power to address this House and take part in the proceedings&mdash;one who is not a member of the House.  That is really a blow at representative institutions, such as they are.  The only basis upon which we in this House stand is as representatives of the people, and the introduction of this measure is shaking the very basis of this House and the constitution of this House.  It is introducing an element into it which is vitiating it and vitiating the whole principle of representative government.  One is at a loss to know what is the reason of it.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass has pointed out, it is difficult to think that there is anybody in the Seanad who can add weight to the present Executive Council.  We must search and see what is the reason.  Is it a symptom of the growing power of a certain section in this country which has always been out of touch with the aims and aspirations of the Irish people?  Is it a further development in the direction of a paralysis of the life of the country and a paralysis of its march towards nationality?  I want to know these things.  We are forced, much against our wills, to attribute evil motives&mdash;I do not like to attribute evil motives to anybody&mdash;we are forced to think that this is a development away from democracy and from the national aspirations of the people.</P>

      <Col N="1820" /> I think it is a grave insult to this House that any proposition of that kind should be put up here permitting anybody who is not a representative of the Irish people to address this House.</P>

      <P>I have not got a copy of the Constitution with me.  Might I ask the President a question?  Is Deputy Little right when he says that if a member of the Seanad were a member of the Executive Council he would have a right to address the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consequential amendment to that effect in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 2 amends Article 57 of the Constitution.  Now, Article 57 of the Constitution says that every Minister shall have the right to attend and be heard in Seanad Eireann.  Amendment 2 amends that.  If you refer back to the long Title of the Bill you will see: &ldquo;and by making consequential provision in the Constitution as to the right of attendance and audience of Ministers at and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection may I point out again that the House may appoint a Minister who is not a member of this House and who is not a member of the Seanad?  The House may appoint such a person a Minister.  Am I to understand if the House did that that they would not give him permission to address the House?  The Constitution makes provision already for the House to take a step of that kind and to appoint a man as Minister who is neither a member of this House nor of the Seanad.  The Deputy seems to forget that altogether. So far as this amendment is concerned we are discussing whether you will have the number in the Bill restricted to one.</P>
