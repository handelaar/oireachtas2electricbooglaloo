      <P>I do not intend to interrupt Public Business to-day.  I propose to allot Thursday next for a discussion on Item No. 10 on the Order Paper and all matters affecting that, and to give Deputy O'Hanlon time on Wednesday, but not the whole of Private Members' time, for the discussion of his motion which appears as No. 9 on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>It is, therefore, proposed to take Item No. 1 to-day, and when that is disposed of to take the Estimates.  Item No. 9 on the Order Paper will be taken in Private Members' time on Wednesday, and it is proposed to take Item No. 10&mdash;the motion with regard to a tariff on imported flour&mdash;on Thursday in Government time.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Report of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business) discharging Deputy Lemass from the Joint Committee on the Bank of Ireland Bill, 1929, and substituting Deputy O'Hanlon in his stead, do lie upon the Table.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much on this Motion to-day, as I explained the Committee's position at some length on the last occasion that the motion was before the House.  I want to say that, if Deputy de Valera's suggestion, or the suggestion of the Fianna Fáil Party, that Parties should have the right to nominate members to serve on Private Bill Committees were given effect to, or that if an <Col N="2256" /> attempt were to be made to give effect to it, it would mean that the procedure which has been followed by the Committee from its inception would have to be altered very considerably, and that the Standing Orders relating to Private Bills would also have to be altered very considerably.  In fact, I think that the Joint Committee on Private Bill Standing Orders could hardly function at all, and it would seem to me that in that case Private Bill Committees would have to be selected by the Selection Committees of the Dáil and Seanad respectively.  Consequently it would be, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, almost impossible to get the type of committee which they feel is essential to have if Private Bills are to be dealt with in a proper way.  It is understood, of course, that the opposition to this motion has no reference whatever to Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this motion.  The attitude taken up by the Joint Committee on Standing Orders is one that we cannot stand for.  We see no reason why this particular Joint Committee on Standing Orders relating to Private Bills should not be composed in the same way and selected in the same way as other Committees of this House are selected.  After all, when a Private Bill comes finally to be considered by a Committee what is it?  It is supposed to be a Committee of this House.  To do what?  To do for a Private Bill largely what we do in Committee of the Whole House in the case of a Public Bill.  It is only right that any Party in this House, particularly a Party that is over one-third of its strength, should have on the Committee examining a Private Bill a representative acting on behalf of the Party.  We have no other means in the case of a Private Bill of following the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested in this particular case that because some of us spoke against this particular Bill that we were, by that fact, to be excluded from being on the Committee appointed to consider it.  It might as well be said that because <Col N="2257" /> we speak on the Second Reading of a Public Bill here, and speak strongly against it, that we should be excluded from the examination of that Public Bill on the Committee Stage.  We may have made up our minds to oppose on the Second Reading the general principle of a Public Bill, but we take part in the Committee Stage of that Public Bill and oppose it finally when we think that all possible amendments that could be made to it are made.  What is our object in taking part in the Committee Stage?  Clearly our object is this, that if we object to a Bill, we have reasons for doing so; because we think it will be harmful in the general interest, and because we want to make it as little harmful, so to speak, and as little injurious to the public interest as possible. Therefore, we put down amendments to it and try to get them carried.  The same thing holds in the case of a Private Bill.  In regard to this particular Private Bill we have indicated, some of us, that on account of the general nature of the Bill we are likely to object to it even when the amendments that we think possible within the general scope of the Bill have been made. We think that, in the public interest, it is our duty to see that in the Committee Stage any amendments that can be introduced will be introduced to make the Bill as little harmful as possible.  That is our position.</P>
    <P>With regard to Private Bills in general, we therefore hold that a Committee set up to examine a Private Bill ought to be fairly representative of the House, and to get a representative committee the same procedure ought to be adopted as is adopted for other committees.  The procedure in regard to other committees is that on the Selection Committee you have representatives of the different parties, and when a selection of members has to be made, representatives of the different parties nominate, and as a rule, the nominations are accepted.  I do not know that it has ever been held that the Committee of Selection could not refuse to take nominations from the <Col N="2258" /> representatives of any party, but it has not in practice ever been done. Common sense dictates that the simplest way to get a representative committee is to have the Selection Committee representative of all parties, and to have it understood as a working rule that the nominees of the representatives on that committee of the different parties will be accepted.  That is our position with regard to this particular Joint Committee. We had a representative on it, and we expected that representative when a selection was being made of members, would have the right to nominate on behalf of our Party such members as he thought would serve on that committee.</P>
    <P>If that rule is not adopted several things are going to follow.  In the first place, you are going to have members chosen who may be unable or unwilling to serve for one reason or another, so that you will have finally no guarantee that the members chosen are prepared to serve. Again, the representatives of the different parties in general will have a better knowledge of the members of its own Party who have the particular qualifications or knowledge that may make them useful members of that committee.  I, for one, cannot accept the principle that this is to be a judicial committee in the ordinary sense.  It can be a judicial committee only in the sense in which we are all acting in a judicial capacity judging of the public interests in this House when we vote, and in the case of a Bill of this kind that relates in general to the public interest, we believe that all parties that are interested should be represented on the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>There are in these Standing Orders certain safeguards with regard to Private Bills affecting certain public services.  There are special regulations with regard to railways, and so on.  In other words, here we have an admission in the Standing Orders that Private Bills that may impinge in any way on the general interests have to be subject to certain rules.  I find no rules dealing with matters of such tremendous economic importance <Col N="2259" /> as banks.  There are no such rules to safeguard the community as against private interests.  In the case of railways we have rules to that effect.  In this Bill it is essential that the public interests should be safeguarded by having members of this House who are here in a public capacity fairly represented on that Committee.  Our members, for instance, would try to get certain amendments if we had representatives of our Party.  If we thought them useful, in the public interests we would try to have these amendments carried, and that would do away with a considerable portion of the objection there is at present to this Bill.  It will probably be argued that you have one of the Standing Orders here on these Private Bills to the effect that anybody who is personally interested in a particular Bill should not be a member of the Committee. It goes further than that by laying it down that a member from a constituency that is affected should not be represented.  I for one would not stand for that principle if we were considering it from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very good reason why the representative of an area which is particularly affected by a Private Bill should be on the Committee. He would be only one member. Certainly that particular interest should not be predominantly represented, but I see no reason at all why, for instance, if there is a Bill dealing with some special area, say, ports and docks, or some Bill dealing with the constituency of Dundalk, the representative of that particular area should not be on the Committee.</P>
    <P>He would have a better knowledge of the particular circumstances than other members will have, just as in this House the members who take part in the Committee Stages most actively are generally the members who evince most interest from the beginning in the Bill in question.  They have made a particular study of it and have special knowledge of it.  I think there is to be a good deal to be said for <Col N="2260" /> applying that principle to a Private Bill.  I think I have indicated our attitude.  I think it is in the power of the Ceann Comhairle to accept a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in respect of any Bill if he thinks it a matter of sufficient urgency.  The general principle, if the House wishes, can be discussed on another occasion, but the immediate matter can be discussed by suspending Standing Orders.  If the Ceann Comhairle were prepared to accept it, I would move the suspension of the Standing Orders in relation to this particular Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this, but I say there may be a question of urgency with respect to this Bill so as not to put the promoters of the Bill to inconvenience or expense. There is a definite way of getting a Committee for this particular Bill without dealing with the particular question as to the composition of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders for Private Bills. or the general principle of what the representation on Joint Committees for the examination of Private Bills should be.  The general principle could be discussed later if the House thinks it wise, but if it should be objected that in this particular case there is urgency to get this Committee so as to save the promoters further expense or anything of that kind, that could be met by the suspension of Standing Orders so as to allow proportional representation of the various parties on this Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill undoubtedly has a character of its own, a very special character, as it affects the public interest more, perhaps, than Private Bills usually do.  I am opposing the motion, and if the objection is that an awkward situation will be created, I say there is a way out of it, that the Ceann Comhairle has discretion to allow the suspension of <Col N="2261" /> the Standing Orders so as to have fair representation.  If the number of our members in the Seanad and of our members here is counted, we are entitled, on a committee of seven, to two, and on this Bill the proposition is that our Party, which is entitled to two members out of a committee of seven, is to have no representation at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has explained at some length his opposition to the present procedure, and I think it would be advisable that a short description should be given of the usage and practice which has been observed for the past few years. When it became necessary to establish a procedure for Private Bills, a preliminary draft of Standing Orders was prepared by the responsible officers of the Oireachtas, and this draft was submitted for consideration to an informal committee, in the summer of 1923, consisting of the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Attorney-General, Deputy G. Fitzgibbon, K.C., and the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Following upon this a Joint Committee of both Houses was set up to deal with the matter.  To this Committee, Government Departments were invited to send in recommendations. In December, 1923, the Committee reported finally, and the Standing Orders framed by them were adopted as the Standing Orders of both Houses jointly.  Here I should emphasise that the primary purpose aimed at was to provide a tribunal before which promoters of Private Bills could make their case, to render the cost of Private Bill promotion as reasonable as possible, and at the same time to provide a simple procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure is that the Second Stage of a Private Bill having been passed in the Seanad, the Bill is brought into this House to have the principle accepted, so that the promoters would not be put to the expense of getting their Bill through in one House, with the possibility of defeat in the other House; and Joint Committees on Bills are provided for, so as to avoid the expense to the <Col N="2262" /> promoters of two separate Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned that he did not exactly subscribe to the view. that this should be a judicial committee, that we are in essence here a judicial body in respect of other Bills.  It must be admitted, and I think the Deputy will agree, that there are protagonists and antagonists to most measures introduced, and I think the Deputy will agree that it is rather difficult for a person to occupy at the same time the position of antagonist or protagonist and that of a judge.</P>
    <P>There have been only two occasions upon which the Government have found it necessary, as a matter of public policy, to intervene in connection with Private Bills.  Acting on the suggestion of the Ceann Comhairle as to the most appropriate stage on which to state fundamental objections to a Private Bill, the Government recommended the Dáil not to agree to the setting up of a Joint Committee on the Merrion Square Bill.  The reason for the choice on that occasion was obvious, to prevent the expense and waste of public time involved in an investigation by a Committee, examination of witnesses, appearance of counsel, etc., on a Bill which would be subsequently rejected by the Dáil.  The Bill was subsequently withdrawn. In the case of the Port and Docks Bill, the Government raised an objection on the same stage, which was followed up by an inquiry and the incorporation of new proposals in the Bill before it went to Committee.</P>
    <P>Apart from their action in these two cases the Government have not concerned themselves with the manner in which Private Bill procedure is carried out.  The Government have never raised any point as to the personnel of Committees on Private Bills, nor, as I have said, as to the manner in which they have functioned. They rely on the Joint Committee on Standing Orders to nominate the members most suited to serve on Committees.  As respects committee work, they are aware&mdash; and I stress this aspect of that matter&mdash;that the Standing Orders <Col N="2263" /> oblige Government Departments, in the protection of public rights, to report where necessary on any Bill going through, and in that way to acquaint the two Houses and the Committee on the Bill of any proposals in the Bill which conflict with public interests or represent an unjustifiable departure from the ordinary law.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that from its introduction Private Bill procedure has been free from Party associations and, so far as I have studied it, its whole character discourages the entry of the Party point of view.  The composition of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders, including as it usually does the Deputy Chairman of each House; the judicial functions which it fulfils, giving it a stamp altogether different to that of the Committee of Selection provided for in the Standing Orders relative to public business; the judicial character of the committees it sets up; the provision that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle shall move in his official capacity all stages of Private Bills; all these circumstances are clear indication that this procedure was intended to be non-Party in its operation.  If any other view is to prevail, if it be held by this House that Private Bill Committees are to be composed on a Party basis, then I say deliberately that Private Bill procedure will cease to command public respect and public confidence. One has only to look a little way ahead to see difficulties of a situation such as that.  The function of promoters will no longer be to state a reasonable case, before what could fairly be regarded by them as a reasonably minded body of men, and to await a fair judgment on the case. Their aim will be to devise how best they can secure support from Parties in the House, viewed according to their numerical strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what the President has said, and while I agree that it would be a wise procedure to adopt in connection with measures which could be fairly described as Private Bills, I submit it <Col N="2264" /> is questionable whether Private Bill procedure should have been adopted in connection with this measure. After all, this is a Bill which proposes to enlarge the powers of a great financial institution, which can exercise, and which does exert a considerable influence over the whole economic life of the community.  A Bill of that sort certainly does touch the public interest at every point, and for that reason I say that it is questionable whether the facilities afforded to Private Bills should have been extended to this measure at all.</P>
      <P>The original Bank of Ireland Bill which it is proposed to amend was not introduced as a Private Bill; it was introduced into the Irish House of Commons as a Government measure. I contend that this Bill should have been introduced in that form, and that it should have been open to this House to discuss it as such.  In view of that, I suggest that, apart altogether from the principle involved, those who are promoting the Bill ought to consider what their future is likely to be, if the reasonable requirements of one of the largest Parties in the House in regard to the constitution of the Committee before which that Bill is to come are disregarded.  We do hold, and we have very definitely stated our position in this matter, that in view of the fact that this Bill will react upon every section of the community, we are entitled, if the Bill is to be afforded the facilities of an ordinary Private Bill, to see that the Judicial Committee, or whatever committee it is&mdash;in this case I can hardly think it will be a Judicial Committee&mdash;to which the Bill is referred from this House should be constituted in such a way that the reasonable demands of every section of the House should be satisfied, and that is what we are contending for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee in which this difference of opinion arose, I have already explained the position from my personal point of view, but it is just as well for me to refer to it again.  The moment I mentioned the names of <Col N="2265" /> two people&mdash;a Deputy and a Senator&mdash;to be put on the Committee as representing a Party in this House which constitutes more than one-third of the House, straight away the point was raised that as these two persons had both taken part in the discussions on the Bill and had taken sides, they should therefore not be allowed to sit upon the Committee. Of course, that might have been said about anybody in either House, because votes had been taken on the matter, and everybody who had voted had taken sides.  The Party Whips were on.  The Bill was, in a sense, almost a Government measure; the Government were deeply committed to it.  If the practice was not adopted of turning it into a public measure, then, at least, if the Government was to show evidence of bona fides in the matter, it should have allowed proportional representation on the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the President's statement of his attitude. Because we have got away from the whole principle of proportional representation, upon which the existence of this House depends, this Committee is turned into a hole-and-corner Committee.  We are to be reduced to the position of a number of officials to serve on committees for the benefit of private interests. That is what it amounts to. A few powerful private corporations think that they can dictate to this House.  Private Bill procedure here has been adopted from the British House of Commons.  I do not say that the principle has been adopted in globo, but the general principle of giving facilities to private interests has been adopted from the British House of Commons.  The origin was in a petition; it arose from a petition on the part of certain private interests for certain privileges from the House of Commons; that is to say, that private individuals came to public representatives, as public representatives, and said to <Col N="2266" /> them: &ldquo;May we do this?  May we do that?  May we interfere with other private interests, and how far will you allow us certain privileges, having regard all the time to the public interests?&rdquo; And yet when this matter comes up here we are asked to turn the whole thing into a purely private concern, and we are to be servants to facilitate these interests, as experts, if you please, as judicial persons, we who are here because we are not judicial persons, we who are here as Parties committed to sets of principles which we want to see asserted in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has arisen in a very acute manner over this Bank of Ireland Bill, because the whole question of banking is becoming more and more one in which the public are getting more deeply interested. They are more deeply convinced that banking is a matter of public policy, and that it should not be treated as a matter of private policy. It is a matter upon which different Parties disagree and on which they have different sets of principles which they wish to apply.  Further than that, in this matter the Bank of Ireland is in a very privileged position.  It is as near as possible to being an official bank; it has the fullest and the closest connection with the Government.  Therefore, not merely on the general principle but on the particular, this question is one which involves very large public interests, and I submit that if the Government will not facilitate the treatment of this measure as a public measure, at least they should facilitate this House in being the master of itself and the master of the country, because, after all, the theory of Government is that the House is the Government and that the Executive Council is a committee of the House. As part of that Government we are entitled on a measure like this to have our full say, but no more than we are entitled to under proportional representation, and if the Government is not willing to deal with the matter as a public measure, then at least they should facilitate us in moving that the Standing Orders be <Col N="2267" /> suspended and that the Committee be selected frankly on the basis of proportional representation.  As for the suggestion that private interests would in future come to this House to look for its suffrages and to look for privileges, and that they would have to consider the numbers in this House, that is a suggestion in reference to the Bank of Ireland which, if it came from our benches, would meet with at least extremely hostile criticism.  It suggests that the Bank of Ireland would have to have recourse to graft in connection with political parties.  That suggestion has not come from our benches.  I will conclude by saying that we should be here either in our capacity as public representatives, applying principles in the public interest, or else we should not be here at all. But the idea of taking us out of our setting and of suddenly making us judges, completely apart from the life of the nation, is absurd and is repugnant to the whole principle of representative government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker does not seem to be able to get away from the Party outlook at all.  For example, this is not a Government matter in any way.  I think I am right in saying that the Committee which took this action has not a single Cumann na nGaedheal representative on it.  Deputies have other duties and other functions besides to have a regard to Party interests. They ought to be able to look at some matters from the point of view of the whole people of the country, and not alone from the point of view of the particular section that they represent, and I think that the action of this Committee is just one of these matters which calls for a broad outlook instead of a narrow one.  After the very lucid statement that the President gave us I do not think it is necessary to say very much, but I would like to make one or two remarks, as one who has been a member of this Committee, with a small hiatus, from its inception.  I corroborate entirely what the President has said as to the actions of that <Col N="2268" /> Committee ever since its inception. Within my recollection it has tried to appoint on Private Bill Committees Deputies who would be able to look at the matters that were brought before them impartially and without any undue regard to Party interests. I do not say that the fact that there were different Parties in the House was entirely ignored by that Committee in the choice of members, but I do say that no one in my recollection has ever been chosen to serve on a committee because he belonged either to the majority Party or a minority Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person was chosen as a member, in coming to look for the second or third person, it might have been said that the first person belonged to one party, and it might have been asked whether or not there was one in another party equally qualified to serve on the committee, but that anybody should be chosen just because he belonged to one party has, I think, never occurred.  It seems to me that the opposition to the motion arises from a misapprehension of the facts.  If any Bill seems to a particular section of the House to conflict with party interests it can be stopped at two different stages.  It can be stopped from going to the Joint Committee, as the President pointed out, or, if the things in it that are objectionable to that section of the House remain after the Committee Stage, it can again be stopped when it comes back on Report to the House.  The functions of the House as a whole with regard to the public interests are adequately met by these two opportunities of rejecting a Bill in toto.  In so far as public interests are concerned, during the procedure in Committee, they are, I think, under the Standing Orders, amply secured by the attention of the different departments of the State having to be drawn to particular parts of the Bill which do affect public interests.  But the Private Bill Committee's function is something quite different and quite limited.  In the main, it is to see that, in so far as it is a Private Bill, the promoters in trying to secure these private interests do not <Col N="2269" /> interfere with other private interests, and the Committee has to weigh up one private interest against another.  It is only in that limited sense that this is actually a Committee Stage of the Bill, and that, I think, does not interfere in the slightest with the control of this House over the Bill, if it seems to be a Bill likely to interfere with general public interests.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay in proving what seems to be a matter which really does not require proof, but it does seem important to say, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pointed out, that the very existence of this Private Bill Standing Orders Committee, with the power to choose members, in addition to the Selection Committee, shows a recognition of the principle that a Private Bill Committee in reference to a Private Bill ought to be chosen on a totally different principle from that which the Selection Committee adopt with reference to the choice of a Committee of this House.  I hope the House will endorse the opinion taken by the Private Bill Committee on this matter and enable them to act in future, as they have in the past, in trying to secure impartially those who are the most likely to give a reasoned opinion on the matters that come before them.  If they do not, I am completely in agreement with the President that the whole confidence in Private Bill Committees will be shattered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift accuses Deputies on this side with not being able to get away from the Party attitude in a matter of this kind.  The fact is, of course, that Deputies on this side refuse to shut their eyes to facts as Deputy Thrift apparently is prepared to do.  Everyone here was elected because he represents a particular point of view, and every Deputy appointed to serve on a particular Private Bill Committee is here as a public representative supporting a particular point of view and as nothing else. Let us face that fact.  Deputy McDonogh has been appointed a member of this Committee.  He was <Col N="2270" /> elected to represent Cumann na nGaedheal in the County Galway and not as a Judge or an expert in banking practice.  We were elected to represent another point of view, and it is not parties but points of view we are concerned with in the appointing of persons to serve upon committees of this kind.</P>
      <P>I do not think that impartiality should enter into the matter.  I think that any Deputy on this side of the House can be trusted to be as impartial in a matter of this kind as Deputy Thrift or any other Deputy. I do not think there is any Deputy that any one of us believes to be absolutely impartial in relation to this Bill.  Objection has been taken to Deputy de Valera as a member of the Committee because he spoke against the Bill.  Deputy de Valera spoke against the Bill because he was a leader of a party in this House holding one particular point of view.  If the debate had not been curtailed in point of time, other Deputies would have spoken, and possibly I would have spoken. But it is extraordinary that the Committee seemed to think that I was a fit and proper person to serve on the Committee and that Deputy de Valera was not.  They appointed me to serve on it, and they refused to appoint Deputy de Valera.  I maintain that I am no more impartial than Deputy de Valera or Deputy McDonogh.  There was a vote taken on the Bill, and Deputy McDonogh went into one Lobby and I went into another along with Deputy de Valera.  The Government Whips were on, and every member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who obeyed that Whip voted on the Bill and, therefore, cannot possibly be considered impartial. Every person who voted on it, either in this House or in the Seanad, cannot be considered impartial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to get an impartial committee.  I remember about this time last year we were discussing a motion to set up a judicial tribunal to inquire into a certain shooting which took place in Dublin, and in my name there <Col N="2271" /> was an amendment to appoint a committee of the House instead. Every single Minister ridiculed the idea of a committee of this House carrying out a judicial or semi-judicial function, and pointed out how absolutely impossible it was to get an impartial committee that could examine questions of fact and report upon the facts without being influenced by party considerations. It is no more possible to get an impartial committee to consider a Bill of this kind than it was to get a committee to consider a matter of that kind then.</P>
    <P>Deputies should realise that this Bill which this Committee is to examine is something more than an ordinary Private Bill.  If a Private Bill is, as Deputy Thrift describes it, merely introduced when certain private interests propose to take action that might conflict with other private interests, then this Bank of Ireland Bill does not come within that definition.  Deputies will recollect that Deputy de Valera opposed the Bill in this House on the ground of public policy, because, as he said, he objected to piecemeal legislation in respect of banking control, and the very fact that the Government did not oppose the Bill makes it a matter of great public importance.  If they contemplated introducing legislation to alter the present method of controlling banking, they would have opposed the Bill, but the fact that they did not oppose it is, in itself, an indication of the line of policy being taken. The particular Bill to which we are referring does not, I think, conflict with other private interests as much as it conflicts with public interests, and it is because it conflicts with public interests we are opposed to it.  We do not think that that Bill deals with the public interest in a proper manner, and I think it is well at this stage that it should be indicated to the promoters of the Bill that we regard it as a public measure, and if it is forced through this House in this manner by a Party majority it will not be immune from repeal or amendment, if at any time <Col N="2272" /> we consider that repeal or amendment to be in the public interest. Before they go to the expense of putting that Bill through the Committee it is well that they should realise that fact.</P>
    <P>The President was talking about the difficulty of any Deputy acting as an antagonist or protagonist and judge at the same time.  I strongly contend that it is not the function of any Deputy to act as a judge in any matter.  Deputies are elected here to represent points of view. They go upon these Special Committees holding points of view.  If we are not here as public representatives, what are we here as?  It is as public representatives that we fulfil every function attaching to membership of this House.  It is as public representatives and public representatives only that Deputies are appointed to Private Bill Committees. Deputy McDonagh, Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Davin, or any other Deputy appointed to serve on a Committee goes on to it as a public representative and in no other capacity, and they will act on that Committee knowing that their continued tenure of their position as members of this House will depend very largely upon the view their constituents take of the way they conduct themselves.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter to be taken into consideration that there are in the Seanad, I think, a larger number of Bank of Ireland directors, all of whom voted for this Bill, than there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party there, and, if it is possible for persons personally affected by the passage of the Bill to assist in getting it enacted as a Statute, it should also be possible for those who have no personal interest to serve and who think that the public interests are adversely affected, to take what steps they consider necessary to oppose it or to amend it.  We did not succeed in inducing the House to reject this Bill.  We wish, therefore to be in a position to induce the Special Committee to amend the Bill so as to make it as innocuous as we possibly could.  If we did succeed in making it less harmful in Committee <Col N="2273" /> than it was when originally introduced we would still be free to oppose it on Report Stage, and in any case, we would be free to repeal or amend it when we thought the time opportune, and when we have the power to do it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into the particular matter of this debate on the Bank of Ireland Bill, but I want to point out that it would be extremely unfortunate if the House were to accept the point of view expressed by Deputy Lemass, and expressed a moment or two before by Deputy Little.  Deputy Lemass went so far as to say that it would be impossible to get a judicial committee of this House upon any matter, and Deputy Little ridiculed the suggestion that it was possible to separate judicial from legislative functions</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so then what Deputy Little imagines is that the House has invented an entirely new and extraordinary procedure.  As Deputy Little properly said, we have <Col N="2274" /> in this matter, as in other matters, copied the procedure of the House of Commons.  I do not think he stated the origin of that procedure quite correctly, but let that pass.  I speak as one who has had experience for many years as a member of various Committees on Private Bills and at times as Chairman of such Committees and I say this: it was quite true that it was the practice of the House of Commons&mdash;and in that perhaps we differ from the practice in the House of Commons&mdash;to have regard to the complexion of different parties in appointing committees, not strictly anything like proportional representation or anything of that sort, but there was a tendency when, say, a Private Bill consisted of four and the Conservatives were in office to put on two Conservatives, one Liberal, and possibly one Nationalist or Labour man.  What I want to point out is that although we fought very often very vehemently in the House, when we got into the Committee room I can recall no occasion on which a difference of opinion occurred along party lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was quite a common thing to find perhaps one Irish Nationalist, one Tory and one Labour Member against the other Tory, or possibly a Nationalist and two Tories against the Liberal Member.  We never thought upon Party lines at all, and though we should not be members of the Committee at all unless we were members of the House of Commons, elected on public grounds, yet from the moment we entered the Committee room we were thinking of the particular matters that came before us as a court and not from the point of view of party affiliations.  If at any time it should become the doctrine of this House that we should carry our party affiliations into the matter of Private Bill procedure I think, as the President stated, we shall be taking a very serious step indeed.  It is perfectly obvious that you cannot expect business interests to have the same confidence in a committee which is known beforehand to be guided by party principles as in a committee in which they know that Deputies will come <Col N="2275" /> fresh to the consideration of the matter.  I think it would be an exceedingly evil day if that were ever understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put to Deputy Law this question: whether anyone can hand on a better title than he has got himself?  Now what is the title under which these things go to a Private Bill Committee?  I do not want to be controversial at all in this matter.  I can see the President's point of view and I can see the other point of view, and if it was possible that that point of view could be extended to cover the whole of the administration and legislation in this House I would welcome it and co-operate with it. But I have to face the facts as stated by the President.  What is the origin of the title that is handed on?  He has told us that time and again these Private Bills have been either accepted or rejected on what is supposed to be called the equivalent to Second Reading by a Party-Government majority.</P>
      <P>That has been the ordinary custom, and when we tried here in this House to get rid of that Deputy Thrift got up and opposed it.  When we said in relation to this particular Bill that if the idea is that it is to go to an impartial committee for examination we are prepared to co-operate in that we were told no. Before it goes to that Committee it must have and will have Party sanction of its principle on the Second Reading stage.  That was Deputy Thrift's own contention, and it was a contention made directly in opposition to Deputy Law.  Deputy Law is perfectly in favour of a title being created to impartiality in the Committee which did not originate in this House.  We started as a Party in the matter.  Now is it suggested that in relation to Private Bills there shall be a special impartiality, a special judicial atmosphere which shall not exist in relation to public matters?</P>

      <P>How can you have any private matter of the size of this Bill divorced from public policy and how can any member of that Committee who has gone into the division lobby under the Party Whips pretend that he is going into that Committee in any judicial capacity? He has accepted the principle under the Government Whips under conditions in which it was a vote of confidence or of non-confidence in the Government and yet it is suggested that that thing which to me is a Party measure with Party Whips ceased to be a Party and political matter when it comes before a judicial tribunal.  Really, they ought not to talk nonsense.  This House functions through mass units with Parties, and there is no use pretending that it does not.  When you actually refuse to a particular Party in this House its nominee on that Committee you take very definite and drastic action in the matter.  I could imagine this thing going on if such a thing had not happened.  What is your objection to our confidence in the man who will express our point of view and whose action upon that Committee will give us confidence in the decision of that Committee?  Remember you are dealing with a measure which, on its introduction, we were told could not be sponsored in this House.  It could not be explained, it could not be justified.  There was nobody officially either to attack it or defend it, and yet it is to come back to this House with the sanction of a judicial authority from which there have been definitely and deliberately excluded the people whom we want upon that Committee so that its decision will have our confidence when it comes back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has given a very definite and timely warning, and that is: if Private Bill procedure is run upon these lines, if a majority of the House, whether they are made up of Independents, Cumann na nGaedheal, or any other name you like to call them, are prepared to keep off that Committee the representatives of the official Opposition, the specially and deliberately selected representatives of the official Opposition, then that <Col N="2277" /> Bill comes back to this House as a party measure; it must be regarded through all its future stages as a party measure, and it must, when passed, be subject to all the dangers and insecurities of a party measure. Is that what you want in relation to Private Bill procedure?  Is it suggested that if the Committee of the other kind was formed, that if parties had the right to nominate their people upon them that Private Bill procedure will break down, that people would not come to Private Bill Committees, would not bring forward Private Bills?  If it is, then something very ridiculous is suggested, and if it is not there is no matter in the complaint at all.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been suggested that, by consent of the House, the Chair should exercise the certain right it has to accept the elimination of a particular Standing Order in this matter on the ground of urgency. The urgency is that all the procedure of this Committee subsequently will be to come to a decision which will not have the confidence of the House, and which will have no claim whatever to permanent acceptance in the future, when the majority changes in it.  That is a matter of urgency.  If people go to Private Bill Committees I believe they ought to feel that when a decision is obtained in the House some sense of fixity of tenure, within reasonable limits, should be allowed.  But there is no fixity of tenure for a Private Bill which is really a party measure, and the sooner they get rid of the idea the better.  We are not here as individuals.  Mr. McDonogh is not serving on that Committee, nor was Mr. Lemass asked to serve on that Committee.  As individuals we do not exist here.  We are not allowed to call each other even by name.  We are Deputies, and you had better get clear on that.</P>
    <P>If you can apply to the whole of procedure in this House the ideals which have been laid down by the President, very fine ideals, well and good.  I would like to see things treated judicially, but I find the biggest matters in this country settled by the ringing of the bell <Col N="2278" /> and the pulling in of people who have not heard one word of the debate.  I am asked by the people who follow that procedure to suggest that in relation to private interests which have a broad impact upon public policy, such as this Bill, that no such procedure should be adopted and when the Party Whips have decided as a Party measure that this principle is accepted, then the Opposition is bound to accept all future proceedings as judicial.  You are living in an unreal world, and the sooner you get out of living in that and come down to facts the better.  We offered this Bill a free passage through this House and we were refused the conditions under which it would have got that free passage. We were told it had to be accepted in principle and Deputy Law upheld that point of view.  He knows that point of view was rejected.  Yet he knows that he went into the Lobby in favour of those who were rejecting that point.  If it could be a procedure in this House that the Party Whips were never put on a private measure on the Second Reading Stage then you can begin with a title which was good enough to hand on.  If the President is prepared now and in future in considering all those Standing Orders in relation to that, to take it that Private Bills will not be subjected to the Party Whips, then we will know where we stand, but we cannot start with it as a party measure and then, at our choice, make it into a non-party matter.</P>
    <P>Are they prepared logically to carry out their own principle, to say that in future the stage of sending this to a committee shall be a formal stage, that it will be decided in a House which has no Party Whips in it?  If they are prepared to do that they have to set up the basis, but as long as they are using the present procedure of Party Whips and machinery first of all, to decide that a measure is a party measure, it is absolute nonsense to suggest that it is anything else.  We want on the Committee a representative chosen by ourselves in whose <Col N="2279" /> actions on that Committee we will have confidence, in whose policy in relation to that Bill in the Committee we will have confidence, and unless we do get such a representative then we will treat this measure as a measure sent by a party majority to a party committee for a party decision, and when it comes back it must take the risks of that decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore might hold his peace for a moment. The proof is in the procedure.  Has not the Preamble to be proved when the Bill goes before a Private Bill Committee?  What is proof of the Preamble but the proving of the principle or the getting approval for the principle in this House or in the Seanad of the whole measure?  What happens on first and second readings?  There is objection taken only on such rare instances when it seems that the principle of the Bill is so objectionable that after expense has been incurred the whole measure is likely to be rejected. There is a sort of second reading, certainly, but only a sort of second <Col N="2281" /> reading, a sort of acceptance of principle but in a limited sense.  The Bill goes to Committee.  Its preamble is proved.  The Committee is selected in a particular way and we ask these people to sit in a judicial way. We are told that Deputies are here in a representative capacity, that we are elected on party lines.  There is apparently a Fianna Fáil policy on sewerage schemes, cemeteries or burial grounds as opposed to a Cumann na nGaedheal policy on these things.  I have even heard a plea made in this House with regard to people who have been defeated on Second Reading that when a measure is not a very controversial one&mdash;I had a measure or two of the type here last year, the Weights and Measures Bill and one relating to gas and petrol&mdash;that people should sit here and divest themselves of party points of view.  What do we do in regard to a Private Bill? There is a sort of acceptance of principle here on the Second Stage. The preamble comes before the type of judicial committee we set up, and when the measure comes back, as it does come back, to this House in the Fifth Stage, it is open to amendment. Amendments of substance may be moved.  It may be referred back to the committee which originally considered it or by this House to a special committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Little had to introduce, of course, the atmosphere that would tend really to destroy any confidence of this House in anything.  I think he said that one or two big private corporations were able to dictate to this House, and to make the members of this House their servants. What are the big private corporations he refers to who are able to shake a stick at members of this House?  Local authorities can come before a Private Bill Committee.  All sorts of people can come, not necessarily the big corporations.  That is a mere red herring in order to divert people's attention from what should be properly before them in this matter.  The House is not master of itself, the Deputy asserts.  Why? Because one Party is not allowed to get on that Committee a certain individual <Col N="2282" /> whom it wants.  There is arrogance and egotism in that beyond all bounds.  This House has lost control of itself because one Party cannot get on the Committee a certain man in whom it apparently lays its confidence to deal with this matter.  This whole thing is farcical and laughable.  This is a storm in a teacup.  We have had a certain type of procedure worked out.  It has inspired confidence in the public in regard to business like the handling of a Bill described as a Private Bill.  Deputies should remember what a Private Bill is.  It is a Bill promoted in the interests of any particular person, meaning corporation, or one that interferes with the rights of private persons, except when it is introduced in the public interests, or as a measure of public policy.  This is not a measure of public policy.  The Government does not stand or fall by it.  There is no excuse even for the Government trying to get members on this Committee, and all the talk that has been made by Deputy Lemass as to the Government introducing this Bill in a particular way, and giving facilities for certain things, is again all so much nonsense.  The Government has had no contact with this Bill, and certainly it had nothing to do with the selection of members to serve on the Committee to examine it.</P>

      <P>As far as this Party is concerned, I have not agreed to anything.  I was told that, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, an hour should suffice.  I mentioned we should at least have one and a half hours, which I considered would mean all the Government time to-day.  My own private opinion is that the discussion would take much longer, as the question is of such magnitude.  Anyhow, the agreement was not there.</P>

The Joint Committee has been already appointed, but one Deputy, Deputy Lemass, has been discharged and Deputy O'Hanlon is suggested for the vacancy.

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has nothing to do with the allocation of Private Members' time, but in the matter of private business it is for the Ceann Comhairle, when a motion is proposed, to fix time for the consideration of the motion.  When he is doing so he must, of necessity, consult the Leader of the House, who is in charge óf Government time.  He must, as a matter of practice&mdash;it is obvious common sense&mdash;be able to suggest that the consideration of a <Col N="2284" /> particular motion relating to a Private Bill will take no more than one hour, or an hour and a half, as the case may be.  The consideration of this matter was postponed until to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did speak on this measure. He was not here when it was under discussion before.  I advise him to read the Ceann Comhairle's rulings as to what exactly was implied in the Second Reading.  I do not think it will coincide with the interpretation of the Minister.  He mentioned that the Government had nothing to do with the Bill; they did not sponsor it and, apparently, did not care what happened it.  Why, then, did they put on the Government Whips?  Was it because they feared the Bill would be defeated?  It looks very much as if there was Government responsibility when the Whips were put on.  As regards red herings, the Minister must have brought a whole shoal of them from some foreign land.  He spoke of a whole lot of Private Bills and what happened to them.  We want to get down to brass tacks.  We maintain that in the particular Bill under consideration public interests are seriously involved.  I fail to see the arrogance of a Party which desires to nominate its own representative on this Committee.  The members of the Party have a perfect right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister maintains that the principle of the Bill will be discussed on the preamble and will actually be settled by the Committee. A few moments previously he said it was a mere technical matter, that it was necessary to be quite impartial and that we should have judicial minds when dealing with technical matters of the sort.  How does he reconcile the two statements? Let us take it the principle is decided.  I maintain there is then need to have the different viewpoints represented in this House expressed before the Committee.  It would be much better if those viewpoints were there expressed.  Amendments could be brought in and the Bill <Col N="2285" /> could be considered in such a way that there would not come back here a one-sided report from the Committee. It is very difficult for me to understand the meaning of the word impartial.  I wonder do Deputy Thrift, Deputy Law and others mean by impartial that nobody goes on a Committee except those known to be favourable to the measure.  Is that what they mean by impartial?  Is it maintained that Deputy de Valera could not have as judicial mind on the question as Deputy Thrift?  The fact that a Deputy is opposed to the measure does not mean that he will not give it fair consideration.  He may have his own view-point, but so has every other member of the Committee. The procedure we suggest would, in the opinion of the Minister, be farcical. I maintain it would be more laughable afterwards if there was a one-sided report coming from the Committee, if the finding was a Party finding.  It would not be laughable if the report were to come from a Committee representative of all sections of the House.</P>

      <P>There is just one point stressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the other speakers from the Government side, and that was that up to the present time there has been a certain procedure adopted.  I would like to remind the President and the Minister that there is a different House here now than was here when this Private Bill procedure was adopted. There is a bigger representation in the House now than there was then. Just remember that practically the whole country is represented now, with the exception of the Six Counties and a small number who are at the moment outside&mdash;I do not know what this small number is that is not represented&mdash;whereas before there was here only about 50 per cent. represented.</P>

      <P>We have been thinking over it for over five years and the Deputies opposite have been thinking it over for only about two years.  Surely they had time in the <Col N="2286" /> two years to make some recommendations and improvements upon the procedure that had been adopted, and they have not done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the last point.  What Deputy Boland has stated is not correct. So far as I know, at no time has the Joint Committee on Standing Orders accepted the nominees of any Party or allowed any Party in this House to nominate the members of a Private Bill Committee.  I think that position ought to be made clear.  The discussion would seem to convey that it was only one Party in this House that was being deprived of the right of nomination on Private Bill Committees.  That applies to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Labour Party and every other Party in the House.  The Joint Committee have taken up the position that they are not going to accept the nominees of any Party in the House or allow any Party to nominate members on Private Bill Committees.</P>
      <P>Listening here to the discussion, it seems to me that this matter was discussed as if this were the first Private Bill which had ever been considered or brought before this House.  We were told that it would be impossible to get a Committee of this House to consider any matter in a judicial way or even in a semi-judicial way.  The fact is that it has happened, and it has happened on many occasions during the last six years.  Many important Bills have been examined by the different Private Bill Committees in a judicial or semi-judicial manner and reported back to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee feel that this procedure which has been in operation on Committees is the best procedure that can be found for dealing with Private Bills.  The Joint Committee feel very strongly that if that procedure is departed from it will act as a great deterrent to <Col N="2287" /> people who may be anxious to promote Private Bills, and the result will be that people will be very slow to promote Private Bills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little made a statement that in this matter there were great private interests influencing the House.  I want to submit to the House that this motion which I have moved is a motion which has come from the Joint Committee functioning under the Standing Orders which were passed by this House without influence or pressure from outside.  So far as I am aware, speaking for the Joint Committee, there was no question of influence, interest or pressure brought to bear on them in any way.  It seemed to me from his speech that the idea of Deputy de Valera is that a Private Bill should be treated in the same way as a Public Bill which is sent by this House to a Select Committee or to a Special Committee.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's speech suggests to me that he felt there should be no difference in dealing with a Private Bill as distinct from a Public Bill, that in fact a Private Bill in Committee should be discussed either in the Committee of the whole House or by a Special or Select Committee set up by the House.  That idea does not commend itself to the Joint Committee. They feel that that is not the way in which Bills should or could be examined and they are certainly of opinion that the present procedure, the procedure which has been in operation, and which has worked successfully for the last six <Col N="2288" /> years, is a procedure that should remain in operation.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation purely I want to say that on every occasion when I acted on a Committee the name that was put forward on behalf of the Party I represent was accepted. There is another point of personal explanation I wish to make.  I did not like to interrupt An Leas-Cheann Comhairle when he was speaking.  I did not suggest, I hope, that particular private interests or influences had been brought to bear upon our Committee. That was a matter I did not suggest.  What I meant was that, in general, private powerful corporations were put into relationship with the members of this House so that the members of this House had to act in a capacity other than that of representatives&mdash;simply to carry out certain works for them.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that when the Private Bill Standing Orders were drawn up the Joint Committee of both Houses had no connection with outside interests. These Standing Orders are adopted by both Houses, each House dealing with them in its own way.  In so far as our Private Bill procedure exists now, it is our own procedure framed by ourselves and is not based on pressure from any outside influence. The Deputy is, I am sure, clear about that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to the remarks which I made last night on this motion to refer <Col N="2291" /> the Vote back for reconsideration. In making the few additional remarks which I have to make, I wish to say that we on this side of the House consider that this debate is likely to prove one of the most important which will take place here this year.  We consider it of paramount importance because we are a Party that desire the restoration of normal and peaceful conditions in this country.  We desire the restoration of peaceful conditions here, not merely as citizens who are anxious to foster industrial development and to end the evils of economic depression and unemployment, but also as a Party because we realise that the achievement of our Party aims can best be brought about by removing all the barriers that exist in the way of peaceful progress towards the national ideal.  The barriers of hate and bitterness, which were created during the Civil War period, are blocking the national advance and we, almost alone apparently in the country, desire to remove them.  The impression has been left on our minds, and on the minds of those whom we represent throughout the country, that the members of the Government and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, some of them at any rate, are deliberately endeavouring to keep alive that hate and bitterness in order to serve their Party ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not believe that the restoration of normal and peaceful contions is possible until all possible shadow of doubt as to the non-political status of the police force has been removed.  We realise that a large number of the members of the Civic Guard, probably the great majority of them, have the right attitude towards their duty but that the Minister for Justice has the wrong attitude and that it is his attitude which will ultimately influence the whole outlook of that force.  I made reference yesterday to the fact that he appears to exalt as an ideal member of that force the man who is most active and, in many cases, most irregular in relation to those <Col N="2292" /> who are the political opponents of the present Executive Council.  The state of affairs that exists in this country to-day is, of course, very largely due to our recent history.  I think, however, that all those who really wish to serve the interests of the country desire that that state of affairs which exists should be ended. If there was a general desire amongst all parties to end that state of affairs and to restore that respect for the ordinary law which is essential for its proper enforcement, we would have a very different attitude on the part of the Minister for Justice to that which he has taken up in the past.  I must say, of course, that the Minister for Justice is not the only offender.  Practically every Minister has endeavoured, both inside and outside the House, to misrepresent the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the Civic Guards as a force and towards the question of the maintenance of public order. Ministers have endeavoured to leave the members of the Civic Guard under the impression that the Fianna Fáil Party is hostile to them, as a force and as individuals.  I do not know whether they consider it to be in the public interest that that impression should be created, particularly when we have taken advantage of every occasion offered to us to make our position clear.  We are not hostile to the Civic Guards as a force.  They are entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing the law and we want to see them made a force that will be effective for the performance of their duties and a force in whom the people of the country can have confidence and can respect.  They cannot become such a force unless the attitude of the Ministry undergoes a fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Members of the Executive Council have repeatedly, by implication and direct assertion, attempted to convey to the people the idea that Fianna Fáil and those whom they represent sympathise with crime.  The Minister for Agriculture has repeatedly stated here and outside that the Fianna Fáil organisation, as an organisation, is associated with <Col N="2293" /> what he calls a conspiracy to murder.  I want to ask the Minister for Justice if he really thinks that it is in the public interest that statements to that effect should be circulated, and that the impression should be created in the country and outside that one-third of the elected representatives in this House, and 500,000 adult voters are associated with and in sympathy with what has been described as a conspiracy to murder.  If he is convinced, as I am sure if he reflects for a few minutes he will be, that it is quite the reverse in the public interest that these statements should be made, will he exercise whatever little influence he has on the Executive Council and on the Minister for Agriculture to cease making these statements?  I am making this assertion because I know that the Minister for Agriculture can produce no evidence to substantiate his statements.  If he will speak in this debate I know the line he will take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case it is the function of the Minister for Justice to see that justice is done and that order is maintained, and I do not think that he would be properly fulfilling his duties in seeing that justice was done, that order was maintained and that the law was respected, unless he succeeded in suppressing the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the campaign on <Col N="2294" /> which Ministers have been engaged in misrepresenting the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party has received the support of the daily Press.  We regret that.  We regret that responsible organs of opinion should deliberately go out of their way to convey the idea that the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party is other than it is. As I have said, I want to make it quite clear to the Minister for Justice and to every member in the House that we desire peace and we desire respect for the ordinary law. We want conditions in the country which will make it possible for us to achieve our political and national ideals by peaceable means.  That cannot be done unless there is a drastic change in Ministerial policy.  That cannot be done unless we get from the Minister of Justice an assurance that every time members of the Civic Guard act in an irregular manner or act as a politically partisan force, they will be called to order by him. That cannot be done unless we get from the Minister for Justice an assurance that every time a complaint is made to him that such irregularities have occurred, the attitude he will adopt will be other than that he has adopted in the recent past.  If he hopes to do his duty he will have to take action in the various cases of assaults by the Guards which have been mentioned here in the recent past.  As I said, if men make statements upon oath alleging that they have been assaulted by Guards either he has got to have these men charged with perjury or to have the conduct of the Guards inquired into.  He has taken neither course, apparently in order to ensure that no judicial inquiry will be held into the truth or otherwise of the assertions.  In doing so I maintain that he has neglected his duty.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that there is a strong case for referring back this Vote for reconsideration.  I do not know what members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party feel about the matter but it is very extraordinary, despite the fact that every facility was given them last evening, that not one of them got up to speak in defence <Col N="2295" /> of the Vote.  I do not know whether that was done under orders or whether it was because of their dissatisfaction with the way the Department is administered.  I hope that, like this Party, they want to see normal conditions restored, that they want a police force which will have the confidence of the public, and that they want respect for the law, and I hope that they will indicate that to the Minister for Justice by voting to refer back this Vote for consideration.</P>

      <P>I cannot support this amendment.  I think it would be no harm, perhaps, if in order to take attention away from the detective force which has been so much attacked in speeches last night and to-day, I referred particularly to the ordinary work of the Guards.  In my opinion, they do their work extremely well as far as the ordinary transport is concerned, but the control of buses has got beyond them. We had a statement from the Minister during the year that instructions had been given to the Guards that the drivers of all buses which travelled beyond 25 miles an hour were to be prosecuted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support this Vote for the Department of Justice, I would like to state that if there is one Department in this State which should receive unanimous, whole-hearted and unqualified support of every individual in the State, particularly every individual associated with the legislature of the State, it is the Department concerned with the suppression of crime and the maintenance of law and order.  In this country we have the peculiar situation that the one Department which is picked out for continuous and for bitter attacks is <Col N="2296" /> the Department responsible for the administration of justice.  Presumably these attacks are based chiefly on the fact that that Department, or the agents of that Department, do not hold their hand and wait for crime to be committed before they take action.  There are jibes to the effect that &ldquo;if you know that&rdquo; and &ldquo;if you know this, why do you not produce your evidence.&rdquo;  Every Deputy in this House, and every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches, knows that there is a very big difference between knowledge and evidence. That difference is wider and more vast in a country where, owing to the misleading of a multitude of people, perjurers are as common as crows.  Is it suggested by that Party that if the agents acting under the Minister for Justice have knowledge that certain white-livered patriots are planning or organising to riddle the thorax of a witness, judge or juror, with lead, that in the absence of evidence they should hold their hand and take no action until after the event?  That is the situation that exists and has existed for some time in the City of Dublin.  If the agents working under the Department of Justice have knowledge of such organisations, or of such activities, have knowledge that such schemes are being hatched, is it suggested that these schemes should not be exterminated in the hatching, but rather that the authorities should wait for the full fruits of the plot to materialise and then rely on witnesses who are subject to the most thorough and organised form of intimidation to bring these individuals to justice?</P>

    <P>Is it not more merciful to the individual concerned, and more a protection to the citizens generally, to take action to prevent such crime rather than trace the individual after the crime has been committed? Members of the Fianna Fáil Party are particularly touchy because the Minister for Agriculture implied that there was a certain association between that Party and the organisation responsible for the intimidation of jurors.  That was denied very emphatically by Deputy <Col N="2297" /> Lemass, but Deputy Lemass must know that it is not only the Minister for Agriculture that has that view, but that it is a view that is very generally, very widely, and very commonly held by the citizens of this State and the citizens of this city, and there certainly is a definite explanation and a definite reason why such views should be held.  If anyone throws his mind back over the last few weeks and over the discussions in this House, he will see that every time an agent of the Department of Justice made any general attempt to suppress crime in the incipient stage that the action of the Fianna Fáil Party could be interpreted as championing such organisers and such organisations.  In addition, the paper which Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly says is not their official organ, more or less commended the fact that a Dublin juror had been sent to a Dublin hospital.</P>
    <P>Now there is certainly a definite reason and a definite chain of events that would lead any thinking person to come to a conclusion similar to that arrived at by the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Lemass&mdash;in this connection I am speaking from memory and I am subject to correction if my recollection is inaccurate&mdash;when he was speaking last night on this particular Vote made a rather startling statement.  He made a statement which would do very much to blow to smithereens the name that he has been getting for himself as being a trifle saner and wiser and showing more judgement than certain other members of his Party.</P>
    <P>He said that subject to certain conditions, subject to certain specific conditions which he mentioned, that he and his Party and the odd five hundred thousand people whom he claimed are misguided enough to support him and his Party, would co-operate with the forces responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the suppression of ordinary crime not associated with the political status of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has <Col N="2298" /> invited correction, perhaps I might correct him now on that.  I said that while the idea persists in the minds of a large section of the people that the Civic Guard force is controlled mainly for political purposes that co-operation will not be given.  I certainly did not hold out any offer that co-operation would be given on certain conditions or not. I expressed my belief that it would not be given and is not at the moment being given because these conditions are not being fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's correction, but that is my point which I was laboriously endeavouring to make, that at the moment there is no co-operation being received or being given by that Party for the suppression of crime in this country, crime of any kind, murder, loot or anything else, and that a responsible Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, claiming to speak for that Party and to speak for five hundred thousand others, boasts and glories in the fact that that Party will give no assistance in the suppression of crime.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that, and in the same speech he criticises the expenditure on the force which is responsible, without any assistance from that section of the community, for the suppression of crime and the maintenance of law and order.  Now the strongest argument that can be advanced for the inflation of this particular Vote is the argument advanced by Deputy Lemass, and notwithstanding that he was simple enough in the same speech to suggest the referring of it back, which means that no money could be spent on the suppression of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a fair interpretation of the position.  I also think it is a very strong argument for an increase in this particular Vote.  We have three voices speaking from the <Col N="2299" /> Fianna Fáil Benches with regard to this particular subject, and it is of importance that this House should know which of those voices is the voice of that particular Party.  We have the statement to-day of Deputy Seán Lemass of non-co-operation and non-assistance with those responsible for the maintenance of law and order and the suppression of crime. We had Deputy Flinn last night offering full co-operation, and hoping that the full assistance of the Fianna Fáil Party would be tendered to those responsible for the suppression of what he called ordinary crime, and we have Deputy de Valera saying that the one authority he respects is the majority vote of this House.  Well, there is no law in operation in this country which has not been passed by a majority of this House.  Does Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, or Deputy Flinn speak for the Party opposite?  The three attitudes are totally different.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I have very much new to say, but I think that this Vote for the Department of Justice, which is responsible for the policing of the country, is a very vital matter.  When people want to <Col N="2300" /> explain that Europe is the home of civilisation, they explain it by saying that Europe has been policed for a longer period than any other part of the world.  The idea of government is based upon the idea of policing, and civilisation itself is dependent upon the existence of police. Here in this country there is a police problem which I think is peculiar to the country.  It might well be that we need a greater police force and greater powers in the police, with a lesser amount of crime here, than in another country.  An individual who needs money and who has grown up under peculiar circumstances goes out and robs.  There should be police to get after him to encourage him not to rob.  An organisation is a different matter, even a small organisation.  In this country we have an organised criminal organisation.  We have more than that.  Deputy Lemass has defied us to show the association between his Party and the gunmen gang.  It seems to me that the existence of the Fianna Fáil Party adds considerably to the police problem in this country.  I said the other day that we had here a small murder gang party that neither in this country nor in any other country should get any volume of support. We have, then, a Party whose history is, roughly, this, that it occupied much the same position as is now occupied by the murder gang. At a given point they found that they were not getting anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said the other day, the Free State Government have done things that I never thought they would do, leading to the downing of arms.  It was the first occasion possibly in our history of a demonstration that the policy of force was successful in dealing with rebellion in this country. You have those people then bringing forward what they call an economic policy, and for what purpose? Because they realised that they exist for a purpose that would never get the assent or the co-operation of the people here.  As far as I remember, they then decided to draw up an economic policy to mislead the people.  The position <Col N="2301" /> was that the people in voting for an economic purpose were actually voting for the purpose of the Party that existed before.  Deputy Lemass said we suggested the Fianna Fáil Party and the people behind them were against public order.  I do not think the people behind them to any large extent are against public order.  As I have said, I think the Fianna Fáil vote represents the capitalisation of the Government's unpopularity, for every act which the Government does alienates a certain number.  A Government has to act for the well-being of the whole country and, there are sections on one side or another whose interests do not coincide with the interests of the whole people.  As I said, here you have a small murder gang, and you have as their spokesmen and defenders official whiners in this House raising points almost every evening on motions on the adjournment about actions of the police in dealing with these people. The law exists solely for the purpose of policing and protecting the people.  I once pointed out, not so very long ago, that there are nine ways in which you can share in the guilt of another's sin, such as by counsel, consent, praise, flattery, silence, or being partner in the sin.</P>
    <P>A little over a year ago I asked the Party opposite would they, if they had information which would be useful for making an arrest in connection with the murder of the late Minister for Justice, give that information, and they never yet agreed that they would.  They accused us of suggesting that they stand against order in the country. I say that the man who is not prepared to do his part as an ordinary moral being in putting down murder is a party to it, and I endeavoured to give them the opportunity of dissociating themselves from it by asserting here publicly, and acting on it thereafter, that if they had any information conceivably of use to the police they would give it.  The indication from two members of the Party was that they would not, and I gathered from another one that he <Col N="2302" /> thought they should.  Now by silence I think they become parties to it, and by their public silence I think they are indicating to the people of this country that they stand against order.  The Deputy said: &ldquo;We desire the restoration of peaceful conditions here.&rdquo;  What are the things that are necessary for peaceful conditions?  They are primarily governed by a Government whose laws are going to be upheld in the country.  It is only a few days ago since Deputy Lemass said he hoped that an Act if passed by a majority of this House would find a man who would resist to the end.  Deputy de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, for one, when the flag of the Republic was run up against an Executive that was bringing off a coup d'état stood by the flag of the Republic, and I will do it again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who continued on in that organisation which we have left can claim exactly the same continuity that we claimed up to 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know that when Deputy de Valera says two incompatible things his dignity requires that he should for the rest of his life maintain that he was right on both occasions.  I think it is necessary in the interests of social order in this country that Deputy de Valera's dignity be impinged upon to the point of saying when he was right and when he was wrong.  He says: &ldquo;Those who continued on in that organisation which we have left can claim exactly the same continuity that we claimed up to 1925.&rdquo;  The gunman gang claim that.  Up to 1925 Deputy de Valera outside this House claimed the powers of life and death.  He left that organisation, and then he says he was right when he claimed those powers, and possibly exercised those powers, or people acting on his behalf exercised those powers which he claimed, and I think we all on these benches were in 1922 condemned to death.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2303" /> He says the powers of life and death remain with those people outside.  There can be only one Government here.  If those people outside have the powers of life and death when they decide that a juryman by virtue of his not committing perjury is guilty of treason and sentence him to death it is the duty of the police to go after them.  The majority of the people of the country think that that power should not exist in the people outside.  If Deputy de Valera is right, then when this Government execute a murderer we are murderers, and if Deputy de Valera ever, by some disaster, gets into power in this country he must either allow these men full scope, or if he attempts to deal with them he will be called a traitor.  If he executes one of them he will be acting as a murderer.  But we are told we are doing a bad thing by suggesting that the Party opposite, who represent or misrepresent a large section of the people who voted for them, stand against social order, and that we are doing something against the interests of the country. We are doing nothing of the sort.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact, and what Deputy de Valera says is true, the country should know it.  I have tried time and again, and not for Party purposes, to get the Party opposite to get up and say exactly what it is they stand for.  Deputy de Valera once wrote a letter in which he said: &ldquo;As you know, I am most particular even to the shade of meaning.&rdquo;  We have not been able to get his shades of meaning.  If he was right in 1925 it is not many weeks since he asserted that those people outside can claim exactly the same authority as he claimed up to 1925.  Very well then, there is the position of the murder gang outside, supported by 57, or whatever the number, of the Deputies opposite.  Their moral claim to murder is supported by the Party opposite.  Does not a country like that require extreme police measures?  It does, and I do not know of any other country faced with such a situation.  We know perfectly well that the Party opposite <Col N="2304" /> would like to get away from their past, only that Deputy de Valera has not the moral courage to get up and admit he was wrong.</P>
    <P>But this country may have to pay too high a price because Deputy de Valera has not the courage to say he is wrong.  He said: &ldquo;In the people outside rests the legitimate authority.&rdquo; We are elected, by the Irish people, to maintain civilisation in this country.  It is obvious and clear that you cannot have civilisation when the moral authority rests with those who exist as a gang outside. We know that we are authorised by the people to put down that authority, which Deputy de Valera, and presumably his Party, say is the only legitimate authority in this country. The police know that a fair number of people are in that organisation, the members of which commit murder. Deputy de Valera will say there was only one murder committed. The business of the police is to get after the man who commits murder, to get after the man who is going to commit murder, and the man associated with murder.</P>
    <P>You have that organisation. There are Deputies opposite who like to throw out phrases from nineteenth century liberalism.  Take Deputy de Valera himself.  He was associated with the movement before the Truce.  Ambushes took place which the British said should be punished by death. Could the British have proved his clear association with the ambush that took place down in West Cork? Of course they could not.  Was he morally responsible for the ambush that took place equally with the rest of us?  Of course he was, but as far as the law was concerned it could not prove it, and if the British Government had the right to be here at all it had a perfect right to bring in such a form of laws as would enable it to handicap and to get control of those people who were associated with it.  They were very much after the late Michael Collins.  Could they definitely have associated him with these things?  Of course they could not.  Was he clearly associated and equally responsible with men <Col N="2305" /> who took part in them?  Of course he was.  Therefore if that Government had a right to be here at all they were perfectly right in endeavouring to secure a condition of affairs whereby they would be able to deal with Deputy de Valera, the late Michael Collins, the Minister for Finance, the President and myself; they had a perfect right to have their machinery so arranged that they could go out after each, equally with a man who was actually captured taking part in an ambush in West Cork.</P>
    <P>The same applies here.  There is an organisation, with its Adjutant-General, its Chief-of-Staff and other posturers that the Deputy was associated with up to a short time ago. You have a so-called Chief-of-Staff and a so-called O.C. of such and such a battalion ordering two men to murder such and such a juryman. The police, knowing the association, and knowing the hierarchy of that association, not knowing exactly who were the men who went to murder that juryman, but having a moral certainty that the Adjutant-General, the Chief-of-Staff and the O.C. were equally morally responsible and equally a danger to social order in this country, it is their business to get after those people with all the power that the law gives them.  But when they do that we have the official whiners getting up every night on the Adjournment and asking why this man was arrested and why that man was arrested and not charged.  The police have a moral certainty, and it is their business to use all the powers they have to secure a legal certainty. But no Deputy in the Party opposite admits that there is this organisation, though these murders have taken place.  They admit these cases but say that the Government, elected by the Irish people to maintain social order, must handicap itself by taking no action whatsoever except against people whom they can arraign in a court and against whom they can bring clear evidence that they were party to a crime.  They know perfectly well, and every intelligent <Col N="2306" /> man in the country knows perfectly well, that such a proposal is utterly ridiculous.  It means that the headquarter staff, the O.C. and the rest of them can go about smoking their cigarettes, sitting in restaurants, catching their trams and all the rest of it, and the Government is to be confined to getting after the poor ignorant dupes who actually do the murders.  Where is the moral responsibility?  We know the names of men who have greater moral responsibility for these murders than the men who actually did them.  Can we bring them to trial and prove it in court?  We cannot. Was the position also the same before the Truce?  Were we not equally responsible with the men who took part in ambushes?  Of course we were.  Could we have been definitely associated with these ambushes in an ordinary trial?  Of course we could not.</P>
    <P>It is only hypocrisy, and everybody knows it, to suggest that there is an absolute parity between organised crime of that sort and the ordinary murderer who kills a man to steal his pocket-book or something else.  It is a totally different situation. Deputies say that for Party purposes they want peace preserved, because it suits the Party purposes, and say that the Minister for Justice exalts the man who is most active against the political opponents of the Government.  I suggest that when you call a murder gang political opponents of the Government and when you talk about political crime you are party to this crime of murder morally by that form of praise or flattery.  To suggest that these humbugs, these hysterical women, and all the rest of those in this organisation, who go about to murder jurymen who do not commit perjury should be exalted as political offenders and to suggest that we have got after them only because they are political opponents of the Government is absurd when you remember that in the election a couple of years ago these people went up and out of 152 seats they got 7&mdash;and what proportion of <Col N="2307" /> the people who voted for them approve of their murder tactics?  They are a very small proportion, and as political opponents they do not count, but as enemies of social order they are a serious problem, backed up, as they are, by the moral sanction of the leader of a big political party in the country, who says that these men can claim the same continuity as he claimed up to 1925 and that, as he asserted, he had a perfect right to claim.  He was right and therefore they are right.  That is the problem we are up against.  Is there not moral association between the Fianna Fáil Party and those people outside, until the leader of that Party, speaking with the assent of the whole Party, gets up and clearly says, wiping out the past altogether, that if he or any member of his Party can get any information that would enable the police to stamp out that conspiracy he will do all in his power to assist the police, and until he asserts that if the Irish people ever give him and his Party a majority he will stamp it out with a rigour not less than the rigour we have exercised?  He has got to have the guts to stand up to his late allies.  But to say, as he has said, that these people who wage war upon the ordinary citizens of the country have a moral right to do so is the very negation of the whole tradition of Irish nationalism; it is the very negation of social order, and it is the very negation of the moral law.  It was only on the 14th of last March that the leader of that Party said these things here.</P>
    <P>Now, the business of the Minister for Justice and of the police is to deal with all crime in the country, and before any other crime to deal with organised crime.  The ordinary murderer who kills somebody or other because he wants his pocket-book is an enemy of social order, but he is only an enemy of social order in so far as he murders that man.  But the people who are endeavouring to overthrow the only possible Government in this country, <Col N="2308" /> that is to say, a Government sitting in the Dáil, elected by a majority of the people, are the arch-enemies of social order because they are attempting to destroy all social order in the country.  Deputies opposite say that they are right, and by saying that they are right and that they have a moral authority to do it they become parties to all that those people do.  We know perfectly well that the greatest tribute paid to the present methods of the police against the murder gang has been shown here day after day and night after night when Deputies on the other side of the House got up to protest against arrests without warrants and about detaining people for twenty-three hours in the lock-ups, and all the rest of it.  They are put up as the official whiners of these people, and I am glad to say that the policy of the Minister has got them whining.</P>
    <P>It was thrown across the House only a few days ago that only one man was wounded and only one man was murdered.  They have sent out their lists.  Mr. White was only one on the list.  The others are immune because there would be a certain amount of danger in attempting to murder them.  We know that one of the securities of the situation is that the tradition of this murder gang only began in the 1922 period, when the fight was carried on solely on the assumption that it would be perfectly safe.  But when the Government did things that I never thought they would do the down-arms order came.  There was no proper surrender under the down-arms order; they could continue their organisations; they could continue all that they had done before, except the dangerous part of it, and if one of them had been arrested after the down-arms order, then there would have been an outery for arresting this man who was perfectly peaceful.  We all know that Deputy de Valera gave the down-arms order on April 28th, or whenever it was.  They are attempting to continue the civil war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> Until 1925 the Party opposite intended to continue the civil war if an opportunity came.  They found that the tide was going against them, and later they decided that, having sworn that under no circumstance would they ever take the oath, to come in here.  Having come in here and having taken the oath and having got up on points of order and having voted for or against laws that were being passed, after being in here up to the 14th of last March Deputy de Valera got up and said that this House has no authority, that the authority of government rests in this little group outside.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says that he stands for law and order as we understand it in this House, and then he complains that the police are getting after these people outside.  I think that if I had any fault to find with the police it would be for lack of activity against what Deputies opposite call political opponents of the Government.  If the Deputy stood for anything that a decent man should stand for he should recognise these people not merely as political opponents of this Government but as opponents of every decent man in the country and as opponents of his Party.  He recognises these people as the opponents of this Party but not as the opponents of his Party. There is not the same distinction. there is not the same antipathy between his Party and them as there is between his Party and ours.  I thank the Deputy for the very high compliment he pays us, and I would, in a Party spirit, rejoice in the way in which he degrades his own Party except that it seems to me that the necessities of social order require that the Fianna Fáil Party should come out perfectly clearly on this matter.  It seems to me that sometimes Deputy Lemass would like to do it, but then we have only to touch Deputy de Valera to the quick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let him get up and say clearly that as far as these people are concerned whom the police are going after at the moment, he stands for crushing them out completely. What does he do?  He says you can never have order in this country until you have the people completely united.  How are you going to have complete unity with this small group representing seven of 152 of the people of the country? That is much more than they represent in reality, but I will give them that much.  Deputy de Valera says that there can be no government, no social order in the country until we have unity.  At the same time Deputy Lemass complains that we are not getting after the British Fascisti. Good heavens, when we have prosituted the moral law to win the Deputy's gunmen friends we should have the British Fascisti saying: &ldquo;You will have to meet us before you can have social order,&rdquo; and it will take more non-Euclidian politics to make both right.</P>

      <P>Here is a Party which says that they will not give information that would lead to the arrest of murderers.  I want to get a clear statement from them.  I would be ready to withdraw everything I have said if they would make a perfectly clear statement.  The Party opposite, through Deputy <Col N="2312" /> O'Kelly's organ, rejoices that jurymen have to be protected, and rejoices that jurymen are being interfered with in earning their living because they would not commit perjury.  You have that Party opposite, seated in this House to the number of more than 50, using all the power that they have got for their bogus policy to prevent the police from using all the power they can to put down that conspiracy. Let us get the thing clear.  Do the Deputies opposite want that conspiracy crushed, or do they not?  If they want it crushed out let them be prepared to co-operate in every possible way with the police in crushing these organisations&mdash;this so-called I.R.A., this Cumann Comhlucht an Poblachta, or whatever it is called, and those other organisations which the police have definite information are attempting to subvert the State.  Are they going to co-operate or are they not?  If they are not, do they think that it is the ordinary straight thing to come in here and to use the power of their votes to prevent the police doing what the police, with the knowledge at their disposal, believe to be necessary to get after these people, and at the same time to get up and assert that the Government is dastardly, untruthful and everything else in suggesting that there is a lien between the Party opposite and the gunmen group?  We have had Deputies getting up and saying that they were in a position to assert that such and such a man had no association with these political organisations. How can a person assert that?  You cannot know everything about a gunman, but you can know every member of an organisation and you can say that a man is not one of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You can say that, if you know every member of it, you know I am not one of them; you can <Col N="2313" /> certainly then have the moral certainly that I am not one of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">

      <P>Why can we not have the same moral certainty about a person whom we know well, even better than we know the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But they do not accept moral certainly.  When we say that such and such a man is associated with these organisations they say: &ldquo;Why do you not prove it in the courts?&rdquo;  Moral certainty is not good enough in that case; we want absolute legal proof of everything&mdash;to be in a position to prove it up to the hilt in court.  Their idea of proof is to say that they are in a position to prove that such a man had no association with any organisation. As a matter of fact, on one occasion we happen to know that a Deputy who said that was wrong. The only one way in which that can be settled is that if Deputies know all about an organisation, as ordinary citizens they are bound to give that information.  They do not do it, and then they complain that we are misrepresenting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, why do you not give information to the police?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The police know. We only know it from the police. The Deputy may rest assured that as far as the Executive Council is concerned if we have any information likely to be useful to the police we will give it, and if the Party opposite were to come into power and their late allies were still active&mdash; and I believe they would be much more active, as they would have the <Col N="2314" /> moral support of Deputy de Valera and his Party&mdash;and if the Party opposite were acting as a Government to crush the conspiracy, if we had any information we would certainly give it to them, because that would be our ordinary moral duty. We are bound to stand for social order.  The movement that Deputies were associated with up to 1925 was incompatible with social order.  Their direct heirs and legatees in that movement are also incompatible with social order, and as such they must be put down.  The last way of putting them down is to go about assuring them that they have all the rights of the case, that they have the moral right to be the Government, and that when they decide that such-and-such a man should not continue to exist, they have the right to execute him.  That is, to my mind, the very worst form of association with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies opposite stated quite openly that they were with them we would not have to put in so much time in the Dáil, as we should have a big majority.  But the Deputies opposite were too cute.  Having concealed from the people their association, they still maintain the attitude that these gunmen are right.  Having concealed that from the people, they got a certain number in here and they, therefore, strengthened them to that extent when they put the power they got that way in this Dáil at the service of these men in handicapping the police.  Then the Deputies opposite are indignant when at elections we get up and refer to these things and say to the people, &ldquo;Vote for us.&rdquo; We can say that the Fianna Fáil Party say these people are our political opponents, and not their political opponents.  Surely we can get up and say to the people: &ldquo;We are the opponents of these people.  The Fianna Fáil Party by their own implication are not their opponents. Do you want these people who murdered jurymen and Kevin O'Higgins to do what they like in the country, or do you not?  If you do not, what is the best way of getting out of it? Vote for the Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="2315" /> Party, who are, as Deputy Lemass said, the opponents of these people, Deputy Lemass himself not being an opponent of them; Deputy Lemass and his Party being determined to maintain silence rather than allude to the fact, and Deputy de Valera giving them comfort by praise and flattery and assuring them that they are the real, live custodians of Irish national tradition&mdash;that they are by right automatically the Government of the country.&rdquo;  The Party opposite it seems to me, from any moral point of view, until they make their position clear, until they come out and make the statement publicly that I have tried to drag out of them time and again, are parties to it by concealment, silence and praise and flattery and, in fact, by being partners in the sin.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence said he had nothing new to say and he had not.  He proceeded as usual with the muck-rake to rake up all the evil that he could, and then he indulged in sophistry and misquoted Deputies on this side, partially quoted them, and took quotations away from their context and read his own meaning into them. He has appointed himself the judge of law and order and morals.  I wonder when he was appointed by this State to stand up and ask a question of any Deputy he likes or any Party and to be the sole arbiter of morals.  He is the sole judge of justice, right, law and order.  I wonder when he was appointed.  He has asked some questions which I shall answer and which are quite easily answered.  Before dealing with that matter, I would again put to the Minister for Justice some propositions put to him by Deputy Lemass.  It is usual for the Minister for Justice to maintain that he has what you never had in any age or clime, an impeccable police force&mdash; that there could not be one wrong man amongst them.  He may not state it definitely, but when any charge is brought against any member of that <Col N="2316" /> force, even on sworn affidavit, he shrugs his shoulders and says he is quite sure there is no truth in such charges owing to the information he has received, after having instituted inquiries.  I suggest to the Minister that in the best interests of the Garda Síochána themselves, of the public and of justice, and to inspire public respect for and confidence in the administration of the Department of Justice, he should, when such charges are made on affidavit, have inquiries instituted.  If they are proved false, he has enhanced the reputation of the police force, and if they are proved true, and the guilty ones punished, he has done a lot to restore public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great Britain boasts of a loyal police force and a law-abiding citizenry, but the Government of Great Britain does not for one moment maintain that there are not criminals occasionally to be found amongst their police force.  Why should the Minister for Justice here try to maintain that the police force is absolutely impeccable?  By the very origin and circumstance of the institution of the Gárda Síochána they were chosen from one political Party.  That is obvious to anyone who thinks over it for a moment.  I do not believe that the great majority of the Gárda are political partisans.  My experience of them, and I speak of them as I found them, particularly at election times, is that the great majority of them are impartial. I have found a few who were not.  I found a sergeant of the Gárda on one occasion who was in every way possible obstructing the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party on the polling day at an election and acting, practically, as an agent for Cumann na nGaedheal.  I do not give his name, because when I spoke to him he apologised and admitted that he was wrong and ceased the activities that he was engaged in for over two hours in the polling booth. There are such cases, and there is no use denying them, and it is important that the Minister should impress upon them that they are not <Col N="2317" /> the servants of any political Party. It is essential in the interests of peace and public order that that should be impressed upon the members of the force very carefully and forcibly.</P>
    <P>In regard to the C.I.D., Deputy Lemass suggested that members of it, particularly the chiefs of it, who were closely identified with a certain side in the Civil War, should no longer hold office in the C.I.D.  He did not ask that they should be deprived of their positions and not given other employment, but there are at least three or four of them whom we all know to be bitter partisans, and who would be much better engaged in any employment than the C.I.D.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke of the bitter attacks made upon the Department of Justice.  We have arraigned certain members of the detective division for what we consider, and for what some of the courts of justice considered, the illegal activities of certain C.I.D. men in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no use saying these are the gunmen and the murder gang. Some of them may have been.  But they were found not guilty in the courts of justice and they were acquitted even of breaking up a jail in which they were illegally detained, and a judge refused to punish them on the ground that they were illegally detained.  We have no objection whatever to arresting men against whom there is any charge or who are even suspected, provided the charge is brought against them and that they are given a chance of defending themselves, but to arrest and detain men for twenty-three hours, then liberate them and arrest them again as many as ten times in a fortnight will not make for confidence or help to bring the guilty to justice.</P>
    <P>It is said that we are touchy about the charges of our connection with a criminal conspiracy.  We do not stand for the murder of jurymen. The Minister for Justice knows that, and the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2318" /> knows it.  We do not stand for a small section of the people maintaining that they have the power of life or death or the right to murder jurymen or those whom they consider against national interests.  No one here has maintained that, but we have stated that you are likely to get peace if you get unity on the lines that those who maintain that this country should be a republic, and refuse allegiance to any other country, or outside king, would be enabled to sit in the people's Parliament. That is a very different thing from saying that they have power, or should have the power, of life and death or that if they put people to death it is not murder.  We do not maintain any such thing.  We heard a lot&mdash;I do not know what the Minister for Defence was quoting from&mdash;about the Ten Commandments and I do not know what else. He seems to be an authority on moral philosophy and theology, but he certainly is an expert sophist. He spoke of us as official whiners, and as spokesmen and defenders of the murder gang.  We do not want to defend, and have not attempted to defend, any murder gang whatever. But we do not want men arrested and rearrested time after time who are not guilty, and who have been proved not to be guilty and whom the courts of the Free State have liberated as not guilty. If there are charges to be made let these charges be brought against these men.  I wonder is it suggested that by arresting and rearresting them day after day information will be extracted, or does the Minister approve of such methods which are third degree methods?  I do not approve of them.  I think such activities, of course, are largely confined to the C.I.D. and even to a certain section of them, but not altogether.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, very difficult to say whether a man is a member of what they call the murder gang or whether he is a member of the I.R.A. I have here a letter which I might quote.  I did not raise the matter mentioned in the letter in the Dáil. <Col N="2319" /> There have been so many questions raised about the Civic Guard and the C.I.D. and wrong conclusions come to that I thought it better not to raise the matter of this letter before now.  This is a letter dated 13th April last from John Silke of Lisheeninane, Kinvarra.  I have other letters from other parts of the county as well, but I will read this as typical.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I attended the Commemoration which was held at Shanaglish, Gort, at the graves of the Brothers Loughnane on Sunday, March 31st.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies may remember that the Brothers Loughnane were captured by the Black and Tans, dragged along a mile roped to a lorry and not being quite dead they were covered with petrol and set on fire.  That was the fate of the Brothers Loughnane. This man was among those who went to the graveside in commemoration of the Brothers Loughnane and in his letter he continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On my way home that evening accompanied by Laurence Fogarty and John Joe Callanan we pulled up at a place called Labane in the Ardrahan Parish and went for cigarettes into the shop of John Quinn.  Fogarty and Callanan went out from the shop a few minutes before me.  When I went out on the road about 20 yards from Quinn's shop two known Guards in full uniform had Fogarty and Callanan held up.  As I approached them the Guards asked me had I a bicycle.  I denied having one.  They then asked for my name.  It was about 10 p.m.  Before I got time to answer one of the Guards hit me with his clenched fist.  I was staggered with the first blow.  I was then struck again by the same Guard and knocked down on the road.  I got up and was knocked down for the second time.  I was then told to get up and clear away. I am being attended by Dr. Connolly of Kinvarra.  One of my <Col N="2320" /> eyes was badly cut, also my mouth and nose.  The Guards were from the Ardrahan Barrack on patrol duty at Labane.  I have reported the matter to the Superintendent at Govt.  He promised to inquire into the case.  I don't know why I was assaulted unless that they objected to my activities during the last elections.  I and others are pestered with those Guards and if they are allowed to carry on like this much longer it would be better for me and some others to emigrate and clear out of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the few cases I have to report, and I would like to know if the Minister has got any information as to what the Superintendent has done in this matter, or what steps he is taking or proposes to take.  I do not want the information now, but perhaps the Minister might send it on to me. There are instances of uniformed Guards acting as political partisans or agents of the Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

I submit we should get from the Minister a definite answer to the propositions put up by Deputy Lemass&mdash;namely, that it should be impressed upon the Guards that they are not the agents of any political Party, and that perhaps the half-dozen men at the headquarters of the C.I.D. who were in the Civil War and took an active part in it and who are known to be bitterly hostile to their fellow-countrymen should be given some other employment in the interests of peace, order and justice.</P>

      <P>The worst aspect of the Department of Justice is the way in which politics and the administration of justice are mixed up to such an extent so as to poison, as has been said on many occasions, the sources of justice.  In particular, the reason why we shall vote against this Estimate is because the Department of Justice has been guilty of flagrant offences against Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution. These are Articles which I suppose the Minister for Defence in his light and humorous way would refer to as nineteenth century liberalism, but in case he might have forgotten they exist, I think it is well to place them on record.  The Articles which have been really rendered a dead letter by the administration of justice are the following.  Article 6 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The liberty of the person is inviolable, and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.&rdquo; ...</P>
      <P>And Article 7 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The dwelling of each citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered except in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this Vote yesterday, Deputy Flinn made reference to the verdict of a certain judge, and on that occasion the Minister seemed to deny the statement made by Deputy Flinn.  Now, what the judge exactly said was this.  It was Judge Davitt. I am quoting the verdict.  I am not criticising the judges in one way or in another; I am quoting the verdict. <Col N="2322" /> The case dealt with glass-breaking in the Bridewell.  The person brought before him was Mr. John Kelly, and Judge Davitt explained to the jury&mdash;I am now quoting the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; report of 23rd April&mdash;that the proof of the arrest of the accused man had not been produced, nor was it shown by whom he was arrested.  There was no evidence that the accused was in lawful custody and, for all they knew, he was in unlawful custody. If so detained, the man in the dock was entitled to do what he could to obtain his release.  Apparently the jury agreed with the judge in his point of view, and after ten minutes' consultation the jury acquitted the prisoner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept all that as accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Andrew Finlay, charged with a similar offence, Judge Davitt said that, as in the last case, there was no evidence to show that the prisoner was in lawful custody.  The arrests and releases and subsequent rearrests and releases of the prisoner had not been justified before the jury.  The jury found the prisoner not guilty and he was discharged. I submit that these verdicts are a condemnation of the whole policy which the Department of Justice has been carrying out, and it has so placed the Department of Justice that they are liable to actions if the unfortunate victims are able to afford an action, or a long series of actions, for illegal arrest.  About 150 individuals, Republicans, have been arrested and re-arrested, men, women and children, at least since the beginning of March.  There were isolated cases before, but from that time, coinciding with the election period, there was intensive activity. They were taken from their houses at night; they were seized in the streets in the day-time, and they were carried off in cars and lorries. When they were released, they were <Col N="2323" /> let down in country places and were threatened.  Every form of terrorism was used against them, and all along the line in this House the attitude taken up by various Ministers has been that these people have been all guilty to their knowledge of certain crimes.  They are all guilty until they prove themselves innocent.</P>
      <P>Then the Minister for Defence has the most extraordinary impudence to address himself to individual citizens and political parties, and to charge them also with being accomplices in these crimes, and he makes an attempt to bind people over to keep the peace on account of crimes they have never committed.  If any ordinary self-respecting citizen in the street was suddenly accosted by a policeman and told that he must give an undertaking to assist in discovering some crime committed because the policeman suspected him of being implicated in it, and at the same time if it were clear from the conduct of the policeman that he had absolutely no evidence even to take that man to the police barracks, and had not even the face to take him to the police barracks, what would the attitude of the ordinary citizen be to the policeman?  He would be looked on as if he were a lunatic.  The ordinary citizen would not enter into conversation with him; he would tell him not to be a nuisance.  On this side of the House we take up exactly the same attitude towards the Minister for Defence.  His questions are the same as the leading question which everybody knows is used in law, when the counsel asks the witness did he stop beating his wife? It is only in that way one can treat these questions which are hurled from the Government Benches in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had in discussions on the adjournment cases raised.  We have first of all, within recent times, heard of cases of the arrests in Dublin here dealt with by Deputy Lemass, and the attitude of the Minister has been indescribable.  He <Col N="2324" /> seems to be entirely indifferent to ordinary human considerations.  He assumes that all these 150 people deserved what they got.  He admits, at the same time, that there is not sufficient evidence to convict them of anything.  Really, the Minister's attitude is that of a man who seems to be carried off his feet as well as having lost his head.  He does not seem to be able to control his own Department, and when his Department is attacked, through him, he tells us the proper course is to take action in the ordinary courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>He ought to pay if he does not.  I still adhere to my contention that the Minister is totally wrong in using the word client. These constituents, acting in their proper capacity, come to their representatives when they have grievances against the Government and their representatives come into this House. This is the proper place for ventilating such grievances.  This is the place <Col N="2325" /> where the House has to exercise its authority over its permanent officials and not in the courts of law.  A court of law is a very good thing if you can afford to go into it, but the Minister must know very well that in a great many cases of this kind&mdash;I am thinking now of a particular case&mdash; the poor unfortunate victims are really not able to afford to go into the ordinary court.  I am thinking of a case in Waterford where a man was beaten by members of the detective department of the Gárda Síochána and where there is ample evidence that he was beaten.  Having had before him the example of what happened in Mr. Crotty's case, where the man concerned was not able to get the damages that were awarded, this man, named O'Donoghue, was not able to follow up the case and get justice.</P>
      <P>When representatives of this House make serious representations to the Minister I think it is the duty of the Minister to make inquiries into each one of these cases.  I myself asked for an inquiry in a case in Clashmore.  Although the incident occurred a month or more ago the inquiry has been delayed, and whenever I ask for the result I am put off from week to week.  I want to know when the Minister is going to give the result of that inquiry.  That is one case.  There is another case in which other Deputies were interested.</P>

      <P>Then there was an outrageous case in County Clare that has been already referred to, the case of Hasset and Cahill.  There has been an absolute refusal to hold an inquiry in that case, although affidavits have been sworn as to what actually happened.  The Minister had the effrontery to suggest that those two men were perjurers, that he attached no importance to the sworn word of two individuals, although two public bodies had made representations, as well as representatives from two parties in <Col N="2327" /> this House.  It is not too late for the Minister to mend his hand and to hold an inquiry into some of these cases.  I should like to know if he proposes to do so.  Then we have the case of a detective officer who was convicted of an assault and who has not been dismissed from the force. We have had the cases of raids on the president, the secretary and the treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Cumann in Drogheda in November last.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise.  I was not in the House when this understanding was <Col N="2328" /> come to.  I understood that the general discussion covering the two Votes should be taken on this Vote, and that details on the question of the administration of the force would be taken on Vote No. 32.  If the Deputy is merely quoting certain cases in order to substantiate the general case he is making I will allow him to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the case I mentioned in Drogheda.  It was purely a political one, and there was no inquiry held.  There was a case in Bantry, where the house of Michael Callaghan was entered and the people were put to great inconvenience. He had gone away from the place.  If the Minister for Justice were a real Minister for Justice he would be careful of the interests of all these citizens, having regard to the two Articles of the Constitution which I quoted.  We asked the Minister to give us a list of the people who had been raided and arrested in the city of Dublin.  He refused to give us any list.  I wonder even if he has a record of the number.  One of the officers admitted that he did not know how many people had been arrested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a quiet way of saying the most subversive things, which stop one thinking. And this, too, in a House which is supposed to represent the whole country, and where the interests of all the citizens are supposed to be protected.  The Minister for Justice <Col N="2329" /> has the face to say that he will not give the names of people who have been arrested, not only once but several times.  Under what kind of justice are we living?  What is the meaning of these two clauses in the Constitution?  Are they just nineteenth century liberalism, as the Minister for Defence calls it, or have they any meaning at all?  Surely we are entitled to the names of those arrested, the reasons for the arrests, how long they have been arrested for and generally, the information asked for by a very large and representative body in this House.  The Minister cannot continually go on treating half of this nation as criminals, even if a Deputy fresh from the polls says that perjurers are as common in Ireland as crows. If the things that are said about the Irish now had been said by Chief Secretaries under the old régime, the Irish people would have risen in a rage of indignation against them. As somebody said in history, when you want to roast an Irishman you will always get another Irishman to turn the spit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, while the Minister for Justice has that outlook, that at least 500,000 in this country are associated with crime, one must come to the conclusion that they will think this country is in a state of civil war.  Everything the Minister for Defence said pointed to a state of mind on his part in which he cannot think of this country except as in a state of civil war.  He is thinking of conditions as they were five or six years ago. He cannot get away from the atmosphere of civil war.  He bulks all Republicans with criminals and then he says that all these <Col N="2330" /> criminals are common criminals and not even political criminals.  I do not know if the Minister for Justice agrees with him.  If he does not, I hope he will repudiate him, because certainly an attitude of mind of that sort controlling the Ministry of Justice in any country is about the most undesirable that one could imagine.  The only protection this country has at present from civil war is the sense of humour which exists in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to take the thunderings of the Ministers on the other side seriously we should be sending emissaries to Mexico or some place like that to get experts in arms and ammunition in order to defend ourselves.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil is a perfectly clearly defined one, however much the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Defence may try to cloud that attitude.  It is possible that a de jure government of a country may be so defeated that it becomes necessary for all citizens to take up an attitude of accepting the de facto government in the interests of the general public and in the interests of maintaining conditions of peace and good order as the only thing to be done under the circumstances.  Those who stood for the complete independence of Ireland, those who stood for the Republic of Ireland&mdash;I do not think any of us are ashamed of having stood for that, and I think a great many members not in the Fianna Fáil Party are as proud of having stood for the Republic as we are&mdash;will all admit that a position arose where it became impossible to maintain the establishment of that body.  We hold that the Government, such as it is in this country, is a de facto Government. We are in this House because we represent a certain number of the Irish people, and we recognise this House in so far as it represents the Irish people.  At the same time, we are not going to give up the old ideals.</P>
