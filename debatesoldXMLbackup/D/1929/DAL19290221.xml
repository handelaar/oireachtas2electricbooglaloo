      <P>asked the President whether he has made any representations to the British Government based on the Report of the Committee on Claims of British Ex-Servicemen in respect of &ldquo;the nature and extent of the claims made by such Ex-Servicemen against the British Government in respect of rights alleged to have arisen out of past services;&rdquo; and, if not, if he will state whether it is his intention to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I quite understand that, but the Deputy will realise also, that it is a considerable Report and that at the present moment the attention of the Executive Council is directed to more business than perhaps is the case at any other time of the year and in consequence it is impossible to indicate what action will be taken in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Ministry therefore is prepared to allow the factory to continue canvassing individual growers and to break up the Association?  If that is allowed to continue, the Association will be left without any bargaining power whatsoever.  May I ask the Minister whether any steps have been taken to prevent the factory approaching individual growers except through the Association, and have those steps been taken by the Government?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state the total number of civil servants whose positions are governed by Article X. of the Treaty; the number of such officers who have applied to retire under that Article; the total number of such applications received to date; the total lump sum payments arising out of such applications (a) already made, (b) yet to be made, and (c) to be made as additional payments consequent upon the decision in the Wigg-Cochrane case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>All civil servants who were transferred to the Provisional Government or to the Government of the Irish Free State by virtue of any transfer of services from the British Government are governed by Article 10 of the Treaty.  The number of officers concerned was 21,035.  To date, the number of such officers who have applied to retire in consequence of the change of Government effected by the Treaty is 1,639.  Of these, compensation on retirement has been awarded in 978 cases: 280 applications have been disallowed or withdrawn or otherwise disposed of; the remainder are awaiting adjudication.  The total lump sum payments by way of additional allowance or gratuity made to officers who have retired under Article 10 as distinct from those who have been awarded compensation on discharge terms, is £208,520.  It is not possible <Col N="176" /> to compute the lump sum payments yet to be made in respect of pending or future applications to retire in advance of the determination of such applications by the proposed new Statutory Tribunal.  As regards the concluding part of the question, any figures that could now be given would have reference only to cases in which awards have been already made.  The actual figures are at present being compiled in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the Dublin newspapers of February 8th that a number of men have been engaged recently in excavating a rath at Rathmore, Co. Roscommon, in the hope of discovering treasure; whether there is at present any legal machinery to prevent such vandalism or to bring the perpetrators to justice; if not, whether proposals for legislation with this end in view may be expected, and how soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that two men began excavating a rath at Rathmore, Co. Roscommon, about a fortnight ago for the purpose of searching for articles of archæological value.  They ceased operations after one day, not having discovered anything of interest.</P>
      <P>The Ancient Monuments Protection Act, 1882, provides for the vesting in the Board of Works of ancient monuments and for the punishment of persons who injure or deface such monuments. I understand, however, that the rath referred to in the question has not been vested in the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>A Bill to provide for the better protection of ancient monuments and places of archæological importance is in contemplation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been called to a statement made in the Central Criminal Court on 17th December, 1928, and reported in the daily Press on 18th December, 1928, in a case in which Patrick J. Glynn and Mary C. Jennings were charged with having set fire to the residence <Col N="178" />&ldquo;Bloomville,&rdquo; Offaly, on the night of May 3rd, 1928, with intent to defraud; whether he is aware that the defendant (Glynn) in the course of examination is reported as having stated that in a conversation with him (Glynn) at the door of &ldquo;Bloomville&rdquo; a sergeant of the Gárda Síochána said he was going to arrest Miss Jennings' sister, and also Messrs. Davin and Gorry; whether there is any evidence in the possession of the Gárda Síochána or any grounds for suspicion that the two latter persons were in any respect implicated in the case, and whether the sergeant concerned made any statement to the accused imputing to Messrs. Davin and Gorry guilty knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this matter has already been the subject of correspondence between us, and as regards the sergeant I have really nothing to add to my letter of the 19th ultimo, in which I informed the Deputy that the sergeant in question denies that he used the words attributed to him by Mr. Glynn.  There is, of course, no foundation for any suggestion by anybody that either Deputy Davin or Deputy Gorry was in any way implicated in the criminal charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly a question, but I will take it as a question.  The suggestion is that somebody representing the Government is to act in this dispute as an arbitrator, and at the same time the Government is to commit itself to a definite line of policy in the Dáil this evening.  What is the object of that?  There is no Deputy in the Dáil but knows that an arbitrator who has taken one side or other before an arbitration comes on is impossible.  We may have our own views, but you put yourself out of court as an arbitrator if you have to make a definite statement before the case comes off.  We are being pressed here, in whose interests?  to make this definite statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the reasons why the water supply has been cut off from the inhabitants of Finner in the neighbourhood of the Finner Camp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finner Camp pumping machinery was closed down for the winter season in October last on the withdrawal of the battalions which <Col N="180" /> had occupied the Camp during the summer training season, and since then the local residents affected continue to obtain water from a well within the Camp area.</P>
      <P>The expense of working the pumping plant during the winter season, including the employment of a skilled attendant, would not be justified by the small revenue of £3 a year derivable from the dozen local residents who use the standpipe on the roadside boundary of the Camp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the camp was closed for a much longer period when the British Army occupied it, that a similar amount of money was paid, and that these people had the use of the tap on the roadside with the minimum of expense to the Government?  If the Minister is satisfied that the tank is in order, if it is filled it will last the winter.  If it is out of order it will not last.

I have a note here stating: &ldquo;Difficulty has been experienced by the Department of Defence in recovering arrears of this water-rate which have accumulated since 1922.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the British Government had that same difficulty.  Anyway, I think the Ballyshannon Town Commissioners had a proposal before them last November with the object of their undertaking the working of the pumping station pending the re-opening of the camp for summer training.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Supplementary Vote arises out of the increased travelling <Col N="185" /> that has been done by Deputies. The figure in the original Estimate was based on the amount of travelling that had been done before the entry of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  But, as a matter of fact, the cost of travelling is more than proportionate to the number of Deputies actually sitting in the House. It is probably due to the fact that, owing to narrow majorities, the attendance of Deputies who have actually taken their seats is better than it was. The result is that instead of an expenditure of £7,800, as was expected, it is likely that the expenditure will amount to about £9,900.  To some extent the change made by the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1928, has caused an increase, and I feel that some investigation will have to be made into the question of motor charges in certain instances.  There has been a great increase also in the travelling of Deputies during the recess.  For instance, the railway companies' claim for vouchers for the month of January last, when the Dáil was in recess, amounted to £205.  However, the expenditure here depends on the travelling actually done by Deputies.</P>

      <P>In connection with this matter, it strikes me that the Great Southern Railways have reduced fares recently, and that reduction applies to all classes of travelling.  I should like to know if they have placed these cheap facilities at the disposal of the Oireachtas.  This reduction applies to two days' travelling, which probably could be availed of by Deputies, as it applies to all classes.  As to classes, as far as I am concerned, third-class would do me as well as first.</P>

      <P>As to what Deputy Kennedy has said, would it not be possible to enter into some arrangement with the railway companies by which, on the presentation of a voucher, Deputies would be allowed to travel to and from their constituencies?  It strikes me as most unfair on the part of the railway company to expect full fares all the year round for Deputies.  I submit that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or whatever committee is competent to deal with this, should go into the whole question.  It is a source of inconvenience to many Deputies to have to go to the office here and get a voucher, and then exchange that voucher at the railway terminus in order to get to their homes.  I do not suggest that any Deputies want to travel when they can possibly avoid it. Personally, I have diffidence in travelling on public business unless it accumulates for some time and when it is incumbent on me to visit Government departments, as I do not care for railway travelling.  Whatever Committee is competent to deal with the matter should take steps so as to obviate a good deal of trouble and annoyance caused to Deputies.  That might be one way to economise.  It is not for me to suggest anything but, at the same time, there is a considerable loss of officials' time, not to speak of the time of Deputies, and that loss must be represented somewhere on the balance-sheet of the nation.  I suggest that some committee should go into the whole matter, and that a voucher of some sort should be given to a Deputy, thus obviating some of the trouble and cost entailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was actually raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and it was pointed out that from the beginning the railway companies had refused to give any concession of any sort or kind or description to this House or Government in relation to railway affairs.  At that time, of course, the railways were in a completely monopolistic position as far as the transport of the country was concerned.  A recommendation went forward from the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to the Minister <Col N="187" /> that now, in the new conditions and as there were alternative means of transport, the question of fares for Dáil members should be revised under the new and altered conditions.  It was suggested that possibly they might give contracts at prices which otherwise they would not have given, or, at any rate, that they would recognise the position had changed, and that they would have to give a commercial price for the services that they rendered relative to the other alternative methods. I would like to know now whether those recommendations have been dealt with, whether they have been put to the railway companies, and whether any result has come from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe if the Department of Finance approached the railway companies, the companies would be prepared to give special facilities so far as Deputies' tickets are concerned. I notice that when a Deputy gets a travelling voucher handed to him, it is mentioned on the voucher that it is for a first class return ticket at ordinary fare.  Some Deputies find it possible to visit their constituencies on a Saturday and return on a Tuesday. According to the voucher issued, the Deputy gets a first class return ticket for a month.  I believe the Department could make arrangements for the issue of week-end tickets to Deputies who find it convenient to visit their constituents at week-ends.  I understand the railway companies are prepared to give out these week-end tickets at single fare and one-third available for ordinary passengers, and if the Department of Finance made application, I believe the railway companies would be prepared to give them these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister's remarks that an investigation may possibly be required, and that he is of opinion that travelling facilities afforded to Deputies are abused, or that there is too much zeal shown by Deputies in attending to their constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the travelling facilities given to Deputies were being abused, although there <Col N="188" /> has been, in respect to a certain class of claims, an extraordinary increase since the Act of 1928 was passed.  These are claims in connection with travelling between the railway station in the Deputy's constituency and his residence. There has been an extraordinary increase there.  However, that is a matter that can be examined and that I shall have to examine further.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is exactly the present position in regard to the latest attempt to get railway companies to give some sort of concession to members of the Oireachtas.  But I do know that time after time applications of one sort or another had been made to them, and they have consistently refused to give any concessions whatsoever.  I think the position of the railway companies in this matter is not peculiar.  All sorts of institutions charge more in any case in which the Government is paying than where private individuals are paying. I do not think it would be possible to get rid of the present voucher system.  Even with this system, at least one or two cases came to the knowledge of the Department of Finance, on the report of the railway companies, where Deputies had made a wrong use of the vouchers, and where tickets issued in exchange for these vouchers were actually travelled on by people who were not members of the Oireachtas.  That happened in one or two instances, and that is just enough, I think, to make it necessary to retain the present system. It might be that if we could do without the arrangement that exists a certain amount of official time would be saved, but on consideration of the matter some time ago, it was very strongly felt that an arrangement like the present one was a necessary arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been recognised that where a Deputy or a Senator claims that he is travelling on public business he should be entitled to have his expenses paid.  I think it is only fair, where a man has definite business with a department, that it should be recognised that that is practically as much a duty cast upon him by his membership of the Dáil as attending in the House.  Members must come with deputations or to represent some urgent business to a department, and I think it is entirely reasonable that in these cases expenses should be <Col N="189" /> paid.  I have, however, had my attention called to certain cases where Deputies or Senators came up with a sort of regularity on a particular day of the month that seemed to indicate it was not entirely public business that brought them.  I was proposing, in view of the fact that the cost in regard to travelling had definitely increased, that this matter should be looked into, and if I see a case I will make representations to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £175,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the payment of Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1924, for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith, and for pensions under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate arises out of an Act which was passed by the Oireachtas about this time last year.  When the Bill was before the House, I estimated that the additional expense would be £150,000 in the first year, and ultimately £175,000.  That estimate was based on a certain number of sample cases, the facts of which were examined by the Revenue Department.  It proved, however, that the amount of the Estimate was rather lower than it ought to have been.  Moreover, recently partly through the benefit of the doubt being more consistently given to pension claimants than in the past, a tendency that previously existed, for the number of old age pensioners to decline, has stopped; and in the last two or three years there has rather been a tendency <Col N="190" /> for the number of people in receipt of old age pensions to increase.  That tendency, together with the increased charge thrown upon the Exchequer by the Act of last year, accounts for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>The motion for £175,000 is for a very large amount.  The House ought not to pass it without a very considerable sense of responsibility. The responsibility for this amount rests not so much upon the Minister as upon the whole House.  The whole House is responsible for this increase in expenditure, and this increase in expenditure will have to be met out of revenue.  That ought to be clearly understood.  This amount has absorbed the whole of the £150,000 which the Minister for Finance is going to get next year out of his woollen tariff.  I think we ought very clearly to understand that in passing this Estimate, <Col N="191" /> however willing we may be to do it, we are committing ourselves, and have as a House committed ourselves to an expenditure of that money which we will have either to find or to save.  I suggest that in passing it, we should do so with deliberate advertence to that responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a sum of £500,000 originally voted for the purchase of the Condensed Milk Company. All that money was not spent in 1926-27, the year in which it was voted. Only £303,000 out of the £500,000 was spent in the year in which it was voted.  The Company had to be liquidated and its assets transferred.  We proceeded to spend the balance of the Estimate on the following year, and we expended more of it in the year 1928-29. We were hoping to spend more of it but this matter came before the Public Accounts Committee and as a matter of procedure, they decided that it was not strictly correct to spend this money which was voted in 1926-27.  It was suggested by the Committee that the money that remained unspent in 1926-27 should be re-voted.  That is why we are applying for this Vote of £303,487.  It is really a question of financial procedure, book-keeping if you like.  It has been discussed with regard to its principles and details already. The principle has been discussed by all parties in the House and has been agreed on.  The details have not, but the details and the general principle have been discussed time and time again.

While I agree on that, I will put this point: where a big sum of money is given for a purpose which is not exactly to cover the services a Government Department usually carries out, it has to be spent as a commercial proposition. It might have been better if it took the form of a grant-in-aid with a note to the effect that this money was not to be surrendered.  That could be brought before the House, and the grant-in-aid could be discussed from the point of view that the Minister was asking for money which was not to be surrendered.  It is difficult in a matter of buying and selling when you have not definitely before your mind the amount of money at your disposal. You are in some difficulty if you agree with a vendor to give him £X and then you are not absolutely sure that you have that money when the actual time for buying comes.  I agree that the point is only one of detail, because once the House has approved the general principle, Deputies are most unlikely to deny the money to carry out the details of the scheme.</P>

      <P>There is a sum for special agricultural schemes in congested districts and the additional estimate is £1,885.  The original estimate was £36,975.  There was, in fact £38,860 spent with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The difference was found by using savings in another sub-head. The transaction came before the Public Accounts Committee, and they were of opinion that the amount should have been revoted&mdash;that we should vote a supplementary estimate.  I quite agree. The appropriations-in-aid and the savings made under other sub-heads equal the amounts set out under sub-head I and sub-head M.6.  If the Deputy adds £9,428 opposite appropriations-in-aid, and also £14,157, savings on other sub-heads, and equally if he adds £21,700 opposite sub-head M.6 and £1,885 opposite sub-head I, he will get the figure £23,585.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which should be given very special consideration, more especially by Deputies representing <Col N="195" /> such areas as Donegal, Mayo or Galway.  In this Supplementary Estimate we are asked to re-vote a sum of £303,487.  The most of that money is being expended on the purchase of creameries.  Those creameries are being purchased in counties where there is fertile land.  The taxpayers all over the twenty-six counties are asked to subscribe their quota towards the amount of purchase money.  The taxpayers in Donegal, Mayo and Galway are not getting much advantage out of this scheme.  It is true that under the Estimate there is an additional sum of £1,885 being devoted to schemes in the congested districts.  I suggest to the Minister, in view of the poverty existing in those districts, that the figure asked for is not near enough, especially when we take into consideration the amount to be expended on the purchase of creameries elsewhere, in counties where they are much better off than we are in the congested areas.</P>

      <P>This is like the previous Estimate; it is completely a paper Supplementary Estimate.  If the exigencies of strict accounting could be reconciled with the ordinary man's ideas of common sense, there would be no necessity at all for this Supplementary Estimate.  It arises from the practice which the public accounting system occasionally requires of transferring the figures on one side of the account of a particular sub-head to another, or in some cases to another Department, leaving the other side untouched. This Supplementary Estimate is made up of a sum under sub-head A, Dockyard Maintenance, with an additional sum required of £2,300.  This was originally under sub-head D and it was required to pay wages of maintenance staff, and under that particular sub-head there is actually a big saving of £2,500 which more than wipes it out.  The next item is under sub-head B, Ship Repairing Work. The original Estimate was only a token Vote of £100 and the revised Estimate was £1,500.  If we were allowed there to take into account as an Appropriation-in-Aid the amount of money saved we would also have a big saving amounting to £4,467 to date.  It will probably be more at the end of the financial year&mdash;another £500&mdash;but this has to be transferred to the receipts payable to the Exchequer.  As regards sub-head C. this is accounted for by the fact that we have a certain amount of inferior coal which was dumped into this dockyard by another Department. We cannot in this particular Vote take <Col N="197" /> credit for the fact that at the present time coal can be purchased at a lower price.  There was a question of writing that off originally, that extra amount, but apparently in order to carry out the system of accounting necessary, it has to be shown here as a loss.  It was originally purchased by the Department of Industry and Commerce so that, in reality, there is no necessity for the Supplementary Estimate.  It is only a paper Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>After the amazingly clear explanation, the House knows that it is going to vote what is quite unnecessary. What Department sold Haulbowline coal at an uneconomic price? Question No. 1.  How much was paid to that Department, and at what price, and why?  For fuel, light and water, the original Estimate was £1,900, but the actual expenditure was £4,200. Cannot any of these Departments estimate within 100 per cent. of their requirements? Who uses this fuel, light and water?  How many people are living on Haulbowline Island?  Who are the people living there?  What rents are they paying, and why are those who are not paying rent not doing so? These are all questions which arise upon the Estimate, and no single one of them has been answered.  I understand that there was about £4,500 spent on the transport of 77 men from a place where they were supposed to be employed to a place where they were not supposed to be employed. How much of this fuel, light and water went to that funny little game?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Flinn that Haulbowline cannot be said to be a purely economic business proposition. I understand that a good deal of one-time valuable machinery is being scrapped and sold at scrap prices.  If that process is to continue, I very much fear that we will have to say good-bye to anything in the nature of progress in what was once a very progressive dockyard.  I do not want to make a cheap joke at the expense of the Government, but in view of the promises made at a very recent general election by the Government candidates and their supporters, and the very rosy pictures that were painted of the future prosperity of Haulbowline when certain developments of the Shannon scheme would take place, I would suggest very seriously that the Minister should consider the manufacture there of many accessories and other electrical plant which will be necessitated by the Shannon scheme.  Such work, in my opinion, could be usefully undertaken in Haulbowline.  I do not believe that the country is bankrupt in good business men and good business brains, and I have every hope, if the Government were seriously to contemplate Haulbowline and were to use the resources provided <Col N="199" /> there by the present plant, it would not be the white elephant it appears to be.  I am not going to stand up for inefficiency or for a policy that would suggest that the Government should spoon-feed every industry in this country.  I recognise my responsibility to the State just as much, perhaps, as the Minister for Finance.  I can quite understand and appreciate the attitude of the Minister for Finance, or any other Minister who is charged with the responsibility of Government.  I do not want to indulge in any cheap sneers at the Government Departments because they do not indulge in uneconomic adventures, but because of my convictions, and because of my practice not to attempt to exploit either party politics or party prejudice, or to play to the gallery in any way, I wish to suggest certain things to the Minister with all seriousness.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated in his speeches, and I am convinced that he examined the question seriously, that we might expect developments at Haulbowline from the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>The question I put to the Parliamentary Secretary was how much the Department expected to receive in respect of the hire overseas of a tugboat attached to the dockyard, in view of the fact that there follows this statement: &ldquo;The cost of equipment <Col N="201" /> for hire overseas of a tugboat is charged to a sub-head of this Vote.&rdquo; We wish to know, if it is worth while spending money under sub-head B, how much money has been received from the sale of surplus machinery apart from the hire of the tugboat. These are perfectly legitimate questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree; I can give you that information.  As the Deputy put the question at first I did not understand it.  The amount received from the hire of the tugboat &ldquo;Dainty&rdquo; was £1,887; from the sale of plant and old stores, £2,568; ship repairing work, £111; rent, £32; firewood, etc., £59, making a total of £4,657.</P>

      <P>I do not know what purpose the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department had in suggesting to the House that whereas they had actually up to date received £4,657 they were going only to receive something like £2,500.  I think that is even from the point of view of ordinary commercial candour and plain straight dealing with the House, very wrong. After having heard that admission from the Parliamentary Secretary we are now able to understand his mentality when he stated that this was a mere paper Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We now realise the spirit in which this Department and the Department with which it is associated come to this House.  It is only, I think, something less than four months ago since we were called upon to pass the original Estimate in which there appeared this sum of £100 for ship repairing work, £1,900 for fuel, light and water, making altogether, with the amount of the Vote under sub-head A, a total Vote of something like £17,000.  Within three months we are asked to increase that by £2,500, and in respect of one of the items we are asked to increase it by something more than 125 per cent. over the original Estimate.  In order, as it were, to <Col N="202" /> cover up the absolutely loose way in which this Department handled public monies, we are told that there will be, in respect of sub-head B, a total saving of £3,500.  Now we find that so far from there having been any sort of saving, actually realisable assets to the value of £2,568 have been sold, and so far to date there has been only credited against this Estimate, a sum of £2,500. In addition, a certain sum of money amounting to £1,887 has been received as a result of the hire of a tug, but the net effect of it is this, that whereas we were told in order to provide fuel, light and water on that island for a certain number of people the State was to spend £1,900, we are asked now to increase that Estimate to £4,200.  In addition the fact is concealed from the House, or would have been concealed from the House were it not for the &ldquo;silly questions&rdquo; that were put, that a sum of £2,157 had been received but had not been admitted in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Again I would like to direct attention to the questions raised by Deputy Flinn.  How does it come that this Vote is charged with £4,200 under sub-head C, fuel, light and water, whereas the original Estimate was for £1,900?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I can explain.  Originally we estimated on the assumption that we would be allowed credit for the surplus amount we had to pay.  Owing to the fact that we had to take over a certain quantity of surplus coal that was originally purchased years ago by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at the time of the fuel famine it was purchased at a higher rate and is of much inferior quality to anything we can get now.  It was discussed whether it could be written off or not.  Eventually it was decided that it could not be written off, but that the Estimate would have to bear the full amount.  It is only a paper transaction, and if the amount did not appear here it would have to appear somewhere else.  The coal was purchased during the year 1926.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,824 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for Grants in Aid of the Expenses of University Institutions, including Grants under the Irish Universities Act, 1908, the Land Act, 1923, and the University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Vote is taken for the purpose of providing the National University&mdash;that is the University as distinct from the Constituent Colleges &mdash;with funds for the acquisition of premises for its general purposes and for making permanent improvements to the premises required.  Under Section 15 of the University Education (Agricultural and Dairy Science) Act, 1926, the grant for the acquisition of premises was not to exceed £4,000, and the grant for improvements was fixed at £900.  In return for this grant the National University agreed at the time the Bill was being framed to sell premises which they had acquired under Section 7, subsection (3) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908.  It is provided by Section 14 of the Act of 1926 that the proceeds will be paid into the Exchequer.  The premises that are to be sold by the University have not all been disposed of, but three houses have been sold.  60, 61, and 62 Upper Mount Street have been sold.  They have realised £3,892, which has been paid into the Exchequer.  When the remaining houses have been sold the amount obtained will substantially exceed the amount that is now being asked for for the University.  The University bought the houses originally for the purpose of erecting university premises on the sites; they intended to have them pulled down.  There remain to be sold numbers 55, 56, 57 Upper Mount Street, and 29 and 30 Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  The University had got plans for the erection of University buildings.  Then, when the war broke out, this was stopped and the houses have been let since.  Of course, the idea <Col N="206" /> of a University building, such as was contemplated originally, has been abandoned, and the University have now purchased a couple of houses.  They have purchased two houses in Merrion Square, Nos. 48 and 49, and expended the £900 provided or rather more on permanent improvements.  They will serve as University buildings.  As to the other houses which were bought out of the Parliamentary grant, they will be sold, the whole lot, and the proceeds paid into the Exchequer.  Three of them have been sold and have realised almost £4,000.  The remaining houses will be sold as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>Yes, a good deal more. As against this £4,824 which we are now voting we have already received £3,892 out of the proceeds of Nos. 60, 61 and 62 Upper Mount Street.  There remain to be sold Nos. 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 Upper Mount Street, together with 29 and 30 Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  When they are sold the proceeds will be paid into the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I notice grants to the National University under Section 15 of the University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Act.  Is it proposed to erect a new building and use that in connection with a chair of agriculture, or what exact purpose do these grants serve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Originally, under the Act of 1908, it was arranged that a sum of £140,000 would be allocated to the University as distinct from the colleges for University buildings.  At that time it was contemplated that there should be University buildings on an extensive scale and these houses were purchased.  It was intended to pull them down and to erect University buildings on the site.  The war intervened and no University buildings were erected.  The University let these houses and carried on in a couple of houses in one of these squares.  Now it appears there is no need for University buildings on that scale. When the University Education <Col N="207" /> (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Act was being passed it was decided formally to abandon by legislation the idea of extensive University buildings. It is provided that the University would be given a fresh grant of £4,000 to purchase existing premises for a University building and a sum not exceeding £900 to effect permanent improvements.  In exchange for that new grant the houses that had been purchased for so much of the £40,000 that had been expended&mdash;about £13,000&mdash;should be sold and the proceeds paid into the Exchequer.  The University have now purchased buildings that are to be permanent and have effected improvements, and the payment which is to be made under the Act falls due.  We have already received the sum of £3,892 from the University, and we will obtain as the other houses are disposed of a further substantial sum.</P>

I understand from the Minister that the scheme that he spoke of as having been abandoned was abandoned before the introduction of the original Estimates, that this actual expenditure was a new departure, and that in fact the £13,000 that would result from the sale of the houses would come into the Exchequer in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this Supplementary Estimate is the difficulty, I might say the impossibility, of gauging correctly the effect of the School Attendance Act on the attendance at schools.  There was a warning issued, I think, by the Public Accounts Committee, that we should make as close an estimate as possible, and especially avoid over-estimation.  Consequently, we did cut the Estimate as tight as we could, but the attendance at national schools was larger than we anticipated, with the result that the consequential expenses in the way of increased salaries and increased capitation grants came to £19,000.  There was a similar increase in the grant for the heating and cleaning of schools.  In other portions of the Vote there are savings amounting to about £6,000, leaving a Supplementary Estimate of £13,850.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that fully.  You may take it, so far as evening schools are concerned, that as a general rule if the classes can be continued up to 31st March, and if they come to an end on 31st March, we will see whether they cannot be paid.  If new courses are now opened and continued beyond the 31st March that raises a different question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just this point.  I should like to ask the Minister how the saving of £150 on school requisites was effected.  Was it by penalising certain schools in regard to free school requisites? Were there fewer applications or was the Department more stringent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <P>As regards Deputy O'Connell's point, do I take it from <Col N="210" /> what the Minister has said that there is no question of shutting down these evening schools before the 31st March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It really depends on whether the course of lectures will come to an end by the 31st March. In some cases what we have done is not to sanction the starting of new schools, schools which cannot come to an end on the 31st March.  I wish to make it quite clear, so far as continuation education is concerned, that we do not think that this particular action will lead in any way to detrimental results. I hope to be in a position in the summer to introduce a Bill dealing with Technical and Continuation Education. However, that raises another matter altogether.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Fahy has pointed out, practically the same cause is responsible for this Supplementary Estimate.  It is impossible, as anybody who knows the situation will appreciate, to estimate at the beginning of the year quite accurately as to what the attendance at secondary <Col N="211" /> schools will be.  For a couple of years we did overestimate to the extent of £12,000 or £13,000.  This year the attendance has exceeded expectations, with the result that the capitation grants will have to be increased; and that is also responsible for the excess of £1,250 under sub-head B&mdash;&ldquo;Increments of Salaries&rdquo;&mdash;because there will be a larger number of recognised teachers in the schools as a result of the increased attendance.</P>

These would be A 1 schools.  Then there are B 1 and B 2, in which there are a certain number of subjects taught through Irish.  They get a certain percentage also on the capitation grant.

      <P>This is a sum of £10 as a token Vote for money that was expended during the two years, 1923-24 and 1925-26. There was a Wound Pensions Act passed in 1923 and certain applicants under that Act, who were wounded men, and who had applied for pensions, had to come to Dublin.  It was necessary, both in their own interest and in the interest of diminishing the amount of the pension that they would be due to receive, to give them medical treatment in St. Bricin's Hospital.  There was no provision in the Estimate in these years for that treatment, and the expenditure under that head was disallowed by the Public Accounts Committee. Therefore, the sum expended will be met out of savings in the current year, with the exception of this token £10.  The Supplementary Estimate is brought in arising out of the Public Accounts Committee's decision that it was not covered in the Estimates for these years and that it should be covered now.</P>

      <P>May I take it that what the Minister really means to convey by the introduction of the Estimate is somewhat the same as applies to the Minister for Agriculture?  Certain payments were made over a certain period which the Public Accounts Committee found could not be entertained under the interpretation of the Act covering such payments, and that after a number of years the Department finds that in order to regularise the expenditure already made they must get these payments brought into order&mdash;that it is only a token Vote and involves no expenditure?</P>

      <P>This is a suggestion that in the event of an equality of votes the presiding Chairman shall have the right to exercise a casting vote.  As the matter stands at present, and as I fancy it always will stand, there will be a certain fixed majority.  As the Bill originally stood there was to be a majority of four out of five, before any decision could be come to.  An amendment was carried last night enlarging the number of the Committee from five to nine, and there is another amendment later on that there should be a majority of at least six out of these nine before a publication could be censored.  In these circumstances, I cannot see how it could possibly arise that the Chairman would have a casting vote.  I think it is completely out of harmony with the whole scheme of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment to the effect that meetings of the Board shall be held in public.  I do not think that would be at all beneficial.  I am slightly afraid that this large committee of nine may have a tendency to degenerate a bit into a debating society.  That is possible, but if the meetings were held in public I am afraid it would almost certainly develop into a debating society. Besides, I think it would be very undesirable that debates of this kind <Col N="215" /> should be held in public.  What they would be debating would be as to whether such and such a book was or was not indecent, and as to whether such and such a passage was or was not indecent.  I am afraid those public debates would be attended by all the prurient-minded persons in Dublin, and that there would be a great deal of reading of immoral passages for their delectation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 6 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Complaints made under this Act shall be subscribed by not less than ten persons, being resident citizens of Saorstát Eireann, each of whom shall make a statutory declaration that he has read the whole of the book or of the particular edition in question of the book which is the subject of the complaint, or in the case of a periodical that he has read several successive issues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section is intended to provide machinery for the initiation of proceedings under this Bill.  When I read it I thought the underlying idea was to prevent the Minister and his Department from being bombarded with letters and correspondence from cranks and busybodies.  I thought the idea was to provide some kind of a sieve that would keep out trivial and unnecessary applications that would completely block the machinery of the Bill. But the Minister in his speech on the Second Reading said that his purpose in bringing in this section was to provide some machinery for working the Bill.  I think I am representing him correctly when I say that he felt that if it were left to people generally to provide the initiative nothing would be done.  That has often happened. Everybody's business is nobody's business. On the other hand, looking at the scheme to provide for initiating proceedings it seems to me to be open to some very serious objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out by many speakers in the House that the obligation to purify the State in regard to its literature, at any rate, is an obligation which rests on everyone of us as citizens. It is to our sense of civic responsibility that we must look to get the backing that will make this Bill really operative.  Unless this Bill has got the respect and confidence of the masses of the people it will not be operative. I think the Minister is taking an undemocratic line and making a mistake, a political mistake, in trying to vest the civic conscience in groups of purity experts, however high-minded they may be.  That is what it comes to.  I think <Col N="217" /> the ordinary man in the street will view the action of such groups with a certain suspicion, sometimes perhaps with a little bit of tolerant pity.  He will not have much confidence in them. There will be some who will look upon such groups and associations as a sort of moral C.I.D., or even worse, as ethical informers.  I think that is a grave mistake.  What I propose is that we leave the ordinary citizen the right &mdash;and it is his right&mdash;if he thinks a book is objectionable and is ready to make a proper study of that book and to make a serious declaration that he thinks there is something objectionable in it, to approach the Minister directly. That does not cut out any association if the associations are earnest in their work, and I know they are earnest.  I am the last person to depreciate what they have done.  They can act under the system I have suggested as an alternative. I proposed that complaints under this Act should be subscribed by not less than ten persons.  I am not bound to say any particular number. I want at least three residents in Saorstát Eireann, each of whom shall make a statutory declaration that he has read the whole of the book or of the particular edition in question of the book which is the subject of complaint, or in the case of a periodical, that he has read several successive issues.  The only objection I have seen to the proposal I have made is on the ground of expense.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have enlightened the objector on that score. The cost of a statutory declaration is exactly nothing. As to the cost of books, I do not see why more books should be bought when a group of people unorganised read them than when a group read them in an association. That objection to the suggestion I have made is, I think, completely pointless. I do not say it is made with any unfairness. But in fact it is an unfair objection.  I made this proposal after long thought, earnestly desiring to provide machinery that would be of a thoroughly democratic nature and would do something to impress upon the ordinary citizen his sense of responsibility. That would give the Bill a <Col N="218" /> wider basis in the conscience of the people.  Because if you have associations they will be localised, and it is the opinion of a man in Donegal and a man in Cork that I want as well as the opinion of a man in Dublin.  I do suggest to the Minister that this amendment which I have proposed is in principle sound and more in keeping with our constitutional outlook than the principle of the section that he has framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is put I want to say that I had an amendment in here to delete the whole section.  I assume that the reason that it did not appear was that it might be considered a direct negative.  The reason for deleting the section was, that when you come to Deputy Alton's amendment there is the question of vested interests and I suppose that that imposes or would impose eventually, as a natural consequence, costs upon the State.  If you are by this Bill to recognise associations, that may be only the thin edge of the wedge, until some other day those associations may have to be paid and provision may have to be made for the controlling and working of those associations.  I think it is a dangerous precedent to establish that any body of people coming together for such purposes as might be required under this Bill should get a status and an interest and be controlled and directed in such a way that it might impose liability upon the State and upon the Exchequer.  When the Bill becomes law it is the officers of the law that should carry out those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting Deputy Alton's amendment.  On a previous occasion when discussing this Bill, I think I said that I looked upon the setting up of those associations as the beginning of an era when we would have multiplied the number of Nosey Parkers in existence.  I have seen and heard nothing since to alter that opinion.  It is only reasonable to expect that the author will be as a prisoner charged with an indictable offence&mdash;he is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty.  All this amendment seeks to do is to put a very moderate request, a very reasonable request&mdash;it seeks to provide that the persons <Col N="219" /> must have read the whole book or at least some portion of the serial before passing judgment upon it and before referring it to the Board as a periodical or book that should not be read under this Bill.  It would be, manifestly, unfair to the reading public and to literature generally if, say, two or three religious fanatics, some of whom&mdash;or all of whom&mdash;perhaps could lay no possible claim to having any literary knowledge in the broadest and fullest sense of the term, could be enabled under this Bill after having perhaps, cursorily, glanced through the pages of a magazine or a newspaper or a particular book and having discovered in that book or magazine or newspaper some passage or passages which, to their mind, might not be fit and proper reading to put into the hands of the people, to report to this Board that it was not a fit and proper book or magazine or periodical. I say it would be, manifestly, unfair if such a state of affairs were allowed to operate in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not as great faith as some people pretend to have in my own fellow-countrymen of that particular type to presume that I will not be unduly interfered with in my reading. I am not going to subscribe to the idea that two or three of these associations in Dublin or elsewhere are going to dictate to me what I am going to read. I reject that idea altogether, and that idea seems to permeate and to underlie many of the discussions which took place both outside and inside this House.  It seems to permeate and influence many of the discussions that have taken place inside and outside the House.  There is, to my mind, a most undesirable atmosphere being created in the country in connection with this Bill.  There is an amount of duplicity practised in connection with this as in connection with other things that are operating around us.  Many persons because of certain clerical influence and because of certain pronouncements by religious of all communities and all sections&mdash;at least, by all brands of religion, if I might say so&mdash;because of pronouncements by certain authorities of these churches, certain individuals and many <Col N="220" /> Deputies, too, in this country are afraid to say what they really believe and what they think to be right.  Personally, I am not going to act in that way, and I am altogether opposed to the principle enunciated in this section of handing over to these associations&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I think it would probably be of great assistance to the House, and probably tend to shorten the discussion if we knew what your ruling was as to how we could take these amendments to this section.  We have heard the proposal of Deputy Alton which is not very clear to me as to whether or not his amendment is intended to be in substitution for Section 6 of the Bill. It certainly is not in the form of a substitution, and I rather understood from Deputy Alton that he did not intend to exclude the setting up of recognised associations by this amendment. Am I right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. Alton Mr. Alton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood. On the other hand, I apprehend that the Minister may possibly reject this proposal and that he may set against it the proposal in the Bill, and in effect, therefore, the two should not be discussed. I suggest for your consideration, just as the Ceann Comhairle did yesterday in the matter of the first section of this Bill, to let all the amendments be taken together and to allow general discussion to take place over the question.  I think it would be for the convenience of the House if you allow a similar course to be taken now.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that Deputy Alton's amendment is not meant to be a substitute for Section 6.

      <P>I was merely going by the Order Paper.  It is my belief and the belief of many others in this country that in the Free State as well as in other countries there are numbers of prurient-minded people and busybodies.  There are many of those also who possess a sort of flair for literature and who, perhaps, are in a position which some politicians occupy, and about whom a certain halo is present. Many people in literature, as in politics, are prepared to take their opinions from such classes of persons. In a word, they send out their thinking as they send out their washing, and possibly they have a greater concern for the washing than they have for the thinking.  A good deal of nonsense has been spoken about this Bill, and possibly I have subscribed somewhat to that myself.  At any rate, I would like to see more Deputies making themselves vocal so far as this Bill is concerned. It would be for the benefit of the country as a whole if, on this Bill, we had a little more plain speaking.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the view put forward by Deputy Ruttledge, that Section 6 should be deleted from the Bill without substituting anything at all. When considering Deputy Ruttledge's suggestion I feel it will be necessary to refer Deputies to two other amendments on the Paper which are consequent on it, and which will stand or fall with the decision on the section. They are amendments 27 and 30, by which it is proposed to provide that complaints with reference to publications can be submitted to the Minister by any person or association, and that the Minister shall cause such complaints to be examined by an officer to be appointed by him for the purpose, and on the receipt of the report of that officer the Minister may, in his discretion, refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there are very many objections to the proposal to recognise associations for the purpose of making complaints in respect to publications. In the first place, I think it is almost inevitable that as soon as the Bill comes into operation and those recognised associations commence to function, an agitation will be started for the purpose of subsidising those associations and providing them with funds to do their work.  If such an agitation were started, and if it were backed, as it possibly would be backed, by some of the powerful, semi-religious organisations, it would be very difficult for any Government dependent for its existence on popular vote to resist it. Therefore, if we permit the establishment of recognised associations at all we may as well face the inevitable consequence of having finally to make a vote annually to defray their expenses. It seems to me also that the machinery contemplated in the Bill in which these associations play a principal part is one <Col N="225" /> that will either prove very objectionable or else completely unworkable in practice.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to foresee exactly what the result will be, but it seems to me that there can be no reasonable objection to the alternative course provided by which complaints can be made by any person who thinks he has grounds for them.  These complaints will be referred to a civil servant in the Department of the Minister, and if that civil servant in his report states to the Minister that there appears to be good ground for such complaint it would proceed through the Minister to the Board.  In that way the machinery of the Act will be made workable, and the danger of having discussions in associations upon objectionable books will be obviated.  The statement of the Minister for Justice with reference to Deputy Alton's amendment appears to me to condemn it.  If that amendment is carried it will mean that there will be something like a public meeting to consider every objectionable publication which somebody discovers.  In any case, some steps will have to be taken by somebody to get ten persons together to discuss and read a publication and to draw up the statutory declaration provided in the amendment.  It seems an extraordinary thing that in a Bill which is designed to suppress evil literature machinery is provided which will make for its effective dissemination. Those who are anxious to see the Bill operating effectively against the spread of evil literature will be well advised to support the amendment of Deputy Ruttledge and to provide the alternative machinery suggested there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going as far as possible to confine my remarks at the moment to the actual matter before the House, namely, the amendment of Deputy Alton to insert a new sub-section.  I recognise, however, that I may have to wander a little outside it, as those who have spoken in front of me have done.  Deputy Alton's suggestion is that before a book would be considered by the Censorship Board ten persons would have to come together and would have to read the whole of the book.  Why it should be necessary for ten persons, or any person, <Col N="226" /> to read the whole of a book before condemning it, I cannot say.  There are books which are blatantly and obviously indecent.  You read two or three chapters here, you pick up another chapter there, and you read four chapters out of forty, but before you can make your declaration you have to wade through a quantity of filth which it should be perfectly unnecessary to wade through.  You can judge the book, judge the whole of its tendency, by reading certain portions.  I recognise that though the matter of reading the whole of the book is in Deputy Alton's amendment the reading of the whole of it may not go to the substance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that persons wishing to make a statutory declaration have read sufficient of the book to form a decision, but, in my judgment at any rate, that is an arrangement which would never work.  After all, we are asking voluntary assistance for the working of the Bill.  We are asking from the people of the country who think that real harm is being done by evil literature their help and assistance, and I venture to think that we will get it, but I think it is asking a great deal, if you have ten persons unconnected, un-linked up, not forming any part of an association, to get them to go before a Peace Commissioner and to go through the amount of bother and worry that such procedure entails. That is too serious a preliminary to put on voluntary workers.  I venture to say that if you have this arrangement by which ten persons could say that they had read the whole, or sufficient of the book to enable them to form an opinion and to make up their minds, you would have two difficulties in the initial stage.  Deputy Anthony says that he objects to associations because he does not want anybody to dictate to him what he is going to read. Nobody has dictated to Deputy Anthony that he had to read this Bill, because I am afraid he has not.  Deputy Anthony should know that authorised associations, if they stand part of the Bill, will not dictate to him what he is going to read, or that persons who bring information to authorised associations will not dictate to him what he ought to read.  The persons who will dictate to Deputy <Col N="227" /> Anthony not exactly what he ought to read but what he ought not to read &mdash;and he will commit a criminal offence if he does&mdash;will be the Censorship Board and they only.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass wandered outside the actual amendment considerably.  He said that there would be an agitation to subsidise and that the Government would have to subsidise voluntary associations. I do not believe that there would be an agitation to subsidise and, if there were, I do not believe that any Government would have to, or would seriously consider the question of subsidising voluntary associations.  What I really look to in the Bill is that you will not only have censorship but that that censorship will only be partly successful unless there is behind it something else, unless you have a really strong public opinion to help and strengthen the decisions of the Censorship Board, unless you have earnest persons who honestly think that this immoral literature is doing harm and who will earnestly work, persons who are going to be paid, or persons whose associations will not put up sufficient voluntary money.  It is voluntary work I want and the voluntary payment of money, because that goes to the very essence of the Bill if it is going to re-act properly on public opinion.  If you cannot get these people without subsidy I will be terribly disappointed as regards the will to do social work among the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also said that complaints would be made through civil servants.  I do not want to debate that now.  That adds nothing to the Bill which says that complaints should be made to the Minister for Justice.  The only thing which the amendment says is that the Minister shall not think but that civil servants shall.  If a complaint is made to the Minister he will naturally avail himself of the services of certain members of his staff who will come to him with their views.  He will see what their views are, what are the nasty things, and probably the complaint will be sent on in the ordinary way by the Minister who will have responsibility. To put responsibility on to civil servants, who will not be responsible to <Col N="228" /> this House or to the Minister who is over them, and to say that the Minister should not exercise that responsibility appears to me to be strange.  We will, however, debate that later.  Except you take away ministerial control of civil servants, the amendment does not alter the Bill in any way.  I submit that this particular amendment, now before us by Deputy Alton, would put too hard a strain upon ordinary social workers who are not associated together.  No individual would have any particular sense of duty and, in addition to that, you would have the great trouble of getting individuals to come forward and make a statutory declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself very much in agreement with much that Deputy Lemass has said.  I think that there are two important matters to lay stress on.  Everything depends, as regards this Bill, on those two things&mdash; in the first place, the choice of the Board of Censors and whether they are likely to do their work well or not; and secondly, as the Minister properly said, whether there is real public opinion behind them or not.  There must be machinery for setting that Board at work.  I am inclined to think that we will get the kernel of the way to do that in this amendment of Deputy Alton.  The point I want to discuss is whether any such machinery is necessary. The Minister proposes to take all initiative from the Board of Censors. They are the persons who ought to be the best judges and who ought to know best what they are going to decide. I do not think any such course is necessary.  I think it should be open to the Minister to refer matters to them. I think it should be also open to the Board of Censors, if they are aware of there being an adverse decision against a particular book, to report to the Minister without being asked by the Minister so to do.  I am not very much afraid of the Board of Censors being overwhelmed by reports from individuals, bodies, or groups of persons. That might occur at first, but I am very doubtful as to whether it would last very long.  I am not convinced that any such machinery as the Minister suggests is necessary, and I would be much more disposed to leave the matter <Col N="229" /> over, as I want members to consider that line.  I am inclined to think that it is much better to leave it open to persons or an association, if it so desires, to ask the Board of Censors to consider a book or paper or for the Board of Censors to be open on its own initiative to consider a book or paper, or for the Minister, if he so desires, to ask their opinion on a book or paper. I agree very much with Deputy Lemass in many of the reasons which he gave for Deputy Ruttledge's amendment. This section is not going to serve any useful purpose and it may do a great deal of harm if left in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is really unfair to these associations if you authorise them only to be a conduit pipe to the Board or the Minister, because any person that comes across a book in a country town in Ireland where there is no association will naturally send it on to some of these associations in Dublin. Everyone of these associations will have to pay secretaries and the volume of work will be great.  If you authorise the associations, it is perfectly natural and, I submit, the right thing, for them to ask for payment of their expenses at least, because there you have put them in at least a semi-official position.  You cannot expect them to do your work at their expense.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but it does prevent individual action.  It encourages him to act, but what it says is that the individual should send on <Col N="230" /> to the association such a book, and the association is able to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I made was that if the individual is going to send on to the association, and the association is going to be in a position to collect all these books, it will be at considerable expense, and it is only fair that they should be paid for it.  Under the normal law I imagine what should happen if the administration of justice is being carried out in the proper way, is that if an individual came across a grossly obscene book, he should be able to hand it on to a policeman, and the policeman should be able to submit it to a magistrate.  I do not wish to go into details, but the public should be able to avail of the ordinary channels of justice and be in such a position that a magistrate, or whatever court is sitting, should be able to give judgment on it.  In the same way, an ordinary citizen, exercising his rights as a citizen, should be able to send a book to the Minister to be submitted to the Board of Censors.  At the same time, if associations like to do the same work, they should be able to do it.  That is the purpose of our amendment No. 27. It is necessary to mention that in reference to the deletion of the whole of Section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enthusiastic about Deputy Alton's alternative to Section 6, but I am still less enthusiastic about Section 6 itself.  I cannot see why, as so many Deputies have said, it should not be open to the ordinary parent, to the ordinary individual citizen of the country, to have direct access to the Minister in order to complain of abuses of the kind contemplated by this Bill.  There is here introduced an element which was not contemplated by the farmers of the report upon which the Bill is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not a word about such recognised associations in the report of the Committee on Evil Literature. To my mind this section introduces an element which goes far to vitiate the whole Bill, and which has done a great deal to cause the criticism of the Bill about which so much has been made. I believe this section will be unfair to <Col N="231" /> the individual citizen, unfair to the recognised associations which it is proposed to set up, and, furthermore, unfair to the Minister himself.  It will be unfair that an individual citizen should be debarred from direct access to the Minister if he wants to make a complaint of a book, unless he is prepared to put his complaint before a recognised association to the members of which, singly or in toto, he may have a complete objection on grounds quite reasonable to himself.  I should like to take my own case.  Under the operation of this Bill I may be compelled, if I find some book on sale, some book to which I object, to make a complaint to members of a body who have put their names to a denunciation of me for my action in this Dáil.  That case may arise all over the country.  You may have people with no redress against the abuses which this Bill proposes to remove, unless they are prepared to go on their knees to an association of whose actions in other respects they may disapprove completely, and to act through such an association before they can get to the Minister.  The Minister says a citizen has a right to appeal to an association, but who guarantees to the citizen the bona fides of the association? Does the Minister propose, in setting up this association, to guarantee the literacy, the bona fides, the good character, the Christian charity of the individual members of these associations? The ordinary citizen is then to have no right to any kind of direct protest under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of these associations themselves.  How are they to be composed?  Either each association will have to be a preliminary Censorship Board or else meetings of the association will simply be public meetings when anybody who may have paid a certain subscription and may have a certain altogether irrational, altogether ill-founded opinion of some book or newspaper he has scarcely glanced at, will come along and express a violent opinion about it.  There is no third course.  Either the association will have to be so carefully selected that it will be equivalent to a censorship board; its members will have to be selected individuals, their bona fides <Col N="232" /> will have to be guaranteed, or else you will recognise associations over whose membership the State has no control whatever, or over whose literacy it has no control, much less over its membership. You will have to take these and confide to these associations the work of pronouncement to a large extent of whether books or periodicals are good or bad for the general citizens of the country, because their opinion will have much greater force than a complaint. These recognised associations will not invariably confine themselves to the work of sending secret complaints to the Minister.  They will proceed as well to carry out a public campaign of canvassing against books and newspapers which they have made the subject of complaint, and against the Censorship Board itself.</P>
    <P>I cannot, for the life of me, see how exactly it is proposed that these recognised associations will work.  As I have said, I should like to know the third course to these two courses I have mentioned.  I know very well what many of such associations are like.  I have myself been a member and am still a member of an association quite likely to be made a recognised association under this Act.  I know that, for example, I was personally denounced as a bad Catholic, or something to that effect, by members of that association in public on an action which the members of the association confessed afterwards they did not understand, and on the terms of a Bill which they confessed they had not read.</P>
    <P>I hold that the introduction of this element would be unfair to the private citizen.  It would be unfair to the membership of that association itself, because it would be putting on it a duty which such a voluntary association should never be asked to carry out.  It would still be more unfair to the Censorship Board and the Minister himself, because it means you are going to set up and sanctify an organisation for the purpose of blackmailing the Minister on every possible occasion and pretext.  How can you guarantee that complaints emanating from the recognised association will be confined to this Bill?  How are you going to determine that instead of complaints <Col N="233" /> against literature everyone wants banished from the country you will not get complaints about books, not in reality offensive to the general public and the banning of which in itself would be an offence?  How are you going to guarantee that you will have complaints confined to indecency at all?  How are you going to guarantee that you will not get theological complaints creeping in, complaints about a book which is said to contain blasphemy? You have no guarantee that the recognised association set up will be not only able to make these complaints, but will not also carry out a campaign on the platform and in the Press to force the Minister to overlap and step outside the terms of this Act in obedience to the dictates of the recognised association.  The Minister in practice and theory is responsible for his actions in this Dáil.  I maintain that by setting up these Censorship Boards you are, to a large extent, taking away from the Minister his responsibility to this Dáil and making him responsible not to the Dáil but to any body of anonymous purity-mongers who may come together on the payment of a small subscription.</P>
    <P>Personally I cannot see how any Minister could with equanimity sit down with the prospect of this kind of recognised association hanging over his head in connection with a Bill like this. I do not believe the Minister will get much peace from these bodies.  It will not only be a disturbance of his private peace but he will find his name and action broadcasted not only in the Press of this country but in neighbouring countries.  There would be constant efforts to compel him to take action to which he himself objects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have one more serious example of that kind.  He is quite used to it when only political sanctions are in question, when he is only responsible to the voters at the polls, but in this case he will be made responsible not only to the voters at the polls but to influences which cut across political divisions and exercise a power out of all proportion to their <Col N="234" /> numerical strength by virtue of the capacity to believe bad things of other people common enough in this country and every other country.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the Minister can contemplate with equanimity the prospect of this type of association hanging over his head, and I cannot see what exact good this type of association is going to do in an Act like this.  The only possible argument there is for it is that it will prevent complaints being made.  If that is the Minister's object, that it will prevent more numerous complaints from being made, he may achieve it, he may make it difficult for an ordinary parent who may feel offended by a certain periodical or book on sale to make any complaints, but he will make it easier for the very people whose activities should be curbed as far as possible, under a Bill like this, to carry out all kinds of objectionable propaganda, and as a matter of fact give more publicity to evil literature than it has ever got before in this country.  I propose to vote against this section, and cannot too strongly express my dislike and disapprobation of it.  As far as Deputy Alton's amendment is concerned, I do not think it improves matters very much.  I should be perfectly content to delete the section and leave the matter and from under which complaints are to be made to the Minister to be carried out under Section 21 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My point was that there is no necessity for even three.  I stated on the Second Reading, and I still adhere to it, that I could not for the love of me see the reason why <Col N="235" /> an individual could not be able to call attention to any book he happens to read that will be of an obscene character. My opinion is this: If I am reading a book and I come across a section that is obscene there is no necessity for me to continue reading that book.  I throw it in the fire, as a general rule.  Under the circumstances of this new Act I would feel it my duty to send that book to the Censorship Board.  I have the greatest objection to the association because the same thing applies to them.  It means that when a complaint is made about a book either a paid secretary is going to judge that book and make a decision or else you are going to have a lot of people reading more obscene literature.  At all events, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, in either of those two directions you are only increasing the advertisement on the notice.  Many people would talk of the book.  I had occasion quite recently to get a number of books written by a certain authoress and I burned those books in the quiet of my own house because I would not allow any one of my family to look at them.  It would be necessary, I suppose, if I objected to those books, for me to call the attention of the Censorship Board to them, at all events, the attention of the association, and that is what I object to.  I object entirely to a set of people setting themselves up and pretending that they are going to read these books and to decide upon them. An individual is quite capable of making a decision and of sending the marked part of a book to the Censorship Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has already said, there is no necessity whatsoever for reading through the whole of an immoral book.  Generally, you can find out fairly early what is going to happen.  I appeal again, as I appealed on the Second Reading, that the individual should be left the power of sending any book he objects to to the Censorship Board directly, with the passage in the book which he considers of an immoral character indicated.  I do object to the section as it stands. I must vote against it.  Even Deputy Alton's amendment I do not think is any very great improvement unless he <Col N="236" /> works it down to two people.  If he can get two people to sign the thing I would not object, but if I were asked to read over the prurient part and make a declaration I would decline.  I think it is quite unnecessary that there should be any calling attention to obscene books by any association.  I think the individual is able to act on his own.</P>

      <P>I am in the extraordinary position of feeling myself one of the majority.  I thought Deputy Tierney and I would find ourselves crying in the wilderness, but it seems to me, from the course the debate has taken, that this is the plight of the Minister. After the speeches of Deputy Ruttledge, Deputy Thrift, Deputy Sir James Craig, of my friend Deputy Tierney and others, it seems that there is almost universal condemnation of the principle of the recognition of any associations and a preference which I share for liberty to be given to the individual to make a complaint.  If we in this House had occasion to vote on the principle of Proportional Representation, I should give my number one preference to the proposal of Deputy Ruttledge, my second to that of Deputy Alton, and my third to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with the Minister's proposal in a moment.  But may I just refer, in the first instance, to his reply to the amendment placed on the paper by Deputy Alton?  I really was astonished to hear the tone in which he treated that amendment.  I must dissent altogether to the proposition he laid down and which I was very sorry to hear Deputy Sir James Craig endorse, namely, that in dealing with so serious a matter as the censorship of literature a person who is taking on himself to denounce the writer of a work as a person who has written a work unsuitable for circulation is under no obligation to read the whole of the book.  I think that is an astonishing proposition, and that proposition coming from the Minister is really destructive of all confidence in his judgment.  I quite agree that there may be works in which a very slight glance will show the character of the book, but such must be the exception, not the rule.  The only safe and just course is to read the book as a whole.</P>

      <P>I suggest that if men are taking on themselves to attack the property of another&mdash;that is what is happening; you are taking away property, and, Deputy Tierney reminds me, character also&mdash;they are taking away the property of the author and the property of the publisher, which is a serious matter, even if it be necessary in the interests of the general public.  To say that it is too serious a demand to make of the person who voluntarily proceeds to do this, that he should read the whole of the book he condemns, is an astonishing proposition.  I think it is an equally astonishing proposition that when a book is of a character which <i>ex hypothesi</i> is improper for general reading and is doing harm and spreading poison through the State, it is putting too great a strain upon the population of the Saorstát to find 10 persons who are willing to come together for the sake of their country to read that book and to sign a declaration that they have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the consideration of the proposal of the Minister himself.  I do not know that there is any matter to which I have given more careful and anxious thought than this question whether or not you should leave the initial steps in this process to the individual or whether you should recognise such associations as the Bill proposes.  I have been long aware of the reasons because of which the Minister favours the setting up of these associations.  He will correct me if I misinterpret him.  He thinks that by setting up associations he will avoid the sending in of merely frivolous complaints and that he will in a sense get rid of the crank and that he will have responsible people with whom to deal.  If he is right in that, these are sound reasons which certainly merit great consideration.  But I suggest to the Minister, as against that, that there are other considerations even more serious.  I do not believe you are getting rid of cranks by recognising them in associations.  I think that you will find that your associations <Col N="238" /> will be breeding-grounds for cranks, and that in setting them up the Minister is making a stick to beat his own back.  Let us realise what is going to happen.  What is going to be the actual process and who are going to exercise the power?  You recognise a certain association.  Is that association as a whole going to exercise this function? Clearly not.  Unless I am wrong altogether in the sort of body which is likely to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, they are bodies with a very large membership spread all over the country.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the general members of these associations cannot possibly be able to deal with the matter. Therefore, the actual working of the matter will fall into the hands of committees, or more probably, of subcommittees who will act necessarily in the name of the association.  They will be composed of Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C.  They may or may not&mdash;we cannot tell; we do not know who they are&mdash;be wise and literate and well judging persons. If A, B or C came along as an individual I suggest that the Minister would be able to exercise his independent judgment.  But they will not come along as A, B or C.  To invent a name, they will come along as, say, the National Patriotic Purity Society of Ireland.  It is a much more serious thing to seem to turn down a body like that to which statutory recognition has been given, though in actual fact all you are turning down is the opinion of A, B and C.  It is very much as if a man, who is not a very good horseman, were to get up on a rather skittish animal and, by way of schooling it over a jump, were deliberately to hire a number of gentlemen with ashplants to stand on the ditch and help the horse over with a few strokes of the ashplants across the rear.  I rather think that a good many of these strokes would come across the rider's own back.  I very much doubt whether the Minister is going to benefit the working of the Act, increase his reputation, or make for sympathetic and decent working and for the respect which should be due to all Acts of this Oireachtas by taking the course of setting up these associations.  The Minister will understand that I am not speaking of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, but of a person named in the Act&mdash;<Col N="239" /> the Minister for Justice, whoever he may chance at any time to be.  The Minister for Justice will, I think, as Deputy Tierney has said, have very great difficulty once he sets up these associations in exercising that independent judgment which the Act requires of him and which I know the present holder of the office individually desires to exercise.</P>

      <P>I will just typify the speeches to which we have listened as &ldquo;much ado about nothing.&rdquo;  I do not believe that there is a shadow of foundation or truth in the statement that has emerged from the two Deputies who have spoken.  What is to be the function of these recognised associations when they are set up?  One would have thought by listening to the two Deputies who have just sat down that the House was giving them the power of life and death.  What does it amount to?  It amounts to this: That the whole function of these recognised associations when created is simply to report certain works of an indecent character to the Censorship Board. There their function begins and ends. All these suggestions about propaganda, about appeals to the public, all these terrible things about what is going to happen if we take away all the tremendous rights and liberties of the subject, are simply pure figments of the imagination.  If one looks at the power that the Minister in sub-section (2) exercises over these associations, one can see that the setting up of these associations is the really practical method by which this particular end of the question should be handled.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may at any time revoke an order made by him under the foregoing sub-section, and upon such order being revoked the recognised association to which such order relates shall cease to be a recognised association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not complete power in the hands of the Minister if that association does not function in a proper way? Why draw all these lurid pictures which are simply pictures of the imagination and nothing else?  Let us look at this in a common-sense way and <Col N="240" /> treat it as a man of common sense should treat it.  We are not giving, as I said, the power of life and death, and taking away the liberty of the subject, but simply dealing with the matter by the social workers of this country who have done so much to bring forward this Bill and to make it a live measure, and a measure that is of interest to every section of the people at present.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the two Deputies who belong to the particular religious line of thought to which I myself belong making such an attack on these associations.  Deputy Tierney went on to say that he had been attacked in public by these associations, one of which would probably be one of the associations set up under the Bill.  When a man comes to this House to perform a public duty he must have rather a thick skin and be prepared to take a hard knock and reply to it.  I myself have been the subject of attack by certain journals belonging to my own way of belief.  Does it prevent me from standing up to support the inevitable right of these associations when questioned in this House?  I say that they are the proper people to deal with this particular aspect of the Bill and that we are showing very poor respect for all that these associations have done from time to time for this country if, in a national assembly of this kind, the rights of these associations are turned down.</P>
    <P>We are asked in this amendment to make a declaration that the whole of a book must be read.  Was there ever such nonsense put before a sensible assembly?  The Minister, in replying to that statement, made it perfectly clear that it is not necessary for any sensible individual to read the whole of a book before coming to the conclusion whether the book is bad, good or indifferent. The question that we should ask ourselves is: Is the amendment going to make for the better or more effective working of the Bill?  If we are going to leave this in the hands of the general public, there is a very old saying that crystallises the whole thing in a nutshell: &ldquo;What is everybody's business is nobody's business.&rdquo;  We all know when we go on the hustings how difficult it is to get an individual to <Col N="241" /> record his vote at the poll.  Here, because it is proposed to put in the hands of certain recognised associations functions that we know they will properly discharge, we are taking away all the rights and liberties of the subject!  Was there ever such &ldquo;bunkum&rdquo; used in a sensible assembly such as this?</P>
    <P>Let us get to the bedrock of these things.  The Minister retains effective control over these associations if they do not function in a proper and reasonable way.  Anybody who reads Section 7 in conjunction with Section 6 can only come to one conclusion: that the Minister is acting in a way that is making for the effective operation of the Act.  Section 7 says:</P>
    <P>Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act by a recognised association to the Minister to the effect that a book or a particular edition of a book is indecent or obscene or tends to inculcate principles contrary to public morality...</P>
    <P>the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.  You are not going to give that much liberty of action to the recognised associations.  You are taking away the liberties of the subject and all the sacred rights of the citizen by handing this over to the associations which, as I have already said, will handle this thing in a proper way.  What have the social workers of the country already done for the uplifting of the people?  Do you imagine that if you leave the social work contained in this Bill to the effort of individuals you are ever going to have an effective censorship over the evil literature of the country?  The suggestions coming from Deputies Law and Tierney are not suggestions that one would expect from educated men. They are not suggestions that one would expect from broad-minded men or suggestions that anyone would make who has the interests of the Bill at heart.  I support wholeheartedly the Minister and ask him to retain the section.</P>

      <P>We have listened to some vigorous speeches, but whether they were relevant or not I am not quite clear.  I do mean relevant to the amendment because we realise pretty early that you cannot discuss <Col N="242" /> the amendment without discussing the section.  I do not know whether they were relevant to the Bill because the forcible statements by Deputy Law and Deputy Tierney would apply whether you recognise the associations or not.  In fact a complaint especially by Deputy Tierney is that the associations which are not recognised have already been very active.  It is not proposed in any amendment that we not merely do not recognise the associations but we prohibit the associations, and the force of the speeches of Deputy Law and Deputy Tierney disappears altogether unless we prohibit the associations from acting too. Deputy Law made a very strong case, for instance, that it is one thing to turn down a complaint by an individual and another thing to turn it down if made by one of those very big associations.  Does Deputy Law intend to prevent these associations making complaints?</P>

I suggest as long as the associations are in existence, as long as they can, under any amendments in this Bill, make complaints, most of the things that Deputy Tierney and Deputy Law have said apply, and apply very fully.</P>
      <P>I cannot, I quite confess, follow what Deputy Law found fault with in the Minister's reply to Deputy Alton's amendment.  Deputy Law gets choked at one moment when the Minister said that a man could condemn a book without having read the whole of it, but then he went on immediately to say, of course, there are books with which you can do that.  That was what the Minister was referring to.  It is high treason for the Minister to say it, but it is wisdom for Deputy Law to say it.</P>

      <P>This is purely incidental.  The amendment itself makes it necessary that ten people or three people or one person should read the whole of the book before they could make a complaint.  Deputy Law will admit that in case of certain books that is not necessary.  There may be books on the border line which it would be unfair to condemn without having read through them.  That is quite obvious. So is the other thing equally obvious.  Therefore, whatever stands, it is quite obvious that in this sense Deputy Alton's amendment cannot stand; but the number ten does not suit.  I doubt if the statutory declaration is necessary, and, really, to read the whole of the book is not necessary.</P>

So far as the merits of the case are concerned I put it to the House that yesterday the Bill, so far as its real effectiveness is concerned&mdash;that is, its real work&mdash;was seriously interfered with by the amendment passed. I am strongly of that opinion.  Supposing the Bill has become an Act and there are a number of people in the country who want to prevent it from working, as there are a number of people, I presume, strongly opposed to the Bill, the easiest way possible to obstruct it would be to put in complaint after complaint of a number of books.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite ineffective if the complaints are taken seriously; if they are turned down without further examination, quite so, but it is meant.  Everybody suggests that everybody should read the whole of the book. I think a statutory declaration is required also from the members of the Board.  It is quite obvious a man could constantly send in book after book of which passages could be marked.  Most of the classics in various languages and other very important books could be objected to on this ground.  A glut could be immediately produced unless there was some canalisation.  You do not get rid of recognised associations by refusing to recognise them.  They will be still active.  In addition you have practically every crank in the country.  I admit the rights of the individual are there.  If you want the Bill to work and want the associations to have a little more responsibility in their criticism I think it would be better in the long run to throw responsibility upon them.  You will not prevent their activity by refusing to recognise them.  I think you will have a healthier effect in the long run on the associations themselves if you throw responsibility upon them in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we have to consider is the amendment put forward by Deputy Alton and I ask the House first of <Col N="245" /> all to reject that amendment.  Then I ask Deputies to consider very carefully what the position is before they take the step of rejecting the proposal with regard to recognised associations.  There is, I presume, no objection whatsoever to the adoption of one of Deputy Thrift's suggestions, namely, that the Board, without being approached by anybody, should be able to suggest to the Minister that they would consider certain books.  I think that is quite reasonable.  There is no reason why that should not be adopted.  There is no reason why the Minister himself should not take the initiative and, if it is necessary, he should have a provision of that kind in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will be prepared to accept suggestions of that kind.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of very forceful denunciation in the course of the debate, but I suggest that most of the denunciation has nothing to do with the particular argument we are now considering. It would be quite as relevant whether the associations were recognised or not.  The proof of it is that a lot of it had to do with an association which is not yet recognised.  Therefore, it is quite obvious that a great deal of it applies whether or not you recognise the association.  The argument was received with a great deal of sympathy in the House, I noticed, and also it bears out what I am stressing, that it had actually nothing to do with the merits of the case that we are now discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all surprised there is a great deal of distress about these associations.  Deputy Byrne, with unnecessary warmth, repudiated the speeches of his two colleagues. I did not appreciate it altogether, because both Deputy Law and Deputy Tierney have been subjected by some of the associations to very unfair criticism.  I cannot understand how these associations could be considered impartial.  They have concentrated on one Commandment, and when they have done with that Commandment there are other Commandments before and after it and they do not touch them, though they see offences every day. There is another reason for distress in respect of these associations.  We know <Col N="246" /> their methods of propaganda in the past.  We know that the papers they disapproved of were papers even like the &ldquo;Observer&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sunday Times.&rdquo; They went out with revolvers and burned these papers.  I am sorry to see the Minister did not give the matter more sympathetic consideration.  I believe there is a great deal of nervousness about how these associations will work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with one thing that Deputy Hennessy says, namely, the absolutely unfair kind of criticism that has gone on in this connection.  I was dealing not with the merits of what Deputy Tierney said, but with its irrelevancy to the argument that we are now discussing. The fairness of what he said proves its irrelevancy.  I suggest we should first dispose of Deputy Alton's amendment and the other amendments and then get on to the section.</P>

      <P>I would like to say one word in explanation with regard to the points of my argument. I foresee that individuals will be compelled to make complaints about books to associations, to the membership of which, or the actions of which, in some way or other they may object.  I referred to my own case as a possible example of this kind, but I do not want to make that a direct argument in the matter.  I simply wanted to say that I thought it unfair that ordinary citizens should be debarred from making complaints direct to the Minister and should be compelled to make complaints to associations over whom they had no control and in whose membership or actions they might possibly have no confidence.</P>

      <P>I think it might be well to make it plain, in view especially of the many resolutions that Deputies have received from various parts of the country with reference to this Bill&mdash;resolutions which seem to condemn any and every amendment to the original Bill, even though some of the amendments are specifically designed to strengthen the Bill&mdash;to make plain that the matter we are now discussing is merely concerned with the machinery of the Bill and has nothing <Col N="247" /> to do with the general principles of the measure.  It is purely a matter for the House in its wisdom to devise what it thinks is the best machinery to make this Bill effective.  I will say right at the beginning that I am not enamoured of, and would not vote for, Deputy Alton's amendment.  It has many objections which have already been effectively pointed out by other speakers. At the same time I want to say that the Committee who prepared the report on which the whole Bill is founded did not recognise this particular type of machinery.  I do not say that they recommended any particular type of machinery, but I want to make it clear that this machinery that is in the Bill has not been taken from the report.  It is not part of the Committee's report. It has been devised entirely by the Minister himself as what he thinks is the best way to make the Bill effective. I want to support what Deputy Thrift said&mdash;that the members of that Committee&mdash;that is my memory at any rate &mdash;contemplated that the Board itself would initiate and have the right to initiate complaints to the Minister.  As I read the Bill, that right is taken from them.</P>

      <P>He says now that it would be wrong to take that initiative from the Board.  There is another thing I want to mention arising out of Deputy Byrne's speech.  Indeed I might say the statement has been made outside as well as inside this House. Deputy Byrne spoke of the rights of these associations, that the rights of these associations would be turned down if they were not recognised in this Bill.  Who gave these associations rights in this matter?  They have not any right.  Deputy Byrne very warmly <Col N="248" /> denounced those who would turn down the rights of these associations.  I do not know what associations Deputy Byrne has in mind.  I have no idea of what associations he is speaking.  But the associations do not exist at all as a matter of fact until they are recognised by the Minister.  Therefore, there are no associations to be spoken of in the sense that Deputy Byrne speaks of these.</P>
      <P>With regard to these associations it is purely with the question of machinery that we are concerned.  The Minister will recognise associations.  We have not heard from the Minister what lines he will go on in recognising the associations&mdash;what will be the basis of the recognition which he will give the associations. Will he recognise the associations that are already existing and only the associations that are already existing or may new associations spring up in every parish and half parish throughout the country and how is he to prevent that and what right has he to recognise one and not recognise another, which may be similarly constituted? All these troubles will arise. The Minister has not stated anywhere the basis of recognition which he will employ in giving recognition to these associations.  I think that members of the House, and certainly people outside the House, are assuming too much in this connection.  They have one or two large associations in their minds and they are assuming that these associations and these only will be the recognised associations.  I submit that we have no right to assume that at all. To my mind there is a lot in the argument that has been made that, say, for the moment, the association which had a membership extending to the greater part of the country will be the recognised association.  Who is going to act in the name of that association? Will it be the association that is acting when that is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They must appoint, I submit, a Board of five or nine, and these will be the people who will be acting in the name of the association.  Then in respect of every report that comes in, you will have, in fact, not one official, but two official censorship boards; that is to say, you will have the official Censorship <Col N="249" /> Board and the semi-official board, consisting of the directorate of this association, and you will have a whole series of these boards or directorates, or whatever you call them, all over the country.  If I have a report to make with regard to an obscene book, I am in a difficulty.  I must fish out the association to whom I have to make the report or I must be a member of an association.  My right to go direct to the Minister, as I have pointed out, seems to be taken from me by this particular machinery.  Deputy Byrne says that the general public cannot handle this matter, that what is everybody's business will be nobody's business. Well, if there is not a considerable volume of public opinion behind this measure then the agitation for it is only an artificial agitation, and in that matter I believe the ordinary citizen will do his duty and make complaints if he thinks a complaint should be made. The principal objection, so far as I can understand the objection, to this particular type of machinery is what the Minister for Education calls the canalisation of the complaints.  I do believe that after the first year of the working of the Act the number of complaints will be very small, and they will be such, in any case, that the Board can deal with them.  The right of any association to make complaints will not be denied and will not be prevented.  I do not wish to prevent any association that wishes to lodge a complaint from making it, be it a vigilance society or any other kind of society.</P>
    <P>In the main it is quite possible that the majority of those that will complain will complain to the association, but I would not confine it entirely to those associations.  I believe that normally after some time the complaints will be few.  For the first year, perhaps, until the policy of the Board is understood in the country and until it is understood that every newspaper will be kept out that prints something that some person thinks foolish&mdash;until that is done there may be complaints, but afterwards the number of complaints will be small.  I believe it would be wrong, and it would not make for the effective working of this measure if those who had complaints are forced, whether they like it or not, to send <Col N="250" /> their complaints through a recognised association.  My chief complaint is that I cannot see, and I cannot contemplate, the line which the Minister will follow or can safely follow in recognising these associations.  On what basis can he set up these associations?  What basis can he follow in giving recognition to certain associations and refusing it to other associations?</P>

I think the House is largely with me in their desire to uphold the principle of citizenship.  I do not insist that my amendment is perhaps worded in the wisest and most perfect way, but I do put in something to draw attention to Section 6, and the position there as it presents itself to me.  I will reserve any thing more I have to say.  I do not want to delay the House.  I think it will bring the discussion more to a point if I withdraw the amendment, and let the discussion go directly on Section 6, whether that will stand part of the Bill or not.</P>

It would make them the choosers of the persons who would give them the information. It would work so that these would be of their own choice.  I do not, as I say, consider the matter is of very great importance, but I think it would be rather better if it were slightly differently worded.  &ldquo;Made after consultation with the Board&rdquo; would be better, as I do not like dropping Ministerial control, because if you drop it you drop Parliamentary control.</P>

      <P>When I framed this amendment I thought it was understood that complaints about books were only to be made through associations, and that after the passing of the Bill a great many associations would spring up, that there might, in fact, be an association in almost every parish.  Therefore I thought it might be better to limit the number of associations which would bring objectionable matter under the notice of the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would limit the number of associations to those which are already in existence.  Deputy O'Connell, on this question of associations, asked in what sense the Bill would be administered. The way, I take it, in which a Bill of this nature would be administered is that the fact that associations were existing associations would not impede but rather encourage their recognition. It would not, however, be necessary in order to be recognised as an association that it should be in existence prior to the passing of the Act.  My idea would be that you would have a series of associations, not very many, not an overwhelming number, but a reasonable number, and have them so that they were not really substantially overlapping. To have an authorised association in every parish with nothing to do but to get a book, perhaps several years after it was published, and to authorise parish associations such as that would be rather absurd.  To say that every association should be in Dublin, and to say that it should not be authorised because it was in Cork, Limerick, or Waterford would be equally absurd.  If there is room for <Col N="253" /> associations, if there are gaps in associations, it would be good to have them filled up.  It may be that in these country towns it would be very useful to have an authorised association. There is one writer, I need not mention the name, whose books have been circulating for a considerable number of years.  I have not read them, and, therefore, I have not been under Deputy Sir James Craig's temptation to make a bonfire, but it is well known that these particular books are extremely immoral.</P>
      <P>I was told by members of the Booksellers' Association, who were kind enough to speak to me about this Bill, that in a great number of small country towns there is a very great sale for the books of that particular writer.  Here in Dublin there is no sale at all, but in some small country towns there is a considerable sale for the writings of that particular lady, and it would be quite possible that an association in Dublin, if it were confined to Dublin, would only deal with the sort of literature that was doing harm to the city.  My idea is that there should be a limited number of associations throughout the country.  I do not believe that social workers are confined to Dublin.  I believe that there are people outside Dublin who are very willing to be social workers.  These are people to whom I think associations should be extended, a reasonable number of them who will be constituted by well-known social workers and who will, because they have responsibilities thrown upon them, undertake this work and be able to carry it out satisfactorily.  I cannot accept an amendment that their numbers should be confined.</P>

I think such individual should have a right to get into direct contact with the Board.  I do not think it is right to shut out individuals from bringing complaints directly before the Board. While I wish those associations should be recognised and authorised, I say that the individual should have that right.  The Minister should remember that in this country there are many circulating libraries, including the Carnegie libraries, and that a number of books get into circulation, some of which are scarcely fit to be taken into the homes of our people.  If we are to get our citizens to purify the literature which is now being broadcast throughout the country I think that this Bill when it comes back to us on the next stage should have a sub-section as indicated inserted to make it successful in that respect.</P>

      <P>On the section itself, naturally I have, to a certain extent, dealt with the section in the discussion which has been carried on this afternoon.  I would like the House very seriously to consider this matter, because as far as books are concerned this entire Bill may be a complete failure.  I think it would be very lamentable indeed if this Bill failed.  I think it necessary that indecent books and indecent pamphlets, pamphlets other than indecent periodicals, should be checked, and I think that official machinery should be set up for that.  I think that that is a matter to which the House should give very careful consideration, and that no hasty turning down of <Col N="255" /> these recognised associations or proposed recognised associations should take place.  Deputy Colohan said that there might be persons and recognised associations.  Of course, whether there should be persons able to make complaints, as well as recognised associations, does not arise upon this section. The question is solely whether there shall be in existence authorised associations or not, because, if this section fails, there can be no authorised associations, and in consequence the alternative which the Deputy put up, persons or authorised associations, will not arise.  If this section goes down, then you will have no authorised associations at all.  You will have the condition that the Board of Censors may initiate itself.  I am willing to agree to that, but the Board of Censors will have a great deal of work to do in censoring, and it cannot be reasonably expected to examine as to what should be censored as well as actually to censor publications. The kind of initiating it can do will be little, and you will be left without any organised effort at all. You will trust entirely to unorganised effort.  You say organised effort is wrong.</P>

      <P>I say you are making no attempt in this Bill to organise effort in this country, making no attempt to organise effort to do the work.  If you authorise associations, then you are getting together certain persons all over the country who will be organised, and who will have undertaken the work.  You will have organised effort.  If you have no authorised association, you will have no organised <Col N="256" /> effort.  You will have some associations possibly working, but they will not be able to do organised work.  They will not be working together with other associations.  They will not be in harmony with other associations, and they will have no public duty imposed upon them.  That is, to my mind, a matter of very great importance.  Supposing a new book is published and it comes into this country.  Who is to read the book?  Who is to discover as to whether that is an immoral or a moral book?  If you have an authorised association, the authorised association has undertaken to do some work.  The authorised association will, I take it, read publishers' circulars, and some of the literary reviews, so that they will have some general idea of the tendency a book or pamphlet will have.  It will have undertaken to do that work.  It will do that work.  It will be nobody's business to do it, unless there is some authorised association.  Books will simply pass unnoticed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that the private individual will also do it, and that the private individual's rights should not be taken away.  There is nothing which takes away the private individual's right, but consider this.  Suppose you have no association, suppose there is one particular objectionable article in a paper, some Sunday paper or some particular book.  You may discover a whole stack of these papers or dozens of books may suddenly arrive at the unfortunate Department of Justice some morning.  The papers may come from all over the country&mdash;one edition of such-and-such a paper.  You may have your office stacked up with it.  For the next week you may have nothing at all.  That may happen for three or four weeks, and you have nothing to send to the Censor because it must be habitual. The House is agreed that a newspaper is not to be condemned for one particular article.  If you have a local association that has undertaken to do this work it will see these papers constantly. Someone will look at them constantly and will see that the Censor is supplied.  Deputy O'Connell seems to suggest that he was not doing away with associations. He did not want to do away with the associations.  In fact, <Col N="257" /> I rather gathered from Deputy O'Connell that he would like the associations to work.  He does not want to condemn associations.  If he does not want to condemn the associations why does he condemn the authorisation of these associations?</P>

I think if those associations have got the responsibility upon them they will keep steadily and constantly at the work.  They will know it is their work. They have to do this job.  They will not be, as is the great danger, very active for a short time and then after a little sporadic effort everything dies out.  I do not want that.  I want the thing to go on steadily and constantly, not possibly running away with the wrong book in a great state of excitement and then cooling down and letting nothing be done for a number of years.  You will have your censors fed by the steady stream of those associations and there will be a considerable amount of work for those associations to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had a great deal of doubt about this section in the Bill.  I have always been very doubtful whether it was wise to create these authorised or recognised associations, but any doubts I have had have been removed by the speech of the Minister.  I can only compare it to the attitude of the chief of a South African tribe who kept a tribe of witchdoctors to smell out persons supposed to be guilty of immoral practices.  The Minister cannot do it himself; he cannot check immoral literature, and he is going to authorise associations to point out the sins of various books.  He has asked us what is the objection to authorisation.  My objection to authorisation is that the State is abdicating its functions and devolving them on private associations, associations authorised or recognised by the State, not supported by the State, but by private subscriptions.  I would say, with all respect to them, that they are likely to give way to the wishes of their subscribers.  In any private association, whatever Church it may belong to, if it is supported by voluntary subscriptions, it cannot ignore the wishes of large subscribers.  They may be <Col N="261" /> forced to bring forward complaints which have no real grounds because one or two large subscribers insist on their doing so.  The Minister said it is impossible for the State itself to take on this function of examining books. How is it impossible?  An efficient censorship department can do it.  It is being done at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister is issuing prohibition orders against the importation of certain books.  He furnished a list of those books to Deputy Tierney about five months ago.  If he can examine books and prevent their importation, why cannot he examine books and prevent their sale?  He is, as a matter of fact, charged with the function of preventing the sale of obscene books, and the Gárda Siochána have powers to prevent the sale of obscene books.  The Minister must, therefore, have some control in his Department and some examination of books.  He does not need outside organisation to advise him and call attention to complaints. But if there is to be any outside intervention, is it not the most undemocratic thing in the world to confine that intervention to certain recognised associations?  Is the ordinary citizen to be deprived of his right to complain?</P>

      <P>That is a very nisi prius point.  We have all been, from Deputy Lemass and Deputy Ruttledge down to back-benchers, mentioning amendments to Section 7 as well as to Section 6.  But the issue arises on Section 6, because it establishes and recognises these associations, and I for one cannot vote for it.  I approve the purpose of the Bill and I believe it can be made workable, having had some experience of censorship.  It can be made workable in the Minister's Department without recognised associations at all. It is repugnant to me, and I think it is repugnant to almost every member of the Dáil, that we should set up certain associations for the definite object of smelling out what they consider to be evil and obscene, and then being liable to being rejected, first by the Minister and secondly by the Censorship Board, and in either case with a <Col N="262" /> sense of indignation for being turned down and an agitation against the whole machinery of the censorship. There are two or three books in circulation that I want to see stopped, but this is not the machinery by which they will effectively be stopped.  I cannot support the section.</P>

      <P>One of the principal points which the Minister made in advocating this section was that it was essential to the proper working of the Bill.  He urged that if the section be deleted the Bill may fail, but these recognised associations, I take it, even from the point of view of their sponsor, are not going to act as censors in the country.  The evil which the Bill proposes to remedy is going, I hope, to be effectively dealt with by the Board of Censors.  The Board of Censors will still remain, even if Section 6 disappears, and if the Board of Censors does its work the Bill will not have have failed by reason of the deletion of Section 6.  Up to the present there has been a certain public demand for this Bill.  That public demand, I believe, has been largely organised by existing associations.  They feel that they have certain duties towards the citizens of this country.  They feel that they have certain duties towards their fellow men. I do not believe, whether they have recognition or not, they will feel that they are no longer their brothers' keepers. They will still feel that there are certain things it would not be right should have general circulation in this country, and I am sure, whether they are recognised or not, they will take the necessary and proper steps to bring those publications under the notice of the Board of Censors.  We feel that possibly it is desirable that there should be certain organisations acting in that way.  There may be differences of opinion in regard to that, because organisations might be able to bring pressure to bear upon the Board of Censors.  They would possibly, on occasions, practically compel the Board to give decisions not in accordance with the Board's own real opinion.  On the whole, possibly it is desirable that there should be certain organisations doing this work.  But while we recognise the necessity for <Col N="263" /> organisations it is quite another matter to give State recognition to them, and that is the whole purpose of this section. Once you give these associations a certain recognised function and status in the State, once you charge them with a certain duty which involves them in the expense of procuring books, of providing a secretariat, of meeting postage expenses and other things, you will inevitably be met with the demand on the part of those associations that this expenditure which they incurred in doing the work with which they have been charged by the State should be defrayed by the State. The consequence of that will be that in order to justify their maintaining a secretariat, and in order to justify this <Col N="264" /> subvention by the State you will have these organisations vieing with one another in establishing little boards of review in every town and village of Ireland which the Minister himself contemplated, and manifesting in every village a great zeal for the public morals by procuring, reading and discussing all the objectionable literature they can get their hands on.  I can foresee the state of affairs that is going to spring up under this section.  I believe that most reasonable men in the House really do wish the Censorship Bill to be effective, and they are anxious that the section should be deleted from the Bill.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act by a recognised association to the Minister to the effect that a book or a particular edition of a book is indecent or obsene or tends to inculcate principles contrary to public morality or is otherwise of such character that the sale or distribution thereof is or tends to be injurious or detrimental to or subversive of public morality, the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>

    <P>(3)  Whenever the Board under this section makes in reference to a complaint a report, assented to and signed by at least four members of the Board, stating that in the opinion of the Board the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint is indecent or obscene, or that in the opinion of the Board such book or edition tends to inculcate principles contrary to public morality or that such book or edition is in the opinion of the Board otherwise of such character that the sale or distribution thereof is or tends to be injurious or detrimental to or subversive of public morality, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a prohibition order) prohibit the sale and distribution in Saorstát Eireann of such book or of such edition of a book.</P>
    <P>(4)  A prohibition order made under this section in relation to a book shall, unless it is expressly limited to one or more particular editions of such book, apply to every edition of such book whether published before or after the date of such order save such (if any) editions thereof as many be excluded by an amending order from the application of such prohibition order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 24:</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 7 the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a complaint is made to the Minister to the effect that a book or a particular edition of a book is wholly or in general character indecent or obscene, or advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or any method, treatment or appliance to be used for the purpose of such prevention <Col N="267" /> or such procurement the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Board shall consider every complaint referred to them by the Minister under this section and for the purpose of such consideration shall examine the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint and on completion of such consideration the Board shall make to the Minister their report of such complaint.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Board under this section makes in reference to a complaint a report, assented to and signed by at least four members of the Board, stating that in the opinion of the Board the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint is wholly or in general character indecent or obscene or advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or any method, treatment or appliance to be used for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a prohibition order) prohibit the sale and distribution in Saorstát Eireann of such book or of such edition of a book.</P>
    <P>(4)  A prohibition order made under this section in relation to a book shall, unless it is expressly limited to one or more particular editions of such book, apply to every edition of such book whether published before or after the date of such order save such (if any) editions thereof as may be excluded by an amending order from the application of such prohibition order.</P>
    <P>This amendment looks rather more formidable than it really is.  In actual fact, the greater part of it is simply a repetition of what is already in the Bill.  There are three points covered by the amendment.  The first with reference to having recognised associations was deleted from the Bill so far as books are concerned.  That point has already been dealt with.  The second point is that between the words &ldquo;particular edition of a book is&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;indecent or obscene&rdquo;<Col N="268" /> the words &ldquo;wholly or in general character&rdquo; are introduced into the section.  The third point is that a whole class of books which are covered in the Bill by Section 17 are taken over and brought under Section 7. The first of these two latter points is somewhat less important than the other.  The amendment simply attempts to provide that a book shall not be condemned as indecent or obscene unless it be wholly or in general character indecent or obscene.  That is to say, that a book which is otherwise harmless shall not be condemned if a few pages, or perhaps only one page, or a few sentences, are such as to allow of their being termed obscene.  In introducing the amendment our feeling was that the intention of the Bill was to deal with a well-known and easily-defined class of books.  We recognise, as, of course, everybody else recognises, that there is a considerable sale of a certain kind of highly objectionable cheap pornographic books not only in Dublin but in country towns, and indeed not only cheap, but, in some cases, of a fairly high price.  We do not at all wish to prevent books of that kind from being dealt with by the Bill.  In fact, we are very anxious that everything possible should be done to deal with the traffic in that sort of book.  What we wanted to secure was that a large class of works which may be termed literary works&mdash; some of them, and perhaps the majority of them works of standing and recognised literary character which are long since well-known to the public&mdash; should not be brought before the Board of Censors, and discussed as indecent. A case in point is that mentioned by Deputy Cooper yesterday.  It might be possible, if the Bill as it stands were strictly interpreted, that a book like Gibbon's &ldquo;Decline and Fall,&rdquo; would be brought before the Censorship Board as indecent, because there are undoubtedly certain passages in it which are indecent, not in English so much as in Latin and in Greek.  There is a very large class of book of that kind which, in our judgment, it would not be only undesirable but impossible for any machinery that we can set up to prohibit.  We believe that, whereas it should be possible to deal satisfactorily and thoroughly with the <Col N="269" /> class of book that may be strictly called pornographic in character and in tendency, it is not possible, nor is it altogether desirable, that an attempt should be made to extend the scope of the Bill beyond that so far as books are concerned to cover the wider range which may include works of literature.</P>
    <P>Another example which occurs to me is a work mentioned on the Canadian Prohibition List, Burton's &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; a work which undoubtedly is, in many passages, indecent and obscene, but which costs at least £10 to buy, is rather hard to procure, and is, in any case, a very highly prized work of literature.  Not only so but if the section be applied to books of that kind, there are even books in the Irish language itself which might be brought before the Censorship Board on the plea that a number of passages in them are indecent and obscene, and which could not be brought in if this phrase which we seek here to introduce were included in the section.  We are not, of course, wedded to this phrase.  What we would like to secure is that while every effort should be made to deal with books definitely pornographic and published with the intention of broadcasting obscenity, no attempt should be made, if possible, to interfere with books of whose literary value or educational value in certain respects or for certain purposes there might be question.  We would be perfectly prepared, of course, to accept any alternative provision that could be made to that effect.  The other object which our amendment tries to achieve is rather more far-reaching, and one which has already given rise to a considerable amount of not altogether relevant discussion. It concerns a class of publication at present included under Section 17 of the Bill.  In the first place we most emphatically state that we have no wish whatever in any way to prevent that class of books from being dealt with.  We have no wish to discuss the principle whether it is desirable or not desirable to deal with that class of books or periodicals.  We are quite in agreement with the Minister and the general sense of the House and the community that the sort of propaganda that it is intended to attack by Section 17 of the <Col N="270" /> Bill is thoroughly undesirable from every point of view, and ought to be dealt with as quickly and as completely as possible.  We are not discussing that principle, although a document which was circulated to Deputies insinuated, in a not very creditable manner to our thinking, that we were discussing that principle What we are discussing is simply and solely the means to be adopted for carrying that principle into practice. In the Bill as it stands the section which deals with this type of publication reads thus:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing granted to him under this Section (a) to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published, or (b) to sell or expose, offer or keep for sale, or (c) to distribute, offer or keep for distribution any book or periodical publication which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or any method, treatment or appliance to be used for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With the principle as enshrined in that clause, I repeat, we are absolutely and entirely and without any reservation in agreement.  But the difficulty which strikes us, and it is a difficulty which, we are sure, will appeal to the whole House is, that there is no provision laid down in the Bill for defining in particular cases the book or periodical with which it is proposed by that section to deal.  As far as we can see under this section you will have a state of affairs by which booksellers and newsagents will be in a state of complete uncertainty as to what their position is.  No bookseller can tell from one day to another whether a police officer on an order of the Minister or the Attorney-General may not come in and seize some particular issue of a periodical which contains perhaps an advertisement that advocates or may reasonably be supposed to advocate the practices referred to; or that a police officer may not come in and seize, say, a <Col N="271" /> book like a recent book on Socialism about which there was a great deal of discussion and which I believe contains in one or two sentences matters which might be construed as advocating those practices.</P>
    <P>The position of the bookseller or newsagent under the Bill as it stands is one of complete and absolute uncertainty. And as far as anyone reading the Bill can see there is no authority to decide, before a prosecution takes place and therefore before a bookseller or newsagent is subjected to altogether undeserved interference or inconvenience&mdash;there is no authority to decide as to what does or does not constitute advocacy of those practices.  It has been stated in a document which was circulated to Deputies and printed in the public press that what was called &ldquo;the Catholic principle&rdquo; was enshrined in this section of the Bill, and that Deputy Law and I were anxious to depart from the Catholic principle. That statement seems to me to have had its origin in a confusion of ideas.  It is all very well to state a principle in a Bill, but when dealing with legislation you have to provide machinery by which the principle can be carried into effect.  In the case of a principle which has behind it the moral authority of the Church, that moral authority carries with it its own sanction in the conscience of the individual. The Church has no police machinery for carrying out the dictates of its moral authority.  But in the case of Acts of Parliament these Acts have to be carried out by policemen and police officials who, although they may not often err, are at any rate not altogether infallible; and they have to be interpreted by lawyers, by, say, the Attorney-General or by the Minister, who may err perhaps less than a police official, but is equally unlikely to be able to claim infallibility.  It is just how the machinery is going to work that we want to have discussed on this amendment.  We have a similar amendment at a later stage of the Bill for dealing with periodical publications of a similar nature.  In this section we are concerned only with books, and I would submit that the <Col N="272" /> question of books is of more importance and one deserving of more care in the setting up of machinery for dealing with them than that of periodicals.  Periodicals come out at regular intervals, and it is easy enough to interfere with the circulation of one issue of a periodical without damaging the publication as a whole, whereas if you interfere with a book you may completely destroy it.</P>
    <P>We want to suggest that before running any risk of such sporadic interference with either authors, publishers, or newsagents, you should be careful to set up a clear and definite means of deciding when exactly an offence is committed.  The means that occurred to us were that books of this kind might be put in the same category as all indecent books are put in by the Bill as it stands.  We propose by our amendment to deal with these books as indecent and obscene books, to have them made the subject of complaint to the Minister and to have them brought to the notice of the Censorship Board before the publishers or the circulators of them or the disseminators of them are made liable to any criminal prosecution.  We thought that there was no very compelling reason why books of this kind should be singled out from these indecent publications.  It may be said that they do more harm.  Probably they do. At the same time what we should consider here is not so much the book which gives offence, but the case where a book which is not actually offensive at all is made the subject of a prosecution and where the newsagent, publisher or author is subject to interference and inconvenience without any real reason.  That is the kind of thing that we want to guard against, and it occurred to us that by leaving such books to the ordinary machinery of the Censorship Board we would secure that such prosecutions and such interference would not take place.  We are not, of course, wedded to that particular method of dealing with the matter.  We are only anxious to protect the author, the bookseller and the newsagent, not authors, booksellers or newsagents who are guilty, but authors, newsagents, and booksellers who are innocent.  It is always easy <Col N="273" /> to say that the people who interfere in these matters at all are themselves interested in this propaganda and are guilty people.</P>
    <P>Our object is to see that innocent people are not made subject to prosecution in this matter.  We are not wedded to the particular method suggested, and we are perfectly willing to adopt any other good method.  For instance, it might be possible that some different machinery for getting together a list of these publications might be put in force; that a list might be prepared by the Minister's Department and published to the newsagent, and that any newsagent selling a book on such a list would be liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>In that case the newsagent and publisher would be protected, and so would the author, because the author would not be liable to have his book interfered with without full and careful consideration.  If such machinery as that should commend itself to the Dáil we would be quite prepared to accept it.  What we did want to bring about was that the Dáil would not allow the section to be passed without adverting to the serious dangers of prosecution and of interference with the normal, natural public rights of innocent people which are inherent in it as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed so far as it is possible to protect the people that Deputy Tierney refers to.  I think it would be the desire of everyone to protect them, but the amendment as it appears on the Paper seems to bring in Sections 7 and 17. I submit that the greater portion of the amendment would arise when we are dealing with Section 17.  There are several amendments dealing with Section 17.  If there were a discussion, perhaps the Minister might consider a way of trying to meet the point that Deputy Tierney has in mind.  It is not the desire of anybody that there should be a raid or interference in any way in connection with books, or that people should be put to the trouble that might be imposed or inflicted upon them if the section were to be adopted as it is.  The difficulty I see is that there would not be an offence and the <Col N="274" /> book would not be illegal at all until it was brought before the Board.  That is a point of some importance, because while all this thing was being gone into and investigated you would probably have it circulated and spread through the country.  That is one of the difficulties I see.  As regards Deputy Tierney's amendment, the greater portion of it could better be taken when we are dealing with Section 17.</P>

      <P>All other books that come under this statute. I cannot accept that.  I frankly confess that this section as it stands will probably be, as far as books are concerned, very much needed.  I am very much afraid of that.  I think that the machinery which so far, the Dáil has provided, with the associations&mdash; I am not going to cry over spilt milk&mdash; and with a Censorship Board, will probably be very nearly, if not quite, a dead letter as far as books are concerned. I therefore think that it will be very necessary to retain Section 17. That section certainly makes it clear that whether the censorship of books breaks down or not, the ability to prosecute for the possession of a certain book will remain intact.  It may turn out&mdash;I hope it does not, but I am greatly afraid it may&mdash;that this Bill will be effective as regards periodicals and will be effective as regards this particular class of book only; that is, the book dealing with birth-control.  I am anxious to see that at any rate it shall be clear that in that respect the Bill shall be effective.  I would be willing to accept Deputy Law's and Deputy Tierney's amendment to Section 7 to this extent, that I would permit by amendment the Censorship Board to draw up and declare, as it does with reference to other books, a list of prohibited books and, coming to a later <Col N="275" /> stage, prohibited periodicals, prohibited not merely because they were indecent or obscene in the wide sense of the word, but prohibited because they advocated the unnatural prevention of birth.  But I want to make it clear at this stage that that list will be a guidance, and only a guidance, for booksellers.  They can be prosecuted under Section 17, and I would make it clear under that section that they can be prosecuted whether the book is in this prohibited list or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of it will be simply this, that there would be a list there for booksellers from which they could judge.  In addition to that, they would have to exercise their own judgement.  When I come to Section 17 itself I will deal with sub-section (b), which is, I have been satisfied, rather too wide.  That is, to &ldquo;sell or expose, offer or keep for sale.&rdquo; That might conceivably put booksellers and stationers in a very awkward position, because a paper normally properly conducted might produce an article advocating birth-control on some particular occasion.  It is a well-known fact that there are certain well-known writers in England who advocate birth-control, and a well-conducted paper might, on one particular occasion, have an article of this nature.  I recognise that if it had such an article it would be unfair to the stationer or bookseller, as the case might be, to prosecute him.  While I would be willing to have sub-section (b) modified, I would only be willing to have it modified to this extent, that he should have shown no negligence in the sale. In other words, the onus should be upon him and he shall be guilty unless he shows that he has taken reasonable care to see that a book or periodical of this nature is not sold.  Further than that I cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular amendment with which we are dealing really re-enacts the existing section except for that sub-section 1 (b).  I am willing to add these words, &ldquo;or advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or <Col N="276" /> any other method.&rdquo;  I would be willing to have those words inserted in the section. Deputy Thrift asks me what use would it be.  I think it might be of very considerable use, because the bookseller would see the list, and he would first know there are certain things which cannot be sold, and he would see generally the type of paper and the particular class of articles that are dangerous. Let me take, for example, that a well-known English writer and he had written a book which advocates birth-control.  His name appears on the list.  The bookseller knows that list, and then he sees another book by the same writer.  That puts him on his guard.  I will take an extreme example. Most people happen to know that there is a certain woman who writes books which are largely advertised dealing with this particular class of offence. Now, suppose somebody sees her name on the title page of a book, he is certainly put on his guard, and he inquires as to what the contents of the book may be.  That is a very extreme case.  The bookseller would not require that particular name to be put on any list, but there may be a person not so extremely well-known, some writer on social affairs who may have written a book which is on the list.  The booksellers would be put on their guard and it would be of assistance to them.  I could not at all consent to the deletion of Section 17.  I would like to point out that either I misunderstood Deputy Tierney or Deputy Tierney has misconstrued Section 17.  No Guard or anybody like that becomes a judge under Section 17 of what is indecent or what is not.  He simply brings a prosecution, and it is the Court under Section 17 which decides.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann approves of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War, signed at Paris on the 27th day of August, 1928, a copy of which was laid upon the Table of the Dáil on the 20th day of February, 1929, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for its ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated yesterday that I did not intend to make any lengthy preliminary statement in moving this motion, but that if points were raised, if there was any suspicion among people, any distrust as to the manner in which the Pact was negotiated, or as to the circumstances of the signing or ratification of it, I would deal with them.  The history of the Pact is so recent I do not intend to go into details concerning it.  It will be within the recollection of most people that in June, 1927, a proposal was made by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State in America that both Powers should enter into a bilateral pact renouncing war as an instrument of national policy, and that a settlement of international disputes should be sought only by pacific means. Towards the end of that year the Secretary of State in America proposed that a better contribution towards world peace could be made if, instead of confining it to the two nations then concerned, it were thrown open and an attempt made to get the adherence of the principal Powers of the world. The result was that in April, 1928, a Note was sent to the other four Great Powers asking that they should all become co-signatories to a treaty renouncing <Col N="278" /> war as an instrument of national policy.  An invitation was extended to this country in May, 1928 under circumstances which have already been discussed in this House and the original Pact, without any modification, was signed for this State by President Cosgrave in August of that year.  It was signed under full power issued to him on the advice of the Executive Council, a full power, it should be noted, that in this case, as in the case of all other signatories from the Commonwealth of Nations, was limited to the area of jurisdiction of this Parliament.  In that respect his power was of an equality with that of the signatories who signed on behalf of the other States, members of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as they, Great Britain included, had their powers limited to the area of jurisdiction of their own Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Pact, the terms of which were circulated yesterday is now before the Dáil for approval by the passage of this motion so that the Executive Council can take steps to ratify it.  As I have already explained, the American Administration goes out of office in March and wish to complete the Pact before then.  To meet their wishes we, acting similarly to all the other Governments, are taking steps to get ratification achieved before the 4th March.  In order to do that this exceptional step had to be taken by us: The instrument of ratification was prepared on our advice and despatched to the Charge d'Affaires at Washington. On the receipt of the message that this motion, ratifying the Pact, has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas it will be presented to the Secretary of State in America.  The ratification has been done by the King on the advice of the Executive Council. It is a notable event in our history in so far as it is the first time that there has been an international agreement signed by any State member of the Commonwealth other than Great Britain as a separate instrument of ratification.  It is the first time that we negotiated and ratified an international agreement of this kind.  The reasons which prompted the bringing forward of this Pact for the Renunciation of War are matters of common <Col N="279" /> knowledge.  People may be cynical.  A great deal of cynicism was expressed to-day in the Seanad as to the effects of it.  As to whether the full fruits may come from it in regard to the universal abandonment of war I am not concerned, but I think it is time that we should play our part in promoting the idea of peace and not refuse by any action to promote the main and simple idea of this Pact which is to try and have disputes between nations settled otherwise than by warlike means.  The Pact says that there should be no recourse to war and that a settlement of international disputes should be sought only by way of pacific means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the main idea behind this Pact, those for whom I can claim to speak are in full sympathy. The idea of ending war appeals to us as I think it would appeal to every humane person.  Those of us who took any interest or whether we took an interest or not, whether our interest was deep or otherwise, in the history of the last fifteen or sixteen years and the wars that have taken place during that time, ought to, if we have any feeling for humanity, bear in mind the awful things that have happened in Europe.  We ought to bend all our energies and use all our influence to endeavour to promote the idea of international peace, and to end war as the supposed purpose of the Treaty now before us is.  However, from our point of view, we believe that it would not be right for us, those of us in particular who stand for the absolute and complete independence of our country, whose idea and ideal it is to work and use all means without restriction to achieve that object, the freedom of our country&mdash;we do not think that it would be right for us now, without a similar declaration being made by those who hold our country in subjection&mdash;a definite declaration without reservation&mdash;and who are strong enough to use force to hold our country&mdash;without a similar declaration being made by those people, the responsible heads of the British Government, who control the British Empire, we do not think that it would be right in the <Col N="280" /> name of our own people and in the name of those who are carrying on that fight still, that we should say in advance that we will give up the only means that have yet been used with success to bring that powerful secular enemy of ours to her senses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that other means have been tried down the centuries, especially in the last century and a half or so.  Constitutional means have been tried with out effect by our people and by people speaking in the name of Ireland to bring that secular enemy to a sense of the justice of the rights of Ireland These methods have failed.  We know that other methods, methods of force, were not adopted by us because of any love of force.  That applies to our people generally.  It is not because our people are a pugnacious people or a people who resort unnecessarily to arms, but because there were people in the country who were prepared to make any and every sacrifice so that the freedom of the country might be achieved.  That was why war was resorted to at any time by our people. We do not think, speaking so far as we can in the name of those who are out to win that freedom for all Ireland, that it would be proper or right, even in the name of a part of Ireland such as this State can speak for, to tie the hands of our people behind their backs and to say to the enemy, &ldquo;We give up the only means that have yet proved in any way successful in winning recognition from you of the rights of the people of Ireland to their freedom.&rdquo; I say again that we want peace; we desire peace.  We would be prepared at the same time as that secular enemy of our country to make a declaration, if they gave up the force by which they have divided this country in two, by which they have held this country so long, we would with gladness and joy make a similar declaration that war for us is over.  &ldquo;You drop force in holding our country, you give our people the right to express their wish and their will with regard to their country freely and in an unfettered way, without holding over them the threat of war.&rdquo;  Then we say that we are prepared to join with any and every nation in a declaration that will <Col N="281" /> have sincerity behind it that wars of any kind between nations and peoples should end.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the United States or the Secretary of State for the United States, who is primarily responsible for the bringing forward of this instrument was anything but sincere in his object.  I do not suggest that the Governments or some of them who signed that declaration were not sincere.  Some of them were, I am sure.  Some of them, we cannot hold, were absolutely sincere, seeing that to our own knowledge at the present moment a threat of force is used; a threat of war is used and held over our own heads to prevent the liberty and the unity of our own country being accomplished.  What sincerity there is in the declaration by a nation that holds this country, by the declaration of that nation that they want international peace, when they are doing their utmost to prevent such peace being accomplished between themselves and their nearest neighbour, we cannot see.  We cannot believe that the intentions of such a country or of such a Government are honest.  Therefore, to that extent, speaking of one country at any rate, we believe that the signature of that country to this document is not sincere.  While it is useful perhaps to have on record even a declaration from that Government in the name of their people that they want international peace, we would like to see action as well as words.  Therefore, taking the stand we do as to the rights of our country and the rights of our people to use any and every honourable means constitutional or otherwise, to achieve the full freedom and unity of our country, we cannot in sincerity and in honesty agree to a declaration of that kind until some of those&mdash;at least one of the countries who have already signed it make a similar declaration, not merely by words but by acts, that they have come to the same conclusion that war in all sincerity ought to be brought to an end as a means for ending disputes between nations.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why we believe difficulties are in our way in agreeing to ratification of this Pact.  We hold that we are not free.  While we are free certainly to sign that Pact, we <Col N="282" /> are not absolutely free agents.  We can be forced at any time by a certain neighbour of ours into war whether we like it or not.  We have no choice in the matter.  One reason for that is Article 7 of the Treaty signed in 1921, the Treaty on which the Constitution of this State is founded.  Article 7 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  In time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State; and</P>
    <P>(b)  In time of war or of strained relations with a Foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>We are not strong enough to prevent England, in case she were at war or in case war were threatened even and she desired it, from making use of our country, our harbours or territory. Therefore, England can send her fleet into our harbours and her armies into our territory.  She could do that before this Treaty was signed I know She is doing that definitely now.  This Treaty has been signed, and so far as it could be done by that instrument having been signed we are willingly assenting to the fact that England can force our country to be the cockpit of war in case war did come about, let us say, between England and the United States.  We look upon the Kellogg Pact as a desirable thing, but we think that we ought to be absolutely free to decide the full destinies of our own country before we make any declaration binding ourselves not to use all the means we might be able to use to win the full freedom of our own country.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Pact itself are certainly admirable.  In the fourth paragraph of the Preamble there are just one or two lines to which I have already said we take objection: &ldquo;That any signatory Power which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war should be denied the benefits furnished by this Treaty.&rdquo;  In self-defence, in defence of our own rights and liberties, when Dáil Eireann was established in 1919, <Col N="283" /> in defence of the rights and liberties of the people of Ireland and of all Ireland war was waged on a neighbouring Power.  We used the natural rights of our citizenship to defend our liberty which was attacked.  Are we going to say now that, for all time, no matter what invasion of our rights and liberties may be made by the only country that ever interfered with our rights, whatever they do to us, whatever rights they filch from us, whatever invasion of our liberty they may be guilty of as they are guilty at this moment, we will stand with our hands tied and let England do what she pleases to us?  It might be, if we were all ideal Christians, the desirable thing to do.  I am afraid we are not.  We have not yet arrived at that advanced stage of Christian civilisation and we have had it proved in our history that England will listen to nothing else from this country but the mailed fist.  In my time, I do not want to see war again.  I do not want to see shooting. I do not want to see bloodshed.  I earnestly and sincerely hope it will not happen in my time and that we may be successful by other methods.  I am not going to preach a different doctrine now from what I preached from my earliest boyhood, that it is the right and duty of every young Irishman to defend with arms, if necessary, the rights and liberties of the whole people of Ireland.  Others may have changed their tune on that matter.  I cannot bring myself to change the doctrine I was brought up on, that I have endeavoured to practise and have preached and will continue to preach as long as I have power and voice to do so.</P>
    <P>In the letter that the Minister for External Affairs sent when announcing the decision of the Executive Council to adhere to this Pact, he made clear that the Kellogg Pact would be signed subject to the commitment of the Free State under the Covenant of the League of Nations.  The date is not on this extract, which is taken from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 17th July, 1928:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As I informed you in my Note of the 30th May, the Government of the <Col N="284" /> Irish Free State were prepared to accept unreservedly the draft Treaty proposed by your Government on the 13th April, holding, as they did, that neither their right of self-defence nor their commitments under the Covenant of the League of Nations were in any way prejudiced by its terms.</P>
    <P>Article X of the League of Nations binds every adherent of the League of Nations to back up every other member of the League of Nations in preserving the present boundaries of the signatory countries.  Article X of the League of Nations, when the Constitution of the League of Nations was in course of adoption, was opposed by Dáil Eireann of 1919, and Dáil Eireann, through its representatives and spokesmen, had a great deal to say in inducing America to turn down the ratification of the Constitution of the League of Nations in America.  Dáil Eireann spokesmen everywhere they were, in Ireland or outside of it, emphasised that Article X of the League of Nations gave England the right to demand the help of other nations signatory to that Treaty in trying to preserve the boundaries that then existed, Ireland being regarded by Great Britain as part of her territory. Under Article X&mdash;that was our gospel at that time&mdash;she could claim the right to ask all other countries signatory to that Treaty to come and assist her in fighting Ireland, if necessary, to preserve the territorial integrity of the British Empire, which included Ireland.  That argument was preached up and down America; that argument met President Wilson when he went on a great tour through the United States in favour of the League of Nations.  Everywhere he went Dáil Eireann representatives and those they could influence met President Wilson.  In every town through which he went Dáil Eireann funds were used to have huge full-page advertisements in the newspapers, stating that Article X, if agreed to, would assist Great Britain in keeping Ireland within the British Empire and in preserving the boundaries as they then existed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to mention that the very first protest that was made against Article X, before ever a word <Col N="285" /> was mentioned about it in the United States or anywhere else, was made by the envoy of Dáil Eireann in 1919 on behalf of Dáil Eireann, and it was on that protest that America based its opposition, on the very words of that protest that was used throughout America to influence America.  It influenced many Senators and Congressmen. We had considerable influence at that time as a united people, fighting for our rights, and the arguments that Dáil Eireann used at that time were very largely responsible for the fact that America refused to ratify that Covenant and refused eventually to join the League of Nations.  In this letter that the Minister for External Affairs sent to his Excellency, Mr. Sterling, the representative of the United States, it is clearly stated that this Pact was signed subject to the commitments of the Irish Free State under Article X of the League of Nations Covenant.  So far as that Covenant binds Irish citizens, in any way, to respect the present boundaries &mdash;I am not alone talking of the boundaries that exist in our own country now and ought not to exist, but I am also refusing to be bound by, so far as we can revise them, the boundaries of the British Empire in so far as countries like Egypt and India are concerned&mdash;we deny the right of Ireland's name to be used in guaranteeing these boundaries, and we refuse to ratify any instrument, however good in itself, that means inferentially that we recognise the boundary in our country or boundaries in those other countries I have mentioned that are there under duress.  Though our might is not great, though our moral influence or otherwise in the world's diplomacy, particularly, may not be great, I say we would not be true to our history if we guaranteed in that way by our signatures any Pact to assist any empire, English or otherwise, in holding down any people that wish to be free.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if there is an implication, as I maintain there is, in that signature, owing to the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that we bind ourselves to respect the boundaries of the British Empire, as at present constituted, we repudiate that signature and we say that we, at any rate, can <Col N="286" /> have no hand, act or part in agreeing to it.</P>
    <P>I asked here yesterday if the Minister would be so kind as to lay on the Table, for the information of members of the House and the public in general, the correspondence that passed between London and Dublin&mdash;between the English Government and the Government of the Irish Free State&mdash;with reference to this Pact.  The Minister did not see his way to lay such correspondence on the Table.  I was anxious, and I believe there were other people anxious, that all this diplomatic business should be done in the open.  You remember one of the principles for which America was supposed to have entered the war. One of the principles laid down by President Wilson was &ldquo;open diplomacy, openly arrived at.&rdquo;  We claim, in accord with that principle, that all the correspondence and documents should be laid on the Table.  We are being asked to sign this document in the dark. We do not know all the principles that we are being committed to.  There is one particular aspect of it that I would like further light upon.  There is a letter that was sent by Sir Austen Chamberlain, the English Foreign Minister, to the Secretary for the United States, Mr. Kellogg, not exactly by way of putting forward reservations.  I believe he repudiated the idea that this letter was to be regarded as putting forward reservations.  I think if we use the word &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; we will be accurate in describing the letter that was sent by Sir Austen Chamberlain on May 19th from the English Foreign Office to Washington.  There are 13 articles in this particular letter, reservations or interpretations, whatever you like to call them.  They were put forward by England not exactly as conditions, but as interpretations, giving her idea of what this Kellogg Pact would mean to her and how far she intended to go in her own interpretation of the meaning of the Kellogg Pact.  In the course of Article X of that important letter it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The language of Article 1, as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, renders it desirable that I should remind your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity <Col N="287" /> of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety.  His Majesty's Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their protection against attack is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. It must be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain accept the new Treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.</P>
    <P>When asking for the correspondence that passed between the Executive Council of the Irish Free State and the British Government or other Dominions of the British Government with reference to this Pact, I was particularly anxious to know if any effort had been made to get from England an interpretation of what England meant by the certain regions of the world over which she maintains a right to look after their special welfare and integrity. During the time the negotiations which finished in the signing of that regrettable Treaty of 1921 were on we know that the English Ministers declared that it was necessary for the peace and safety of England that she should hold Ireland, and that is the reason why they hold Ireland to-day, and why their garrison here in this country are holding our harbours and why they claim that it is necessary for their peace and safety.  I was anxious to know if any effort was made by the Irish Free State to have the language in that Article X. of the letter of Sir Austen Chamberlain clarified, and to find out if England still maintained and declared that it was necessary for her peace and safety, and the safety of her Empire, that she should hold Ireland as she holds it at present, and that, despite the fact that she was negotiating and signing a Pact with America to renounce war, she still found it necessary, and would continue to find it necessary, to tell us and tell the world that holding Ireland was absolutely necessary for her peace and security.  Possibly I will be told that the Executive Council of the Irish Free State are not concerned with what England says to America as to the interpretation <Col N="288" /> she may give of her signature.  That would be all very well, if we could accept that, if Ireland were not in the unfortunate position of being like the mouse and the cat so far as Ireland and the British Empire are concerned.  That would be all very well if we were an absolutely free country, if the whole people of Ireland had been given absolutely and definitely the right to decide freely for themselves what form of government they desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>England stepped in and did not allow that to happen.  She partitioned our country and holds six counties of Ireland, which are garrisoned by her army.  England holds the harbours of Ireland, which are garrisoned by her navy, to prevent the people of Ireland from declaring freely and in an unfettered way what their own will and wish is with regard to the liberty of our country.  We have to recognise England still as a dominating political influence in the two parts of this country.  England still has a definite, clear dominance here.  Therefore, we are bound to take notice of any declaration of this kind made by the Foreign Minister of England in the name of his Government.  We are bound to use our intelligence and to read between the lines that England still maintains her right to hold this country, as she says, in the interests of her own security.  Therefore it is our duty, and it would be at least the duty of those interested in the freedom and unity of Ireland, to see, when Governments were being asked to sign an important declaration, that it was an opportunity that might be used with advantage to try to induce, diplomatically if you like, from England a declaration that, now that she was giving up war and declaring that she would give up war for ever, except, as she says, of course for defence, but at any rate renouncing war, she would be prepared to recognise the right of this people that she holds in subjection to absolute freedom of choice as a people and a nation, not as a divided country as at present, but as a united people, to declare their will and wish with regard <Col N="289" /> to the future of their own country.  I would be anxious to know if any attempt was made to avail of the opportunity that was given when the Irish Free State was asked to adhere to this Pact to use diplomatic influence in order to secure from England a declaration that she, at any rate, was sincere and intended no further to impose by force her will or wish on this country or on any of the two parts into which she has divided it.</P>
      <P>England has issued her own interpretation; America has done the same. America has declared that the Continent of America is her sphere of influence and, therefore, that England or any other country should not, without it being considered an unfriendly act, interfere in the internal affairs or arrangements of the nations composing the sphere of influence over which the Monroe doctrine is supposed to rule. That is America's affair.  I object to imperialism anywhere, but we on this side of the House, at any rate, are more particularly interested in the influence and dominance that is exercised by one Empire over us.  Until we have got rid of that influence and secured the freedom of our own country most of our efforts must be used to free our own country, and when we have freed it, as, please God, we will free it and unite it again, we will be in a better position to use whatever little influence we may have in the affairs of the world to induce empires to give the right that we claim for our own people to other subject countries the world over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In asking if there is sincerity behind this Pact one is forced to take notice of the fact that while its ratification was being discussed in some Parliaments Bills were before the Parliaments of the different nations asking for money supplies to increase and, in some cases, to increase by huge amounts, the armaments of these same nations.  A few days after agreeing to the ratification of the Kellogg Pact America voted a sum of money to enable its Navy to be very largely increased. Fifteen new cruisers are to be built.  England, after signing this Pact declaring against war for ever, has revised her intention recently expressed to reduce the building programme <Col N="290" /> of her Navy.  Only a few days after the Kellogg Pact was agreed to in America, England announced she intended to increase her Navy by the addition of three cruisers, one of ten thousand tons and two of eight thousand tons each, every year for the next five years.  That is to be the minimum building programme.  We know that France is building a large number of submarines and that Germany is laying down again the basis of a fleet. All these nations are signatories to the Kellogg Pact.</P>
    <P>In the case of America, it must be realised that the commerce of America is growing.  The nation has very recently grown remarkably prosperous; her industries and commerce have extended to an extraordinary extent, and her commerce is with every corner of the world.  Therefore America claims the right to protect her commerce; she claims the right to a fleet that will adequately protect her ships of commerce in every sea.  For a long time, more than a hundred years or a hundred and fifty, England has claimed that she and she alone has the right not alone to protect her own commerce which nobody would refuse to her, but to dominate the seas.</P>
    <P>During the last war America claimed freedom on the seas as a neutral, as she was in the early stages of the war. She claimed the right to have her ships of commerce pass in and out of the war zones of the seas without molestation.  That right was not admitted. Therefore America claims now that the only way she can protect her ships is to build a fleet big enough to protect them and big enough to face the biggest fleet on the seas.  She is building a fleet, we are told by the American Press that will at least equal that of England, and that being so, has it not followed in history&mdash;I need not remind anybody, for they know as well as I do&mdash;that war was the consequence of such armament-building in the past?  The possibilities are that, as a result of this rivalry that is existing, and that will continue and grow in intensity, that conflict may occur between England and America on the seas. It is not stretching our imagination too far if we look back into history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> Where is Ireland going to come in in case that happens?  We are deeply interested, whether we like it or not, in these two great peoples and nations. We have close relationship of blood and otherwise with both these countries. Millions of our people have passed into the United States and formed part of that great people.  Millions of our people have gone to England, and their descendants are citizens of Britain to-day.  Where are we going to be if that conflict takes place, as perhaps it will?  If it takes place, what is going to be the position of Ireland?  Under the present diplomatic and political conditions that now exist in Ireland and the relations that exist between England and Ireland, if they are continued, Irish harbours and seas round Ireland will be red with the blood of her own people, and her own territory will be used whether we like it or not, whether we wish to take sides or not, as the cockpit of this conflict which, it is not too great a stretch of the imagination to picture, will take place.</P>
    <P>Unless we can get rid of the political and diplomatic commitments that bind our people under the Treaty of 1921, signed, as I maintain, under threat of war, and the commitments under the League of Nations Covenant, signed willingly in the name of some of the people of Ireland by the Executive Council and get recognition for our country as a definitely neutral State the prospect for Ireland in a possible war between England and America is certainly not pleasant to think of.</P>
    <P>In view of all these arguments, and owing to the refusal of the Minister to give us the information that we are asking for, owing to the commitments of Ireland at the present time, diplomatic and political, willingly agreed to in some cases, unwillingly in others, we cannot, we believe, honestly and sincerely give a vote in favour of the ratification of this Pact, though we do say honestly and sincerely that from our hearts we would be happy to see Ireland in a position to sign the Kellogg Pact or a similar international declaration made in the name of free nations, made in <Col N="292" /> the name of Ireland, as one of the free nations&mdash;absolutely free and independent, and a united Ireland.  If Ireland were free and independent and were asked to sign such a declaration, no body of people in Ireland would be happier or more pleased to make the declaration under the conditions I have suggested than those for whom I speak.</P>

      <P>I was rather astonished at the reticence of Deputies of parties sitting in other Benches not rising to speak upon this question.  In order to give them an opportunity of reconsidering the effect of their silence and perhaps deciding what they are going to say, there are one or two minor points on this question with which I shall occupy the House.  In the first place I would like to draw attention to the reasons given by the Minister for External Affairs in refusing to make available to Deputies the documents that passed between his Government and the Government of Britain in relation to this Treaty.  I asked the Minister yesterday to state definitely what were the special reasons for maintaining secrecy in connection with this Treaty, and he evaded the answer by asserting that he had already answered.  Since that we have had an opportunity of actually examining the very words he used, and we find that they are merely a general expression of opinion that it is usually undesirable to publish documents passing between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, because otherwise all constitutional progress would be made impossible.</P>

    <P>I can understand that there are very many documents which passed between the Minister for External Affairs and the British Government which in the interests of constitutional progress or otherwise it might be very undersirable to publish.  These documents, if ever they do see the light of day, will be found to deal with many, various and certainly very interesting matters, starting back from the order which came originally, no doubt, for the initiation of the Civil War.  But although I can recognise that there is a very <Col N="293" /> strong argument for maintaining secrecy in respect of the greater portion of the correspondence between the Government here and the Government in Great Britain surely in this case of a Treaty for the renunciation of war, if on no other ground whatsoever, there is no reasonable ground for refusing to let the light of day shine on the facts relating to it.  If ever there was a case for open diplomacy this is one.</P>
    <P>The very fact that there has been a refusal to disclose these documents is in itself an indication that there is something to be concealed.  What is to be concealed it is not very difficult to guess.  Certain indications have been given to us to the nature of the communications which were addressed to the Minister for External Affairs here from His Majesty's Government in Great Britain.  We are very completely in the dark as to the nature of the replies.  Deputy O'Kelly has made certain references to the reservations by the British Government in respect of Article 1 of this Treaty.  Article 1 of this Treaty reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The High Contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that solemn declaration there appear the signatures of the various representatives of His Majesty, acting on behalf of a number of His Majesty's Dominions.  It was in respect of that particular Article that the British reservations were produced.  The British Government, before accepting the invitation to become a party to this Treaty, thought it desirable to point out to the Government of the United States.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the language of Article 1 as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy renders it desirable that I should remind your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety.  His Majesty's Government has been at pains in the <Col N="294" /> past to make it clear that any interference with the integrity of these regions cannot be suffered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it is true that later on in the same communication the British Government asked the Secretary of the United States Government to observe that the detailed arguments in that paragraph are expressed on behalf of his Majesty's Government in Great Britain.  They stated, however, that they had been in communication with the Governments of the various Dominions and had ascertained that they were all in general agreement with the cordial principle of the proposed Treaty.  I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;since things that are equal to the same are equal to one another&mdash;to tell us if the actual reservations which were ultimately made by the British Government were first communicated to him, and if they were considered by him, and if he Government sent any definite expression of opinion to the British Government with regard to them?  This matter was discussed in the Dáil before on the motion for the adjournment, and the Minister for External Affairs made the amazing assertion that we were no more concerned with the British reservation than we were concerned with the reservations made by the French Government, or by the United States Government.  He made that assertion, despite the fact that this State is operating under a Constitution based on a Treaty containing Article 7. Deputy O'Kelly has just read that Article.  Under it the Executive Council are obliged to give to the British Government in time of war such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require.  I would ask the Deputies to realise that in that Article of the Treaty of 1921 there is no qualification whatsoever placed upon the term &ldquo;war.&rdquo;  It does not merely refer to a defensive war.  It refers to any war in which Great Britain may be engaged, and in that connection we must therefore study the reservations which the British Government thought fit to make to Article I of this Article.  It means that we are directly concerned in these reservations.  If we are to renounce <Col N="295" /> war we must make it quite clear to the other signatories of this Pact that we are only in a position to give a very limited renunciation.  Because whenever it should suit the interests of another signatory; whenever another signatory feels fit to engage in any war in any of these regions of the earth in which they feel they have been appointed by God to guide the natives, or whenever there are strained relations between that other signatory and the people residing in these regions, we will be compelled to ignore this Treaty which we are now asked to ratify and abide by the original Treaty of 1921.</P>
    <P>When the Vote for the Department of External Affairs was under consideration in this House, either in the previous session or the one before it, I drew attention to the conflict which might possibly arise between the commitments which the Executive Council had made under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the commitments which they had made by the signing of this Treaty in respect of Article 7.  By the Covenant of the League of Nations this State was committed not to give facilities to any belligerent in any aggressive war.  I asked the Minister for External Affairs to tell us, if it should happen that Britain had become engaged in an aggressive war within the meaning of the Covenant of the League of Nations and insisted on her right under Article 7 of the Treaty to secure harbour and other facilities here, would we honour our bond with the League of Nations or with Britain?  I asked the Minister to tell us which tie would prove the stronger in that event.  I could not get an answer, or, at any rate, I did not get an answer.  I think that the very same question arises for answer in connection with this Treaty We are hereby asked to declare that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy should be made to the end, that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing between the peoples may be perpetuated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are persuaded that the time <Col N="296" /> has come when there should be a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, will we take up or will the Executive Council take up with the British Government the obligations of Article 7 of the Treaty with a view to having that article eliminated?  And if they will not do that, will they make it clear to the Government of the United States that we are not free agents in this matter in the renunciation of war, and will they make it clear to the Government of the United States if it should happen that Britain will denounce the Pact and engage in a war in contravention of it, that we, under this Treaty, would be bound to stand by Britian and to violate our signature to this Treaty?  I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that it does appear that this Treaty, as an instrument for the prevention of war, is not worth the paper it is written on.  If the nation whose representatives signed this Pact really desire to banish war from the earth, let them renounce not war, but renounce what causes war.  Let them renounce aggression.  Let Britain withdraw her armies from Northern Ireland and let France withdraw her armies from German territory.  Let them get their cannon and beat them into tractors, and take their fleets and send them to join the German fleet at the bottom of the North Sea.  If they do that, then we will have some concrete evidence of their sincerity.</P>
    <P>Some time ago when the representatives of Soviet Russia attended a disarmament conference at Geneva and made the astounding proposal to abolish armies they were laughed at. On the faces of every one of the professional diplomats of Europe there appeared that kind of smile which we are accustomed to see on the faces of Ministers when we ask them in the Dáil to honour the promises that they make during elections.  But the Russian proposal was turned out of court. It was ignored; it was denounced by every Government because it cut right down to the root of things and stripped the sham of all this pretence which is being maintained by these Governments to effect general disarmament or to renounce war.</P>
    <P>We are, no doubt, one of the smallest <Col N="297" /> and probably one of the least significant signatories to the Pact, but we can give a lead to the others.  Let us therefore give them a lead.  Let us tell the British Government that, having signed this Pact, we are going to honour it, and that henceforth Article 7 of the Treaty holds no weight.  Let us see what the British Government will reply.  Test the sincerity of their signature to the Pact.  Let us announce that in no war, whether it be a war of aggression or of defence in which Britian engages, will we allow ourselves in any way to be involved.  We have been involved in wars for very many centuries and in consequence of the fighting we had to do in order to preserve our own existence, other people got the idea that we like it and they called us a fighting race.  We, being the fools we are in that connection, became ourselves convinced that we liked it, and we were rather proud of the title of a fighting race. But we know that we are a people with a desire for peace deeply ingrained in us to an extent which probably does not exist in any other race on the earth.  We know that if we are allowed to live our own lives in peace that we would never be the aggressor against any other country.  We know, too, that although there does appear to be on the surface of things peace in Ireland at this moment, there is in existence what was described over a hundred years ago in Grattan's Parliament by a speaker there, a state of smothered war.  There is no fighting on at the moment and there is no violent disturbance of conditions, but that is merely because the stronger power with which we are contending has succeeded for the moment in buying one half of us and in intimidating the other half.  At some future date there will come a renewal of courage to the Irish people, and if those conditions still prevail on that day, then all the Pacts in the world or that can be brought into the world will not prevent a renewal of war here to achieve the longdesired independence of our country.</P>
    <P>If Britain has the least sincerity whatsoever in the signing of the Pact, if she has the least desire to give a lead to the world towards the renunciation <Col N="298" /> of war, she can take a very effective step towards that end by merely making a simple declaration that she will not attempt to interfere by force with any desire on the part of the Irish people, by their free vote, to establish a Republican form of Government here, and another declaration to the effect that she will not support the minority in the North in maintaining the partition of our country.  I would dislike very much to see any Irish Government, even this Irish Government, poor and all as is my opinion of them, associated with an act so obviously hypocritical as this act is.</P>
    <P>I am not a cynic.  I believe there is amongst all the peoples of the earth a very real desire for world peace.  I believe there is a very real desire for the creation of conditions under which war will be impossible.  But I do think that until that desire finds expression through some other channels than the recognised channels of diplomacy, then it is liable to prove fruitless.  If we and if the other people of the earth are going to leave it in the hands of those who conducted and initiated the world war of 1914, and imposed the treaty of conquest which followed that war, then we will perhaps get quite a number of declarations of this kind, but we will get no real attempt to solve this problem and ensure, in the words of this Pact, that the various signatory Powers shall henceforth seek to promote their natural interests by orderly processes.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to repudiate this Treaty.  I ask it to reject this motion to ratify it for the various grounds that I have mentioned, first, because this Dáil, if it is going to stand by the Treaty of 1921, cannot consistently sign it; secondly, because there is in this country at the moment a state of war which sooner or later will become more obvious, but which undoubtedly does exist; and, thirdly, because documents of this kind will prove useless unless they are preceded by a general determination on behalf of the Governments concerned to stop the means of war which they are now piling up within their respective shores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister's <Col N="299" /> statement when he was introducing this motion, nor had I the advantage of hearing Deputy O'Kelly's speech.  I listened to Deputy Lemass and, listening to him, I have been wondering exactly what is the question before us, whether this Parliament should ratify this document, or whether Britain should ratify it, or whether some other country should ratify it.  The question before us is not the action of Britain or France or the United States, or the insincerity of any of these countries. They may be insincere, but the question we have to ask ourselves is: Are our signatories to this document sincere in their renunciation that they have set their hands to?  If we believe they are, then I hold it is our duty to ratify the Pact.  I have listened to many admirable speeches from Deputy Lemass since he came to this Parliament, but I am afraid I cannot congratulate him on the speech he has delivered just now. I believe it is the type of mind disclosed by the speech of Deputy Lemass in his particular outlook that is responsible for a good deal of the wars that have occured in history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That suspicion seems to be always oozing out as to what the other fellow is going to do.  There is a good deal of that in this country at present.  There is a good deal of it in other countries, and it is because it exists in the Chancelleries of other countries that wars are bred.  It is out of such suspicion as exemplified mildly in the speech of Deputy Lemass, that wars are bred. We have in this country many people unfortunately who seem to talk about, and even to gloat over, the prospects of war between the United States and Great Britain, and they think that when that day comes the millenium will have arrived for Ireland.  That is the sort of talk, no doubt ill-informed, that one hears, and I am afraid it is encouraged by speeches of the type we have just heard from Deputy Lemass.  There is no need for any sensible man to say that it will be an unfortunate day for this country if it happens that war should break out between the United States and England.  No matter what Government may be in power, or how anxious we are not to be drawn into <Col N="300" /> such a war, no matter what the people will do to declare their neutrality, they will be bound, in spite of all that, to get embroiled in a war between those two nations.  It ought to be the bounden duty of every person of good-will to do everything possible in his power to prevent a catastrophe of that kind from coming about.  We have a document before us which was initiated by the United States.  Deputy Lemass seems to think that it was an amazing assertion on the part of the Minister to say that we were not responsible for the reservations which Great Britain made. The Minister is the authoritative mouthpiece of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Deputy.  I did not say that the Minister was not responsible, but what the Minister said was that we were not more concerned with the British than with the French reservations, and I say that that is an amazing statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, speaking for the Government, the Minister said that we were not accepting these reservations, that we are taking no responsibility for them, and that we are accepting the Pact without any reservations. I accept that statement from him as the responsible Minister for the time being, and that we are signing it without reservation of any kind.  It is not our fault if Great Britain has made certain reservations.  We do not stand by them.  We have made our position clear with regard to reservations. The fact that this is a Treaty for the renunciation of war as a national policy is a reason why this Parliament should ratify the signature of its representative.  If we do not do so, what is the alternative?  If we refuse to adopt this motion, let Deputy Lemass say what he likes with regard to his reasons for refusing to accept it, all over the world it will be assumed, and I think it is bound to be assumed, that we refused to ratify it, possibly because we are a fighting race, and like to have a fight now and again, that we refuse to accept the Pact because it contains a renunciation of war.  In that event we would be marking ourselves out in a very special way from the other nations whose signatures are <Col N="301" /> appended to this document.  I think it would be a wrong policy on the part of this Parliament to reject this motion. It may be said that it does not make much matter one way or the other, as we are a small nation.</P>
      <P>I agree to the extent that our actual physical interference in war would make very little difference but it seems to me that, in so far as we can it is our duty to preach peace.  Perhaps it is more our duty to do so than if we had great armaments behind us.  I believe that small nations like this can do a great deal to cultivate the peace mind in the world and to cultivate it more in our own little bit of the world perhaps than anywhere else.  I do not know whether I belong to the half that was bought or to the half that was intimidated, but I do say that the statement from a responsible, sensible Deputy like Deputy Lemass to the effect that there is a state of war existing in this country at present is a statement that is bound not to do good, and not to make for that peace for which we are all very anxious, no doubt none more so than Deputy Lemass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The proposal before the Dáil is that we ratify a Treaty which lays it down that we are &ldquo;Persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy should be made to the end that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing between peoples may be perpetuated.&rdquo; I gather that the Party opposite do not wish to ratify that Treaty.  I admit that the two speeches to which I have listened did not make it clear on what grounds they do so, but I think the statement that a &ldquo;frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy should be made to the end that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing between peoples may be perpetuated&rdquo; represents the attitude of mind of citizens of this State.  We accepted that unreservedly but we did use a phrase in our letter that we held <Col N="302" /> that neither the rights of self-defence nor commitments under the League of Nations were in any way prejudiced by the terms of that.  Deputies opposite wish us not to ratify that Treaty.  It is very hard to understand what their objection to it is.  They seem to imply that we are not free to do it on the one hand.  We are perfectly free.  They seem to imply that the signatories of Great Britain and the United States are not sincere in their statements.  In ordinary relations between States when a State makes a solemn declaration one must assume that it means what it says unless it actually breaks its word.  We are urged to say that because Article 7 of the Treaty of 1921 states certain things in the event of Great Britain being at war it nullifies the effect of this Pact.  As a matter of fact, by this Treaty Great Britain undertakes not to resort to war.  The terms of Article 7 apply only in case of war.  The suggestion is that Great Britain has no intention of keeping the Treaty.  I cannot see how we can get up here and assert that we know something that is in the mind of a Government, or potential Government, of another State when that State says that such a thing is not in its mind.  Therefore Article 7 is not invoked because if what is laid down there needs to become operative it means that what is laid down in this Treaty has been negatived and it means that this Treaty has gone by the board.  So far as this Treaty may be helpful in preventing such a situation arising we should be very thankful that it is forthcoming and that we have an opportunity of assisting its application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested that the Treaty of 1921 was contradictory to the commitments of Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations.  The Deputy can make his mind perfectly easy on that point. When we applied for admission to the League of Nations, all relevant documents were laid before the Committee of the League of Nations which had to consider the conditions here, and how far those conditions were compatible or not compatible with membership of the <Col N="303" /> League of Nations.  The Committee adverted fully to everything governing the Constitution here, and that Committee decided, Deputy Lemass notwithstanding, that there was no contradiction there.  I have never been able to get head or tail of the policy of the Party opposite, but I think I am not misrepresenting them when I say that some of the statements made over there were roughly this&mdash;that we might want to go to war with Great Britain, and that we did not want this instrument to tie our hands if we were prepared to do that.  I think that is a very fair interpretation of some of the remarks on the other side.  On the other hand, I understand that Deputy O'Kelly has a great grievance.  It may be the geographical situation of Ireland is what it is.  He seems to have a great grievance because Great Britain is so much bigger than we are, or that we are so much smaller than Great Britain.  He complains that we are not in a position to beat Great Britain.  At the same time he complains that nothing should be done which may prevent him, in his martial ardour, from doing that at any moment he thinks fit.</P>
      <P>I gather from Deputy Lemass that there are only two classes of people in this country&mdash;those who are bought, presumably ourselves&mdash;unfortunately I have not seen the colour of the money &mdash;and those who are intimidated&mdash; everybody in the other party, apparently, except Deputy O'Kelly.  He apparently does not belong to this country at all.  Deputy Lemass was very much concerned about the reason for what he calls secrecy, the reason for not making public every document which passed between this Government and the Governments of other countries.</P>

      <P>I do not know why he does not carry it the whole way. Deputy O'Kelly's position implies that he stood for what he called open diplomacy.  Presumably what he meant was open covenants, openly arrived at. The Party opposite are always assuring everybody that they are going to be the <Col N="304" /> next Government here.  Personally, I do not believe that they are, or ever will be.  They think in their jubilant moments that their advent is very imminent. I think they are equally wrong in that, but if they are at any future time to become a Government, they have made what I consider to be the wildest, I won't say dishonest, promises to the unthinking people of the country. That might just as well go along with the other promises, but if they think that if ever they become a Government here that every communication passing from this State to every other State, that every conversation that they may have, will at the moment of its occurrence or immediately after be made public for everybody to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Opposition Deputies who spoke were very much concerned about Paragraph 10 of Sir Austen Chamberlain's letter, which may be described as a form of reservation. Our Minister for External Affairs has stated that we accept the Treaty unreservedly. There is something in the nature of a reservation in Sir Austen Chamberlain's letter, and Deputies voiced their concern about it.  This is the reservation: &ldquo;It must be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain accept the new Treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.&rdquo;  The respect <Col N="305" /> to which it refers is &ldquo;that there are certain regions of the world, the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our people's safety.&rdquo;  Now, we know that the great objective in diplomacy of the people opposite is to secure a guarantee of neutrality.  They tell us that the people who are to guarantee it are Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France.  If such a thing were brought about by the diplomacy and wisdom of the people opposite, do you not think that a Treaty declaring a guarantee of neutrality would be in these terms: &ldquo;We, the Government or the plenipotentiaries of such Government, undertake henceforward to regard the welfare and the integrity of the Irish Free State as a matter of vital interest to our honour laid down here in this Treaty?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not see that there is much to worry about.  I do not see that this thing refers to the Irish Free State.  The question of the Boundary was brought in, and it was said that we were committed to maintaining the boundaries of other States.  The Covenant of the League of Nations does not permit anyone to interfere in the domestic concerns of any other State, and under this the existing boundaries of any existing State must be regarded as part of their domestic concerns.  I do not know whether the Deputy sees my point there.</P>

      <P>That being so, I do not quite see how we are affected in maintaining or destroying.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy does not propose that we should proceed to wage war, say, on Poland, to abolish the Dantzig corridor, but if on the other hand, the people of Germany want from the inside to change their frontier, or the people of Poland want it, that is an internal matter for them, and we do not comment on it, under the Covenant of the League of Nations. What is the objection by Deputies opposite to our signing this?  I do not want to stress the fact that they want to leave their hands free to wage war on England, and at the same time to complain that England is so much bigger than we are.  Do they suggest that we do want to remain belligerent?  If we do not want to remain belligerent why should we not at least have the credit of being fundamentally, probably more than any other nation in the world, a peaceful people?  I think we are satisfied that we do not want to resort to war as far as it is humanly possible to do it, and I believe that those who will come after us will not want to resort to war. This Treaty guarantees that we will not resort to war, although we have made it perfectly clear that in the event of agression against us, we shall not regard this Treaty as prohibiting or preventing us from defending ourselves nationally.  What is the objection? It is because England is hypocritical. If Britain had agreed to this without any reservation whatever, what would be the attitude of the other side?  They would have said that Great Britain agreed to this, but what of Egypt and India.  If they refused to agree to it they would say there is imperialistic England, always wanting to use the weapon of warfare any time it suits her.  If they did put in specific reservations, they would come along and say, here is England making reservations, and they try to imply, somehow or other, that we are concerned in those reservations.  We are not.  A Deputy quoted an Article of the Treaty which refers to a time of war.</P>

      <P>I thought you objected to the whole.  Deputy O'Kelly insisted upon referring to this &ldquo;as your Free State.&rdquo;  It is our Free State. It being our Free State they go about and say to the Irish people they are the natural custodians of it.  This logic is beyond me.  I wanted to deal with any points made on the other side.  The thing seems to me perfectly clear. Here we are, the bought half at any rate, absolutely standing unreservedly for the abolition of war as a weapon of national policy without any reservation whatsoever, prepared to stand by that all the time.  We are asked by the United States and other Governments, who assure us that they to a greater or lesser degree stand for that same thing, to join with them in declaring that we stand by it and that we will do our best to maintain that condition of affairs.  We more than any other people do stand for it, and yet the Party opposite demands that we should refuse to stand for this because they assert England has a dominating influence in the political conditions of this country.  I cannot see it.  As far as the Free State is concerned, England has no influence whatsoever. The Government which signs this Treaty is the Government of the Free State.  It commits only the people of the Free State.  It does not commit the people of the Six Counties, who are outside the area of our jurisdiction. The frontier of this State does not include <Col N="308" /> the Six Counties.  If the Deputies opposite want to be free to wage war on England in order to win back that irredenta they are quite right, I suppose, in being perfectly frank and pretending they are preparing for war. But I think if they come out and tell the people of this country that they propose within any sort of reasonable time to declare war on England, at the same time lodging a protest against her being so much stronger than we are, they will rather have to change their political speeches.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly may rest assured that his ardour for defending himself, whether attacked or not attacked, will not be interfered with.  It is hard to deal with people who talk of England's dominating influence here.  It is hard to talk to people who will not recognise ordinary, existing facts, but I think that we have come in for a great deal of misrepresentation in the world. A great many things have been said against us that were true and a great many things said about us that we would rather were not said, whether they were true or not.  At this time, when a pacific nation is particularly popular and appreciated in the world, when I am satisfied that the bought half, which is only two-thirds of this country, would stand utterly for peace and there is occasion here for uniting with other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that is the case, if you count the votes at the last election.  I think you will find that we are standing for something which is for the welfare of the world.  We have an opportunity here of assisting that cause&mdash;not only here, but in many countries in the world&mdash;by binding <Col N="310" /> countries with a clear definite statement of that as a policy.  I think the Irish Free State as much as any, and probably more than most countries, is pre-eminently justified in signing this Treaty.  I am not a bit afraid as to what the Dáil will do, but it does seem a little unfortunate that in the Seanad this afternoon, and to a lesser degree here this evening, there have been statements from the Opposition benches which one can only call clearly unfriendly statements not only to England but also to the United States of America, and also, I think by Deputy Lemass, to France.  I do think if we stand for peace we can only hope to do our best to get other people to do the same.  If we do not stand for aggression we can only do our best to encourage other people not to stand for aggression.  I think it is quite unnecessary for people here to get up and criticise what is being done by other Governments when they do not advert to the full circumstances.  We really have enough to take on.  As Deputy O'Kelly practically admitted, we are not strong enough even to beat England. That being so, I think that until we have at least done that, there is no need to try to create a situation of friction or a situation possibly leading up to war with the United States of America, Great Britain, France and Germany.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The way I would like to look on this question is to see how the present situation can be best used for the sake of Ireland, not taking a purely hidebound view of the Free State as at present constituted.  The Minister, who spoke very carefully, limited his attitude of mind purely to that of the Free State.  He has ignored Ireland all through.  He ignored the whole <Col N="311" /> question of Partition and all the merits of the case.  He ignored the fact that for the first time in all history Ireland has been divided into two parts and is kept divided by England, and that so long as that is so you cannot expect ordinary Irishmen to regard England as friendly country or to regard Ireland as being in a condition of justice which must be at the root of any peace. It is all very well to say we have reserved our right of defence in these negotiations prior to signing the Pact. But what does defence mean?  Is Ireland a nation being so defended so long as Partition exists?</P>
      <P>Last night we had a debate upon the question of one prisoner up there who may be regarded as a prisoner of war, because that prisoner is there for the simple reason that he stands uncompromisingly for Ireland as a whole and Ireland free.  Because he is such an effective and dangerous agent for the ideals for which he stands&mdash;the freedom and unity of Ireland&mdash;and for that reason only, he is in jail to-day. If anything could bring home to the minds of Irishmen to-day that there is a condition which is not a condition of peace in this country it is the fact that Deputy de Valera is in jail.  It may not be a condition of open warfare but it certainly is not a condition of peace. This Pact is false from every aspect that you can take it.  There is hardly a country in the world or a newspaper in the world that has not pointed to its hypocrisy.  Germany was ringing with its hypocrisy.  The French papers referred to it and talked of the way in which it was signed and of the armaments and armies which are developing side by side with it.  We will lose the respect of no country in the world by not signing this thing and we will gain nothing in the world by signing it except that we will show the world that we are acquiescing in this game which is a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who devote their best energies at present to examining the relations between these countries are convinced that either we are on the verge of a new war between England and America or else that England must take a second place or become, as a <Col N="312" /> very distinguished Englishman recently put it, like one of the northern nations of Europe.  That is the position that is developing at the present moment and that is the position which we must either avail ourselves of or else wreck ourselves, because if we are going to miss this opportunity we are going to be merged in another big war, and one of the first things that is going up in that war is the Shannon Scheme. Being concentrated in one place a few bombs will settle it.</P>
    <P>The position is seriously and really developing.  All the elements of war are there.  There will be a struggle for markets.  Behind most wars there is an element of a struggle for markets. Every effort that has been made by each country to try and tide over that situation&mdash;the struggle between the big financiers and the struggle for the markets&mdash;has failed.  Big economic experts say now that war may come in two years, but they think it will certainly come within ten years.  That is a situation which we have to face.  Are we going to get anywhere by signing this farce?  We would get very much further if from a united House here there went a statement to the effect that we could not sign this document until our freedom and neutrality was recognised by both these countries.  In that way we would stir up a public opinion which we cannot possibly stir by merely signing this thing, showing that we are acquiescing in a farce and following the lead of the King of Great Britain and Ireland.  We are not signing as Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was at great pains to prove that it was not Ireland, but the Free State, that was signing.  In any case we follow merely as one of the minor signatories to this, not one of the principal parties, and, naturally, no seriousminded person who repudiates partition and all that goes with it in the present settlement, could acquiesce in the signing of this document because the relations are false relations.  The point about the preamble is this, that anyone who signs this must acquiesce in all present relations.  The present relations existing between England and Ireland are ruled by the Treaty, and ruled, so far as this particular matter <Col N="313" /> is concerned, by the rights under that Treaty which England has of occupying this country in time of war.  Those are the relations at present in existence, and paragraph two of the preamble must be read in that connection: &ldquo;Convinced that all changes in their relations with one another should be sought only by pacific means....&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the relations at present existing are such that they are entirely in favour of England.  They are conditions which, if Ireland to-morrow were in a position to defend herself against these relations with arms, she would do it. Justice comes before peace.  We want peace, but there is no use in our playing at the farce of saying that you can have real peace until justice has first been attained.  I am not willing to admit that Ireland is incapable of playing a big part in the situation at present.  Ireland may be small and weak from the point of view of armed resistance, but if there were a united mind demonstrated from this House, clearly indicating that we all stood together for the complete freedom of the whole of Ireland, we would gather a new strength, or rather I should say the old strength of the Irish race around us again.  We should command the same respect which we commanded when we were at the height of our strength.  We should command the same moral respect from other nations throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to prophesy what exactly will happen.  All we know is that there is a sort of balance of power being created and a conflict between two great countries, and that out of a situation like that there is great hope for Ireland to be derived, because England's difficulty will always remain Ireland's opportunity.  England, with the menace of war from America upon the one hand, and the menace of difficulties from Russia, Afghanistan and India, on the other hand, will be in a very difficult predicament within the next five or ten years.  Ireland's position will be by no means so weak as some people may contend, and the first <Col N="314" /> thing we have to do is to get rid of that illusion, that inferiority complex, and feel that we are capable of going very far.  I will go so far as to say that our capacity to achieve complete freedom by peaceful means depends largely upon the amount of courage we have in putting forward our full claim all the time, and making as much diplomatic difficulty for our opponents as possible all the time.  At present England is making supreme efforts through the machinery of the League of Nations to get America into some agreement with her on that basis.  She is using public opinion in Ireland, she is using various agents in different places, to induce the League of Nations to bring about such agreement with herself as will give her a position of strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the bearing of that on the point I was making.  Undoubtedly, England is making that effort, and she is doing so because she is in a weak position.  That is her difficulty, and obviously, following the old rule, we should try to prevent, as far as possible, her coming to an agreement with America.  It was by having that outlook of determination in the past that we got as far as we did.  It was by using that method of opposing England in America that we made ourselves effective at all, and I suggest that that is the proper policy that we should adopt to-day, and that is the peaceful policy&mdash;I mean that is the policy which, because it is based on justice, is more likely to lead to a permanent peace and to a peaceful settlement for ourselves, than acquiescing in what most countries in Europe admit is a pure farce, and in playing England's game in the League of Nations. I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Connell say that, no matter what neutrality was established in Ireland, we were bound to get into a war, say, between England and America.  I could not imagine any Irishman being so absolutely mad as wanting to get into the mess of a war between America and England.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal to be said for her not being bound to get in.  I do not profess to be a prophet. These are things which you have to weigh pretty carefully.  You cannot prophesy and say that Ireland will or will not, get in.  But you have to consider it in relation to other countries. First of all, Ireland having sea all round it, is an advantage.  If Ireland were in the position of Belgium, which was always the cockpit of wars between France and Germany, then it might be inevitable that in a war between America and England she would be bound to come in.  But where you have a sea-board, and the interruption which prevents invading armies from crossing, it is not easy to break a neutrality of that sort, once it is established.</P>

But take the comparison I made of Belgium, we are in a far more favourable position as regards other countries than Belgium is.  Take the case of Holland in the last war.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and also because it did not suit them politically.  Take the geographical reason first.  There was water between Holland and England which made it difficult for either side to carry out a great invasion.  From the political point of view the lesson of Belgium had been learned by Germany: that the invading of a neutral country on the whole weighs against the country that invades, because it turns the world against it.  On the other hand, England was not willing to invade Germany from Holland because she also would lose propaganda value by invading, so there was a political reason there too.  There is a strong political reason why it should be a very bad thing for America to invade England through Ireland because it would turn the Irish in America against such a war.  On the other hand, if England broke the neutrality of an Ireland which was once declared free it would give America an opportunity of infusing a terrific enthusiasm in the Irish in America to fight against England.  So that there are very serious political reasons why, if once Ireland's neutrality was declared, we should be pretty safe from being involved in any war between the two countries.  The alternative given for this, according to Deputy O'Connell, is to cultivate the peace-mind.  I do not know how you cultivate the peace-mind.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House have not intervened in this debate, but after listening to the very interesting speech of Deputy Little I could not remain silent. The great war that he and Deputy <Col N="317" /> Lemass and Deputy O'Kelly are to promote in the near future would have the effect, in the first place, of blowing up the Shannon scheme and taking £5,000,000 out of the pockets of the Irish ratepayers.  Was there ever such nonsense spoken as we have heard in this Dáil to-night.  We are talking about wars and the results of a war that will not take place for half a century or until we are all dead, if it ever takes place.  It is most ridiculous to hear those Deputies talking seriously of wars all over the world.  Would it not be much better for us in this Dáil to be talking about drainage schemes, development schemes, and other schemes for the building up of the nation instead of all the arrant nonsense we have to listen to here.  I stand up to support the signing of the Treaty, and I know perfectly well what I am talking about when I say that the overwhelming majority of the people of the Twenty-Six Counties are solidly behind the Government in signing the Treaty.  We are all sick of war and all this kind of talk.  What we want is peaceful development and the cultivation of the peaceful mind as Deputy O'Connell has said, and let us put war on one side.  Deputy Little has talked of the United States.  I remind him that when George Washington was fighting for independence there were thousands of gallant Irishmen in the fight with him and from that day to this the American nation have never forgotten it and when America closed its doors to every other nation we always had free entrance into the country.  Let us drop all this talk about war.  Long may the Stars and Stripes wave.  We need not be afraid that war will break out to-morrow. There will be no war between England and the United States, and you may take that from Tim Sheehy.  I tell you straight that if such a war broke out it would not be fought on Irish soil.  I do not believe it.  The Americans would hold the land of St. Patrick sacred, and there will be no fighting here if Deputy Little and Deputy Lemass do not start a war themselves.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not present to hear the speech of the Minister <Col N="318" /> for External Affairs in regard to the Kellogg Pact.  From what I heard from the Minister for Defence, I came to the conclusion that that Minister was under the impression that the signing of this Pact would bring about a cessation of all wars.  I am sorry that I cannot, in view of the facts which I will place before the House, claim such an optimistic turn of mind as the Minister for Defence.  It should be borne in mind, in discussing this Pact, that Mr. Kellogg, the Secretary for State for the United States of America, invited the nations of the world, in the first instance, to sign this Pact without consulting the American Senate.  Furthermore, there are not many people who have gone into detail as regards the various interpretations that have been placed upon this Pact.  In fact, I might say that no two similar interpretations have been placed upon it.  The interpretations placed upon it are almost as numerous as the Deputies in this House. That being so, one would imagine that the Government, in asking this House to ratify the Pact, would have placed upon the Table the correspondence that took place between the American Government and the Executive Council, and also the correspondence that took place between the British Government and the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence seemed to suggest that ratification by the nations of the world of this Pact would bring about a cessation of war.  He suggested that when this Pact is ratified, swords will be beaten into ploughshares.  In my belief, the opinions of the nations must be determined by the policy which the nations are pursuing.  According to a statement made by Senator Reed in the American Senate, the opinion in regard to peace in England is manifest in a standing army of 404,000 men and in a navy of more than 700 great fighting ships; in fortresses that line the shores of the world and dot the seas: in guns that command every avenue of progress; in the present construction of vast fortresses; in the present building of 78 war vessels.  The opinion of France is expressed in a standing army of 727,000 men; in a reserve army of 5,610,000 men; in the efforts of that great country to dominate the air and <Col N="319" /> to control the waters under the sea by a vast fleet of submarines.

    <P>The Minister for Defence went on to point out that he is here speaking to people who will not recognise facts.  I suggest to the Minister that he has not recognised the fact that while the nations that signed the Pact are crying aloud for peace, at the same time, according to the statistics I have quoted, they are preparing for war.  I believe that the twenty-six counties are in favour of peace, but, at the same time, I do not think it should go out from this House that we believe that the nations which have subscribed to the Pact up to the present are sincere in their desire for peace.  I believe that there is a large amount of hypocrisy manifested by the preparations which these countries are making for war.  Although we were told that this Pact will bring about peace, negotiations had hardly been started by Mr. Kellogg in order to get the various nations to sign than he made a large number of reservations.  The first reservation includes defensive wars&mdash;the right to defend territory from attack; secondly, to protect trade and commerce everywhere; third, to protect nationals on sea and land; fourth, the invasion by armed forces of the territory of a foreign country for protective or punitive purposes.  We are further told that it implies the right to make offensive-defensive wars&mdash;that is, to make the initial attack when it is for defensive purposes; further, that it involves the right to defend all national interests.  The principal reservation, as far as I can interpret it, is that regarding defensive wars.  Anybody who <Col N="320" /> has read anything about history knows that 99 per cent.  of the wars which have been fought for the past few hundred years were termed &ldquo;defensive wars.&rdquo;  Nations which are going on the offensive make the people of their country believe, by Press propaganda and otherwise, that they are engaging in a war to protect the interests of their people.  I should like to believe that the nations which have signed this Pact are really sincere in their desire to bring about peace.  I believe the majority of the people of this country desire to have peace, but peace, not with certain reservations at the present time laid down by Great Britain, with regard to the partition of this country.  I am sorry I cannot share the optimism manifested by the Minister. I think we should ratify the Pact in order to show to other nations that we are sincere in our desire for peace, but it should not go out from this Dáil that we believe that the other nations which I have mentioned are sincere in their desire for peace.  I believe there is a lot of hypocrisy about their action.  I believe that it should go out from this Dáil that while we recognise that nations have signed this Pact to show their desire for peace, Britain, and quite a large number of other countries, are really preparing for war, and have engaged in hypocrisy in signing this Pact.</P>

      <P>I had a question on the Order Paper to-day with reference to the present crisis in the beet growing industry, which was of interest to every party in this House.  (Question and answer quoted.)  With the object of eliciting whether the answer of the Minister meant that the Government had actually intervened or were proposing <Col N="321" /> to intervene, I put a supplementary question.  In reply to that supplementary question, the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;I will refuse to answer on the adjournment and the Deputy can talk to empty Government Benches if he likes.&rdquo;  That answer was made simply because, there being no information I, as a Deputy, chose to raise this matter, which I think I am perfectly entitled to do.  I question whether the Minister for Finance, or any other Minister, has the right to show such gross discourtesy to any Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not a trivial matter; it is an important matter.  It is a matter which the Press has been discussing for several months. It is a matter which members of the different parties in this House were called together to discuss in Jury's Hotel nearly a month ago.  From that conference, a demand was sent out, signed by Deputies on the opposite benches as well as by Deputies on this side, to the Government to intervene. Since that resolution was passed, published in the Press, and forwarded to the Executive Council by the Beet Growers' Association, no action has been taken.  The Ministry may take up the attitude that raising the question here is likely to prejudice any action they may take when intervening in the dispute or is likely to prejudice the chances of bringing about successful arbitration, but I believe the beet growers are entitled to whatever moral support they can get from this House. The Beet Growers' Association represents the five or six thousand farmers who are growing beet.  In addition to that, they can claim to stand for providing employment for about 500 men in the district around Carlow town. They represent both these interests. When they approached the Carlow Sugar Manufacturing Company, the Company did not suggest that both sides should approach the Government with a view to mediation.  Neither did the Carlow Sugar Manufacturing Company seem disposed to make any advance towards meeting the demands of the Beet Growers' Association.  On the contrary, instead of helping that <Col N="322" /> Association, which represents those who originally sacrificed so much to make the beet industry successful and profitable, they tried to pass over the heads of the Association, and they have been engaged for the past few months in trying to make contracts with individual growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those contracts would mean that those who really established the industry&mdash;the farmers who lost a good deal by it, and gave a good deal of employment&mdash;would be left out in the cold.  It would mean that there would be an entirely new body of farmers concerned who would not be giving a great deal of employment, and who would not be in a position to make the industry as successful as the original growers. These farmers would be engaged upon contracts for a single year.  That would simply mean that, once the Association had been weakened, the factory could drive any terms they wished with the growers.  Having broken up the Association, which the factory itself helped to create, and which it subsidised, it is obvious that collective bargaining would be at an end.  I raise the matter not with a view to prejudicing the Government, but in order to strengthen the beet growers' postion.  I understand the factory have a case, but we have not heard what their case is in full.  The Government are in a position to get both sides of the case.  We do not claim that the information which the factory has at its disposal, and which is regarded as a commercial secret, should be made known, but what we do demand is that some action should be taken in the matter.  I fail to see why the Minister, when the question was raised to-day, could not state definitely whether the Government was taking action or not.  If the Government claim that a statement of that kind would injure the chances of bringing about a settlement, I cannot agree.  If the Government intervenes, the matter will undoubtedly become known.  It will get into the Press.  I am only too anxious to bring about a settlement.  If the beet growers are satisfied with the terms arrived at, nobody will be more pleased than I shall be.  But I certainly feel that on this, the first opportunity that we have had <Col N="323" /> of raising the matter, other Deputies as well as myself, should impress upon the Government the necessity for immediate action.  Another week and the opportunity will practically have passed.  Now that the Minister for Agriculture has come in, I ask if he can add anything to his statement of this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that bodies of interested people outside this House, and Deputies of this House, have brought pressure to bear on certain departments of Government during the past few months to bring about a settlement between the rival parties.  The Ministers to-day, in replying to questions, indicated quite clearly that discussion in this Dáil would not be in any way helpful in bringing about the settlement which so many Deputies wish.  With all due respect to Deputy Derrig, I do not think his speech to-night will contribute in any way to bringing about a settlement between the rival parties to this particular dispute.  After all, the Minister, or whoever is acting on behalf of the Minister, in any negotiations that take place between the rival parties to this dispute, must be absolutely free and untrammelled.  For that reason, no discussion in this Dáil, or outside it, can be in any way helpful in bringing about the settlement which we all desire, and which we hope will be realised later.  In disputes of this kind, nobody can possibly say at what particular point intervention should take place.  The dispute has undoubtedly been going on for a long period, but we all hope that the fact that it has proceeded for such a length of time may render it more easy of satisfactory settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully and attentively to the remarks made by Deputy Derrig, and I could not see anything in them that would be likely to prejudice any negotiations that might take place from the intervention of the Ministry.  There is nothing unusual in any Deputy coming to the House and demanding the intervention of the Ministry in any ordinary trade dispute. <Col N="324" /> Many times from these benches demands have been made and acceded to by the Ministry for intervention, in the hope that intervention on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce might prevent a dispute which would affect the trade of the country. This dispute, as far as I can see, is much on the same lines, with this difference: that the taxpayers are much more deeply concerned with the result of any negotiations that may take place than they would be in negotiations in connection, say, with a dispute between railway employees and the railway management or any similar dispute. There is a very large amount of taxpayers' money involved in this transaction, but it would not be right at this stage to demand from the Minister for Agriculture, or any other Minister who might later have to intervene and who would be well advised to intervene, any statement.  At the proper time we should expect a statement as to the merits of the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been studying the balancesheet which was laid on the Table of the House in connection with the working of the beet factory for the last year for which returns are available.  I find that the amount paid in subsidy at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer was £442,000.  The amount paid by the directors of the factory for the raw material for the manufacture of sugar amounted to £385,000.  Therefore, the factory was presented by the taxpayers with raw beet for nothing and with £60,000 or so as a present.  I hope these figures, which cannot be disputed and which are available in the library for any member that wants to examine them, will not be overlooked by the people charged with any negotiations that may take place.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who knows more about the whole situation than the Minister for Agriculture.  Personally, I am prepared to leave it to the good judgment of the Minister for Agriculture to intervene in whatever manner he may think fit.  But I think it is the desire of the beet-growers and of the Labour Party&mdash;Labour is deeply interested in this matter&mdash;that the intervention should be as early as possible. The beet industry has helped, through those who had the courage to grow it, <Col N="325" /> to give a good deal of additional employment in the beet-growing counties.</P>
    <P>There is a much more important aspect from the Labour point or view. The question of collective bargaining is involved in this transaction, and it is a very great pleasure to members of the Labour Party to join with the members of the Farmers' Union, with whom they disagreed in many matters in the past, in endeavouring to maintain the right of collective bargaining.  I believe that if the Beet Growers' Association, which is a well-conducted organisation catering for the needs and interests of the beet growers, is beaten in this matter, it will mean the dismal failure on the part of the farmers in a last attempt to organise and accomplish something on behalf of the farming community.  I hope, as a Labour Deputy, that every Deputy who has given consideration to this matter will back the Beet Growers' Association in the fight to maintain for the beet growers an economic price for the raw material which they supply to the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture should be asked, at this stage, to make any statement or to commit himself in the House in any way, but I hope he will, as soon as possible, bring the conflicting parties together and arrange for an amicable settlement to the best of his ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aird</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is a very important one in our area and I quite agree with Deputy Davin, while being at one with him in the desire to do nothing that might prejudice a settlement. I also agree with Deputy Derrig that time is of the essence of the contract. We are getting to the period when the ground is prepared and when the sowing will commence, and I think something should be done as quickly as possible.  Forty-four shillings a ton seems a very small price and I know that farmers in my area will not be satisfied with it.  I think the factory should be more generous.  I will not comment further than that, but I hope that we shall have good news in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with this request to the Government to <Col N="326" /> move as quickly as possible in connection with this dispute.  It is a very urgent matter.  Within the next ten days or a fortnight, the farmers will have to sow, and a settlement should be reached before then, because the members are determined to stand loyally by their Association.  I, as a member of the Beet Growers' Association, have a dual responsibility.  I must stand loyally by the Beet Growers' Association and demand fair play for them and, as a member for a constituency in which beet growing has been extensively carried on, I desire to urge upon the Government that the time is now ripe for their intervention.  Within the next fortnight, the matter must be settled.  The farmers feel that the factory can afford to pay the price they look for, and I was glad to be associated with a meeting of all Parties in Dublin recently.  It was very hopeful to see all Parties united and linked up in their demand for fair play for the Beet Growers' Association.  That was a lead which, I think, we should like to see followed up.  We had all Parties represented and unanimous in their finding.  That finding was sent by resolution to the Government.  The Government were asked to intervene, and the members of the Association affirmed that the price offered was ridiculous. I am glad that Deputy Derrig has raised this matter because it is very urgent.  If we are anxious to maintain the beet growing industry, the growers will have to be given every consideration possible.  If the growers are let down on this occasion, I, as a beet grower for the last three years, will drop out of the industry, as will others. If the grower gets fair play and encouragement, he will continue to grow beet.</P>

      <P>As so many Laoighis Deputies have spoken, I think it may be well to let it be known that there are other areas than Laoighis interested. As one who was instrumental in launching the Beet Growers' Association and who presided at the first meeting at which it was formed, I should be very disappointed if the beet growers proved that they were not worth their salt in this dispute.  I do not want them to adopt an unreasonable <Col N="327" /> attitude, and I hope it will not be alleged that they have adopted that attitude.  From my point of view, and from the point of view of the growers and the general public, the factory people had better get it out of their heads that 44/- per ton is going to meet the position.  It is not going to meet it, or anything like it.  I think it would be foolish to ask the Minister, if his intervention is going to be of any use, to make a pronouncement as to what his opinion is.  I hope the beet growers will prove that there are not as many black sheep in their ranks as is alleged.  I know the other people are going around the country trying to detach the grower&mdash;the small grower especially&mdash;from the ranks of the Association. I know they have gone to people who were not growers at all up to now, and have asked them to come in.  The only thing I find fault with amongst the Beet Growers' Association is that there are a good many people in their ranks who are purely gamblers and intend to grow only as long as this subsidy lasts.  When the subsidy goes, they will go out.  My whole concern is for the people who want a means of living, and who want to use beet as an economic crop for the future.  There are gamblers, and my sympathy is not very much with them.</P>
      <P>My sympathies are with the growers, and I believe that they should get a reasonable price that would compensate them for their labours.  The beet-growers will not adopt an attitude of unreasonableness, but they are determined to stick together as an association. I trust that some satisfactory settlement will be reached in the dispute.</P>

      <P>It is a regrettable thing that this unfortunate dispute should have arisen between the beet-growers and the Carlow Factory directors. I think, however, that the time is now ripe when a settlement should be made between the disputing parties. The time is rapidly approaching when it will be necessary for the farmers to make preparations for the sowing of this year's crop of sugar beet, and the sooner a settlement can be made the <Col N="328" /> better it will be for those people.  I have not very much to say on the matter. The Minister has made it known that it would not be very advisable for him to make any statement this evening. I do not think it would be wise on our part to put any great pressure on him.  At the same time, I was anxious to give my view of the matter. The sooner that negotiations are brought to a head, and the sooner that some statement is made that will lead to a settlement, the better it will be for the beet-growers and for the factory. I have no doubt but that the Beet Growers' Association will be quite reasonable in the stand they will take in this matter, but at the same time they will be firm.  In my locality there is very little hope that the factory will secure any beet unless they offer more favourable conditions.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in the hope that the discussion here to-night may hasten a settlement between the Beet Growers' Association and the directors of the Carlow Factory.  I can say on behalf of the people engaged in beet-growing in County Wexford that if the directors of the factory think they are going to get beet grown at 44/- a ton, they are making a great mistake.  No doubt in Wexford, as in other counties, a small amount of beet will be grown, but a very large section of the growers would not be prepared to accept 44/-.</P>

      <P>It would want to be considerably more in order to induce them to grow beet.  I do not know that the Minister can say very much now on the matter.  I wish the meeting that we had in Jury's Hotel, and, that was referred to by Deputy Derrig, accepted the suggestion I made, that a deputation be sent directly to the Minister. Instead of doing that, they passed a resolution which was sent on in due course.  If my suggestion had been adopted, and if the deputation had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister in the hope of getting him to intervene, there is every possibility that a settlement might have been brought about.  It is <Col N="329" /> my definite opinion that a round-table conference with the Minister present is the best method of approaching a settlement of this unfortunate dispute.</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  I believe a good deal can be done in the way of a settlement. The time is coming shortly when the farmers should be ready to sow the crop, and if within the next fortnight something is not done with a view to bringing the dispute to an end, the outlook for the farmers who are prepared to sow beet is a poor one.  I am prepared to help in any way I can.  I am willing to do anything I can do with other Deputies in bringing about a settlement.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Derrig and other Deputies in the remarks that they have made on this subject.  In the County Louth a considerable amount of beet has been grown, particularly in that part of the county which has been severely hit owing to the prevalence of black scab. I refer to the Cooley district.  As the <Col N="330" /> Minister for Agriculture is aware, that district has been scheduled for the last ten or twelve years, and the farmers in the area have suffered very great hardships. They have now taken to the growing of beet, and if there is not a settlement reached as between the beet growers and the factory people a very serious situation will arise with regard to the farmers, particularly in County Louth.  I hope peace will ultimately prevail, and that an amicable settlement will be arrived at as between the Carlow people and the beet growers.  It has been said by men in the business that it is almost impossible to grow beet at any such price as 44/-.  Considering the position of agriculture at the moment, it is absolutely essential that a settlement of this very vexed question should take place as soon as possible.  I hope, without putting the Government in an awkward position, that some steps will be taken to bring about the desired result.</P>
