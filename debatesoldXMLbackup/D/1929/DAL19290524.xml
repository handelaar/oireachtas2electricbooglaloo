      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question put to me during the week, I knew that there was a dispute and also that the two parties to it were in conference. It was only very late last night that I learned from one of the parties that they believed that a conference of that type would not carry the matter further.  Application was made to me to receive a deputation of the men to-day and I am doing that.  I have no information as to what transpired at the other conference.</P>

      <P>Since this Resolution was before the House on Wednesday last, Deputies have had an opportunity of examining the report of the Tariff Commission with respect to the proposal which is contained in the Resolution.  I am sure that Deputies who have read that report noticed that the application which the Tariff Commission met to consider from the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers' Association, was one for an increase in the duty upon apparel by ten per cent.  The Tariff Commissioners state that they consulted the Irish Woollen and <Col N="335" /> Worsted Manufacturers' Association with respect to the application and received from them an intimation that they would have no objection to a temporary increase in the duty from five to seven and a half per cent. but, although the application was for an increase in duty on wearing apparel and although the body that might reasonably be expected to oppose the application did not oppose it, the Tariff Commission rejected it and substituted instead a proposal for which, apparently, nobody asked.  The recommendation is, as has been announced to the House, that the exemption limit be raised from cloth at one and sixpence per yard to cloth at two and sixpence per yard and that in future clothing costing under two and sixpence per yard should be admitted free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has, of course, been considered in the House before, when the main proposal was before us and on that occasion many Deputies pointed out that the Tariff Commission had apparently made a serious miscalculation and that, as a result of the proposal which they put forward, in addition to helping the woollen manufacturing trade they were, in fact, reducing considerably the amount of protection enjoyed by ready-made clothing manufacturers before that.  As Deputies will remember, there was a lengthy discussion on the Report Stage of that Resolution in which that particular effect was emphasised by many speakers, all of whom in my recollection recommended that the obvious step to take to remedy the mistake of the Tariff Commission was to increase still further the tariff upon ready-made clothing.  The Tariff Commission, apparently for some reason which they did not state, appeared to think that the other course was preferable and, accordingly, the recommendation now is to increase the exemption limit.  The motives which led them to believe that the difficulty would be eased by increasing <Col N="336" /> the exemption limit have not been placed before us.  The Tariff Commission confine themselves to making one objection to the other proposal, but they give no argument good, bad or indifferent, in favour of the proposition which they recommend.  That particular procedure is, of course, only in accordance with the procedure they adopted in the main proposal in regard to woollens in which there was another important recommendation that related to Imperial preference which was put forward without any argument being produced to support it.  The same thing is done here.  A recommendation is made which will have the effect of weakening the protection given to woollen manufacturers, and nothing is said concerning it except that the Tariff Commission believe that it is the most equitable method of meeting the difficulty.</P>
    <P>What particular facts or what particular arguments they had to convince them that that was the most equitable method of meeting the difficulty we do not know.  It was mentioned on the other occasion when this matter was under discussion, that the Census of Production of 1926 indicated that the average price of the cloth used by the ready-made clothing manufacturers in the Free State was about 4/3 per yard.  This is a proposal to take off the tariff on cloth under 4/- per yard and to maintain it on cloth above that price. Its effect will obviously be to encourage the use of cheaper cloth.  The protection which is being given to manufacturers of suits from imported cloth over 4/- per yard is reduced. The Tariff Commission themselves admit that their original proposal did operate to reduce the protection which the ready-made clothing manufacturers enjoyed.  That reduced protection will still continue to operate in respect of suits made out of cloth costing more than 4/- per yard, but the amount of the protection imposed upon suits made out of cloth costing less than 4/- per yard is, of course, increased by the proposal which was before the House on the previous <Col N="337" /> occasion to increase the duty in operation from 15 to 20 per cent.  In other words, there is being created a much bigger gap than hitherto prevailed between suits made out of cloth costing 4/- per yard and suits made out of cloth costing more than 4/- per yard.</P>
    <P>A simple calculation will show that the differences in the selling price between suits made out of cloth at 4/- per yard and suits made out of cloth at 4/6 per yard, firstly, before the woollen tariff was imposed, secondly under the previous arrangements, and thirdly under this arrangement, are 1/9, 2/5½ and 5/- respectively. In other words, for the difference of 1/9 a suit made out of the better cloth could have been secured before the woollen tariff was imposed.  For a difference of 2/5½, after the woollen tariff had been imposed, and under the existing arrangements, a better suit could have been obtained, but now it will require an additional 5/- in order to purchase the better suit.  In other words, the gap between the two classes of suits is being widened.  Irish cloth is available, we understand, at 4/- per yard and upwards.  Apparently it must be available at that price, as otherwise the Tariff Commission would have proposed to increase the exemption limit beyond 2/6.  Because they have not done that, we must conclude that they are satisfied that an adequate supply of Irish cloth will be available at a price over 4/- per yard.</P>
    <P>The proposal which is before us will operate to reduce the available market for that Irish cloth and to encourage, as I have said, the importation of cheaper cloth, and the manufacture and sale of suits made out of that cheaper cloth.  It is obvious that the consumer might be prepared to pay an extra 1/9 or thereabouts in order to get a better suit, but he would hesitate considerably before paying 5/- in order to get that suit. As a result of the operation of this Resolution it is very likely that the ready-made clothing manufacturers will confine themselves almost exclusively to the manufacture of clothes <Col N="338" /> out of the cheaper cloth, which can be imported free of duty, except in so far as they can secure Irish cloth of better quality in the designs which they require.  When the matter was under discussion on Wednesday last, the Minister for Industry and Commerce appeared to base his case for the proposal on the grounds that the other proposal made by us, the proposal to increase the duty on ready-made clothing, would increase the cost of living.  Let us examine that and see whether or not it would increase the cost of living.  The proposal we made was that the import duty upon imported suits should be increased.  Obviously that import duty would only operate to increase the cost of imported suits, and would not have the effect of increasing the price of suits made in the country.  It does appear that the bulk of the ready-made suits at present being sold here are made within the country.  Whether that is so or not I cannot say, but if we are to judge the figures given in the Census of Production, and compare them with the figures given in the trade and shipping statistics for the years before 1924, before the duty went on, it would appear that the ready-made clothing manufacturers are now manufacturing something like 70 per cent. of the total imports of suits in 1924.</P>
    <P>With an increased duty in operation it would still further develop that particular industry.  It is an industry which can be easily developed. It is the type of industry which we should set out to help forthwith, because it does not require any considerable capital expenditure or any very high degree of technical skill in order to make it flourish.  Of course, the operation of the tax upon cloth between 1/6 and 2/6 per square yard would tend to increase the cost of suits made out of such cloth when it is imported.  But that is the situation that now exists, and it is to change that situation that this proposal is brought forward.  The proposal, therefore, is one to reduce the price of suits made out of imported cloth at the expense of suits made <Col N="339" /> out of native cloth.  If the Tariff Commission, when the application of the woollen manufacturers originally came before them, had given it the consideration which they were subsequently forced to give it, we would, I am sure, have from them, not the proposal which is now before us, but the proposal which the woollen manufacturers were prepared to agree to, and which the ready-made clothing manufacturers asked for&mdash;that is, an increase of the duty on apparel of 10 per cent.  The operation of the increased duty on wearing apparel which we propose, while increasing the market for the cloth produced in Irish mills, would also tend to discourage the use of suits made out of the cheaper shoddy cloth by lessening the margin between the suits made out of this cloth and the better class suits made out of Irish cloth. This proposal increases the margin; the proposal which we make would lessen it, and would encourage people to spend the very small additional amount required to get the much better suit that can be obtained made out of cloth from Irish mills.</P>
    <P>There is a good case for increasing the duty on wearing apparel independent of the application for a tariff on woollen material.  The duty was originally too low, and it is still too low.  It can be increased with advantage.  The advantage which will be secured by that increase can be utilised to case the difficulty which has arisen with respect to the Tariff Commission proposals relating to woollen cloth.  I do not know what is operating to make the Minister reject the proposal which we put forward. The only argument advanced by the Tariff Commission is that it might operate to increase the cost of living.  It is very difficult to see how it would.  When I say that, I mean it is very difficult to see how it would operate to increase the cost of living over and above what it is in consequence of the original proposals introduced here.  I agree that the person who wanted to buy an English suit made of cheap cloth between 1/6 and 2/6 per yard had to pay more for it after the Government's <Col N="340" /> original proposals were adopted.  But you cannot possibly increase the cost of living beyond that by increasing the duty on imported manufactured apparel.  You will be increasing the amount of protection which the ready-made clothing manufacturers here enjoy; you will be increasing the margin available for Irish cloth, and you will be offering the people a better inducement to buy suits made out of a better class Irish cloth in preference to suits made out of poor quality imported shoddy.</P>
    <P>The other point made by the Tariff Commission relating to the difficulty of imposing a duty on apparel that would not apply to other articles not manufactured in quantity in the Saorstát is one that they had to take into consideration when the main question was before them. They proposed certain exemptions. Other exemptions are proposed in this Resolution.  The advancement of that difficulty as an argument against the proposition to increase the duty on apparel is quite childish. I am satisfied, if the Government were not afraid to utilise the tariff weapon properly, that they would have done the right thing in this case.  But they appear to be very hesitant whenever any proposition for increasing protective duties comes before them.  They appear to be afraid of the weapon in their hands, and because of their fear, and the consequent timorous use they are making of the tariff weapon, they are doing much more harm than the vigorous use of that weapon could possibly do.  In addition, they are giving arguments to those who do not want to see Irish industry fostered.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember when this matter was under discussion here previously the daily papers and other organs in this State which represent the importing community were gloating over the spectacle of avowed supporters of tariffs finding objection to tariff proposals.  We did find objection to the particular tariff proposals before us, because these proposals had obviously not been properly considered.  The fact that they were not so considered is now evident by reason of the additional <Col N="341" /> report before us.  If the Tariff Commission, which took two years to consider the application for a duty on woollen cloth, had during that time given the matter the consideration which it required, we would not have this additional proposal here, because they would have been able to visualise all the difficulties that might have arisen from the granting of the application and they might have taken steps to meet them.  They did not do so, and consequently we have this arrangement of introducing additional resolutions to hide and remedy their mistakes.  I ask the Government to request the Tariff Commission to give concrete arguments against the proposition which we are putting forward&mdash;the proposition that the proper way to meet this difficulty is to increase the duty on woollen cloth.  I ask the Government to request the Tariff Commission to advance at least one argument in favour of the recommendation they have made.  They have not advanced any such argument in this report, nor has any such argument been advanced by a member of the Ministerial Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. Broderick Mr. H. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of the motion before the House.  Last February, when the tariff was imposed on woollen and worsted goods, I knew that the Saorstát mills would not manufacture the cheap class of material that is utilised in the cheaper type of ready-mades.  I knew well then, and I know now, that they would not be prepared to manufacture that class of material.  They gave evidence before the Commission that they would be prepared to manufacture material up to 3/- per yard.  The article that they would manufacture at 3/- would be a good article, but it would be without design; there would be no pattern in that article, and there would not be the same demand for it as the material coming from the foreign mills would receive from the ready-made manufacturers.  When he was introducing this Resolution the Minister mentioned that the members of the Tariff Commission had visited some mills in the Saorstát, and in one or <Col N="342" /> two of those mills they had what he called a rag-pulling machine for reclaiming wool.  I have heard of that machine, but I do not know where it is installed.  I know several important mills in the Saorstát have not got such a machine.  I know that such machines are used for teasing old socks and cardigan jackets, and things of that kind, which can be used for the cheaper classes of clothing.  I expect that is what the Commissioners had in mind when they mentioned this matter and put it in printed form.</P>
      <P>I know that the Athlone and the Cork woollen mills and the mills in Dublin do not use this class of teasing machine at all.  I would not like it to be broadcasted that we have machines in this country that tear up this class of old cloth for manufacturing into shoddy.  I do not believe that this is used in scarcely any of the mills.  I do not believe there is such a machine in the principal mills.  Indeed, I do not believe that there are more than one or two such machines in the Saorstát.  These machines are common enough in Bradford and in other mills across the Channel.  I am aware that consignments of rags from this country are sent to those mills for the purpose of being torn up and made into a cheap shoddy cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were approached here last February by the wholesale ready-made clothing people making an appeal to us to have cloths up to the value of four shillings a yard exempted from the tariff, or alternatively to have an additional tariff of ten per cent. imposed on wearing apparel.  In view of the evidence that these people put before us, and in view of the number of people who have gone into that particular end of the clothing industry from the handicraft trade, I thought it was necessary and wise to give support and consideration to the appeal made by these people in the ready-made tailoring industry.  Large numbers of people in the city have gone into these factories in Dublin.  The same thing prevails in Cork, Limerick, and <Col N="343" /> in the other large cities and towns. For that reason I think it is very desirable to do what the Minister and the Commissioners are doing, and it is very wise to exempt this clothing coming into the Saorstát up to the value of 2/6 per square yard. For this reason, and for this reason alone&mdash;consideration for the ready-made clothing and tailoring industry &mdash;I am supporting the motion.</P>
    <P>It has been said that as a result of this exemption on cloth coming into the Saorstát up to 2/6 per square yard that more shoddy will be coming into the Saorstát.  I do not think that will be the case.  That shoddy would come in in any case whether the tariff was on or not.  We know that that particular class of clothing is used by the majority of working people in Cork and Dublin, and in every large town in Ireland. I dare say that is so.  As Deputy Lemass says, I wish we could induce the people of this country to buy a better class of ready-made clothes than they buy.  I wish they would be patriotic enough not to buy any ready-made clothing that was not manufactured out of Irish material. I wish we could induce them to look at the matter in that way.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pleasure to me and to everybody here to know that the people were patriotic enough to wear clothing manufactured in their own country.  I was in a shop the other day and I demanded Irish-manufactured cloth.  There was a traveller in the shop selling ready-made clothes and he wondered at me and said I was a fool.  He said that the Minister for Finance was another fool for putting on a tariff on woollens at all.  I said: &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;do you not think that I am doing the right thing?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I know where this stuff is manufactured. It is manufactured in the City Woollen Mills, Dublin.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;You would be better off wearing an English suit; it would be material of better finish.&rdquo;  I laughed and I said: &ldquo;You are mad.&rdquo;  If we could induce the people to do what I and a good many more have done in this matter it would be a great <Col N="344" /> thing for the woollen mills in the Saorstát and for the tailoring industry as well.  For the reasons I have given I am supporting this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has talked a good deal about the length of time that the original application was before the Tariff Commission. He indicated that, of course, it was a very simple matter, and that if the Tariff Commission had only taken his point of view they need not have examined anything and they would have gone on all right.  That point of view is one that does not commend itself to me.  The whole proposition was a very complex one, and like all tariff proposals was very difficult on examination, because, without wishing to reflect unnecessarily on any applicants for a tariff, I think it must be admitted that they cannot be believed in practically any case without certainly making allowances. The ordinary applicant for a tariff stands to gain tremendously if a tariff is granted.  In some cases he is a man whose factory is, for instance, making no profit at all.  If the tariff were granted he sees himself able to make a profit of £1,000 or £2,000 or £3,000 a year without any difficulty.  The granting of a tariff to him is equivalent to the getting of a gift of £20,000, £30,000, or £60,000.  Consequently he will use everything that can be used in favour of that application, and he will, generally speaking, tend to suppress a good deal of what may be said against his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of everybody and it was my experience dealing with these cases before the Tariff Commission was set up at all, that before a tariff was granted we found that the applicant will promise everything.  He will promise to instal new equipment and to make a class of goods that he never made before.  He will give you signed contracts of all sorts.  Then when he has got the tariff he comes to you and tells you of difficulties that he did not mention before, difficulties which will prevent him from carrying out his promises.  The same sort of difficulty faced the <Col N="345" /> Tariff Commission.  If the woollen manufacturers had said with the same plainness before the original recommendation was made that they were not prepared to develop this side of their business, then the original recommendation would have contained the exemption limit that is now proposed.</P>
    <P>It was because of the lack of candour, which I suppose one must always expect, but which you cannot be sure is existing in any particular instance in advance, that the change now is proposed to be made. As a matter of fact, I understand that the Tariff Commission were in great doubts as to whether they should not put the exemption limit at 2s. 6d. as now proposed, when they were making the original report. The reason they did not do so was because various manufacturers indicated that they were going to develop this side of the business, and it was because the Tariff Commission wished to give them that opportunity to develop this side of their business that the exemption limit was fixed as low as 1s. 6d.  I do not regret myself that they did fix the limit so low, even though it involves amending legislation. I say that because it was worth while to give the woollen manufacturers as a body a fair opportunity, to give them, as it were, a pressing invitation to develop this cheap line of business.</P>
    <P>When it is now seen that they are not prepared to do it for some considerable time, at any rate, then there is nothing for it but to relieve the clothing manufacturers of the disadvantage which the change would have subjected them to.  I think a great deal of the argument that Deputy Lemass put forward was illogical, because he seemed to assume that in all grades of cloth made here&mdash;and I do not think he will admit this&mdash;the Irish manufacturers' price was going to be the full 15 per cent. above the price of corresponding cloth made on the other side.  This industry is one of the well-rooted industries of the country.  It is an industry which has done in the past, and which still <Col N="346" /> does, a considerable export trade.  It is one of the industries in which, given just the stimulus that the reservation of the biggest part of the home market will give, Irish manufacturers can hope to compete on absolutely even terms with the people on the other side.  For the ranges of cloth which they have made successfully in the past the Irish manufacturers will be able to do just as well as their competitors on the other side.  They will be able to make cloths of as good quality, and of as good design, and they will be able to sell them as cheaply.  It is very hard to say whether 4/- per trade yard represents the exact point at which Irish manufacturers can begin to compete successfully, but that is the nearest the Tariff Commission could get to it.</P>
    <P>If the kind of cloth which sells at 4/6 is the sort of cloth Irish manufacturers have been making successfully, then they can make that quality of cloth as cheaply, and as satisfactorily, as manufacturers in Great Britain.  If we call that sort of cloth wide, then the cloth of wide quality which can be bought at 4/6 here cannot be bought cheaper than 4/6 on the other side.  Therefore there will not be this wide divergence that Deputy Lemass suggested there is likely to be in the future. The position will be that, when a certain quality of cloth which can be bought in England&mdash;call it &ldquo;X&rdquo;&mdash; and which cost 3/9, will be admitted in free, 3/9 will be the price that the manufacturer will pay.  A certain other quality of cloth, which may be called &ldquo;Y&rdquo; cloth, which can be made at home, and at a cost of 4/6, can be bought also in England, but if bought in England at 4/6 the manufacturer will have to pay duty.  Consequently he will buy here.  I do not anticipate that the change is going to rob the Irish manufacturers of any part of the market they had in the past.  It will simply have this effect, that it will permit manufacturers of clothing here to use the quality of cloth which they need in order to sell their suits in competition, and which they could not have got if we did not <Col N="347" /> make this change.  If we had not made the change now proposed, the &ldquo;X&rdquo; quality cloth, which would cost 3/9, and which could not be got here, would have to pay duty, and a manufacturer would have either to put up the price of the suits or else to use Irish-manufactured cloth of another quality.  Assuming that 4/6 represents the point at which Irish manufacturers can make cloth to compete in all respects with cloth made on the other side, then we are going to rob them of no market at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said that the increase in the tax on ready-made clothing would not increase the cost to the consumer.  I could not accept that at all.  The clothing manufacturers are in an entirely different position from the woollen manufacturers. They have not yet the capacity to meet the requirements of the country.  This is not an old-established industry with an export market which it must hold in competition with outside firms.  The price of the home-made suits is really based on the price of imported suits, duty paid, and I am satisfied of this, that as we have put up the tax on imported suits by five per cent., the price of the home-made suits will go up by something very near five per cent.  It may go up immediately by an actual rise in price, it may go up by some changes in quality, or it may go up by not responding to downward fluctuations when they take place in competing suits.  Undoubtedly the Irish manufacturers, broadly speaking, not having control of the home market, not having any export trade, except a specialised sort of contract export trade, the position will be that every increase on the imported suits will increase the price to every purchaser of ready-made suits here.</P>
    <P>There is another argument against it.  The increased tax of 20 per cent. on apparel will apply to apparel which contains woollen or worsted material.  But the only wool in some of the apparel which will pay that extra tax may be wool valued for less than 1s. 6d. per yard, or may be <Col N="348" /> wool that is lighter in weight than the wool that is subject to the tax. It would follow that the only practicable method of administering the apparel tax was to charge the increased duty on all apparel which contained wool or worsted, and we would have to take samples of the particular wool or worsted cloth in a garment and decide whether that garment should pay 15 per cent. because of the type of wool or worsted in it, and was not liable to pay 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is what the Second Report refers to when it states that apparel would be subject to the increased duties although the material in it might be free from woollen duty. There are only two mills that have specialised at all in the use of reclaimed wool, and they are two of the smallest mills in the country. Another mill, a big one, which does something in it, devotes only a part of its capacity to the manufacture of cheaper cloths.  No undertakings could be obtained from the woollen manufacturers to give the Tariff Commission or the Department of Industry and Commerce any hope that the requirements of the clothing manufacturers would be met in the near future.  If the woollen manufacturers change their minds, or if any of them who have capital or mills which would enable them to have a fairly large output and to meet some substantial portion of the requirements of the clothing manufacturers, then, a case put forward by them for some alteration in the tariff could be very speedily determined by the Tariff Commission. The attitude of the Tariff Commission, as I have indicated, is one of anxiety to have as much cloth made in this country as possible and to have the scope of the protection as wide as is reasonable and fair, considering the other interests that are involved.  If there is a change in the position, if we reach a point where the woollen mills, as a whole, or a group of them which have a considerable capacity, make up their minds to develop this cheap end, then the protection which would enable them to get ahead with that <Col N="349" /> work and that development could very easily be afforded.  Meantime, if we leave the matter as it was by the original report there is no doubt that certain ends of the making-up trade would be very substantially hit and their development hindered, even if no collapse were actually caused.  On the other hand, if we <Col N="350" /> followed Deputy Lemass's recommendation we would have an increase in the apparel on the section of the community which can certainly least afford it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Ruttledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Vote was last before the House I was contending that it could be very considerably reduced on the figures which the Minister disclosed in introducing it.  It was pointed out, as I stated, when the Estimate was on last year that, owing to the fact that conditions had not yet become normal, nothing very substantial, at any rate, could be done with regard to making any effective reduction. The arguments then made would apply equally well now, so far as this House is concerned.  We contend that this Vote could be substantially reduced.  If the Minister desires to take the steps which he should have taken to reduce the force to a figure in keeping with the extent of the areas over which the Guards operate, it could be made more efficient than the rather cumbersome force that is now operating in the country.  The arguments put forward from time to time with regard to disturbed conditions in the country, and that things are not exactly normal&mdash;that is from the Minister's point of view, but we say that they are&mdash;do not hold.  If there were disturbed conditions in the country the Guards would not be able to deal with that situation, since they are an unarmed force.  If there were disturbed conditions in the country the Army would have to be called in, and the Minister is aware of that.  Therefore, the question raised about disturbed, or alleged disturbed, conditions in the country does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out before, the Gárda Síochána force now being maintained in the Twenty-Six Counties, if you exclude what was formerly the Dublin Metropolitan area, is almost as large a force as that in existence for the thirty-two counties up to 1918.  I do not think anyone <Col N="353" /> would contend that in 1918 conditions were exactly normal.  In the Gárda Síochána you have, I think, five commissioners, twenty-six chief superintendents, 133 superintendents, 55 inspectors, 1,287 sergeants and about 5,703 Guards, together with a large number of so-called civil servants, giving a total of something like 7,500.  The first question that would occur to one is, where is the necessity for five commissioners to control a force of 7,000 men? Where is the necessity for each of those commissioners to have a chief superintendent as a secretary?  It seems an extraordinary thing that each commissioner should have a chief superintendent as secretary.  There is another position in the force, in regard to which I would like to have some information from the Minister. What exactly are the duties of the inspector, and what is the necessity for such a position?  An inspector in the Gárda Síochána seems to be a peculiar position.  Nobody seems to know what the duties of the position are, except it be that a superintendent may be away from time to time and that then this inspector takes on certain duties.  What exactly are the duties assigned to the inspector?  I would like the Minister, when replying, to state the necessity for this position of inspector.</P>
    <P>We say that very substantial reductions could be effected by amalgamating a number of stations throughout the country.  I know that, in many areas, stations are within two or three miles of one another.  That is where you have stations in an adjoining county.  In other places they are within six and seven miles of one another.  I do not know any reason for that, or see the necessity for it, except that the Minister feels that his Department should, shall I say, follow in the footsteps of its fathers, or follow at any rate in the footsteps of the old régime, by keeping in existence the stations that existed prior to the Gárda Síochána being established? We believe that with the help of modern transport you could carry on as effectively and efficiently with <Col N="354" /> a reduced number of stations and with a much smaller force than you have at present.  In police stations, in many places, you have, for instance, a force consisting of six men, two sergeants and a superintendent. That is surely a preponderance of higher officers over men.  Of course, I admit that the superintendent has to be responsible for other stations in the district in which he resides, but in the chief station where he has his quarters it is usually found that there are from four to six men, two sergeants and, sometimes, an inspector as well.  I have certain stations in mind where that obtains.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, when he was introducing this Vote, that he anticipated a further reduction.  I am not clear whether the Minister meant that he anticipates a further reduction than that disclosed in the Estimate&mdash;that is, a reduction greater than the £29,000 set out in the Estimate. He says that recruiting is stopped, but he has not stated whether any reduction is to be made except so far as the stoppage of recruiting will affect it.  It would appear to be indicated by what the Minister stated that he is satisfied that a reduced force could carry on the duties effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was, that it would appear to be indicated that the Minister would be satisfied with that, since he provides that recruiting should cease.  If recruiting should cease, then a certain number of Guards will be retiring from time to time and going into other positions, and so on, and we will find at the end of a year that a reduced force will be looking after affairs compared to that here at present. The Minister seems to be prepared for that, and he seems to be satisfied he can carry on without making any arrangements to fill vacancies that will occur.  If that is so, would the Minister go farther and let the House know exactly the number by which the force could be reduced, without having to wait until vacancies <Col N="355" /> occur?  He must be satisfied that the force could be carried on with less numbers.  If that is so, why can not the Minister give some information to the House definitely as to the extent by which the force can be reduced?  Is it that the Minister is going to keep on those men simply because they are in positions and because he does not want to deprive them of their positions?  I think that might reasonably be deduced from what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister seeks to make economies, and when the Department tries to effect some economies, they tackle it in a method not approved of by this side of the House. They tackle it by what we say is a rather mean method.  They attack the allowances.  When these men joined the force the Minister of the time was satisfied that the allowances were only commensurate with the positions they occupied.  The Minister, this year, in a wild drive to secure economies, was supposed to take the boots off the Gárda.  We all had experience of the Gárda prosecuting unfortunate people all over the country for not keeping shoes on the donkeys.  The Minister thinks he can take the shoes off the Gárda, and also deprive them of some of their cycling allowance as a means of effecting economy.  I suppose we on this side of the House should be glad that something is being done to bring things down to a proper level, but we do not think it is a genuine effort at or a decent means of effecting economy, to act in this way.  A better and more effective means would be to reduce the force to a strength sufficient to deal with ordinary police work and the ordinary duties that devolve on the Gárda. This country always complained that it had been over-policed.  That was the cry in the old Sinn Fein days, and I am afraid that the Minister, in keeping up the Gárda to their present strength, deserves that cry being used against him.  No inquiry has been held, so far as this House knows, with a view to finding out by how much this force can be reduced.  Modern transport would <Col N="356" /> enable the Gárda to carry out their duties with a much smaller force.  As I have already pointed out, this country is policed altogether out of proportion to other countries.  England, Scotland, New Zealand, New South Wales, and other countries, as I have shown, have very much smaller police forces in proportion to the population than this country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to secure any real economy in the administration of the Gárda Síochána, or any reduction in the strength of the force, I suggest the proper way to do that is by setting up a committee of enquiry which would go into the duties that devolve on the Gárda, and who would take evidence from people who are in a position to give it and have that brought before the House.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to get up here and say that he himself is satisfied that the force cannot be reduced.  As I have said, the ordinary implication, from what he said in introducing this Vote, is that it can be reduced, but he does not say the extent to which it can be reduced.  A committee of enquiry, if set up, could take evidence from people who may have knowledge in this matter, or who may be interested in the question. That evidence could be submitted to the House for examination with a view to determining to what extent the force could be reduced, so that subsequent estimates may be considerably reduced.  I think that is not only the best but the only method of dealing with the matter. We ask that this Estimate be sent back for reconsideration.  We say the force can be reduced considerably, that there are positions in it that are anomalous, that the position of inspector is anomalous and should be done away with, and that there is no necessity for five commissioners in this small body.</P>
    <P>We say that Commissioners should not be entitled to have Chief Superintendents for clerks and that, in addition to Gárdaí, there should not be also a band of civil servants provided in connection with this service. If the Minister went into these matters he would not have to cut <Col N="357" /> down the boot and bicycle allowances of the Gárda in order to effect an economy of £29,000.  That is a very easy way to effect economy&mdash; it is a very simple and crude way&mdash; instead of cutting the pay, to take certain items away, so that it does not appear that it is a cut in salary or in wages.  It does not show that there is any real endeavour to effect the economy that we believe can be effected by a re-organisation of the force which will result in a certain reduction.  For these reasons, I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration pending the Minister giving some indication as to what he proposes to do to have some investigation made with regard to a reduction and how economies could be effected, and as to what further reductions he has in mind in the number of the force during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(Cork): I rise to pay a tribute to the Guards.  People would view with great alarm any reduction in the numbers of the force or in the barracks at present established.  I would strongly appeal to the Opposition to vote in favour of payment of the Guards. Deputy Ruttledge admitted that they were a useful body, and they are a useful body.  If things went on as they should have for the last seven years, there could be a substantial reduction made in the force, but while we have this element of unrest, this dissatisfaction with the State, and an anxiety to injure it at every stage of its existence, the Executive Council would be grossly neglecting their duty if they did not stand behind the Guards, and maintain them at their full strength.  To show how popular the force is at this moment, I may mention that 40,000 young men had to be refused admittance to the Guards.  If the Government required 100,000 young men over 20 years of age for the preservation of the State they would get them within 24 hours.  The people recognise that the Guards are a valuable asset to the State, that they form one of its foundations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since he came into the Dáil I have not been impressed either by his common sense or his eloquence.  This is one of the most crucial questions before us at present. We are asked to send the Vote back for reconsideration.  We are called upon to ignore the fact that the Guards gallantly joined up seven years ago to preserve the Treaty and the State, and we are asked now to hang up their pay and leave the Guards and their families without food.  Is that the policy of the Opposition&mdash;that we should hold up the pay of the Guards until such time as they consider they should be abolished?  I may tell the Opposition that they are not cutting much ice in the Twenty-Six Counties by this continual pin-pricking at the State, that they are losing their prestige and status in trying to lower the dignity of the State.  I appeal to the Minister to stick by the Guards and he will have the country behind him. I ask him not to reduce the present barracks by one.  The people of West Cork would view with alarm any attempt to take away the security which they enjoy owing to the fact that these barracks are in existence. The people know that while the Guards are there they can sleep safely.  I am surprised also that the Government should be called upon to disband the non-uniformed members of the Gárda, as they are a valuable asset.  As the result of two or three visits paid by one of these non-uniformed Guards to the village of Drimoleague, it is now the most peaceful village in the country.  If any Opposition Deputy walked down the long street of that village now he will find the people at every door smiling with joy because they have now security and peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Sheehy appreciated the appreciation that I was feeling for his speech when he referred to me. Deputy Ruttledge has pretty adequately covered the ground as to where the real reduction should be <Col N="359" /> made, and I do not wish to repeat what he said.  There is, however, another way of looking at it.  If the Government are not willing to reduce the numbers, at least they should try to get the best possible value out of the force, such as it is. The Gárda are used for purposes like collecting statistics, and I contend they are not sufficiently educated for that purpose, and that they should get very special training for it.  I do not question that they do the work to the best of their ability.  They are also used&mdash;they must be used, because there is no other machinery at present&mdash;for inquiries in connection with the Agricultural Credit Act.  They have not the expert knowledge of farming, etc., required to be able to say whether a person is a proper person to get a loan or not.  Instead of having the police sitting on walls, kicking their heels, for a considerable part of the day, as they are in a great many parts of the country, some form of training in these matters should be given to them.  I do not say that by way of attacking them, because I know that many of them would much prefer to be kept busy for a full working day.  Everybody likes to have a full working day when he is at work.  For that reason, if the Government will persist in keeping the enormous number that they have&mdash;because really the country could be policed with a far less number; the condition of the country is such that it does not require such an enormous number&mdash; they should give them a course of education to equip them for helping to rebuild the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a very pathetic picture of Irish life when you hear Deputy Sheehy say that 40,000 young men&mdash; and I do not doubt his figures&mdash;have applied to get into the force.  The explanation of that is that the economic conditions of the country are such that the only alternatives are unemployment or emigration.  I am speaking now apart entirely from the other debate in which the Minister seemed satisfied in his own mind that we were all <Col N="360" /> most terrific criminals, but it is rather hopeful to find that he is able to settle down peacefully and quietly to discuss in a reasonable way the actual administration of the force; it is a curious comment upon his, shall we say, forensic efforts of the last few days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That having regard to the lack of proper facilities for the shipment of cattle from Dublin port and the fact that the carrying trade from the Free State to British ports is practically non-competitive, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should confer with the Dublin Commissioners, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and the Cattle Traders' Association with a view to the erection of suitable municipal lairages at the North Wall and for facilities for berthage convenient thereto.&rdquo;  (John F. O'Hanlon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much additional to say upon this motion to what I have already said. <Col N="361" /> I have recounted certain attempts that were made to get members of the Cattle Traders' Association, and the Cattle Exporters' Association into a conference with other interests concerned on these various matters. I suggest to Deputy O'Hanlon that his purpose could be best served in this way.  There are three questions brought out in this motion: one is the matter which is implied in the second assumption, the fact that the carrying trade, from the Free State to British ports, is practically non-competitive. I presume that the point of that is that some action is thought to be required on the question of freights.  The other two points are those directly referred to &mdash;that is, the provision of suitable municipal lairages at the North Wall, and facilities for berthage convenience there, too.  I think these three are joined up by what was said in the Seanad&mdash;a remark I previously referred to&mdash;when it was alleged that what the cattle exporters of this country wanted was to get some element of competition in order to bring down freights, and that they could not possibly get that competition unless they had places where beasts could be held for inspection, and unless they had berthage facilities close at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest again that the Cattle Traders' Association, or the Cattle Exporters' Association, or both, should come to a meeting, which I am prepared to summon, with representatives of the railway companies and shipping companies, and let us have properly threshed out this question of freights, and come to some determination as to what the freights in fact are, and some approach to agreement as to the exact percentage increase since 1914.  When that matter has been determined, if one side thinks the rates as then determined are still too high, and if the other people say that although they may appear to be too high they are warranted by circumstances and cannot be brought down, then undoubtedly the question of the opening up of competition will have to be gone into.  Competition can only be obtained by the encouragement <Col N="362" /> of a sort of a tramp steamer trade, or encouraging regular sailings by boats that would be chartered by some of those associations. For that it is necessary to have the two other facilities spoken of, lairage accommodation and berthage facilities close at hand.  So on the question of freights I shall take steps to summon a conference of the three parties concerned, and to get that presided over by some person not joined up with any of the three interests that are to confer.</P>
    <P>On the second matter, the question of lairage and facilities for berthage, Deputy O'Hanlon's motion deals with municipal lairages.  At one time it seemed to me he did not stress that word very much, or care whether it was in or not.  Any scheme that the Senator concerned spoke of as likely to be laid before the Minister for Agriculture was a project for municipal lairages.  The first approach there should be to the Dublin City Commissioners, and I again invite the Cattle Traders' Association, and those concerned with those lairages, to put their scheme before the Dublin Commissioners. If the Dublin Commissioners are ready to accept the scheme, finance it, and carry it out, well and good.  If not, they should then seek an interview, and the interview will be arranged or any sort of a conference called with the Dublin City Commissioners.  But the proper approach is first to the Dublin City Commissioners and thereafter through the Commissioners to whoever is the proper Minister, probably the Minister for Agriculture. Facilities for berthage is a subsidiary question to the matter of lairages, because it depends upon where the lairages are to be situated, but, again, I repeat my invitation to the Cattle Exporters' Association to pass on to me any correspondence they have had with the Port and Docks Board as to facilities for berthage and the answer given to them by that Board, and if the attitude taken up by that Board seems unreasonable I shall make it my business to get in touch with them and have the matter threshed out. <Col N="363" /> These are the three matters dealt with in the motion, and I am making these suggestions to the Deputy as a better way out: I will write to the Cattle Traders asking them to meet the other people interested on the question of freights; I invite them to approach the Dublin Commissioners on the question of lairages and to get the Commissioners to make their approach to the Government afterwards, and if approach is made I shall see that that further conference is arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Cattle Exporters' Association I desire to say that we are satisfied with the explanation of the Minister. What we would like is that this conference should not be delayed. This motion has been before the House for 13 or 14 months and in that time the cattle trade has suffered from the exorbitant freights. They may say they come from the exporters themselves.  They do not, they all go back to the producers. We feel that, owing to the unnecessarily heavy freights charged at present, unless some action is taken the matter will be found to be bearing too heavily on the cattle trade.  The time has arrived when something should be done to reduce the freights.  I ask the Minister to call a conference as soon as possible, and, speaking on behalf of the Cattle Exporters' Association, I say we are prepared to take part in it at any time.</P>

      <P>The reason I intervene in this debate is that an unfair use of the rights and privileges of this House has been attempted to some extent to make what appears to me to be a most unjustifiable attack upon an old Dublin company.  The old Dublin company attacked under this resolution is the British and Irish Steam Packet Company.  Those of us who have had association extending over some years with this city will recognise in this company an institution which was giving employment to large numbers in our city, a company which has a very honourable record and a company <Col N="364" /> which has done an amount of useful work for the city.  That company has been subjected to attack, to my mind very unfairly, under the rules and privileges of this House.  Not alone has the company been attacked, I am sorry to say, but the respected manager of the company has been singled out by name in this House and has been the subject of attack.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I have to deal with this matter, but I hope that by doing so we will prevent the rules of the House being availed of under similar circumstances in the <Col N="365" /> future.  In some respects there is something to be said for the Deputy because he is not a member of any of the Dublin constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>He comes from a constituency that possibly has not very close business relations with Dublin and therefore, to some extent, there is some justification for his ignorance about this old Dublin Company. Not satisfied with attacking the company, he proceeds further to deal by name with the manager of that company.  It has been my privilege to have been a member of this House for the past six years and I can recall no similar circumstances on the part of any Deputies in this House naming any particular individual and thereby attempting to hold him up to odium.</P>
      <P>We, business men in Dublin, are justly proud of some of those men who have done much towards building up the industries which give a certain amount of employment in our city.  Knowing Mr. Barry for a number of years, I can say this of him, that he is a citizen of which every citizen of Dublin is justly proud, and nothing that Northern Deputies can say in this House will in any way take from the respect that we feel for that citizen.  I am sorry that the privileges and regulations of this House have been availed of to make such an attack on a respectable citizen.  Such was the attack that the Ceann Comhairle found it his duty to intervene and draw the Deputy's attention to the statements he was making about this citizen.  I trust that when the verbatim report of this debate reaches the Deputy he will feel it his duty to send an apology to that citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it is my duty to have to refer to those two matters. This company is being attacked because it is a member of a combine.  Those of us who have <Col N="366" /> close business relations with this city and with business, as it is done in other places, know that we are living in an age of combines.  It is only a few years ago that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House brought in a Bill to amalgamate the railways in the Free State.  He said that there were too many boards and too many directors and that the overhead expenses involved in running all these various establishments and companies were too large, too great a burden, and that all these companies should be amalgamated in one combine.  The House agreed with that.  Whether if it were to come forward at the moment we would still be of the same view is another question.  That is the tendency of the age.  If a company is to exist to-day, in many circumstances it is necessary that it should be a member of a combine, and because a company is a member of a combine it should not, for that particular reason, be held up to odium in this House.  We have, as I said, the case of a number of small companies.  Small companies are not economic at present.  They are not able to carry through business at the rates combines can carry them through, and for that reason it is essential that small companies should be identified with each other or amalgamated in order that they may compete against combines.  Any business man will tell you of the accuracy of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I object to is that the lairages and the cattle market in Dublin have been held up to a certain amount of ridicule.  The lairages of Dublin, and I happen to know something of them, will compare favourably with the lairages to be found in any other seaport in the United Kingdom.  I have been in lairages in other ports, and from my point of view I would be inclined to say that the accommodation at our own port was superior, but for the purposes of the argument I will only say that it is as good as is to be found.  Other Deputies who have experience of this matter can give their views.  I will give mine, unbiased, on the subject.  If that be <Col N="367" /> so, why is our port held up to odium?  The effect of this when it gets into the Press will be to give the impression that the conveniences in Dublin are not what they ought to be, that it is not up-to-date, and people will say, &ldquo;we will send our cattle via Belfast.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they are doing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is not what the Deputy wants done.  I do not want that done. The effect of unjustifiable criticism of this character is to injure not alone the company which does the trade but the Port of Dublin.  The Port of Dublin might possibly be improved, but I think the same criticism can be offered of any port or any system that has been in existence for a number of years.  I do not say it is above criticism, but let our criticism be fair and helpful. Do not let our criticism be damaging. The cattle market has been attacked. It is an old institution, possibly if we had town-planning in Dublin to-day it would be found that the cattle markets might be placed in closer proximity to our port.  As the cattle market stands at the moment it compares very favourably with any market I know of, and I have been in a number of them.  You will get facilities in the Dublin market that you will not get in others.  Other members of the House can speak more closely of the work of the Dublin market than I can, but it is an institution that has been well looked after and well kept up even though it is run by the old Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that these matters should be taken over by the State.  I do not know if they are taken over by the State that we are going to find any great improvement in them.  My experience of business done by the State is not that it is better done than by some of the institutions that are carrying on at the moment.  It was only a few days ago that I was reading the remarks of a man who has very considerable parliamentary experience. <Col N="368" /> He happens to be the Prime Minister of the Parliament of Australia.  He was speaking on the subject of business done under State control some little time ago, when he was over here at one of these Imperial Conferences.  In the connection of State doing business I was rather struck by the words of this statesman.  Mr. Bruce, as you are aware, is the Prime Minister of the Parliament of Australia.  He is a man who was trained in one of the universities at the other side and he is looked upon as one of the most up-to-date in connection with the experiences of government.  His opinion is very highly valued.  This is what he said, speaking on the subject of business being carried on by a Government: &ldquo;Governments have certain things they can do reasonably well, but I can assure you that Governments are not really capable of initiating great schemes, sifting them to the bottom and carrying them through.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that that view of an experienced statesman will not be accepted by the Labour Party, but it is a view that will have a good deal of weight with those outside this House.  Some of us who have had to do with business for a number of years have seen governments doing business, we have seen corporations doing business, and we have seen business carried through by business men.  I have yet to learn that the State is a good medium through which to do business.  When I see the difficulties that the State is confronted with&mdash;we all see them&mdash; I certainly have come to the conclusion that there is a good deal of truth in what was said by Mr. Bruce, that it is only a matter of <Col N="369" /> good luck when a government pulls off some business successfully.  I do not want to take up the time of the House dealing with these matters further.  What I want to impress on Deputies is that things in our city may not be ideal&mdash;they can be im-proved&mdash;but let the criticism that we have to offer be helpful so that they may be improved.  Do not have that condemnation and useless criticism that we sometimes hear of things in Dublin, that they are old, worthless and out of date.  Also, may I express the hope that when we come to speak of business men in the future in this House we will give to them, at all events, the credit that is due to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose so, from the Deputy's point of view.  This is an important motion that Deputy O'Hanlon has moved.  It opens up a very big and vital question.  As the Minister pointed out the other day, when speaking to this motion, this whole question has got to be hung up until the Ports and Harbours Tribunal reports to the House. We have heard many complaints from various sections of the community, traders, shippers and so on, and even from some of our port authorities, of the manner in which business is being done through our ports&mdash;complaints of increased rates, the want of berthage and lairage accommodation, etc.&mdash;but when the Minister appointed a tribunal to investigate all these <Col N="370" /> complaints I wonder did all these people come forward and tell exactly the position of affairs I am afraid they did not.  If I remember aright, when the Tribunal sat in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, everyone who appeared before them, instead of bearing out these complaints told them that everything in the garden was lovely.  The moment they had gone away we had a repetition of the complaints.  It is a very reasonable complaint for us to make nowadays, seven years after the Treaty, that we find many of our ports&mdash;I presume the Port of Dublin is in the same position as the Port of Cork&mdash;absolutely controlled by foreign statutes of about the time of George IV, 1820, statutes 110 years old.  How business men on these Boards tolerate that position and expect to do good business, and the country to develop industrially and commercially, passes my comprehension. We will take the Port of Cork, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hennessy would be quite in order in referring to Cork port.  The motion states that the carrying trade from the Free State to British ports is practically non-competitive.  The fact that the Port of Cork is suffering from a stranglehold so far as the carrying companies are concerned, brings it within the motion, and I think Deputy Hennessy is quite in order in referring to the conditions at the Port of Cork.</P>

      <P>We would raise the wind somehow, and having formed our company, purchased our ships and registered them in the State, would we get berthage accommodation either in Cork or Dublin?  I doubt it.  Sooner or later the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Agriculture must seriously tackle this question of berthage accommodation and freights.  I believe it is a matter that will require legislation, and, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done in the case of big schemes, such as the Shannon scheme, we must be prepared to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, if we are to get rid of these combines which have this country economically by the throat.  I was talking yesterday to a cattle shipper, who told me that the freights on cattle are about 300 per cent. over pre-war rates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will <Col N="372" /> find it in the Report of the Tariff Commission.  When rates are 300 per cent. over pre-war rates surely there is a case for investigation.  We welcome the Minister's proposal.  It is a practical suggestion, namely, that the people interested&mdash;the shippers, the shipping companies and railway companies&mdash;should get down to a conference immediately, and if they do not reach a satisfactory agreement it would then be a question for the Minister to get after the question of rates.  Surely, he and his Department are in a position to get correct figures and statistics from the shipping companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though Deputy Good would deprecate any Deputy speaking on this subject unless he represented Dublin City or County, I will presume to say a few words on the motion.  First of all, I would appeal to Deputy O'Hanlon to reconsider his decision to press this motion to a division in view of the fact that the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal will shortly be presented to the Executive Council.  On the consideration of that Report we will be in a better position to make up our minds on this question.  The provision of municipal lairages would not necessarily be better than the present accommodation, and also, as Deputy Moore pointed out on the last day, it is hard to understand how the Government could interfere with the municipality in this matter.  I think that there is a feeling in every part of the House, however, that Government action of some sort is necessary. As Deputy Hennessy pointed out, the Government is now seven years in control, but the same regulations hold and, not only that, things have to a certain extent got worse with the shipping business, which has gone practically altogether into the hands of foreign companies, and there exists what is known as a shipping ring.  We, on these benches, and also, I think, Deputies opposite, believe that something should be done to break that ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we think that anything, no matter what motion, <Col N="373" /> that would force the Government to do something is better than the present state of affairs.  I believe that if this motion went to a division it would have a considerable volume of support, but I appeal to the Deputy to wait until the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal is issued before proceeding further as we can see how we stand in the matter and what their recommendations are.  It is possible that a stronger and clearer resolution could then be put down by Deputy O'Hanlon which would practically have the unanimous support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the members for the City of Dublin, and as one who has been in business in that city for practically a quarter of a century, I suppose I have some idea of what the people think so far as the present arrangements for shipping are concerned.  It is only right I think, to say that the citizens of Dublin view with very considerable alarm the position which prevails under the present combine. Deputy Good referred to the employment given by these companies. The citizens of Dublin appreciate that employment and have no wish to depreciate the value of these companies nor to say anything that would lessen the prestige of the Port of Dublin, but they cannot shut their eyes to the fact that every Irish carrying company that existed in the city has ceased to exist as an Irish company.  The old City of Dublin Steampacket Company is gone.  The British and Irish Company is gone.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Good allow me to finish?  The Palgrave-Murphy Company, and the Michael Murphy Company have gone under the control and management of the British combine.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts that we have ceased to have carrying companies belonging to this country. They are no longer Irish companies, and every penny of goods carried from this country is carried in the bottoms of English ships.  As Deputy Hennessy said, this motion gives rise to an important and grave problem.  The external trade of this country is no mean trade.  It is valued at something like £100,000,000 sterling, and 97 per cent. of that trade goes to British ports.  As somebody in this House has said, it is practically a non-competitive trade. There is nobody to bring down rates or to see that only a fair margin of profit exists for the companies. These companies can sit down and demand any rates they like.  As a business man who has to pay freights I realise the exorbitant charges made.  Is it not time that something should be done to face this problem, which is a very important problem as far as the future of the State is concerned?  Is it not time that something should be done to avail ourselves of this great carrying trade for the profit of the country?  Is it not time that an effort should be made to set up an Irish mercantile marine?  Are we ever to tackle the problem of ships coming in here year after year, carrying cargoes and going out in ballast?  Deputy Hennessy, in my opinion, is perfectly right in saying that this is a most important problem and that Deputy O'Hanlon's motion raises far greater issues than the mere issues connected with the lairage and berthage question to which he has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by Deputy Good in the course of his speech that anything handled by the State is generally a failure.  I am not one who advocates as a rule the running of any system on State lines.  I prefer in every case to see the operation of private enterprise, but we must remember that this country is faced with a position of affairs in which it would be utterly impossible, in my opinion as a business man, that this question could ever <Col N="375" /> be properly handled by private enterprise and made a success.  When Deputy Good informed this House that several States had interfered in matters of the kind under discussion and had never made a success of them, I would remind him that a little country, like ours in many respects, the country of Denmark, has organised a mercantile marine and that mercantile marine brings in a revenue to the Danish people of £11,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the property of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the property of the Danish people.  I would prefer to see private enterprise dealing with this problem if it were humanly possible for it to operate in face of the combine which controls the carrying trade of the country at present, but I fail to see how it would be humanly possible for private individuals to tackle the problem under present conditions.  I remember in the old days when the firm of Palgrave Murphy gave us direct shipping from Dublin with Cadiz, Oporto and other places. To-day no such facilities exist. Surely it is in the interests of the country that it should have direct shipping from this city to every quarter of the globe.  I would remind Deputy Good that other countries faced with problems of this kind found ways and means of dealing with them, by levying tariffs and dues which prevented the indirect shipment taking place.  I suppose two-thirds of the goods coming into this country from the United States have to pass through British ports. That means that every Irish importer has to pay five or ten per cent. extra carriage on these goods.  These are matters, in my opinion, of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask are the rates charged by the carrying trade to Dublin so satisfactory that it is not the duty of the House to give them consideration, and if they are not, is it not <Col N="376" /> really the proper function of this House to consider a matter of such outstanding magnitude?  I would like to quote one or two items to show the freights that are being charged at the present moment. Bacon brought from Denmark is landed in Grimsby at 24/3 per ton. To bring Irish bacon from Cork to Liverpool costs 37/2 per ton, and to land it in Manchester costs 41/4. Butter landed in Grimsby from Denmark costs 35/6 per ton.  Butter from Cork landed in Manchester costs 45/- per ton.  Some time ago the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; dealt with this very important problem, and quoted a representative from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce as saying: &ldquo;There must be something radically wrong when it is cheaper to bring produce all the way across the North Sea than from places on our doorstep, and when Ireland's national geographical advantage is converted into a disadvantage.&rdquo;  The problem raised by the motion of Deputy O'Hanlon is, in my opinion, a problem of outstanding importance.  No matter what side of the House a Deputy belongs to, one thing he should have at heart is the interest of his own country before any country in the world.  The interest of our country will never be served by the present British monopoly which carries everything we have to export from our ports.  If there is one problem which should be tackled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce I suggest it is the transport problem as it exists at present. I say that it is not impossible for that problem to be tackled satisfactorily by the State.  I say the satisfactory solution of the problem would mean providing many millions sterling for the State.  The revenue that would accrue would, in my opinion, wipe out the present adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>These are factors that, as a Deputy representing the City of Dublin, it is my duty to bring before the House, particularly when Deputy Good makes use of the remarks that he has made use of.  I would deplore anything in the nature of a personal attack on Mr. Barry.  I <Col N="377" /> feel sure that if Deputy O'Hanlon made such an attack it was not intended by him in a personal way.  I do not know whether he made any such attack.  I would say, as one who has the interest of the city at heart just as deeply as Deputy Good and as one representing the city, that this question of transport is a question of outstanding importance and a question that should receive the earliest and earnest consideration of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  Upon its solution there is no doubt a great fillip would be given to trade and a great improvement in the adverse trade balance would be made, to the advantage of the people generally and especially the people of the City of Dublin, whom I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to welcome the widely distributed opinion which is shown in this House in relation to this problem.  I welcome the contributions of Deputy Byrne, Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Hennessy and members on our own benches, in so far as they illustrate that this problem, as a problem, has now come home to representatives of all Parties in the House and in this State.  I disagree with a great deal that has been said by Deputy Byrne, which, I think, will be in the minds of most members of the House, in relation to the efficiency and the effectiveness of purely State interference in the matter.  To me it is a problem which I personally have been up against the whole of my life.  It is a problem which the firm to which I belonged for forty years have been engaged in an attempt to fight and solve.  I am not satisfied that the solution is going to be in State action as such.  The nigger in the wood pile is Deputy Good and all that Deputy Good represents. It is a fact that right through the whole industrial, commercial, financial and political machine of this country, Deputy Good and the mentality of Deputy Good exists and dominates the position. The army of peaceful economic penetration is in possession of <Col N="378" /> all the key positions of commerce, of credit, and of transport.</P>
      <P>The problem which we have to face in this country is not the problem which other countries have to face&mdash;the problem of dealing with the enemy outside our shores.  The problem we have to face is the problem of dealing with the enemy who is entrenched in our own home and who pretends to speak in our name. If this problem is to be solved there will be a definite duty and a definite function to be performed by the Government.  That would be a function purely and simply, in my opinion, of protecting and making effective the efforts of those who are not in the Government.</P>
      <P>Commercial interests of all sorts and kinds are regimented behind this transport monopoly.  And if you hit that transport monopoly in any single one of its widely flung tentacles in Irish commercial life, you will find that like the squid it will harden up on every one of its tentacles and you will find that you are fighting the whole machine.  You will be fighting the whole machine that controls insurance, that controls larger distribution, that controls credit and that controls transport generally.  The hand is the hand of Esau but the voice is the voice of Jacob&mdash;not Jacob in this case but Good.  Damn good for Good, but very bad for this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy suggested that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could get exact figures.  I believe that the Minister for Industry and Commerce does want this information.  I believe quite frankly that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce could get information and if he could help he would be anxious to act upon it.  I think he knows the problem.  He knows that the enemy is in our own house, but what figures can he get?  Their balance sheet of five per cent.? What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a very simple story.  A new splendid boat came into the City of Cork for one of the members of this combine.  A Cork shipper was standing on the quay with the managing director of that particular <Col N="379" /> line.  He said, &ldquo;How much do you think that ship cost?&rdquo; She was replacing a ship which was supposed to cost £60,000.  She stood in their books at the figure of £60,000. The Cork shipper was told that she cost £380,000 and her cabins were not yet in her.  The comment made by that managing director for the purpose of transmission to the commercial community of Cork was: &ldquo;They will have to wait a long time for a reduction of the freights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It took us four years to discover that that ship was built by themselves, and the figure at which it appeared in their books was purely a matter for themselves.  We have got to earn interest upon £360,000 when that £360,000 may represent any sum, in fact, different to £360,000. You had a ship which was written down to £25,000 belonging to one branch of the Octopus.  She was transferred to another branch of the Octopus at £80,000, because that was the branch that was capable of earning money on £80,000 and not because her value had changed in the slightest degree.  A ship which had been temporarily upon the Irish service was converted at a cost of £40,000 or £50,000 to make it suitable for the Scotch service, and the cost of the conversion was charged up to the Irish service, and interest had to be paid upon that.</P>
    <P>You go further through their accounts and you find that they borrow money from each other.  They borrow money, at any rate, that suits them through each other, and no accountant could contest the accuracy of their accounts upon that ground.  If, for instance, one of them accumulates, say, £15,000 or £20,000 profit he is told to transfer that at any particular interest which the central organisation decides to any particular branch of that organisation. He can transfer it at an interest of one, two, three or ten per cent.  How can the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not knowing anything of these facts&mdash;there is no means whatever by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce can know these facts&mdash;be able to find <Col N="380" /> from any particular balance sheet whether the profits made are extravagant or otherwise?</P>
    <P>It is impossible at the present moment for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the whole of the balance sheet and all the information that he could possibly take from those people, to form an opinion as to what is actually going on unless he knew from inside.</P>
    <P>Move on again.  Let us say for a moment that we are going to send a competing service into the city of Cork, into Dublin or some other place.  You will find that every single piece of property on the quay, every economic loading berth, is backed by property which is owned by the combine or those interested in it, and you can only buy it against a covenant not to use it for shipping purposes. I have seen dozens of those contracts.  If I buy a piece of property on the Cork quays at present I find I can use it for rearing antelopes. I cannot use it for coal.  I cannot use it for shipping; I cannot use it for storing grain.  That sort of thing has been going on for a considerable number of years, and that invisible stranglehold is there.  If you send a ship to Dublin City to load in competition with a ship that has an economic berth you are beaten from the day you go in.  We send in some more ships in competition and first, there is a rate cutting.  After the rate has been cut for a certain time there is an attempt to buy you, and generally that is successful, because a good many of the lines that come in to compete come in to be bought out.</P>
    <P>A man came to me in Liverpool one time and told me he was running a ship to Ireland for a particular and specific purpose.  I knew his financial position to a hair.  He asked me if I would not come in with him and I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;Do you know what you are up against?&rdquo;&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; he said.  He added &ldquo;What do you think I want?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;In the first place, you will not get an economic loading berth.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I think I can get over that,&rdquo;<Col N="381" /> and for certain reasons which were very exceptional reasons for a time he did.  Then I told him the second thing that would happen, assuming that he could do that, was that he would be beaten out by the weight of money.  He said &ldquo;No, I will not. I am going deliberately to restrict myself to a small trade.  It will not pay them to break their freight price on their gross traffic for the small amount that I am going to do.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Wise man.&rdquo; Then I said &ldquo;The third thing that will happen will be that you will be bought out. You cannot be frozen out, you cannot be beaten out, but you will be bought out,&rdquo; and his answer was, &ldquo;Mr. Flinn, what do you think I am going in for?&rdquo; and he was bought out.</P>
    <P>That is the history of a good deal of the competition.  Anyone who knows anything about what has been occurring in Ireland for the last few years will be able to identify three, four, and possibly five, enterprises of that kind.  Then you find the man who cannot be shifted like that. There was a line coming into Cork from the continent, so the Octopus came to him and said: &ldquo;You are coming into Cork in competition with us,&rdquo; and the man said &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Octopus, &ldquo;You call at Havre.&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we do not and if you are not out of Cork next week we will call at Havre,&rdquo; and he cleared out of Cork. The idea that it is easy for anyone to go into competition and to get away with it, having regard to the existence of these people's far-flung commercial associations, their covenanted rights in harbours and, above all, the support of Deputy Good&mdash;the idea that it is easy for us to get through that stranglehold certainly shows a lack of knowledge of the position.</P>
    <P>Now I will come to what I call the Deputy Good element.  In the City of Cork the local representative of the Octopus charges 6s. 8d. for each consignment coming in for clearing it through the customs, whether you clear it or they clear it.  If you do all the work they still charge you <Col N="382" /> the money and the commercial community in Cork have apparently not been able to solve that little riddle. You would imagine they would protest and kick up blue blazes about it, but this is actually what did happen. At a meeting of a certain trade at which the question was raised as to the 6s. 8d. for which nothing was being done in this particular case, because it often paid the people to clear the goods themselves, the suggestion was made that they should protest.  Do you know what that body actually advocated? They advocated not that the 6s. 8d. should be reduced, but that it should be increased, that they should be asked to pay more for that service. And why?  Because that charge was a heavy charge upon people who were getting small consignments, small parcels of goods, but it was a protection for those who were engaged in the larger trade of distribution and it paid them to use the shipping companies for the purpose of hitting their smaller competitors.</P>
    <P>One of the methods which most people have in relation to getting over the Irish shipping difficulty is to set up a company with Irish capital to run the shipping end.  In the first place you have to remember that when you tackle the Cork Steam Packet Company, the British and Irish, or any other of the twenty-two companies which are associated, you tackle, roughly speaking, £250,000,000.  Remember that that is £250,000,000 of fighting money, and unless you are prepared to put into the pool an amount of money which can stand up to that fight, do not imagine for a moment that the mere question of business efficiency or anything else is going to enable you to win through.  Certanly not, particularly if you have at the head of your major importation and exportation services in Ireland men of the mentality of Deputy Good, or men of the mentality of the Dublin Chamber of Distributors who do not want anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is not the putting up of money that is required; it is the pooling of traffic.  It is a question of the putting <Col N="383" /> up of traffic under conditions in which that traffic can be held to that particular new organisation in spite of the bribes, the menaces and the sabotage which will be immediately and directly used against it.  If our Irish shippers had a different mentality to that of the O.B.E., if they had a different mentality to the N.C.O's of the army of economic penetration which are called the Chambers of Commerce, whose grip economically in this country is so complete that they have not got even a petty commissioned officer here, the situation would be altered.  Mr. David Barry's name has been mentioned. I merely take him as an example&mdash;an office boy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now, you start again with a rival company and attempt to function. They go to one of these people, who say: &ldquo;All right, this traffic of yours is hitting us.  We will give you a rebate upon the nominal figure; we will give you that rebate over a series of years even, and you must state on your invoice to your customers a wrong freight.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What interest has Deputy Davin in this matter?  In a number of things there is a difference between what one knows and what one can prove, and a difference between the things that one can prove and that one is allowed to prove.  Where do I get this information? From living in it, because such agreements have been handed to those in whom I am interested.  I have simply put that to you as a problem. It is a much bigger problem and a much more difficult problem than is, I think, ordinarily envisaged. But it is a problem that can be solved if we get rid of Deputy Good, if we get rid of everything that Deputy Good represents, if we tear out of the heart of this country &ldquo;the fifteen.&rdquo; Deputy Byrne does not count&mdash;a pawn in the game.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If you can get Irish industry conscious of the grip, conscious of what it is suffering on account of the grip, if you can get it determined to take the action which that consciousness of what it is suffering in that grip imposes upon it, then this problem is solvable.  If these people would recognise the position with regard to the services between us and the single customer for our goods, that the complete control of shipping, of insurance, of distribution, and of credit is in the hands of Deputy Good and his associates, and that that means that they have a stranglehold upon them, that no matter what we do, no matter what we produce, no matter what <Col N="385" /> the quality or the amount of our produce may be, that stranglehold can be effective to keep us poor and to keep our country depopulated, if we can get that consciousness burnt home into the minds of our people, then the shipping combine can be smashed, the grip can be broken, and this country can be allowed to function as a free economic unit instead of as an economic slave.</P>
      <P>But it is in our own hands.  The Government alone cannot do it.  If the Government attempt to do it they will be hamstrung at every corner by people who are in possession of the key positions in Irish economic life.  It is our business to put behind whatever government we are asking to function in this matter an educated, an informed and a determined national opinion.  Then this shipping problem which, big as it is, is only one of the fingers of the grip, can be solved, and when it can be solved the whole question as to whether this country can be made a country in which a considerable population on a widely distributed standard of frugal comfort can be maintained, or whether it is going to be a little country, with a small and poor population which cannot maintain itself, maintain its present industries or develop to any position which is consonant with the hope that we have always had through the long generations of hard times that our people have served through, can be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has withdrawn that, because I have no greater personal interest in this motion than the Deputy himself, or than any other Deputy who may be interested in the passage of laws which are for the well-being of the community at large.  I join with Deputy Ryan in appealing to the mover of the motion to withdraw it, for two reasons.  In the first place, the motion calls for certain inquiries, investigations and consultations with <Col N="386" /> public bodies and others who are interested in the matter with a view to providing better lairage facilities in the City of Dublin.  Having heard the eloquent speeches of Deputies representing the City and County of Cork, Deputy O'Hanlon will quite clearly see that it would be unfair to the people in the City and County of Cork to pass a motion which deals only with Dublin.  Therefore, I hope that he will not press the motion to a division.  If he does, I feel that such Deputies as Deputy Hennessy and Deputy Flinn would be bound to go into the Lobby against it, because it does not call for the same facilities for Cork Harbour as for Dublin, and as far as I can gather, Cork is suffering to a greater extent than Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Government set up the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, and as far as I can see from reading the evidence which has been given all over the country, every opportunity has been given to every interest, wherever the Tribunal has sat and taken evidence, to put up any aspect of the problem affecting their shipping conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but the Deputy will realise that, unfortunately, authority over the ports in this country has been in the hands of vested interests, who will not always give evidence before the Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  Any Deputy who has given consideration to the matter must agree that the setting up of a native Government here was bound to bring with it a demand for the revision of the powers and authority of harbour boards.  I agree that that demand was justified and that a revision of the powers of the different harbour authorities in the Free State is long overdue.  If that is the case and if the Tribunal is charged with the responsibility of dealing with the harbours and with the duty of suggesting a revision of the laws governing their administration and control, I say that this motion should apply equally in the case of Dundalk, Cork <Col N="387" /> or any other port as in the case of Dublin.  For that reason, I suggest that the whole matter should be left over until the House has had an opportunity of studying the Report and the recommendations of that very important Commission.  Deputy Hennessy said that some of the people who have vested interests refused to give evidence before it.  If they did so, and the Tribunal makes a report of any kind, affecting their interests, then it will be their loss or misfortune if they refused to give evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question. I strongly appeal to Deputy O'Hanlon to withdraw the motion. It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;That having regard to the lack of proper facilities for the shipment of cattle from Dublin port and the fact that the carrying trade from the Free State to British ports is practically non-competitive, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should confer... &ldquo;I disagree with the wording of a motion, which says that the carrying trade to British ports from Free State ports is practically non-competitive. I suggest this to Deputy O'Hanlon and probably it might enable him to get such information as to make him change his mind: I would ask him to make inquiries regarding the number of agents employed by Cross-Channel railway and shipping companies who attend cattle fairs and call upon people who export any form of produce.  Let him ascertain how many represent the B. and I. Line or the Coast Lines, the London, Midland and Scottish, and the Great Western, and when he has that information, having regard to the number of people who are acting for these three big British shipping and railway companies, I think he will change his mind on the extent to which competition is supposed to exist with cross-Channel trade here.  If there was no competition, there would be no necessity for having something like 100 agents representing the three companies I referred <Col N="388" /> to.  I think the Deputy will get evidence to convince him in that respect without going very far.  Deputy Flinn referred to the question of rebates, and suggested that rates were being charged different from the book rates agreed to by the conference which controls railway and shipping rates in this country.  Deputy Flinn is a public representative and, like other Deputies, he has a public responsibility to discharge.  I suggest that the Deputy will be discharging what is obviously a public responsibility if he puts before the House, and on its records, the information which he says he has with regard to that matter.  He will be doing a public duty, and I think it is up to him to discharge that duty, by giving any information which he has.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy O'Hanlon will agree to withdraw the motion until Deputies have had an opportunity of reading the report, which, I presume, will be before them in the near future, of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, dealing with the whole question.  Deputy Flinn referred to people who came into the shipping world in order that they might be bought out.  As far as I know, the people who are at the back of this motion are the people who purchased a ship for the purpose of carrying traffic for their own convenience, thinking it would be more economic for them to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has dropped into the error that a number of others dropped into, in stating that a certain association is behind this motion.  This is my motion. There are no cattle traders or members of any other association behind it.  I want to make that plain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read an interview given by a representative of the Cattle Traders Exporters' Association that appeared in this day's &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; one would be led to believe that a certain cattle organisation, or certain representatives of the cattle trade were behind it.  I accept Deputy O'Hanlon's statement, but the fact is that certain people who were directly associated <Col N="389" /> with the export of cattle purchased a ship some years ago.  They claimed to be very patriotic Irishmen, but it was only a short time after they had purchased that ship that they sold their interest to another shipping company, one of the so-called foreign shipping companies.  Deputy Byrne says that the British and Irish Steampacket Company is not an Irish shipping company.  Well, I think that the Irish manager of that concern would like Deputy Byrne and Deputy Hennessy to believe that he is really more Irish than the Irish themselves.  In any case the company is called the British and Irish Steampacket Company, and they bought out the ship that was purchased by a combine of cattle traders for the purpose of under-cutting cattle rates.  Why did these patriotic Irishmen sell the ship they were using for the purpose of carrying on the cattle trade with the other side, at rates below those then in existence?  The real cause of the failure of attempts to establish really Irish shipping companies of that kind is due to the fact that people who start these small shipping companies fail to realise that return cargoes from the other side are the only means whereby they can undercut the existing rates of the big combine.  Any people interested in the future of an Irish shipping company will have to realise that that is one of the great problems to be faced if the Irish companies are going to be formed with any chance of success.</P>

      <P>I think with Deputy Davin that this motion is badly drafted and ought to be withdrawn for the present.  When Deputy O'Hanlon was introducing the motion, he made a speech which would leave certain members of the House under a completely wrong impression. He brought in the question of moving the cattle market down to <Col N="390" /> the North Wall.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware of it or not, but an enormous number of cattle and sheep that are shown in the cattle market come by road to the North Circular Road, and it would be extremely awkward to have cattle and sheep driven in the first instance to the North Wall.  It might also be very inconvenient for the Dublin victuallers.  I do not know why the Deputy decided to word the resolution as he did.  The Deputy also attacked the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  He was evidently completely misinformed.  He said the Dublin Port and Docks Board had put every obstacle in the way of any other shipping company getting facilities, such as are given to the firms already in existence.  That is absolutely incorrect.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board is there to further the trade of Dublin, and through Dublin the trade of Ireland.  The Deputy also mentioned the case of &ldquo;The Brussels,&rdquo; and said that when that ship was purchased for the export of cattle and sheep from Dublin the Port and Docks Board put every obstacle in the way, by refusing to give her a berth, and in every way discouraged the project.  That also was absolutely incorrect.  They gave her a berth.  When the owners of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; said that the berth was rather inconvenient as their stock had to walk so many hundred yards down to the yard, they were given another berth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving the Deputy my impression of his speech. They gave &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; another berth opposite where the owners of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; had a yard.  They spent between £6,000 and £8,000 in making that berth in the Liffey near the Custom House available at all times of the tide for &ldquo;The Brussels.&rdquo; Well, now &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; as an economic proposition failed, and it failed because, as Deputy Davin said, it could not get return freights.  It was then sold to the British and Irish.  The Port and Docks Board <Col N="391" /> had nothing whatever to do with that.  I just want to mention that the Port and Docks Board gave every possible facility, and spent an enormous amount of money in helping the trade established, or proposed to be established, by the owners of &ldquo;The Brussels.&rdquo;  There is no doubt, to my mind, as a member of the cattle trade, that the suggested lairage to which people could send their cattle to anybody they liked would be an advantage to the trade.  I think, however, that we ought to wait until we receive the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  Like Deputy Davin, I suggest that Deputy O'Hanlon should withdraw his motion for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before expressing an opinion on the appeal made to me there are just a few points that I would like to clear up.  I will deal first of all with the question of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; referred to by Deputy Leonard.  What I said with regard to the Port and Docks Board and the question of the berthage of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; was that were it not for the fact that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce had several representatives on the Port and Docks Board at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Deputy that the Chamber of Commerce has not representatives on the Port and Docks Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to say was that when the Dublin Corporation was in existence, it had seven or eight representatives on the Port and Docks Board, and were it not for those representatives those who usually conduct the business of the Port and Docks Board would have obstructed the owners of &ldquo;The Brussels&rdquo; in getting a berth.  At present no representatives are nominated on behalf of the Corporation, and I believe that the Commissioners rarely attend the meetings of the Port and Docks Board, so that the Port and Docks Board is, to all intents and purposes, in the hands of those who run the combine.  I do not withdraw one word of that.  The <Col N="392" /> main object of Deputy Good in intervening in the debate was to defend the rights of Coast Lines.  In the course of my speech, in opening the debate, I do admit that I lapsed in mentioning the name of a particular gentleman.  I had referred to him in the earlier part of my speech as the representative of Coast Lines. I was quoting from a newspaper where the Minister for Finance had referred to him by name, and, unfortunately, in reading from the quotation I continued on and mentioned his name instead of just saying the representative of Coast Lines.  In my opening speech, I said that Coast Lines were not giving any return to this country in the way of income tax, and I adhere to that.  I also said that this combine was a monopoly that was making its business out of the farmers of Ireland and was not making any adequate return to this State for the money it was getting out of it.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to make a long speech in replying on this motion. This motion, as Deputies are aware, was on the Order Paper for 13 months.  It was a disappointment to me that I did not get an opportunity of moving it earlier, but I wish to say now that I am more than pleased that I did not get that opportunity, and that the motion was not squeezed in between other motions, because I am afraid, if that had occurred, less time would have been given to it than it has actually received. Members from all sides of the House have expressed opinions favourable to the motion.  I think that if I had achieved nothing else by putting down the motion except to draw forth these unanimous expressions of opinion, thereby focussing attention on the indifference shown to our main industry in this particular matter, I would have done a great deal.</P>

      <P>As I have said, members on all sides of the House, and belonging to every Party, have expressed opinions favourable to the motion.  They have done that, but I <Col N="393" /> may say that I am not looking for any kudos for myself.  I moved the motion on behalf of the farmers of the Free State and on behalf of the finances of the Free State, and I am satisfied with the results that I have obtained.  I am, however, not quite satisfied with the attitude which the Minister for Industry and Commerce adopted towards the motion. He said that he was to meet yesterday the members of the Cattle Traders' Association.  I may say that, in moving the motion, I did not care one crack of my finger about the Cattle Traders' Association.  I look, first of all, to the producers, the farmers of this country who produce the animal.  I want him to get as much profit out of what he produces as possible.  I want the State to get every halfpenny of money that can be realised out of the sale of animals on the other side, so as to help to rectify our trade balance, and, as far as possible, make it favourable to this country.  But, as regards the parties who come in between these two interests, I care nothing.  They are well able to look after themselves. The money which the cattle traders, and other people who come in between these interests, make comes out of the farmers' pocket. He is the man that I represent.  Deputy Good sneers at country representatives. Let me tell the Deputy that if the farmers in my county and the farmers of Ireland generally downed tools for one month they would soon leave Deputy Good hungry.</P>

As long as I represent a country constituency I will not allow Deputy Good or any gentleman in the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to make little of the people who sent me here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appeal that has been made to me to withdraw this motion has come from various parts of the <Col N="394" /> House, and come in good faith.  I do not want to close my ears to that appeal.  I am prepared to withdraw the motion on one condition.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said he was prepared to have a conference between the Cattle Traders' Association, his own Department and the railway people and the shippers.  I am not satisfied with that.  That suggests to me that you might as well try to play Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. Where is the Minister for Agriculture?  The Minister speaks on almost every subject that comes up here, and speaks very cleverly, but here is a matter of prime importance dealing with the agricultural industry and involving a sum of £20,000,000 a year to the country, and yet we have not heard a word from the Minister for Agriculture on it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce confined his speech to statements that were made in the Seanad.  I want to say that was no reply to any statement made in my speech.  The Minister was under the delusion that I was briefed by the Cattle Traders' Association and that the case made in the Seanad was the case made here.  My case is quite a different case to that made in the Seanad.  Until the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells me, and tells the House, that he is going to confer with the Minister for Agriculture when dealing with a matter affecting the agricultural industry, such as this, then I will not be satisfied that the matter has been dealt with in a proper way.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech did not attempt to refute one of the statements I made in regard to the conditions under which veterinary inspections are carried out at the Port of Dublin or in other ports in the country.</P>
    <P>He must not be aware of the conditions, and he did not bring in the Minister for Agriculture to say what the conditions are and whether they are satisfactory.  I put this to the Minister for Fisheries, who is the only Minister present: Is the Government satisfied that the £20,000,000 worth of live stock leaving this <Col N="395" /> country are leaving it under the best possible conditions, and, if not, are they going to take steps to ensure that they are?  I want an assurance that all the Departments will be brought in to consider this important question.  I believe I have the House behind me in this matter.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question on private notice this morning relative to the grave dispute that has arisen on the Great Southern Railways.  I raise the matter because it is important and urgent and in order to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce an opportunity of making any further statement he may consider it advisable to make.  I understand that he has seen a deputation representative of the Unions concerned since I asked the question this morning.  I think the House should know that there is a serious dislocation of the <Col N="396" /> railway service threatened, and is most likely to occur, I understand, if the Railway Company persists in the attitude which they appear to have taken up with regard to the matter in dispute.  I understand that the men in the railway shops at the Broadstone and Inchicore since 1922 have been working under certain terms which were arrived at by way of conference at which the Unions concerned and the Railway Companies were represented, under the chairmanship of a gentleman appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the merits of the case.  Terms were arrived at by agreement.  I am suggesting that if new terms are to be made, naturally the only thing to do is to have a similar conference to that which fixed the previous terms.  The principle of negotiation under which the terms were arrived at by the conference is, I think, one that should commend itself to all parties.  I am only pointing out the position as I understand it.  That is what the railway company have refused to do.  They have posted up a notice fixing certain terms without conference or negotiation, and have in fact said to the men: &ldquo;Go in on Monday morning and work on these terms and if not you need not go to work.&rdquo;  That, to my mind, is equivalent to a lock out. I am only asking the Minister if he would use the good services of his Department to arrange for a conference similar to that which in 1922 fixed the terms which were agreed to <Col N="397" /> and have been operative since.  I do not want to discuss the merits of the actual dispute.</P>
      <P>I only want to suggest to the Minister that the proper way, it seems to me, of preventing the dispute would be to have a conference similar to the one which fixed the agreement in 1922, and that the Minister should use his good offices to bring about such a conference, and should be present at the conference or be represented at it.  No party in the country wants the trouble which would be likely to arise if the matter is not settled amicably.  I am only suggesting that no effort should be spared to see that an amicable settlement of whatever matters are in dispute should be arrived at.  I do not profess to know the merits of the matter in dispute, but I am urging that steps should be taken to see that there should be negotiation in the proper form in regard to the matter, and that any such notices as have been posted up should be withdrawn or suspended until such conference will have the opportunity of coming to an arrangement.</P>

      <P>I beg to join with Deputy O'Connell in urging on the Minister the desirability of bringing about negotiations between the company and the shopmen concerned in this dispute.  He is already familiar with the details, so there is no necessity to go into them.  There is a crisis threatened on Monday morning if the men do not accept terms which, I believe, are most unreasonable. The non-acceptance of these terms means a lock-out, and no one knows to what extent that may develop. I impress on the Minister the desirability of interesting himself with a view to bringing about negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in appealing for the immediate intervention of the Minister in regard to the pending crisis.  The existing conditions of service, so far as they apply to the shop men, were brought about, as Deputy O'Connell has stated, as a result of negotiations between representatives of the men and the directors <Col N="398" /> and management of the railway company, and by a subsequent arbitration by Mr. James MacNeill, the present Governor-General.  I suggest that any alteration or amendment of the existing conditions of service should be brought about in the same way, that is, by proper negotiation and, if necessary, under a neutral chairman.  If there is any future for the railways of this country it is by having a good co-operative spirit existing between the workmen and the management and directors.  In my opinion, the action of the Board in posting up notices without previous consultation with the Union representing the men is rather provocative. I do not wish in any way to enter into the merits of the dispute or the action of the directors in taking steps to effect certain reductions or alterations in the present conditions of service, but I am of opinion that the immediate intervention of the Department of Industry and Commerce is called for.  I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to bring the parties together under a neutral chairman, or a representative of his own Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious situation that has arisen at the Broadstone and Inchicore, and which will affect approximately 2,600 men, I think it is the bounden duty of the Department of Industry and Commerce to intervene.  In 1922, when a dispute was settled, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Joe McGrath, set up a tribunal which was composed of a representative of the Company and a representative of the men, with Mr. MacNeill as chairman.  It was decided that if no decision could be reached so far as the three were concerned the chairman would make an award.  The chairman, Mr. MacNeill, made the award and the employees have abided by the terms of that award.  Very often we hear from the Government and Independent Benches how prone men are to take strike action.  I would point out, so far as this dispute is concerned, that if any serious situation <Col N="399" /> arises by the Company persisting in their attitude that will be the fault of the Company by locking out the men and not allowing them to continue work under the arrangement in operation.  What the railway company propose amounts to a reduction of from twelve to eighteen shillings per week in the wages of the men.  In view of that, and seeing that the MacNeill award was made as a result of a tribunal set up by the Minister's Department, I think it is the bounden duty of the Minister to convene a conference at which a representative of his Department would be present, as well as a representative of the men and a representative of the company. During the time these negotiations are taking place, I also hold it is the duty of the Minister to see that the notices are either withdrawn or suspended to let the negotiations take place in an amicable way.</P>
