      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state the reasons for refusing to pay unemployment insurance benefit to Thomas Dunne, Green Road, Newbridge, Co. Kildare, Serial Book No. 577, Newbridge Office, who lodged a claim to benefit on the 7th May, 1929, and whether he will expedite payment.</P>

      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit made by Mr. Thomas Dunne on the 7th May last was disallowed under the first part of Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as amended, because no contribution had been paid for him in the 1927-28 insurance year, and less than twelve contributions have since been paid.  Mr. Dunne appealed against the decision to the Court of Referees which, having considered the case, recommended that the claim should be disallowed, a recommendation with which the insurance officer agreed. The claim, accordingly, remains disallowed, and Mr. Dunne is disqualified by the section mentioned from receiving unemployment benefit until not less than twelve contributions have been paid for him subsequent to the 1927-28 insurance year.</P>

Perhaps what the Deputy refers to is the contributions to his credit in Great Britain &mdash;he worked in Great Britain in that period&mdash;but, as the Deputy is aware, we have a separate account here for each employee, and Mr. Dunne's account here is only credited with the stamps paid in the Saorstát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland (for Dr. O'Dowd)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that James Smyth, of Blackloon, Mantua, Co. Roscommon, was refused an old age pension on appeal on the grounds that he had not attained the statutory age necessary for the receipt of a pension, namely, seventy years; if he is further aware that the same applicant was refused sickness benefit by the Co. Roscommon Insurance Society on the grounds that he was over seventy years of age; and if in view of the hardship inflicted on this man he will order an immediate investigation by the Departments concerned into the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>An appeal was decided in this case on the 11th June, 1929, when it was determined that the claimant was not entitled to an old age pension.  The evidence included a letter stating that the County Roscommon Insurance Society had disallowed a claim for sick benefit on the ground that Mr. Smyth was over 70 years of age.  It appears that when joining the Insurance Society <Col N="1691" /> Mr. Smyth gave the date of his birth as 20th June, 1856.  He did not, however, apply for an old age pension until May, 1928, and he did not then furnish any definite evidence as to his age.  He stated he was married on the 4th of April, 1882; but, on the particulars furnished, no record was found of his marriage in the official Marriage Register. He was visited by an inspector of the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the 12th of March, 1929, who went thoroughly into his case.  On the evidence submitted, and in view of the terms of the inspector's report, it could not be held that the claimant fulfilled the statutory condition as to age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to become of this man?  The Insurance Society, which comes under the Department of Industry and Commerce, declares that the man is over seventy, and therefore they refused him sickness benefit&mdash;they say he is too old to get benefit to which he would be otherwise entitled&mdash;and, on the other hand, the Department of Local Government and Public Health say that the man is not old enough to qualify for an old age pension.  There really should be some consultation between Departments in a case of this nature.  The man is either entitled to an old age pension or else he is eligible for benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts.  It is not fair to this man to allow him to fall between two stools.  Has the Minister anything to say on this matter?  Is he prepared to have a consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce with the object of seeing that this man does ultimately receive the benefit he is entitled to?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of arranging between one Department and another.  In so far as the question of a pension is concerned, that is entirely one matter, and the man's age must be proved, at any rate, to my satisfaction.  In so far as this man has a complaint that the Insurance Society will not pay <Col N="1692" /> him benefit because they considered he was over seventy, the attitude of the Society in that case is based upon the man's statement when he joined the Society that he was born in 1856. So far as I know the Society have not had any examination into the accuracy or otherwise of the statement. As far as the pension is concerned, it has been fully inquired into and, to the satisfaction of the different inspectors and myself, it has not been established that the man is seventy years of age now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all.  I have not answered all that is asked in the first question&mdash;that is, question 4&mdash; because I do not think it is in the interests of the company that these matters should be made public.  This company is competing with very powerful rivals in this and other countries.  We hope to transfer it eventually to the farmers.  It is run as a commercial concern, and it is not right that rivals should know all about the position of the company. I have not, therefore, answered all the matters asked in question 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to answer the question fully, because it is the farmers of that district who are supplying the milk out of which the profits are being made, and they are entitled to know whether the creamery is paying as well as other creameries.  I think, therefore, that the farmers of the district are quite entitled to ask for and get that information, or some explanation from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the farmers are concerned, they will not only be entitled to get it, but they will know all about it, when they are buying. They must get the information they require.  Meanwhile, we have to run this concern in competition with concerns elsewhere, and it is not in the interests of this commercial concern that every detail of its business should be known to its rivals.  To permit that would obviously be very bad business.  Libby's would not give any of these details about their own business, and why should the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland? When the farmers are buying it, they will get full information about all the facts.  We are merely holding this in trust in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to ask the House to agree to the amendments which have been proposed in this Bill in the Seanad, and to take up the further consideration of the Bill this day week.  No amendment which has been introduced in the Seanad in any way goes to alter the principles which were contained in the Bill as it left this House.  There is one amendment which I might mention, because, from what I have heard, its tenor seems to have been mistaken by certain persons.  That is amendment 14, which is an amendment to Section 16 of the Bill. That amendment simply means that a person cannot be prosecuted under Section 16 because of something contained in a book or paper which was a mere advertisement of a book which might advocate birth control. That is to say, that a person cannot be prosecuted if the advertisement merely mentions the name of a book.  If an advertisement states that there are such and such books in existence, well, that will not be the subject matter for a prosecution under Section 16.  But if an advertisement in itself becomes an advocacy of birth control, then of course a prosecution will lie.  The mere naming, the mere setting down of a list of books for sale, some of which may contain an advocacy of birth control, is not in itself an advocacy of birth control, whereas if there is in the advertisement of the book anything of that kind, then a prosecution will lie.  I propose to take up the consideration of these amendments from the Seanad this day week.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, gave us an explanation as to why it is proposed to reduce the membership of the Railway Tribunal from three to one, but he did not give us a clear explanation as to why it is proposed that the one member should be appointed from year to year instead of for a five years' period.  There was one sentence in his remarks, as they appeared in the Official Report, which implied that the Government were contemplating the termination of the existence of the Railway Tribunal within five years from the passing of this Bill, and that that is why this year-to-year appointment was necessary.  I would be glad if the Minister would make the position clear in that respect.</P>

      <P>No, there is no well-founded intention on the part of the Executive Council to have the Railway Tribunal disappear within a five years' period.  The Executive Council simply wishes to have the position this, that if at any time within that period it appears that there is no work which would require even one member of the Railway Tribunal to sit, then the Railway Tribunal as a whole may disappear. But there is no decision&mdash;there is not even a forecast of a decision&mdash;that the Railway Tribunal as a whole should cease to function.  This is only to enable the situation to be dealt with inside the five years' period if it should appear that there was no necessity for any member of the Railway Tribunal to act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A &ldquo;well-founded intention&rdquo; is one where an explanation had been given by the Minister in charge of the railway situation that circumstances were likely to arise inside the five years' period which would lead to the disappearance of the Railway Tribunal.  I think Deputies are inclined to suspect that there is much more in this Bill than what meets the eye.  There is nothing in it except what is on the face of it. The position is that if there was not an amending Bill such as this the Executive Council would be faced with the necessity in August of this year either of removing the Railway Tribunal completely or of appointing three members for five years.  There is no reason to believe that it will be necessary to appoint three members for five years.  We want elasticity in two ways: we want elasticity either to reduce the number on the tribunal or to reduce the term of office of any of the three members from a stated five years' period to a year-to-year period.  A decision will be taken when the circumstances become clearer.  I could not say the last day that the Executive Council had taken this decision, but it is quite clear to me that I will not make any representation to the Executive Council to reduce the members of the Railway Tribunal until, for instance, standard charges have been prepared.</P>

      <P>The last day the Estimate was under consideration I was referring to the Black Scab Order as it affected the farmers in Cooley area.  I spoke at considerable length, and dealt with the circumstances from every angle, and I confidently expect that the Minister will be in a position to do something in the near future to mitigate some of the losses suffered by the people of that district. Since the question was raised here, the people have received letters from all over the country asking for quotations for their potatoes.  It is a great hardship that they are not allowed to dispose of the surplus crop.  What they ask the Minister to do is to isolate the farms on which black scab has been discovered, in view of the fact that the major portion of the area has been found to be immune from black scab altogether, and to allow the potatoes out on licence to institutions.  By these means it would be possible for the farmers to dispose of the potatoes left on their hands when the English market closes.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something for the people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are a section of the community known to be thrifty and industrious, and they have not asked for much during the last ten or fifteen years. They managed to keep things going at great loss to themselves, but they feel that the time has now arrived when they are not in a position to continue growing potatoes, except the Department comes to their aid by doing something in the way of letting them get out the potatoes, especially that portion of the crop that seems to be left on their hands at the end of each season.  During the last few years various suggestions have been made as to how they could dispose of the crop, but they seem to think they would be in a position to do so if only the Department would not put too many obstacles in the way.  They feel that the time has arrived when the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1703" /> should do something for that district.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter in all its phases, and if possible to come to some amicable arrangement that will be satisfactory both to the potato growers there and to the officials of the Department.  If agreement could be arrived at, it would be the means of setting a dispute that has been going on for ten or eleven years between the Department and the people of Cooley. With a little good-will on both sides I am sure it will be possible to control the disease without imposing the order on the area as a whole.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to give some hope to these people that something will be done in the near future to mitigate the losses they have suffered for the last ten or eleven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring a few points to the notice of the Minister with regard to the licensing of bulls.  In March and April of this year inspectors from the Department went around to the different stations inspecting bulls.  In a number of cases the bulls were rejected, and quite rightly.  My grievance is that down in my locality about 80 bulls were inspected, 30 per cent. of which were rejected.  I sent two bulls for inspection, and both passed as being up to the standard.  A fortnight afterwards I got a licence from the Department for one bull, which I kept on my farm for the use of my stock.  In the meantime I had entered one bull for auction by Marsh's.  I wrote to the Department for a licence, but they had not the courtesy to reply.  I mentioned in my letter that one of the bulls was going to Marsh's sale.  I would like to know the reason why a licence was not sent on, or what was the motive for withholding it. I got the licence a fortnight after the sale.  I think that is a very mean way of treating people.  Last year several bulls passed the inspection, and when they were sent to the sale ring at Marsh's, at considerable <Col N="1704" /> expense, they were rejected by the inspector sent down by the Department. I would like to know from the Minister the reason or the motive for withholding the licence in the case to which I referred and sending it in the other case.</P>

      <P>About a fortnight afterwards, as well as I can remember. During the discussion Deputy Daly mentioned Moore Park, a large estate that is at present in the Government's hands.  There are over a thousand acres there that were formerly held by the British military. They were handed over to the present Government about ten years ago and have been practically lying idle since.  The Deputy advocated the establishment of an agricultural college in the district.  I wish to inform the Minister that practically all the farmers in that locality are model farmers.  I would not like to be the Deputy who would stand up in Kilworth and advocate an agricultural college.  My wish is to have this land divided into small holdings for landless men and the uneconomic holders of Kilworth and the surrounding districts.  From my experience of agricultural colleges, there is nothing impossible to them.  They are the greatest authors of all time.  They are what I call chaotic instructors; they can turn day into night; in fact they can put two tails on a cat. Nothing but confusion will be created if an agricultural college is set up in that district.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to labourers or any other class.  I would like to see the land of Ireland tilled and producing food for the poor and starving people.  I would like to impress upon the Minister the necessity for having limekilns set up throughout the country.  Since limekilns ceased to work a number of diseases have sprung up amongst cattle, especially young stock.  I find it almost impossible to rear pedigree calves from pedigree bulls.  Anybody who visited the Dublin Show would come to the conclusion&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; that we have the finest cattle in the world.  I was at a fair in Fermoy recently and I was rather surprised at the class of young cattle shown there.  We have been led to believe that the cattle in this country are improving.  In my opinion, the cattle are not improving to a degree corresponding with the amount of money that is being spent on the purchase of highly bred animals.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a good thing for the farmers of the country if they bred their own bulls, rams, sows and pigs.  As far as I can see, the bulls that belong to the Department of Agriculture, and that are being sent around the country, are most unprolific.  They are spreading a lot of disease, such as abortion and white scour.  I think all that could be remedied if the Minister would take more interest in the welfare of the farmers of the country, and if he would go around to the fairs himself and see whether there has been an improvement in the cattle of the country or not.  I suggest to him that he would gain a good deal of experience if he did that, and that something might be done in the way of getting suitable cattle for the different areas.  I hope that the Minister, when replying, will deal with the questions that I have raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two small points that I want to raise.  There are two classes of servants in the Department of Agriculture that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to.  I think they <Col N="1706" /> suffer under a certain grievance.  The first class I want to refer to are the agricultural overseers.  There are fifty-two of them employed in the congested areas entirely.  I do not know any body of men under the Department who give more useful service of a special kind than these agricultural overseers.  It is difficult to expect that these men will continue to do the useful work they are doing at the remuneration set out here for them.  Their salaries are set down at from £70 to £120 in the case of unmarried men, and at from £85 to £140 in the case of married men. The bonus, I take it, has to be added to that.  But, even adding the bonus, I think it will be admitted that the remuneration they are being paid is very poor.  I do not know, but perhaps the Minister will tell me, whether in addition to their salary they are allowed travelling expenses. My own impression is that they are not.  If that is the case, then their grievance is all the greater.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into this and see if the remuneration for these useful public servants could not be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other class that I want to refer to are the veterinary inspectors. It has been represented to me that it is the practice of the Department, in the case of these officers, to continue them in an unestablished capacity for quite a number of years&mdash; in some cases for fifteen and twenty years.  That is done despite the fact that these officers are in the service of the Department all the time.  At the end of twenty years they are put on the establishment, and it is only then they become entitled to a pension.  The position, therefore, is this: that a person with thirty years' service may have only ten years' service that will count for pension purposes.  If that is the case, I think it ought to be remedied. I can see no object whatever in keeping a fully-qualified whole-time officer in an unestablished capacity.  I quite recognise, of course, that this is perhaps more a matter for the Department of Finance than for the Department of Agriculture. I think it should be the duty <Col N="1707" /> of the Minister for Agriculture to make very strong representations to the Department of Finance on this matter in the interests of the efficiency of his own Department. There may be a necessity for a period of probation for say a year or two.  A fully qualified officer, however, should not be obliged to undergo a probationary period of more than one year, or two years at the outside.  If at the end of that time he is found satisfactory, then I think he is entitled to be put on the establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy O'Connell's appeal for consideration for the veterinary inspectors. We remember, a couple of years ago, when the foot-and-mouth disease broke out in Wexford, the great praise that was given to the veterinary branch of the Department of Agriculture.  I think that men who were able to deal with a situation like that should at least get the same treatment as a lot of people who do nothing except just write to each other in the different Government offices.  I think that the veterinary branch is one of the most important services in the State, and that the men who are attached to it should be put on as good a basis as any other public servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the problem that exists in the Cooley district regarding the operation of the Black Scab Order.  If the Minister examines what has happened in the Cooley area, it will provide a good lesson for him, because he will find that the growing of one crop, and that crop for a foreign market, has brought ruin to that district.  If his policy in connection with summer dairying meets with the same obstacles as the farmers in the Cooley area have met with recently, there will be, I fear, a general national collapse.  There is an absolute economic collapse in the Cooley district at present.  The farmers there till practically all their land. There is no grass there, and if there is one class of farmer in the country that deserves support from the <Col N="1708" /> Minister for Agriculture, it is such a class of farmer as you have in that area.  As far as I can see, the Department of Agriculture has done nothing except to enforce the Black Scab Order that applies to that area.  Let it be granted that it was necessary to prohibit the export of potatoes from Cooley to other districts in the country for the safety of the rest of the growers throughout the country.  Even granting that, the farmers in the Cooley district have a legitimate grievance as to the method adopted for the enforcement of that Order.</P>
    <P>First of all, they are prohibited from exporting potatoes from that area.  While prohibited from doing that, they were allowed to export cabbages, turnips, mangolds and other root crops for a great number of years.  Suddenly a prohibition Order against the export of these products was clapped on a couple of years ago without any warning being given and without anything being done to help the farmers in that district.  I believe it is a wrong method for the farmers in Cooley district to be depending on one crop, particularly when that crop is to be exported to England.  I am not one of those who agree with the Minister's statement that our present system of farming is the result of the accumulated wisdom of 500 years.</P>
    <P>It has been proved all over the world that farmers are behind the times; that, speaking generally, they have not combined as regards methods of research, as other industries have done and have been doing intensively for the last twenty years. I believe that the Cooley farmers should get away from the growing of one crop for England, and I appeal to the Minister to help them in that. There has been established in Athlone a factory which manufactures potatoes into glucose and other byproducts. I think the proper place to have such a factory established is in a district which gives a return of 20 tons to the acre, instead of a district like Athlone, where, I am sure, the maximum would be eight tons, even on very good land.</P>
    <Col N="1709" />
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be too sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my opinion, and I think I am nearly right.  Anyway, I think the district around Cooley is eminently suitable for such a factory, and the Minister should endeavour to have one established there, particularly as for the safety of the rest of the farmers he has prohibited the export of potatoes from the district.  When the foot and mouth disease came along, some cattle had to be destroyed in the interests of the rest of the community, and compensation was given to the farmers who owned the cattle that were destroyed.  This year, in Cooley district, thousands of tons of potatoes have either gone to waste or have been sold at 1/- per cwt.  That was a great loss to the farmers there.  I think the Minister should take some special steps to deal with the situation, just as he took extreme steps to deal with the situation in Wexford when the foot and mouth disease occurred, and compensated the farmers for the cattle that had to be destroyed.</P>
      <P>There are several things the Minister could do without finding out how many tons of potatoes went to loss or were sold under value.  I think that would be the wrong way from the national point of view. He could set up an experimental farm in that district where 90 per cent. of the land is tilled, and experiments could be carried out in the growing of other crops which would not come under the prohibition of the Black Scab Order, crops such as peas and beans, and raspberries and other fruit.  The establishment of such a farm there would enable the Minister to find out the most suitable variety of crops for growing in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He could also have a scheme whereby there would be loans given to farmers who would grow a quarter of an acre and upwards of these crops.  I myself think that an advance of around £40 per acre, that is, £10 for a rood of ground, would cover the planting of most of those crops, and it would get away from <Col N="1710" /> the existing situation.  They do not know what the position may be next year.  They may get a better price for their produce in Dundalk than they would in England, or they may be as badly hit next year as they are this year.  One thing that can be done is to encourage the farmers to change over a portion of their land to other crops, and another is to get a method of dealing with the main potato crop which will get over this Black Scab Order. There are two ways in which that can be done.  One is by the establishment of a glucose factory; and the other the establishment of a potato chip factory.  The potato chip business is a growing trade.  A number of hotels and institutions, instead of making their own chips, buy them half cooked.  These are matters to which, I think, the Minister should give consideration.  I call attention again to the lesson that is to be learned by him from the catastrophe that has occurred in Cooley from depending altogether on a foreign market.  If the Cooley farmers could get a sale in the home market they would be all right.  Instead of producing altogether for export, we should try to build up our home market.  That is the only security.  If we continue the Minister's policy of concentrating on the foreign market and let the home market go to pot, the whole nation will find itself some day in the situation of the Cooley farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to draw attention. I have not listened to the debate on this Vote, but I understand that several speeches have been delivered, and notably one from the Fianna Fáil Benches by Deputy Gorry.  I read that speech, and I must say that while it did not introduce a lot of new matter, it did introduce a very healthy and desirable tone into this debate.  I want to touch on the question of barley and home-grown foodstuffs, and to try and come down to something practical.  It is all very well to say: grow barley in Leix and Offaly and find a market for it in Monaghan or in the Six Counties, or in West <Col N="1711" /> Cork.  It is also easy to say, grow barley in Kilkenny, as we have been doing, and try and find a market for it in West Cork.  We know that the stuff cannot be carried from any of these centres to Monaghan or West Cork at less than 3/6 or 4/- per barrel, with the result that the thing becomes a joke, and certainly would not be profitable or recompense the growers of barley in comparison with the yield from other foodstuffs. In North Kilkenny we grow barley, and in South Kilkenny, near Waterford, we are great feeders of pigs, but the people who feed the pigs grow none of their own foodstuffs. They have been accustomed for a long period, if not all their lives, to feeding the pigs with Indian meal. I put it to the Minister and to the County Committees of Agriculture that the county instructors should be asked, now that we have passed the experimental stage, to give a demonstration of the mixtures that have proved satisfactory.  Half-a-dozen parishes in my county turn out 300 to 350 pigs a week.  A demonstration could be given in one or two of those parishes, and that would make a market right at the doors of the growers.  The same could be done in many other areas. There is no use asking people to grow barley at 15/- or 17/- per barrel and pay 3/6 or 4/- a barrel for freightage. It is not a paying proposition. There is no use in holding out hopes to growers in a direction that would never materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter. It is, perhaps, introducing a new topic, but I do not know any Department that could deal with it except the Department of Agriculture.  For the last twelve or fifteen months several Press campaigns have been run in England attacking the price of produce, especially bacon.  So far did that campaign go in advising customers not to buy at the current price that three or four big slumps took place in the price of our agricultural produce and, incidentally, of English produce.  I could understand a campaign to reduce the price <Col N="1712" /> of any particular foodstuff provided all the factors of the case were taken into consideration, but when the factors are not taken into consideration, when you merely attack the producer through the curer, without having regard to the price of feeding stuffs or the other factors which contribute to the cost of production, then I think that the matter is not treated fairly.  I quite agree that the people who write these articles think they are doing the best, but they are not taking all the facts into consideration. During the last four or five months that campaign has reduced the pig population of Ireland by 50 per cent.  We have now only 100 pigs coming into a fair when we had 200 four or five months ago, all through this campaign of knocking down prices indiscriminately without regard to the other circumstances. The same thing applies in England. I think that representation should be made from an authoritative quarter, such as the Department here or the English Department, or both, to the Press concerned not to indulge in these campaigns without taking all the facts into consideration.  It is true that circulation is the great object in journalism, and that a campaign attacking the price of a popular foodstuff would increase the circulation more than, say, a health campaign or a campaign directed against over-indulgence in cigarette smoking or amusement.  Such campaigns would not be nearly so popular.</P>
    <P>I also wish to direct attention to a speech delivered here which dealt with the question of cross-bred cattle. There were also speeches delivered down the country and an agitation got up in some counties, especially Kerry, in connection with this question. We have to make up our minds about this question.  We have either to maintain our present dairy foundation for our live stock or we have not.  I did a little travelling lately in connection with the Sligo-Leitrim election.  Anybody with any knowledge of agriculture travelling round, either by train or motor, could not help being struck by the number of cross-bred cows in every herd.  I <Col N="1713" /> have seen a herd of seven cows with four or five cross-breds in it; a herd of five cows with three cross-breds, and a herd of fourteen with eight cross-breds.  You find that all the way through the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in Kinlough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think Kinlough was not the worst.  This is really a serious matter.  Great efforts have been made by the Department to put into the County Sligo a very high-class dairy Shorthorn, but so much is the attraction of the cross-bred to the ordinary farmer when he goes with his cow to the bull that he passes a dairy Shorthorn bull and goes five or six miles perhaps to an Aberdeen Angus bull.  There is no doubt, of course, that the ordinary cross-bred store, especially the bullock, is of much more value and often very much easier to market than the Shorthorn bullock.  But that does not apply at all to heifers.  A Shorthorn heifer is of infinitely more value at present, on account of the shortage here and on the other side, than a black heifer.  Of course, the Department would be very well advised to get on with the question of controlling the sex of animals.  I think the time is ripe for them to see what they can do in that direction.  I suppose if we could guarantee that all the calves of Shorthorn bulls would be heifers the balance would be maintained, but, while we cannot do that, there must be an iron rule enforced so that our stocks will not disappear.  We either have to maintain the Shorthorn or the Kerry or we have not, and the matter is a serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago an Act was passed with the object of eliminating the cross-bred.  We eliminated the cross-bred bull.  What is the use of that if we still have the cross-bred cow to the extent that I have mentioned?  The same thing would apply to Co. Kerry.  I am not sure that it is not just as big a problem, and just as necessary to get rid of the cross-bred cow as it is to get rid of the cross-bred bull.  Governments, and Departments and Ministers, if they want to do the right <Col N="1714" /> thing for the country, will be unpopular. They will have to do things that perhaps 50 per cent. of the people will not like, because these people may be temporarily getting a little bit more out of the cross-bred store.  But what will be the end of it?  We may find ourselves in a dozen years absolutely without our dairy foundation altogether. It is very much more important that we should retain a proper dairy foundation than that certain Deputies may be able to get elected in particular constituencies. We can do without these particular Deputies, but we cannot do without a proper foundation stock to breed from.  We ought to look at this from a broader standpoint than mere politics, or that a few votes might be turned in favour of a certain party at an election at some time.  What I have said as to cross-breds applies to several other counties&mdash;Mayo, for instance.  In Westmeath and Longford it is a Hereford cross that one notices.  Passing along outside Mullingar, you can see those Hereford cross-breds.  I can see that in the near future, if the people in this country want to preserve a paying dairy strain of cattle, they must be buyers of heifers.  Instead of heifers going across the Channel, they must be brought into this country, and the people must become buyers of heifers and buyers immediately.  I quite admit that any Government Department or Minister has a very grave task to face and not at all a popular task, because the people are not all wise and will not take a long view.</P>
    <P>Several other subjects raised in the debate do not really require to be answered.  We have heard talk that Cruikshank was the originator of the shorthorn breed.  It is forgotten that there were ever people like Booth and Bates.  Then we hear talk about the Canadian climate, that it is like ours.  In what way I wonder is the Canadian climate like ours?  Is it the temperature, the rainfall, or what?  But I do not think these matters are worth replying to and, indeed, perhaps the Minister could spare himself the trouble of replying <Col N="1715" /> to them.  There is one matter that I view with very great concern, and that is any curtailment of technical education in the rural areas, especially with regard to carpentry, because we cannot over-estimate the value of that sort of knowledge to our young farmers.  Every farmer should have a decent knowledge of carpentry; then a man could easily put up a cement building, and we cannot over-estimate the value of that class of work.  Any curtailment of the Estimates in this direction I would view with very great regret indeed.  Everyone knows that the dwellings and buildings of the farmers have been badly laid out. Cleanliness has not been the object in the lay out, and any education that would help the young farmer to make things more habitable on the farm, and that would give a better lay out for his buildings, would be one of the greatest things that we could cultivate in the country.  Any curtailment of the facilities that would make for that I would view with very great regret.  I do hope it will not take place.  This knowledge is as necessary for the healthy life of the ordinary rural area as is primary education.  I hope neither will be curtailed.  Technical education dealing with construction I hope will not be abandoned, but will be put on a different basis and will be very much more developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Aiken and Coburn, in the course of their remarks, made reference to the question of the scheduled areas as far as the County Louth is concerned because of the scab disease in potatoes. I want to make representations on behalf of the scheduled areas in North-West Donegal as far as the disease is concerned.  The Minister for Agriculture has deemed it necessary to schedule the lower and upper Rosses in North-West Donegal.  As far as the potato-growers in these districts are concerned, they are restricted in their choice of seeds by the Department to varieties such as the Champion, Kerr's Pink, Arran Victory, and a few others.  Now, the growers in these particular districts, <Col N="1716" /> from their experience of the seeds supplied by the Department, have come to the conclusion that the seed supplied is not suitable for the district. The soil in the upper and lower Rosses in Donegal is mostly a poor and mossy soil.  The district is situated in the heart of the Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking people are in a very poor position.  The majority of them, owing to the economic conditions under which they live, have to migrate to the potato fields of Scotland.  The people in that area believe that the time has now arrived when the restrictions should be removed and when they should be free to select their own varieties of seeds.  I quite realise that the restrictions are necessary to stamp out the disease.  But it is the opinion of the people who are experts, as far as potato-growing is concerned, in these districts, that the time has arrived when these restrictions should be removed.  If the Minister cannot see his way to remove them, may I suggest that he should attempt to establish in the County Donegal what has already been established in Athlone and is advocated in Louth, a glucose factory.</P>

    <P>Another matter that I would like to refer to is the question of flax growing.  A week or a fortnight ago I asked was the Minister prepared to give a subsidy to the flax growers in Donegal.  As far as Donegal is concerned, flax growing was a very remunerative industry a few years ago, and I believe at the present time there are big possibilities with regard to this industry.  However, the Minister said he was not prepared to give a subsidy, although, as I pointed out, as far as the south was concerned, the Ministry were prepared to give subsidies to creameries and sugar beet in Carlow.  In the Estimate this year, there is a reduction in the amount voted for flax growing of fifty per cent.  Last year the amount was £2,626, and this year the amount is only £1,224.  Apparently, from that, the Minister must have come to the conclusion that there is no great prospect in regard to the development of the flax growing <Col N="1717" /> industry in the County Donegal.  If the Minister has come to that conclusion I submit he must have been misinformed, and I ask him and the officials of his Department to look again into the position, because I believe there are great possibilities for this industry in County Donegal. As I said, I think his Department are not paying enough attention in order to develop that industry, in which there are such great possibilities.</P>
    <P>There is another question that I think comes under the head of this Vote, and that is the question of the importation of bacon.</P>

I notice that, as far as agricultural societies and shows are concerned, the sum of £416 has been voted for prizes at the Royal Dublin Society's shows and the Munster Agricultural Society's shows.  While that sum of £416 is voted as between these, I notice that Connacht and the three Ulster counties in the Free State are left out altogether as far as these prizes are concerned.  That is a matter that I should like the Minister and his Department to give consideration to.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputies O'Connell, Brennan, Aiken and a number of others as to the position of the overseers and veterinary officers in the Department of Agriculture I agree with everything that has been said. Those two classes of officers are amongst the very best officers we have in the Department.  Anyone who goes to the western districts knows the work the agricultural overseers are doing, and the same applies to the veterinary staff.  A competent veterinary staff is more essential in this country than, perhaps, in any other country in the world.  I am clear myself that the status of the staff and their emoluments and general conditions <Col N="1718" /> should not be worse than corresponding officers under the Northern Ministry.</P>
      <P>For a long time I have been, and still am, in communication with the Department of Finance in regard to both of these classes with a view to improving not only their tenure but also their scales of salary and remuneration.  With regard to the points raised by a number of Deputies in connection with the Live Stock Breeding Act, I cannot agree that there has not been an improvement in the cattle of the country. There ought to be an improvement. Obviously, other things being equal, if you are using better bulls&mdash;I am speaking from the point of view of substance and quality, especially substance&mdash;the progeny ought to be better.  As opposed to that policy, what we could do is to use the worst bulls we can cast eyes upon, but we think that you are more likely to get a good calf from a good bull than a good calf from a bad bull. The policy is to try by means of the Live Stock Breeding Act, by means of our agricultural schemes and by means of bringing first-class bulls from Scotland and England, as well as from other countries, into this country to establish a position whereby we would have a large number of good bulls from the point of view of breeding and substance&mdash;exactly the same point of view as that which a farmer takes when he goes to the fair of Limerick or Ballinasloe looking for beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kent said that he did not think much about pedigree bulls. There is a good deal of misunderstanding on that matter.  Some people in the country think all you have got to say is that an animal is good or pedigree to condemn it. People think it is exotic and they often come to the conclusion that it is not Irish.  Sometimes, it is sufficient to crab a bull by saying it is a pedigree bull.  That is stupidity. What is a pedigree animal?  If Deputy Kent started with his own cows, he could in ten years time have his stock in the Herd Book. First of all they have to be inspected by an inspector to see what sort of <Col N="1719" /> backs they have, what sort of quarters, and so forth and he would look for all the points which Deputy Kent would look for when buying a good cow.  If they pass the standard required from the point of view of substance, they would be provisionally chosen, provided they were of a definite type, say, a Shorthorn type. Then they must go to a bull which is in the Herd Book.  If the calves come up to standard in regard to substance they will also go into the Herd Book as pedigree animals.  In other words they will have better looks and more substance.  You will, of course, find a good pedigree cow throwing a bad calf.  Other things being equal, pedigree cows produce better calves.  Pedigree animals produce better meat if that is what is wanted and better milk if they are used in milk-producing areas.  The reason that an animal is not pedigree is because it is not good enough to go into the Herd Book, good enough not from the point of view of a millionaire in America but from the point of view of the ordinary farmer. That being so, the right policy for the Department is to get as many pedigree animals in the country as possible.  If you get such stock, you know that it can go back for generations and that it has plenty of bone and substance.  The Livestock Breeding Act has been in operation for the last four or five years but the full effects of it cannot be seen yet.  It will probably take four or five years longer before you have a large number of two-year-old cattle which will be the progeny of licensed bulls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kent probably knows the farmers who operate the Live Stock Breeding Act in Cork.  There are some of the best commercial farmers in that county, and if they go to a district and scrap 30 per cent. of the bulls they know their business. If the bulls are not up to the standard, they are prevented from breeding, and surely it is in the interest of the live stock industry to see that only the best possible, 60 per cent., will be left.  That has been going on for the last three or four years.  We have been rejecting <Col N="1720" /> between 40 and 50 per cent. of the bulls.  That is a very high standard, but we leave, at least, the better bulls.  We have been consistently increasing the number of animals coming from Scotland, and they come in at the top of the best herds. If that policy is continued intelligently, there is no reason why there should not be a steady, if slow, improvement in live stock.  In regard to the special position mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly in Kerry, it constitutes a special problem, and I do not pretend that in its solution some people will not be hurt and hard hit.  The Kerry cow is a good cow. That is admitted.</P>

      <P>I never make a contentious statement.  That is slightly contentious.  In any case, it is a good cow.  It is a useful cow, not for beef, but for milk, and it has had a lot to do with the comparative prosperity of Kerry.  There is land there as poor as that in the worst parts of Mayo, but much more prosperous, and I think that the Kerry cow has had a lot to do with that. It has been in Kerry for a long time and has survived, and consequently it must be acclimatised and suited to the conditions there.  In 1923-24 we found that the Kerry cow was being bred out.  You would find it hard to get a black.  You had blacks and whites and all sorts of colours as a result of crossing with Aberdeen-Angus, Galloways, Shorthorns, or Herefords.  If you have constant crossing by different breeds for a long time you must breed out in the course of time.  If these bulls were being used as they were in Kerry and were allowed to continue to be so used the Kerry breed would disappear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only dealt with one side of the question, so far.  It is admitted that the problem is there. If there was free use of non-Kerry bulls, the Kerry cow would be bred out.  In farming, I am quite international. I have no predispositions or prejudices, for or against, and I say that this breed was a very valuable Irish breed and was admittedly the salvation of particular districts. Most good judges think that it might be the salvation of other districts, where there are similar conditions, if it were brought there.  That breed was dying, and would die if there was a free use of non-Kerry bulls. What were we to do?  We took power in the Livestock Breeding Act to confine certain areas to Kerry bulls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We only allow Kerry bulls to stand in certain areas which we have defined. They are the mountainous districts, the two peninsulas.  There were certain pockets in these areas where there was good land, and in which shorthorn cattle had been bred successfully.  We made exceptions in the case of these pockets and allowed shorthorn bulls to be used there.  We, of course, met with borderline cases where people claimed the right to have shorthorn bulls and where there was something to be said for their contention that the land was good enough for this class of cattle.  In the borderline cases there was something to be said on the other side.  We decided as best we could, and our decisions, of course, pleased some people and displeased other people.  It might be said that we ought to draw the line more closely.  Anyway we had to draw the line somewhere.  Let us argue that the area we have enclosed was approximately correct.  In that area, only Kerry bulls can be used. If that arrangement be kept up for a certain time, in a short time we can say that the bulls are, in fact, Kerry bulls, and are, in fact, pure bred.  Practically <Col N="1722" /> all the stock will be pure-bred Kerry stock.  There are cross-bred cows there already, for the reasons I have mentioned, but in five, six or ten years all the stock will be pure-bred Kerry stock, and you will have pure-bred Kerry cattle there.  That is what we are aiming at.  The difficulty is this.  There is no doubt that from the point of view of the ordinary commercial farmer a cross-bred animal&mdash;the first cross&mdash;is often better than a pure-bred.  He makes a better bullock.  He is often more vigorous, and so on.  In County Sligo, about which Deputy Gorey spoke some time ago, they get excellent stores bred from shorthorn cows and Aberdeen Angus bulls.  The first cross is fairly virile, but it is equally well known that the second and third crosses go to seed and tend to get weak.</P>
    <P>If you continue an Aberdeen Angus bull with a shorthorn cow and again cross you will get smaller animals lacking bone and weight. That was what was happening in Kerry.  People are now comparing the pure-bred with the first cross which they remember.  We might go back to the conditions which prevailed previously.  It might be said that the farmers know their business best.  If we withdraw our restrictions everybody will be happy for a year or two.  Some patriotic party will come along after five or ten years and say that the Kerry cattle are bred out.  Meantime we are in the transition period.  We find it hard to get really suitable bulls and we have to take all the hard knocks. I suggest that it is our business to stick to our guns and that the best thing we can do is to continue our policy until it becomes either a success or a failure.  It would be most unsatisfactory to drop a policy that is only half tried out.  There is something to be said for letting the Kerry farmer alone.  There would be something to be said for the State interfering in the interests of a special breed which was dying out&mdash;that is what we did in the special areas&mdash;but there can be nothing to be said for taking up the <Col N="1723" /> attitude that we have taken up and then dropping it at the first sign of opposition and before anything was proved or disproved.  The Department intends, so far as it can, to obviate whatever hardships can be obviated and at the same time to go ahead with the policy.  The Deputy mentioned that he was at a fair and saw more red calves than he ever saw.  Whether or not you put a pure-bred bull with these cows, most of them have a shorthorn strain.  The dams might be absolutely black, but because of a shorthorn strain they might have a red calf or black and white calf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not give anything like £30 now for bulls.  I have been speaking on a couple of occasions to buyers from Kerry and one hears both sides.  It depends on their interests.  I have heard plenty of people praising the policy of the Department.  Of course, in a particular district it is perhaps irritating not to be allowed to use any bull that one likes.  People resent it. <Col N="1724" /> The farmer resents the mere fact of being prevented from using any bull he likes.  What does the Deputy want me to do?  If he complains that the bulls are not good enough, that is something and we can meet him on that.  There are many more people breeding Kerry bulls now than formerly and there are many more Kerry bulls for sale.  I had a Kerry bull myself for which I could not get sale.  At the same time, if he does not complain of the general policy and says that the bulls we put in there are not good enough, that is something about which we can meet him.  I do not know whether he is complaining of the general policy or its administration.</P>

      <P>If he is complaining about the general policy, my view is that we should carry out the policy, as if we do not the Kerry breed will disappear.  It might be right to let it disappear.  Personally, I do not think it would be right, but in ten years time the farmers would have very few Kerry bulls.  There would be a very small collection of Kerry bulls and they would be going very high prices for some time.  I think it would be a great advantage to a county like Kerry, which is mainly a dairying county, to have a good stock of milchers, a stock which suits the climate and conditions of the county.  They must suit them or they would not have survived there so long.  Meantime we will try to get the best Kerry bulls we can.  If they do breed an odd red calf what harm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kent spoke of getting two bulls licensed.  He said that he kept one and sent the other up to Marsh's sale in Limerick.  He had written for the licence, and a fortnight afterwards had not received it.  That is one case which the Deputy might have mentioned to me beforehand.  I do not know anything about it, and I could not be expected to know anything about it.  If I had information of the case, I could have looked into it, but the view I put up to him is that it is more than likely that the <Col N="1725" /> staff of the Department could not get the report, first of all, from all the inspectors, and secondly, send out licences for all the bulls in Ireland within a fortnight of the actual inspection. In any case it did not make much difference.  Was he not branded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, my complaint was that these two bulls were passed for licence.  A fortnight afterwards I got the licence for the bull which I have now, but the form for the licence for the bull which I entered for the sale in Marsh's was withheld.  I applied for that licence the week before Marsh's sale came on.  I did not get a reply until the sale was over.  Three weeks after the sale was over the licence was sent on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this question of black scab in potatoes, there are two areas in the Free State where black scab occurs, one in North Louth and the other in Donegal.  There is no great grievance in Donegal, because they never have a surplus of potatoes, as far as I know, but with regard to North Louth there is occasionally a surplus.  There is, I understand, a surplus this year. Everyone knows what our regulations are, that we insist on the planting of immune varieties&mdash;those are varieties immune from black scab, resistent to disease.  We prohibit the sale of potatoes in any market except the British market.  We were able to make arrangements with the British that those potatoes <Col N="1726" /> could get into England.  There is black scab all over England, but with regard to Scotland we could not make that arrangement work. I do not know if there is any black scab there, but if there is, it is controlled. They are as free as they can be.  If we make a regulation that only immune varieties can be grown, nevertheless we must prohibit the sale of diseased potatoes elsewhere in the country if we are to keep the disease within bounds. The disease is highly infectious and is carried not only by the non-immune potatoes, but it is carried by clay or any other matter that attaches to the tubers.  In all varieties of potatoes you get what are known as rogues.  Those are potatoes not true to the type; and within the last year or so we found black scab in what were, in fact, immune varieties, but in rogues, potatoes that were not true to type. For that reason, it is admitted that if we are to prevent the spread of this disease all over the country we must control the sale of these potatoes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn's point is: Is it not sufficient to control the farms on which black scab has been found? We can narrow down the debate to that.  No Deputy has had the temerity to suggest that we should not control the areas where there is black scab.  Everyone admits that the disease is highly infectious and is likely to spread over the country &mdash;as it has, in fact, spread over the North of Ireland&mdash;if we do not control it.  The point made by Deputy Coburn is: confine the regulations to the particular farm where black scab has been found, and also take certain steps to improve the market for these farms.</P>
    <P>There have been, I think, over 150 outbreaks of black scab for the last five or six years.  Black scab was found within recent years in a number of places all over the particular area which we have scheduled.  We have scheduled a small area.  When scheduling the area you must take into account this consideration: that you are to schedule an area you can control so <Col N="1727" /> that smuggling cannot take place, and you must also leave a sufficiently wide gap between the non-infected area and the infected area. You must do that for particular reasons.  There is no use in scheduling an area if you are not in practice able to prevent potatoes going out.  The interest of the farmer is to send out potatoes.  He does not like regulations.  He does not like to be controlled.  He wants a free market and his interest is to get his potatoes out.  We have to adopt police methods of one kind or another to keep them in.  We must draw a line which must be one which has relation to the railway stations, the roads, and so on, and it would be absolutely out of the question to schedule particular farms. You would have to go around and schedule every farm where black scab has been found.  To do that, you would have a chess board, a farm here and there, and in the middle a farm which was not scheduled, but where black scab might easily be owing to the fact that farm implements, machinery and so on come in from the other farms.  What are we to do?  It is admitted that we have to control. If you let out potatoes black scab will spread.  What are we to do? They have as their only market the English market.  Deputy Aiken says they are at a great loss because they cannot sell at home.  They are at some loss but it is hard to measure that.  People will come along and quote the price of potatoes at Dundalk for small quantities, and say, &ldquo;This is the price that growers near Dundalk in non-infected areas get, and look at how it compares with the price growers in Cooley are getting.  It is much higher.&rdquo;  The fact is the varieties are different, and if the potatoes from Cooley went into Dundalk the price would come immediately to the English price.  That is the only effect it would have.  There is a little, but only a little in that point.  If the Cooley potatoes went up to Dundalk the Dundalk price would slump to the English one.</P>

The Cooley growers are getting the same price as any other growers above or below the line are getting in England. They have a fairly good market in England.  That is to say, it is as good as any other market at home or abroad we can get at.  The price for potatoes in 1923 and 1925 slumped here and in England, and we cannot control that, but they have the best market, a market where the price compares favourably with the price either at home, in Scotland or anywhere else.  I do not see what we can do.  I am ready, consistent with maintaining the regulations and seeing to it that this black scab does not spread to the rest of the country, always to meet potato growers, and I have met them and discussed details with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>I cannot point to any definite example of where black scab was carried through turnips or mangels&mdash;they do not go far from the farm; they are sold locally&mdash;but it is very likely that the progress of black scab in that area was hurried by the fact that turnips and mangels were being sold.  It might have been our good fortune that it was not carried in the clay attaching to turnips and mangels, but it is a fact that it is carried in the clay.  That has been scientifically established and is beyond doubt.  It is admitted in serious discussion by the people on both sides that black scab is carried in the clay.  It is suggested that the establishment of a glucose factory in the district would solve the difficulty.  I think Deputy Aiken referred to a shilling a cwt. as a very poor price.  I doubt if they could, under any conditions, get more for potatoes for glucose than a shilling a cwt.  My information is that potatoes for factory purposes&mdash;glucose, alcohol or anything else&mdash;must be bought at something very low indeed, far below the price that the Cooley people would be prepared to accept.</P>

      <P>I did not know that the factory in Athlone was in fact established.  I do not want to say anything to discourage the factory beforehand, but the information I have is that potatoes bought for factory purposes on the Continent&mdash;glucose and other things&mdash;are bought extremely cheaply, and must be bought extremely cheaply, if they have to compete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly a case there for the Minister to inquire into.  I do not believe that any firm going to establish a factory in this country are doing it in the expectation that they will buy potatoes at a shilling a cwt.  They must expect to pay a price that will compensate the farmers for the trouble of growing them.  A factory has been established in Athlone, and the owners must believe that they will be able to offer a fairly good price for the potatoes.  I think the Minister should inquire into the whole business and find out the details about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made some inquiries as regards some of the prices that are being paid for potatoes for alcohol and potato flour and they are extremely low.  I imagine myself that if commercial money comes along to establish a factory in Athlone or anywhere else, people would be establishing it from the point of view of getting waste potatoes to a great extent as their raw materials. I do not want to go into that point at the moment.  I do not want to prejudice the establishment of the factory in any way.  I assume if people are prepared to put their money into that factory they will make all the inquiries necessary; they will probably make more careful inquiries than I would make or anybody else who is not going to lose his money in the establishment of the factory.  If they are putting their money into it they see a chance of a profit and of getting the raw materials necessary.  Anyhow, I am keeping in touch with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to keep in touch with what is happening in that regard.  Deputy Aiken wants to draw conclusions from the Cooley situation.  He pointed out that it was a good example of the dangers of depending on one crop and one market.  He suggested that was the position the country was in.  That is exactly the wrong description of <Col N="1731" /> the position.  There is, of course, a great danger there.  He is right in drawing the deduction that the farmer who relies on the production of one crop is extremely insecure.  That is a doctrine I have always been preaching, but, on the other hand, that is not the economy of this country and it is not the economy of the farmer.  The Department of Agriculture is trying to encourage the mixed farmer.  The mixed farmer has not all his eggs in one basket.  If he is a dairy farmer he goes in for not only butter, but beef in the shape of calves, poultry, eggs and bacon.  The same thing applies to the big farmer; he goes in for beef, butter and eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cooley farmers, I believe, could do more to help themselves than we could do for them, but they will not do it.  They could go in more for pigs and poultry.  They may have good reasons for not doing so, but I cannot see them. Why should they not keep some pigs?  I do not see what is to prevent them.  They are small farmers and they have a certain amount of stabling.  You do not require an awful lot of stabling to keep a sow or so.  Where potatoes are available they could keep pigs.  It may be that they are short of milk for their young pigs, but they have a lot of food-stuffs required for pigs; they must occasionally grow some corn.  I am quite satisfied that they could do a lot more for themselves by mixing up their farming than the State could do for them by the establishment of a flour factory or any other factory.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is there now functioning.  It was set up for the purpose of operating agricultural credits, and there is no reason why they should not avail of it.  While I know it is rather difficult for small farmers who are not doing a tremendous amount of tillage to go in for stock to any extent, I have not the slightest doubt that if these farmers would keep pigs it would improve their position.  The price of pigs is often bad, but I cannot guarantee prices.  Nobody can, <Col N="1732" /> where there is an export surplus. But, taking one year with another, the keeping of pigs to a greater extent would undoubtedly help those farmers if they only did it, but they will not do it.  I believe they will have to do it yet.  I believe they will realise, after some time, that it is the soundest thing they could do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, Deputy Moore and other Deputies, I think, said that we should give up this policy of producing for export.  That was what I described as &ldquo;no exports.&rdquo;  Deputies got annoyed and said they meant nothing of the kind.  It is as sound for me to say &ldquo;no exports&rdquo; as for them to say that my policy is &ldquo;producing for export.&rdquo;  We do not produce for export.  We produce certain things, and I would be only too glad to hear an alternative to the things we produce&mdash; cattle, sheep, eggs, butter, mutton, bacon.  We export a surplus, and that is all we do export.</P>
    <P>I make this general statement that, as far as these articles are concerned, we are more than self-contained. After nine or ten months of argument we should get away from the point where that particular contention is answered by someone from the opposite benches, who asks, &ldquo;What about American bacon that comes in?&rdquo; The fact is that we produce considerably more bacon than is consumed here, no matter whether the bacon consumed in this country is American bacon or not. The same thing applies, with added strength, to butter.  We produce twice as much butter as we can possibly consume.  What are we to do with it?  Are we to throw it away? If we give up producing these articles, what are we to produce? Wheat?  Admit wheat, for the sake of argument.  What else?  What is the use of talking of my policy as being &ldquo;producing for export.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Fruit in the country from which the Deputy comes&mdash; Armagh&mdash;is rather a common crop, but there are special considerations applying to the fruit in Armagh.  I know that a lot of farmers in <Col N="1733" /> Armagh grow fruit for export entirely.  There is a certain amount of fruit grown in the South.  Possibly with encouragement more fruit could be grown, but do you think that you can make fruit a real alternative to butter?</P>

There is no use talking about fruit, and there is no use in Deputy Moore talking about suet.  The Deputy said we imported £30,000 worth of lard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And we imported £32,000 worth of strawberries.  That is not counting what we imported in the way of jams.  I believe that we could grow our own fruit.  There is a big market for it here and we could protect our own fruit as against foreign goods.  I know we cannot produce grapes or oranges or bananas here, but we can encourage the people to eat the fruit that we grow ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a debate on the merits and demerits of fruit growing, nor of the special advantages and disadvantages <Col N="1734" /> that we possess for growing certain types of fruit.  All I say is that obviously we are importing something like a quarter of a million pounds worth of fruit between apples and strawberries.  Where does that leave us?  Suppose we produce all that in this country?  What is it as compared with the slightest increase in butter or eggs or bacon? Not the slightest weight.  Here is the line we are on&mdash;the reason the farmer goes in for butter and eggs is because it pays him better.  The conditions are widespread and consistent. That has not been contradicted. The lesson that you ought to draw from the facts of the case has not, to my mind, been contradicted by any set of costings produced by any authorities.</P>
      <P>What I say is this: you can do anything you like to encourage the production of £250,000 worth of fruit, apples and strawberries, and you can do what you like in the stimulation of these products, but an increase in the production of your butter would mean, even taking it at the very smallest, £250,000.  A fairly small increase would amount to £500,000 annually, and a reasonable increase would amount to £1,000,000.  The same applies to eggs.  One year with another, cattle production and the export of cattle fluctuates between two and three million pounds and all the wealth you can get out of strawberries and apples and the growing of fruit would be swallowed up by the slightest fluctuation in cattle.  A fluctuation in cattle may mean, in rise or in fall, a matter of two or three millions.  But these are all details.  This matter of fruit is only a detail, and perhaps we can see where we can encourage it.  But it is very little use in a big way, and neither for the moment is the matter of £30,000 worth of suet for bovril or any of those other items picked out of the statistics of the things which we are importing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these things is going to be any substitute for butter, bacon, eggs, beef and mutton.  We have a bag that will hold £35,000,000.  If you can get any substitute for these <Col N="1735" /> that would be suitable to the farmer, surely the thing to do would be to develop it.  If these things are suitable to the farmer, and if the farmer finds that they pay, the thing to do is to develop them.  In all these matters, we are self-supporting, and more than self-supporting.  Let us give up all this talk and criticism about producing for export.  There has been one suggestion, and only one suggestion, put up.  I am not taking tobacco seriously.  I refer to the suggestion put up about wheat. To my mind, if the State has money to spare, it could much better utilise that money than by giving a subsidy to wheat.  If the State decided on a policy of subsidy, the money would be much better spent in bringing about a state of affairs where, perhaps, we would go in more for winter dairying.  Through winter dairying we can get an increase in tillage more than in any other way.  But we would have enough to do at the moment if we would only concentrate on the things that are obviously suitable and right and develop them for all they are worth.  We will get something if we go on these lines.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about cattle, sheep, bacon, butter, eggs and poultry.  Quidnuncs come along, and in any year that the prices of these fall they say: &ldquo;I told you so; this is the worst of making this country a vegetable garden.  This is the worst of this policy of grazing and grazierdom.&rdquo; Now that is all dope.  I could not guarantee a market for the farmers or for anyone.  No Department of State could do it.  A Department of State can only co-operate in helping the farmer.  We cannot change any detail for a very long time.  We could persuade the farmers, in the course of a number of years, to change the details of their farming, but we cannot change them ourselves. We could perhaps do it in ten years.  If there was a big market here, we could possibly do a lot of things.  Meanwhile, it is good business, in times like this, to concentrate on big items and to concentrate on the particular form of production <Col N="1736" /> which is most susceptible of improvement, and the expansion of which will certainly yield good results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made a speech on these Estimates, but he missed the main point.  I agree with a lot of what Deputy Gorry said.  He suggested to me that I ought to give up politics and stick to farming, that that is what I was paid for.  There is the trouble.  He was very nearly right, but not in that suggestion. The Deputy was very nearly right, but he was very much wrong at the same time, and for this reason&mdash; what he meant really was that politics are of no importance.  Of course they are not, and if this were a normal Parliament there would be no such discussions as we have here. What the Deputy really meant to say was that politics have sterilised this country; that the creative sterilised all the creative energy in this country; that the creative energy in the country has been canalised for the last hundred years, and particularly for the last five years, into politics, with the result that we have become sterile.  We produce nothing.  That is really the position with the Opposition Deputies. The real point against the Deputies opposite is that they are continuing that particular process under which all the creative energy of this country is going into politics; is going into things that do not matter twopence instead of going into life, and when I speak of life I mean agriculture, medicine, law, arts and literature.</P>

      <P>Yes, but there is all the difference in the world between doping yourself and taking it in a moderate way. I take it regularly, and whiskey also, if I can get it; but there is all the difference between dope and taking the thing regularly.  That is the point.  There is all the difference in the world between taking it naturally and normally or taking politics naturally and normally and doping yourself with either.  This country has been doped and sterilised with politics.  That is what the Deputy meant to say.  I say that the debates that we should have here should be debates on economics. These are the proper things to be debated.  Instead of that, days have been spent in logic-chopping as to whether we are the legitimate Government of this country or not, and debating, without any sincerity, the I.R.A. as against the National Army and other issues of that sort. All these things are simply a waste of time and a futility.  That is what the Deputy meant to say, but he could not say it.  That is what Deputy Gorry had at the back of his head.  I would like very much to give up politics, but what we have to fight about here is not politics&mdash; they are not political issues.  We are fighting about certain issues. These issues are common to other Parties in every State in the world. Until these issues become common to both Parties, we cannot do what the Deputy wants us to do, concentrate on the things that are important to the man in the street between the time that he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night.  These things can be summed up in the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; instead of in the word &ldquo;politics.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now, as regards barley, it has been suggested that we should endeavour to replace Indian meal by barley.  There again the issue is very extraordinary.  I have constantly been advocating that the farmers should grow barley and feed it to their stock as far as possible. That has been laughed at; that is supposed to be more Imperialistic nonsense.  I never suggested that they should feed all their barley.  Of course, as regards the barley grown in Leix, it is all sold.  I have suggested that in other districts where they have land suitable for barley growing, but where barley is not grown now, it should be grown to a certain extent and fed on the farm. <Col N="1739" /> That has been regarded as all wrong. It has, in fact, been regarded as heresy, and I do not know why.  The very people who regard it as heresy are very enthusiastic about one class of farmer growing barley and transferring it to another class of farmer who does not grow it.  The farmer in Leix who grows barley does not consider sixteen shillings a barrel a great price.  If he were paid eight shillings a hundredweight, by the time the barley would get to Galway it would cost twelve shillings.  If you take into consideration the percentage of moisture, millers' profit, the wholesalers' profit and the retailers' profit, by the time it reaches the small farmer in Galway it is twelve shillings.  The farmer there has to pay more for it than he has to pay for maize, and the farmer in Leix has not gained anything in the transaction. That is essentially unsound in a small country like this.</P>
      <P>Indian meal could be replaced to a great extent by barley, but that would only be possible if the people who have suitable barley land would grow it and use it, and if the farmers in Leix would retain a portion of their second-class barley and feed it to their stock.  Give the farmer an opportunity of collaring all the profits between eight shillings and twelve shillings.  Unless you approach the matter in that way you will not get anywhere.  I warn Deputy Gorry that, while his intentions in the matter may be quite sound, it seems to me that it is unsound to endeavour to build up a system in a small country like this in which barley grown by one farmer could be transferred to another. Under such a system the profits which are paid do not go into the farmer's pocket.  The Deputy is not on sound lines and he will not please either the grower or the consumer. The only sound thing is for the farmer to grow barley and feed it to his stock, and where a farmer has land suitable for barley-growing he should endeavour to grow a little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has put a wrong interpretation <Col N="1740" /> upon my viewpoint.  I think it is admitted on all sides that barley could be economically transferred from one farmer to another.  Take my own area for example.  If a thousand barrels of barley could be transferred to Galway, Mayo, or any other part of the country at a price equal to the prevailing malting price, and at a price which would compare favourably even with the comparative value of maize, I think it would be doing very good work for the farmers instead of leaving them at the mercy of a market overfilled with corn which forces down the price to eleven shillings or twelve shillings per barrel and gives the buyer a very great advantage against the farmer.  I believe it is possible to send corn to Mayo or Galway and buy it at sixteen shillings.  The malting price of barley would be £10 15/-.</P>

      <P>I buy a lot of maize every year.  I have only been able to buy barley twice during the last five years and I could only buy it in ton lots.  I found I was not able to do it as against maize.  I warn the Deputy that it would be a mistake to sink heavy State expenditure on that scheme.  It would be useful to a point.  No simple device will solve the barley problem.  There ought to be sufficient organisation to do what the Deputy wants, if the opportunity occurred and there was a suitable market.  I refer now to the transfer of barley.  There ought to be organisations to do that and, equally, the farmers themselves should feed more of their barley. Farmers who do not grow barley now but who have suitable barley land ought to make an effort to grow it.  As it is, they buy maize.  I think they should grow barley.  No one device is going to solve the problem.  Where you have mixed farming you could only solve the <Col N="1741" /> problem by a series of detailed measures.  I think these are the main points with which I have to deal.</P>

      <P>The amount of the Vote proposed is £56,803, as against £57,851 last year, a decrease of over £1,000.  The important sub-head is sub-head C1&mdash;Acquisition of land&mdash; £7,000, as against £10,000 in each of the two previous years.  The money provided under this sub-head is voted as a grant-in-aid in order that unexpended balances at the end of each year may be allowed to accumulate to form an acquisition fund.  The unexpended balance in hand on 31st March, 1929, was £7,045.  The reason for the grant-in-aid arrangement is that under the old conditions in the purchase of land preliminary negotiations were somewhat protracted as a rule, and even when general agreement as to a bargain has been reached it is not absolutely certain whether the money will be available or not.  If the money is voted by way of a grant-in-aid none of it is surrendered, and the particular officer carrying out negotiations knows how far he can go and what money he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with cultural operations&mdash;£43,000&mdash;there is an increase of £1,000, mainly due to the fact that <Col N="1744" /> each year the area is getting bigger and cultural operations are getting more expensive.  We have one or two foresters and foremen.  Their salaries are on the Estimate.  Of the item of £8,300 for maintenance, £3,800 is for labour and £4,500 is for materials. Under cultural operations labour amounts to £24,700.  I do not think I need comment on the smaller items. Forestry education is a small item. It is for the purpose of training a certain number of forestry apprentices who are included in the service each year.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The reason why I do so is because we believe that sufficient is not being done for afforestation. The Minister has explained that a certain amount remained over in the hands of the Forestry Department out of the sum voted for the acquisition of land at the end of the last two years, and that therefore the amount this year has been reduced from £10,000 to £7,000.  I do not know that much can be done for afforestation unless the amount voted for the acquisition of land be considerably increased instead of decreased, because it is admitted, I think, by everybody, that there is a deficiency of land under afforestation. It is rather a peculiar thing that the two items in the Estimate in which there is a decrease are the acquisition of land and advances for afforestation purposes, while the other items, such as salaries, wages and travelling expenses have been increased.  I accept the Minister's explanation that the reason for the increase in the grant for cultural operations is because the areas are being enlarged, and that therefore the expenses have increased.  But why the other item of salaries, wages and allowances should have increased by the enormous sum of £1,200 I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the Forestry Act, I do not see why it should be increased from £7,000 to £8,200. That is a very large increase.  If as <Col N="1745" /> a result of the Forestry Act we were to have a big increase in the amount of land planted there would be justification for the big increase in the salaries bill.  But it appears that the only advantage we have got from the Forestry Act, at least in this Estimate, is an increase in the salaries bill.  There are other points to which I would like to draw attention.  I believe, from the information I have been able to get, that the Forestry Department are acting on a policy of planting soft woods rather than hard woods, and I am not sure that that is the proper policy for this country.  In England the wood that is used is estimated to be 80 per cent. soft wood as against 20 per cent. hard wood, the reason being that there is a big amount of wood used for pit props which brings up the percentage of soft wood.  That would be a justification for the English Forestry Department going in for the planting of soft woods on a much wider scale than hard woods.  But in this country I do not think that the position is the same.  We learn from English returns that they import in some years up to twenty million pounds' worth of timber, 80 per cent. of which would be coniferous.  Last year Ireland imported one and a half million pounds' worth of timber.  It is not possible to find out from the returns what proportion of that was soft wood and what proportion was hard wood, but I believe that there is a much bigger proportion of hard wood used in this country than there is used in England. On that account I think that our Forestry Department should go in for the planting of some of the hard woods, whereas up to the present I believe that they have confined themselves almost entirely to soft woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Afforestation, apart from supplying our needs in timber, which is rather a big item, amounting to a million and a half pounds worth imported last year, is one of the most useful forms of industry for absorbing the unemployed in rural areas.  As a matter of fact, even from the estimate for cultural <Col N="1746" /> operations here we can see that a very large proportion of the money is spent on labour.  There is, I think, no other form of industry in this country that could be speeded up to give such good economic results eventually and that could give as much employment to labour as afforestation, in view of the capital costs that would be incurred on other forms of relief of unemployment, and looking at it from the point of view of the relief of unemployment. I say that it is one of the best things we could do at present.  There is also the matter to be considered, what amount of land is available in the country for planting.  That leads to the making of an economic calculation, just as in the case of any other crop or in regard to any other thing that we may do with our land.  We take, for instance, the best land in the country, we take the mountain land and we take the poor medium land and try to find out whether it would be economic to plant any of these classes of land.  We have certain mountain land in the country that is only capable of producing from two to eleven lbs. of meat per year from the grazing of sheep. These are figures that were given before a Commission that sat in 1920. On the other hand, the planting of that particular mountain land that only produced that amount of meat might not be economic, because, in the first place, you must consider what sort of trees you can plant on that mountain.  That particular mountain might only grow very poor timber.  It might not grow a big quantity of timber per acre per year. Another point that must be taken into consideration is the cost of felling that timber when it comes to maturity and the marketing of it. These are all matters of calculation; to find out whether it would be a better economic proposition to plant mountains that at present are grazing sheep or whether it would be better to leave them under grass.  In the same way when we come to consider land, not mountain land but low land, which is not in good order for grazing, we cannot calculate what it is worth at present.  We are also <Col N="1747" /> up against the proposition there, what it would cost to plant and whether, when the timber had been grown on it, it would be possible to market it economically.</P>
    <P>I believe that at the present time the price of timber is falling. Of course that has only happened since the end of the war. But, taking the price of timber before the war, during the war and at the present time, it should be quite easy to calculate, within a reasonable margin, what is the lowest price you might expect to get for timber that would have matured in forty, fifty or sixty years' time. It is possible also to calculate the number of cubic feet per acre that would be grown on any of the classes of land that I have referred to.  In that way, we would be able to get our formula of what the timber would be worth then, per year, as against what the grass is worth per year at the present time. As I have said, we imported last year timber to the value of one and a half million pounds.  I do not believe that a single ton of that timber came in unmanufactured.  It all came in either manufactured or partially manufactured.  The greater part of it, I think, was fully manufactured before coming in here in the form of furniture, coach bodies, boxes and other things.  Some of it came in in the form of boards and planks which were partially manufactured.  Then you had window frames and doors, on which quite an amount of labour had been spent before they came into the country.  Our importers had to pay not only the cost of this timber, but also for the cost of labour on it in some other country, while our own carpenters and labouring people were idle.</P>
    <P>Take against the figure that I have given, the figures for the export of timber.  We exported timber to the value of about £215,000.  About £135,000 worth of that was just in the round.  It was simply felled and cut across in two places, and sent to the port to be shipped out of the country.  The least possible amount <Col N="1748" /> of labour was expended on that timber before it left this country.  It was exported principally to England. As I said before, we exported timber out of the country without having got any value out of it in the way of the employment of labour, while numbers of carpenters and labouring men were walking around idle here.</P>
    <P>With regard to timber, this is one of the barest countries in the world. Take countries which have practically the same climate and the same conditions as regards mountain, soil and all that sort of thing.  We occupy the lowest place amongst all the countries in these islands as regards the amount of land under timber here.  In England, when the last survey was taken, it had 5.1 per cent. of the country under timber; Scotland had 4.5, Wales had 3.8, while Ireland had only 1.5.  From these figures it is quite easy to see why it should be the case that we are importing timber to the value of one and a half million pounds, while we only export timber to the value of a little over £200,000.  We will have to raise the proportion of our land under timber much higher than the present figure if we want to be in a position to supply our own needs.  It is quite possible, in fact it is probable, that the figures in regard to imports and exports will be even more unfavourable for many years to come than they have been for the last two years.  I say that because, as far as one can observe in travelling around the country, we seem to be cutting down the last few woods and forests that we have.  At the present time we do not seem to have any woods or forests that are approaching maturity.  The young woods and forests that we have at present have not been planted for more than twenty years.  There are very few woods or forests in the country approaching a state of maturity and fit for cutting.  There are very few of our woods and forests that have been planted for a period of between twenty and forty years. Therefore, when the present few woods and forests have matured and are cut down, and they will be cut probably within the next three or <Col N="1749" /> four years, we will have a very lean period for, I should say, at least twenty years.  During that period we will probably have no timber at all. Even after that period has elapsed, and until the few young woods and forests that we have begin to mature, which may extend over a period of another twenty-five years, we will be in the position that we will have nothing to fall back upon except the pines and the soft woods.  We shall have no hard woods whatever.</P>
    <P>The great advantage of hard woods in a country like ours, or indeed in any country, is that much more employment is given in the manufacture of it than in the manufacture of soft woods.  We are all, I suppose, fairly familiar with the small amount of labour that is given in the manufacture of flooring boards and joists for houses from soft woods compared with the great amount of labour given in the making of furniture out of oak, handles, tools and so on, all of which are made principally from hard woods, so that the advantage to a country would be much greater in the working of hard woods than in the working of soft woods.</P>
    <P>It may be asked, why do we not import hard woods and do the work on them rather than import furniture, or whatever it may be, but it is very difficult at present to get from any of the big forest growing countries unmanufactured wood, for most of them have passed laws prohibiting the export of the raw wood.  They have realised that the big advantage they get from the growing of forests is not the capital amount that may be got for the wood when cut down, but the amount of labour that wood is capable of giving before it leaves the country as manufactured articles. Not having timber ourselves.  we have to accept the manufactured article.  Another thing that convinced me the Forestry Department are not making very much progress, and are not making a very serious endeavour to plant the country, was when I visited the Forestry Department a few months ago to make an inquiry about a certain small mountain called Forth in my own county, with a <Col N="1750" /> view to ascertaining what progress had been made as regards the planting of it.  The local people had been hearing, for a couple of years past, that the thing was almost a fait accompli, and that they might expect at any moment to see the foresters coming down to plant the trees.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of my visit, I was told that the first step was that the Minister would have to give an order to have the Forestry Act brought into operation; that order having been given the Forestry Act would become law; and then the Forestry Department would have to apply formally to the Land Commission to take over the land in that particular area, and the Land Commission after taking over the land would hand it to the Forestry Department, who would then have to commence all the processes of fencing and clearing the ground, and so on, before any planting could be done.  Having a little knowledge of the working of the Land Commission, and not having much knowledge of the working of the Forestry Department, because I do not see it working anywhere, I began to realise that it would be some years, and not months, before the people in that area would see a tree planted on the mountain of Forth.  If other areas that are expecting to have something done by the Forestry Department have to go through all these processes, I think it will be some years before any serious advance is made towards afforestation. It was with a view to try and get from the Minister some idea as to what we may really expect with regard to afforestation, for we have not got information of that sort yet, that I put down the motion that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some little knowledge of forestry, as there is a fair share of it going on around my district, and we appreciate it very much.  It absorbs a lot of the unemployed. With the exception of a few mistakes, which might be remedied by the Minister, everything is going on well.  I would like <Col N="1751" /> to bring under the Minister's notice the question of the importation of trees.  We should have our own nurseries, or one big one established. That would save a good deal of money which is now being sent out of the country.  It would not be necessary to have an increase in the Estimate to establish these nurseries.</P>
      <P>Of course, you will not get land for nothing, although some farmers in my district who have 300 acres or 400 acres of land which is fit for nothing but forestry have offered me 200 acres out of 400 if they would be allowed a reduction in their rent.  Suppose they owed two years' rent and got a clear receipt they would hand over 200 or 250 acres.  During the war the country was denuded of most of its forests, because of the big prices that were obtained for the wood, and because of these big prices everything in my district was coaxed away.  For years I have advocated that more land should be taken over for the purpose of afforestation.  We have a place locally which if used for the purpose of forestry would give a considerable amount of employment, and in that way benefit two or three districts, including Fermoy.  It would be better to have the money spent in giving employment in that way than having the men on the dole.  If men now drawing the dole were offered employment at forestry work and refused to take it that would be sufficient excuse for refusing to give them the dole.  I would like to see an increase in the Estimate for the purpose of increasing the wages.  As I said in my opening remarks, there are a few small details that require to be looked into in my district, and that could be remedied by one stroke of the Minister's pen.  I would like to see all our own plants produced in the country and not to be sending our money away for them.  We would have healthier plants and would give employment in the growth of them.  I would be very pleased if the Minister would look after these few details that I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly endorse Deputy Ryan's remarks about concentration by the Forestry Department on hard timber.  It should be the purpose of the Department to plant sufficient timber to meet all the demands of the home market. These demands are not met now, though I suppose they were met in the distant post when there was more timber in the country.  I also think there should be concentration on timber suitable for box-making and for ordinary market purposes, for which a great amount of timber is at present imported.  I understand the Minister's Department does not allow any Irish timber into egg boxes.  A thing that strikes me, and I speak with only local knowledge of afforestation, is that the areas under forests are much too small.  They cover anything from 30 to 60 acres, and there is a good deal of money wasted on them.  If instead you had 400 acres or 500 acres of hills and hollows, not suitable for anything else, under forests it would be much more economic, and the same amount of labour could see after them.  With regard to soft timber, I think more attention should be paid to cut away bogs.  They should be planted with Scotch firs, the only thing they are suitable for.  It would be of benefit in every way if these cut away bogs were used up all over the country. A tree that they should concentrate upon and that is invaluable at present is the sycamore.  Committees acting under the Department should concentrate more on the growing of that tree.  It is very easily grown, and I believe its market value is much greater than the oak at present, particularly for the making of dishes and such vessels for creamery purposes.  The principal point I want to make is concentration on meeting our own demands as regards hard timber and the utilisation of larger areas in the planting of forests throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion that the Estimate be referred <Col N="1753" /> back for further consideration. My principal reason is that I believe the Forestry Branch have not been as active in the past as they should have been, and, in the second place, that the money expended up to the present upon afforestation has not been distributed throughout the various counties in the manner in which it should be.  Some time ago I asked the Minister the number of acres which had been acquired for this purpose, and he informed me that approximately 50,000 acres had been acquired and that, out of the 50,000, approximately 20,000 acres had been planted.  As there are over 2,000 trees planted to the acre, that will work out at about forty million trees planted since the Government took over office.  I learned with regret from the Minister that not one tree has been planted in Donegal up to the present, and not one acre of land acquired for the purpose of afforestation.  When I raised this question first in March, 1928, the Minister informed me that it was the intention of the Land Commission to acquire about 2,000 acres of the Stewart-Bam estate, of which about 1,000 acres would be devoted to afforestation.  Over a year has elapsed since then, and that promise has not been carried out.  As far as I am aware, no land has been taken over in Donegal for that purpose, and not one tree has been planted, although the taxpayers there are contributing their quota of this expenditure.  For that reason, if for no other reason, it is my intention to vote for Deputy Ryan's motion.  I do not intend to go into the details&mdash;Deputy Ryan has gone into them very extensively &mdash;as to why land should be acquired and more trees planted.  I do not know whether the Minister is responsible, or some person in the Forestry Branch, but whoever it is, he seems to think that we have only twenty-five counties in the Free State and has forgotten that Donegal is in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Ryan's exposition of the argument which he makes in favour of his amendment, and I find it somewhat <Col N="1754" /> difficult to follow the justification for his charge against the Forestry Department with regard to the condition of afforestation at present. We are all in agreement that the forestry conditions are not anything like what we would like them to be, but I have not been convinced by the Deputy that the conditions which exist are due, either in whole or in part, to the action or inaction of the Forestry Department.  In order fully to understand the situation which exists, one must have some knowledge of the recent history of afforestation here.  Undoubtedly, the denudation of the country from the afforestation point of view has been to a very large extent due to the change in the system of land tenure. The operation of the various Land Acts dispossessed the landlords of their lands and a great many of them thought fit, simultaneously with the sale of their lands, to dispose of the lands which they held personally as demesnes, with the result that it is common history that within the last twenty years various woods and forests which were the property of the former landlords have been cut down and sold and have not been replaced.  My point is that in the past afforestation was in the hands of private individuals.  The situation now has changed altogether.  It is well-known that afforestation is a form of industry which requires very considerable capital expenditure, which must be made by somebody who is prepared to wait for a very long time for the results accruing from that expenditure.  There is an old saying in connection with afforestation, that a man planted for his grand-children.  It is quite obvious that nobody would be prepared to sink a large capital sum in afforestation, when the results would not begin to turn in for at least twenty or twenty-five years, and then only in very small part.  Afforestation, undoubtedly, is now out of the hands of individuals to a very large extent and has become a State problem and the question of the rapidity with which the State advances is altogether a matter of money.  The State can advance slowly or quickly, but it can <Col N="1755" /> only advance as quickly as the money is made available.  It is generally accepted that the profits from afforestation are very small, and that, as far as the exploitation of afforestation by the State is concerned, we cannot hope for any profit, but rather that there will be a loss.</P>
      <P>The other advantages to the country which would accrue from increased afforestation will, however, compensate in part or altogether, for the loss to the State&mdash;the improved climatic conditions, not to mention the advantage from the point of view of scenery and picturesqueness. But the whole development and expansion in that regard must be governed by the amount of money which the Dáil is prepared to vote.  Deputy Ryan might reasonably make the case that the State has not spent sufficient money, that it ought to spend more money, and that the Vote ought to be larger.  The only thing is that any Deputies who support that idea ought to state where the money is to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan dealt with other matters which are not really cognate to this debate, and which are really fiscal matters&mdash;the importation of timber into the country and the exportation of timber out of the country.  If the Deputy wants to have a restriction of any kind placed upon the exportation or importation of timber, that is a fiscal matter to be dealt with by the Tariff Commission. But there is a relation between these two things which it may be relevant to touch upon, that is the question of importation and exportation as mentioned by Deputy Ryan.  It is all very fine to state that we are importing too much timber, and a much larger value in timber than we are exporting, but surely the Deputy realises that this, as almost every modern industrial proposition, is complex and not a simple problem to be dealt with off-hand or haphazard. The passing of an order in the Dáil that the importation of timber should be prohibited at certain stages, and that from that forward all timber required for use in the <Col N="1756" /> country should be native timber, would not meet the case at all.  Because anybody conversant even superficially with this matter&mdash;and I only claim to have a superficial knowledge of the industrial use of timber in this country&mdash;must know that there are considerable quantities of timber which cannot be grown in this country, and which have to be imported to be used in the manufacture of articles required.  The Deputy would find the same conditions prevailing in England.  In that country, with climatic conditions approximately similar to ours, they find, in regard to their building and other industries, that it is absolutely essential to introduce a certain foreign-grown timber, and that a prohibition of that import would not serve the country.  If we attempted to use native timber for certain purposes we would be using an inferior article which would not suit at all for the purposes required.</P>
    <P>The other question&mdash;whether the timber imported should be imported in a raw condition or in a manufactured or partly manufactured condition&mdash;is almost altogether a fiscal matter.  It may be that it is easy to suggest remedies, but it would be very hard to carry them into actual practice.  In this industry, as in most modern industries, we have to deal with standardisation and mass production, where enormously expensive standardised plant units to produce standardised articles are available, and on that account we have to import standardised articles at lower prices than we would be able to manufacture them in our own country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that by imposing certain restrictions we could import raw timber and manufacture it into the finished articles required here, but we would do it at very greatly increased cost.  If anyone wants to deal with this question, the proper place to deal with it is before the Tariff Commission, where the whole question of costs could be gone into, and where it could be examined whether the advantages that would accrue in the way of increased employment and <Col N="1757" /> other things would counterbalance the increase in cost.  I doubt very much if it would be justified.  Similarly, the Deputy dealt with the prohibition of the export of timber.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to follow the exact trend of the arguments here, and particularly I may say some of the arguments of the Deputy.  I am giving a general idea which I got from the arguments which he put forward.  I may be wrong, but I got these ideas from his arguments about the exportation of timber.  I thought the Deputy suggested that in other countries, at least, the exportation of timber is prohibited?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">

      <P>The Deputy should be more candid and not merely let a certain implication be taken from what he says.  I am dealing with his argument.  I can only accept the obvious implications of his argument and what they appeared to be on the surface. The obvious implication of his argument here is that there should be a prohibition on the exportation of timber.  The Deputy is annoyed that the Department gives no <Col N="1758" /> encouragement to the growing of timber, and he has suggested a remedy, but that would not be a remedy at all, because the effect of the prohibition of the export of timber would be to reduce the price to the producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal, through the Chair, with the arguments of the Deputy opposite. The Deputy has stressed the advisability of increasing afforestation from the point of view of the increased employment that would result.  Everyone is anxious to reduce unemployment and to give employment where employment can be remuneratively given.  But we should realise the actualities of the situation, and I believe it is an accepted fact that the amount expended on labour in afforestation is a comparatively trifling sum and that the amount of unemployment that would be relieved, even from a considerable extension of the afforestation policy of the Government, would be comparatively slight.  I make that in the form of a general statement.  It can be tested by actual figures; figures can be produced and the amount of money spent in labour in proportion to the total capital expenditure can be shown.  My opinion is that the actual relief that would be given in the way of employment with considerably increased expenditure on afforestation would be comparatively trifling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of this question of afforestation that from a purely agricultural point of view more stress should be laid on than has been laid up to the present.  It is undoubtedly a fact that in the various farms scattered all over the <Col N="1759" /> country there has been a denudation of timber.  To my mind a good deal of the timber cut away is a loss not felt either from the agricultural point of view or the economic point of view, because it is what is known as hedgerow timber.  From my knowledge of agriculture, hedge timber to any great extent is almost useless either from the point of view of shelter or as an economic asset. There is a form in which timber might be grown on farms.  I suggest it is in this regard, if there is any weakness in the action of the Department, that it exists.  That is in regard to timber grown in shelter belts.</P>
    <P>I think that there ought to be some more definite plan than that which I have heard adumbrated for the encouragement of the growing of shelter belts by farmers.  A good many farms suffer because of their being exposed and from not having that shelter which they formerly had from woods.  That want should be met, in so far as it could be met, by growing timber in small clumps rather than by the suggestion that farmers should leave the timber in hedges.  Some experts state that an immense amount of harm is done to land by allowing timber to stand in isolated units in hedges.  Anyone who has knowledge of the growth of roots of the ash or elm will know that the land, for almost a distance equal to the height of the timber, will not be as fertile as land further out in the fields, and also that crops grown under trees will be less productive than those grown further out.  For that reason the encouragement of the growth of hedge timber is not desirable, and every support should be given to farmers to induce them to grow timber in shelter belts.  I have dealt generally with this question of afforestation as I see it.  I do not feel that the charge which has been made by the Deputy who moved that the Vote be referred back has been proved.  I believe that the Forestry Department, with the resources at its disposal, has done and is doing excellent work.  If the Dáil wants to see a much greater expansion in the <Col N="1760" /> work of the Department the only way to do it is to vote a much larger sum of money than we are voting.  I think it is up to Deputies who desire that a larger sum should be voted to suggest where that money is to come from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan has almost obviated the necessity for my getting up to speak, as I wanted chiefly to refer to the growth of shelter belts, and to ask the Minister to encourage farmers in that respect by giving free plants and seedlings. These belts are particularly necessary in parts of Galway where farms have been divided and a number of new houses erected.  Many tenants complain that their land is exposed, and they say that they want to have shelter belts.  There is scientific foundation for the suggestion of Deputy Daly that we should have our own nurseries for seedlings.  It has been found in other countries that native seedlings produce better timber and, moreover, that trees should be grown at the same altitude as that at which the seeds were grown.  I presume that most of the £215,000 worth of timber exported consisted of pit-props, and that it would not be worth while having legislation to insist that it should be in a semi-manufactured state going out.  We realise the difficulties of the Minister in this matter; first, as regards finance and, secondly, as to obtaining suitable land.  Fairly good land is, I believe, required to produce good timber.  There are districts in which timber would beautify the country.  For instance, when the Minister and I cross Ireland by rail to go to our little grey homes in the west, we cross the Bog of Allen, where, I understand, Scotch fir could be grown.  As regards mountainous districts in Connemara&mdash;I know that I am treading on dangerous ground &mdash;the Minister might refer to the Knockboy experiment, which had disastrous results.  The Minister and I have seen timber growing around shooting lodges in Connemara, and I do not see why it should not be grown elsewhere, for a certain class of timber can be grown inside shelter <Col N="1761" /> belts.  For instance, the ridge of Sliabh Eachta, between Loughrea and Gort, which formerly was thickly wooded, is now denuded. Some of that land is not suitable for agriculture and could be replanted with timber.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan says that very little employment is given by afforestation, but I remember the Minister for Finance stating that, if we had the land and the money for afforestation, he thought that that was the best means we had for relieving unemployment. Thus experts differ on this matter.  It is hard to understand why the Department last year and the year before did not spend all the money which the Dáil voted for the purchase of lands instead of handing some of that money back. The Deputy's contention hardly holds good in that respect.  There is, of course, the difficulty of mass production. I hope that I am misinterpreting Deputy Heffernan in thinking that he would like to see standardised doors and windows for the whole world.  The economic side of the problem must, of course, be looked into by the Minister for Agriculture, but in doing that such matters as the improvement of health, the giving of employment and the beautifying effect on the landscape must also be considered.  We are anxious to develop the tourist traffic; there are many districts, particularly in the West, which would be vastly improved by afforestation.  We have to look to it, even if it took more money, that we shall have timber, say, in fifty or eighty years' time. That is very essential, particularly when other countries are not exporting raw timber.  Russia is the only country doing so now as other countries insist on giving employment at home.  The money arising from afforestation and from the cutting and handling of timber may be small, but if we, like other countries, insisted in not letting it out in a raw state, except for pit-props, we would give much employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment for the reason that I have no knowledge <Col N="1762" /> whatever of any definite scheme of afforestation.  I know that a Forestry Bill was passed some time ago which gave the Government control to a certain extent over timber.  That was all to the good.  It was necessary because this process of timber slaughter which we are now going through took place in previous times more or less to the same extent as now.  I believe the Government should decide once and for all whether it is their intention to take State control of afforestation, to have a regular State scheme, or to go on a smaller scale and make an attempt to subsidise or assist individual farmers to plant shelter belts or otherwise.  The question of timber production in a country with land laws and economic conditions such as ours is rather a difficult one.  Continental countries and foreign countries generally have much less difficulty in this respect than we have.  Forests generally grow up naturally in these countries. Destructive fires destroyed some of these forests, of course, and the march of civilisation removed others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment the great difficulty I see is that it would be rather hard to have an economic unit as regards forestry in this country.  The planting of forty, fifty, or even a hundred acres of timber would seem to be uneconomic both from the point of view of maintenance as well as from the point of view of expectation afterwards. There is then, of course, the difficulty of compensation for owners. The land is owned by different people who have their rights.  There is also the question of the erection of fences for the preservation of the timber.  That would mean a very large expenditure, and it is doubtful if, at the present moment, our financial position is such that we could afford to meet this expenditure.  I believe myself that small schemes under which individual farmers might get free trees or trees without freight or under which you might have tree nurseries in different districts, supplying young trees at cheap prices, might meet the difficulty for the moment.  If we are going to start large schemes of State <Col N="1763" /> afforestation such as there are on the Continent, I believe it would take big sums of money.  If we did that we would have to decide what would be an economic unit, whether it would be 500, 1,000, or 2,000 acres.  I believe that less than a thousand acres would not be very economic.  The trees when planted would need a good deal of protection. On the Continent, they do not need so much protection as here. The custom on the Continent generally is that animals, such as cattle, are tied.  Here the custom is to erect fences; therefore you would have to erect fences around the plantations. Rabbits also cause a good deal of destruction.  As well as that there is the danger of fires and men would have to be occupied in removing the decayed branches.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the expenditure would be very heavy and, as I say, I doubt if we are in a position to undertake this huge expenditure at the present time.  We would have difficulties in certain ways.  Farmers will not attempt afforestation on a very large scale for the simple reason that the investment would be spread over too long a period and it would take too long to realise their money.  For that reason even small plantations would have to be subsidised or assisted to a certain extent. Hard wood takes 100 or 120 years to mature, and soft wood in a good many cases will take 60.  That is a long time to be out of the capital invested.  As I say, the position in foreign countries is that timber plantations are so huge that the people are able to erect sawmills to cut the timber into proper dimensions and export it.  It would be rather difficult to erect sawmills here, to cut the timber into shorter pieces.  That is why we exported such an enormous quantity of simply cut timber in the last few years.  It was not easy to erect sawmills.  Therefore the timber had to be exported in bulk with a consequent loss to labour in this country.  These are some of the difficulties we are up against in regard to this question of afforestation.  I believe it would be safer if farmers <Col N="1764" /> were assisted to plant such things as shelter belts.  These would supply him with whatever material he would require in the way of timber. Larger areas suitable for timber might be taken over, that is if the price seems anything like economic.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that has to be encountered is that good timber needs good land, and you will have a conflict between timber-producing land and agricultural land.  I believe that you will produce timber of a sort on poor land, but you cannot produce timber of a high quality on poor land.  As far as I see, going through the country, a good indication of good land is the class of timber grown on it.  That is apparent to anybody travelling through the country.  Therefore, I think, according to our present system, you will and must have a conflict between the question of pasture, tillage and afforestation.  I would like, therefore, to see the Minister put forward some definite scheme.  He has already made a partial attempt by means of the Afforestation Bill which he introduced quietly, to see what the results will be.  I hope the result will be to introduce some sort of scheme to encourage farmers, as far as possible, to re-plant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, we do not realise the importance of forestry to the country as a source of income and of wealth. In order that we may realise it.  I should like to give a few facts and figures to show what other countries <Col N="1765" /> are doing in the matter of forestry. In Czecho-Slovakia within recent years the central authorities there, the Government, I understand, have taken over upwards of 5,000,000 acres of privately-owned forests.  The result of taking over these forests is that in Czecho-Slovakia, a country about one and two-thirds the area of Ireland in about 53,000 square miles, there are upwards of 6,000 saw mills. There are about 900 worked by steam, about 2,000 by water, and 100 by electrical power.  In that 6,000 there are 3,000 modern high-speed sawmills, with a total annual cut of 200,000,000 cubic feet.</P>
    <P>The total annual cut of Czecho-Slovakia&mdash;when I say annual cut I mean lumber or sawn timber only&mdash; is three million cubic feet.  In that country there are 50 large, and upwards of 4,000 small, factories for the manufacture of furniture alone. Talking about nurseries for forestry in that country, there are seven factories for the sorting, drying and curing of forest seeds.  After supplying their own needs for young trees they export large quantities of the seeds.  The number of commodities manufactured from trees is enormous.  There are upwards of 600 different commodities manufactured from trees, including wood pulp for paper and for making cardboard, timber for furniture, box making and veneering.  There are also many kinds of chemicals manufactured from trees.  Also the artificial silk so much worn at present in ladies' stockings is manufactured from trees.  The principal item, however, is paper, the demand for which is increasing year by year enormously. To give an instance of that increase the total output of paper in the United States in 1810 was 3,000 tons.  In 1922, seven years ago, the output was seven million tons, and last year the output was ten million tons, so that in six years the increase in paper in the United States alone was three million tons.  We import almost all the timber we require.  We import practically all our paper, and at present I understand that more timber is being cut in the world <Col N="1766" /> than is being grown.  Some countries are alive to the need for planting. England is planting largely.  In Scotland only recently I saw where an outcry was raised because the Forestry Department had taken over some medium quality land to plant. The outcry was raised by those who did not understand the importance of forestry.  In America land is being devoted to forestry in preference to agriculture.  In Sweden there are one hundred wood pulp factories alone.  There are 200 paper and cardboard mills.  There are 2,000 mills and factories for the manufacture of furniture and for veneering, box making, sawing and planing.  The planing mills alone give employment to 44,000 people.  In 1923 the total amount of wood goods was £46,500,000, and the value of the wood goods exported by Sweden was £35,000,000.  The difference between the two amounts, eleven and a half million pounds, shows the value of the wood goods they use for their own needs.  They are satisfied to use native grown timber in their house building, in their furniture, and for all their needs.  I am sure if they have a restaurant attached to what is equivalent to the Dáil that that restaurant is not embellished with foreign-grown timber, as ours is.  I understand that the wainscotting in the restaurant is foreign timber, and I say it is a disgrace to the Government to have it there. We have timber grown here that should satisfy the æsthetic taste of anyone, and it should have been used.</P>

      <P>In the manufacture of the products of timber there is one item alone, sulphite spirit, which is used in the manufacture of ether, acetic acid, aniline dyes, and in heating and lighting.  The value of that alone in Sweden is three million <Col N="1767" /> pounds.  Timber is worth millions of pounds annually to Sweden and other countries.  It ought to be worth the same to us if we make up our minds to plant it as we ought.  The cause of the success of timber growing in Sweden is scientific forestry, allowing as little as possible of the profits derived from timber and the timber industry to leave the country, and the influence of the great Swedish forest banking corporation in Stockholm, which is Swedish in deed as well as in name, and which realises that it is the servant not the master of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of timber grown in Sweden on account of the poor soil is about 50 per cent. that of the timber grown in Germany, and it has been proved that we in Ireland can grow timber equal in quality to the timber grown in Germany.  Forestry in full swing would give more employment than is at present given by our greatest industry, agriculture, and even from the very start if we started forestry in this country in earnest on a national scale we would immediately cut the emigration figure in half.  As I said before other countries are alive to the importance of forestry and are planting accordingly but to have it a success it must be undertaken on a national scale.  It would pay us not only to plant the worst land but in fact it would pay us better to plant all except the really good land.  To do that, we should require a faculty of forestry to train young Irishmen to think in terms of trees for Ireland, not for another country.  We do not want forestry here to grow pit props for England or any other country. We are planning at present to grow pit props and by the time these young trees come to mature they will not be needed because electricity will very largely take the place of coal as power in future.  That is evident. As well as the faculty of forestry we should require a forestry Department and then a Commission to glean information from whatever sources possible.  Germany is, I understand, one of the foremost countries in forestry.  They go in for it on a <Col N="1768" /> scientific scale.  I think it should be taken up earnestly and I think the Labour members in this Dáil ought to be the first to insist on its being taken up on a large scale on account of the enormous employment it would give in this country and, God knows, we want employment for our people. We want to stop the yearly emigration that is going on.  If we take up forestry earnestly and as it ought to be taken up we will stop a great proportion of that emigration almost immediately.</P>

      <P>And these are the prospective statesmen who want the country to be handed over to them. Soft wood has an advantage over hard wood, in addition to there being a market for it.  We have a market for soft wood in all its stages.  I come from a part of the country that is reasonably well wooded, but there is not nearly enough larch to make the farm implements of the future.  It is very hard to get larch that will do for the front boards of a car.  It is very hard to get larch nine inches in <Col N="1771" /> diameter, and I do not know where it is going to be got in ten years' time.  I can very easily see a shortage of soft timber in the near future, especially of larch.  Soft timber has this additional advantage over hard timber, it comes to maturity earlier and it will grow in a latitude at which hard timber will not.  You need not go very high in a mountain when you will not get hard timber to grow.  Oak will only grow on arable land.  It will not grow on your mountain ranges.  It must have good soil.  Land for hard timber must be low as compared with soft timber.  There are very few of the hills of Ireland on which you could grow it, while soft timber can be grown right to the top except the rocks stop it.  Deputy O'Reilly, while standing up to support Deputy Ryan's motion, actually answered the points that Deputy Ryan made.  Instead of being a speech in support of the motion, it was a refutation of Deputy Ryan's amendment.</P>

      <P>The reason manufactured timber is coming here in such large quantities is that we cannot grow that particular class of timber at home.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast bulk of the £1,500,000 worth imported is for roofing and flooring.  The amount imported for furniture is negligible; it is not worth speaking about.  All the pine imported is for church or other purposes.  The white deal is for flooring and roofing.  There would not be £100,000 worth of timber imported except for roofing and flooring, and pine for church purposes. At present we are having a very lean period, and unless the Department gets busy and puts down vast areas of soft timber in the near future we will be in the position of having to import even the makings of our carts.  It is suggested that we have some employment in hard woods. The answer to that is that there is no work in the country in hard woods. The reason ash and sycamore are leaving the country is because they are suitable for handles and shafting and for aeroplane construction; that is why there is a good market for them.  I have plenty of timber to sell and I cannot find a market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see where hard wood can be used except in the making of coffins.  There are as many elms in Ireland as will make coffins for China for the next fifty years.  The principal hard woods are oak, beech and elm.  They are good for ornamentation. There they are and there they will remain cumbering the land and growing on good land. They are there for ornament but they are doing a good deal of damage. Where the good land is there will always be a clash between forestry and agriculture.  The people must have the arable land.  They <Col N="1774" /> cannot eat timber or the leaves of the trees.  Timber will have to give way on the arable land in order to accommodate the people.  There is any amount of high land suitable for soft timber and nothing else.  It is not arable, and it is not suitable for hard timber.  It can be exploited in the growing of soft timber.  Again, railway sleepers are imported.  If you put down white and red deal and pine and timber suitable for railway sleepers you will have exhausted Deputy Ryan's £1,500,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else in the House, I am in favour of the promotion of forestry.  I realise, with Deputy Heffernan, that you want a long purse for forestry. You will not get a return for a very considerable time.  Consequently, it is not possible, in the present state of the finances of this country, for a very large sum of money to be put down at once for that object, however deserving it may be.  But every year the Minister, following the general desire of the House and of the country, has been spending judiciously a certain sum of money in the planting of trees, and in improving forestry generally.  Deputy Buckley, who, along with Deputy Colohan and myself, represents the County Kildare, talked a great deal about different countries abroad and about their capacities for growing timber.  But he did not say anything about the county we represent, which is one of the best timber counties in Ireland up to date and which has been so in the years that have gone past.  There have been for many years three nurseries established <Col N="1775" /> to supply the wants of the country with the class of timber that is suitable for afforestation. This has been going on for the last twenty-eight or twenty-nine years. Previously to that, a great many landowners, whatever their faults may have been&mdash;and no doubt they were many&mdash;were not deficient or backward in any way in helping in the matter of tree planting and growing timber.  As a rule, they showed a considerable amount of sense in the style of wood that they selected.</P>
      <P>As a case in point, I may say that, following a good many of my own people who have gone in for tree planting, I have watched afforestation with a good deal of interest. My father went in very considerably for tree planting.  He had a certain estate, which I have now handed over voluntarily at a fair price to the Land Commission.  In the year 1840, there was not a single tree on that estate.  My father planted continuously from 1840 to 1872.  He planted every year.  The result is there to-day to be seen.  In the storm of the 27th February, 1903, the whole country was devastated, and my place along with others. Over 2,000 trees were knocked down on my estate, but one would scarcely notice that number out of the amount of timber on the estate. I sold a certain number of trees during the war years, and the cutting of those trees improved the plantation considerably.  The Land Commission will now, I hope, profit by the trees that have become their property.  I think they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that tree planting was a paying proposition for my father or for anybody that ever planted is a matter that I question very much.  It was done with the idea of giving employment and of beautifying the country.  I am afraid that any money spent on a large scale in this country will have to be spent on those lines &mdash;that is to beautify the country and to give employment.  That timber that is of great value to the country, as Deputy Gorey pointed out, timber that is required for the urgent needs <Col N="1776" /> of the country, can be got here in great quantities will not, to my mind, ever be the case.  The timber that grows best in this country is timber that is of the least value.  That is the case, with certain exceptions.  Ash and sycamore, which are of value, do grow pretty extensively.  Oak, too, grows well.  But, as Deputy Gorey remarked, there is no value in oak.  I know something about that.  I have a fair number of oak trees myself. They are fairly good specimens, but they are of very little value.  Nobody would plant oak now because it would not pay.  It is of no use saying that when you go and plant a tree that tree will have a market when it is matured.  We cannot plant timber that is unsuitable to the country, however valuable it may be.</P>
    <P>For good timber we will always have to look abroad for our supplies. We cannot plant wood that is unsuitable to the climate, no matter how valuable it may be.  That wood will die in a very short time.  At least that is my experience.  That the planting of timber is of value to the country I believe and I hope that the work will go on every year and that a certain amount will be spent on it, as the Minister is doing at present, and doing judiciously.  In the employment that it will give, and in the fact that we can afford to spend that money and afford more or less to lose on it, I think it will be of great value from the point of view of the giving of that employment and beautifying the country.  I hope that the work will proceed as it has been proceeding.</P>
    <P>As regards the statistics about timber, I have not gone into that.  I do not know anything about that.  But I think that it is of value to plant land that is not wanted.  We can never hope on that same land, at the same time, to produce the best timber. As Deputy O'Reilly said, you require good land for good timber, and we cannot afford to plant on good land.  Such land cannot be taken for tree planting.  It is required for division or for the enlargement of holdings, and it certainly cannot be given over for the purpose of growing timber.  We must <Col N="1777" /> use that land for other purposes.  But we can make use of certain land, mountainy land, bog land, and land of that sort that is not of much use for other things.  We can use such land for the growing of timber.  We may, to a certain extent, grow in such land timber that would be of much use to us, but we cannot grow the best and the most suitable timber that is necessary for our requirements. I hope the Minister will proceed in the way in which he has been proceeding, year after year, adding to the timber acreage of the country, and in that way adding to the beauty and the attractiveness of the country in many ways.  I do not hold with the expending of any vast sum of money on this work, because I do not think that there is any fortune to be made out of timber either now or at any future time in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be no harm if one were to start on the note on which the last speaker finished. That is that nobody can make a fortune by planting timber.  It is like the Centenary celebrations.  Anybody who saw them will never see another.  Nobody who plants timber will ever live to reap the benefits of it.  But it does not follow that the State should not plant timber, and plant it in such quantities that at some future date some persons in this country, persons who will be living then in this country, can and will reap the benefit from that planting. I am not satisfied that the Minister in his policy has done all that he should have done in regard to afforestation.  There is no doubt there is a lot of truth in the speeches that have been made&mdash; when people say that tree planting would cost money.  Very little can be done in the country at the present time that does not cost money. What we want to do is to invest money in the best possible way, even though we will not get rich quickly ourselves as a result of that. Some generations who will come after us will reap the benefit. Deputy Gorey proved to my satisfaction that his knowledge of timber <Col N="1778" /> was&mdash;well, not just as good as it might be.  According to Deputy Gorey one would think that the only use we had for timber was the making of shafts for carts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at present, fortunately or unfortunately, there are other uses for timber than the making of shafts for carts.  The Deputy said, in relation to elm, that we had enough elm to make coffins for the population of China for the next fifty years.  He may be right or he may be wrong, but it does not follow that elm in this country is not a valuable asset to the country.  I would like to remind Deputy Gorey and other Deputies that there are other things besides coffins made from elm.  The colleague who sits behind him will be able to tell him that they make sterns for boats out of this timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will have enough also to make the kitchen chairs that are required in the country. Deputy Gorey may not be aware of the fact that some of the best kitchen chairs are made from elm.  He also assured us that there was no market for hard wood.  He said he had to give away hard wood, that he could get no price for it.  I say, with all respect to him, that that is nonsense, because if you go into a furniture shop and try to buy anything made of oak you will find the price is a good stiff price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy through you.  I have never sold an oak tree, because I never had an oak tree to sell, but what I and my father before me have done <Col N="1779" /> is: we have cut down oak trees for somebody else to sell, so I know a little about that end.  Deputy Gorey assured us that there is no market for oak.  But still I find if I have to go into a shop to buy furniture that I have to pay quite a good price for oak.  I have seen some of the finest churches in this country panelled with oak.  They were not panelled with teak, like our restaurant.  Of course, they were job lots, and I suppose they got them cheaply, and I can hardly blame them for taking a bargain.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about hard woods and soft woods.  Deputy O'Reilly is quite right, of course, when he says that the better classes of timber&mdash;the hard woods&mdash;require good land.  That is very true up to a point, but I have seen the best of elm grown on bog soil.  I have seen good sycamore grown in places where it seemed impossible that sycamore could grow.  There you have two useful woods.  Beech requires very good soil, but not the kind of soil you would have to throw people out of in order to grow it, and beech is useful, as Deputy Gorey and others probably know, for the manufacture of handles for carpenters' tools&mdash;for planes and other things.  If Deputy Gorey will stand up and interrupt me decently I will sit down and give him an opportunity, if the Ceann Comhairle permits.  I cannot speak and listen-in at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of trees that can be grown, not alone on lowlying lands, but on mountain land that is also bog or peaty land, and I think every Deputy who knows anything about his job will admit that when you cut out any bog, even on a mountain, you will find bog deal.  These trees grew, flourished and died on bog soil.  Where deal grew once it can be grown again. Deputy Gorey might want us to grow Oregon pine, California redwood, or something else, to supply him with floor boards, but if deal grew once in this country it can grow again.  As a matter of fact, <Col N="1780" /> you have quite an amount of it growing in the country at present. You might not be able to get deal planks out of it similar to what you get from Oregon pine, redwood or Douglas fir.  You will not get the same growth of timber out of it, but still you will get quite sufficient for your own use, and the timber will be quite good enough for ordinary purposes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about larch. There is a shortage of larch.  Why should there not be?  Why should there not be a shortage of all timber in the country?  I have seen during the war thousands of tons of timber cut, made up into rafts, brought away, chained behind steamers, cut into eleven feet lengths and sent away for pit props or for making into railway sleepers.  Thousands of tons went out of the country during the war and nothing has been done to replace them.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has done all that he could have done to replace that loss to the country.  Some time ago Deputy Cassidy put down a question with regard to the planting of Donegal.  He discovered to his surprise that nothing had been done, comparatively speaking, to deal with afforestation in Donegal.  There are huge tracts there that could be planted with pine.  We can see advertisements in all the papers that we take up about the pine forests in Germany, Norway and elsewhere. These countries want people to go there for health purposes.  We have plenty of spaces where pine could be grown and grown well, but the Minister is making absolutely no effort to do it.  There is not a mountain tract with bog soil on which we could not grow pine easily, but the thing is not being taken up at all.</P>
    <P>There is another timber&mdash;elder&mdash; which is not so very valuable but which is very useful in some ways. It is a very quick-growing timber and can be used for the purpose of making wind breaks for other timber that takes a long time to mature. There is just one danger with elder and it is this, that it grows so quickly and practically seeds itself.  It almost plants and grows itself.  It <Col N="1781" /> might spread too much, but, of course, that could always be obviated if Deputy O'Reilly's suggestion were carried out, that is, if large tracts were taken over that were not suitable for any other purpose, say a mountain tract in Donegal of 500, 600 or 1,000 acres, and if there was a forester appointed to look after the timber and to replace with new plants any losses that occurred.  If that were done you would have such a difference as the Minister has never yet seen in this country.  The forester could give seeds to the farmers, who would put up shelter belts.  I would venture to say that 75 per cent. of the shelter belts are a complete loss because they seem to have been planted too closely, with the consequence that the trees killed one another and nothing could be seen except dead plantations.  It stands to reason that when a farmer has a couple of acres of a shelter belt he does not bother himself very much about it.  In the first place; perhaps, he does not know very much about preservation, and, secondly, he does not care very much.  But if there were 500, 600 or 1,000 acres planted with timber and a forester appointed for the purpose of looking after it, or after a couple of plantations, it would be his duty to do so and he could do it well.</P>
    <P>A good deal of money is paid in salaries, but we have, comparatively speaking, very little education in forestry, and if you educated these men up to the point when they could look after trees, preserve those that were decaying, take over tracts of country that are at present, comparatively speaking, worthless, and plant them, you would then have not alone a valuable asset in the form of timber which would mature in 30, 40 or 50 years' time, but you would have quite a distinct change from the health point of view from what we have had for years owing to the shortage of timber.  If the Minister had all these places planted with pine a time would come, if we live long enough, when we might read such advertisements as &ldquo;Come to Donegal and Connemara and recuperate <Col N="1782" /> in the pine forests.&rdquo;  At present all we have is plenty of moisture, without any timber to take it up.</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion to the Minister with regard to the elders for this reason&mdash;I do not know whether it has been tried or not, and I am not sure of it, but in my own experience I have seen belts of elder that planted themselves from seeds carried by birds or by the water, and in five or six years, where formerly there had been nothing but grass, it was almost impossible to push one's way through the elder trees.  It has its use, first of all, as a shelter belt, because it grows quickly and it prevents young plants from being destroyed by storms; and, secondly, it has its use for the manufacture of clog soles.  There was quite a big trade carried on with Lancashire and Yorkshire in the manufacture of clog soles made from elder.  I worked at it for a pastime when I was a kid, and it was quite a valuable product, because quite a good deal of money was made at it.  Also, during the coal strike, about three years ago, elder with turf was the standby of about 5,000 people in the place to which I belong.  They cut elder down and sold it to the poor people who could not afford to buy coal at the price that was then charged for it.  So that as well as using it for shelter belts the Minister could have it for the other two purposes&mdash;for the making of clog soles or for firewood, if we were to run short of fuel.  We are not to suppose that the Shannon scheme will provide us with all the heat that we need within the next ten or fifteen years, for example, so that elder would be a valuable standby.</P>
    <P>I think that these are all the points with which I wanted to deal. I hope that before Deputy Gorey talks about giving 2,000 tons of timber away again he will find out what uses his timber might be put to, because otherwise he might find that he was making a big present of timber to somebody.  If he would only go round the furniture shops or the undertakers he would discover that there might be quite a big <Col N="1783" /> market for his elm or oak, or whatever it may be.</P>

      <P>(West Cork): I rise most heartily to support the Forestry Vote of the Minister for Agriculture. After the very substantial vote of confidence that was passed in him early to-day, I expected he would get some little consideration, but I find there are many forestry experts on the opposite side firing in their advice on him, but firing in no money to his Exchequer, who are very careful with regard to his Department. We were told by one Deputy to study what Sweden, what Germany, and what England had done for forestry for some years past, yea, for centuries. Here we are, a small nation, with the State only seven years in existence, and I defy anyone to prove that the nations mentioned by Deputies on the other side have accomplished more than this Government has accomplished in every department of State during its term of office.  One would imagine, as far as forestry is concerned, that the Government had been neglectful. A substantial sum is being asked by the Minister for forestry, and I thought it would have been passed with enthusiasm, that we would have had no more of this work that has been going on for three days&mdash;blocking him and endeavouring to hold up the work of agriculture.  I have to congratulate the Dáil on the substantial vote it gave earlier in passing the Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture.  I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister's Vote for Forestry will also be carried by a large majority.  The Minister is nothing to me personally.  I never met him until I entered the Dáil, but I wish to testify, with an experience of public men extending over half a century, that I never came into touch with a more disinterested, honest or zealous public servant than the Minister for Agriculture.  He has been here, there and everywhere.  Only a few days ago he was in England endeavouring <Col N="1784" /> to open up markets for the farmers of Ireland, so that this country might be able to reduce its adverse trade balance.  He is met here by wonderful experts.  I wish to know from them how many trees they have planted since they entered the Dáil.  Have they ever planted a tree?  I am anxious to hear Deputy MacEntee's views on this matter.  He is the one man who is able to catechise us all as to our ability.  As far as forestry is concerned, I am waiting until he joins the other fusiliers who fire away without having a tree in their gardens.  I commiserate with you.  Minister for Agriculture. At the rate the Opposition is going on.  I am afraid they will keep you here a little longer.  My advice to you is: &ldquo;Be of good heart; do not be alarmed at the shouting, the sneering and the laughing on the other side; you are building up the nation steadily; you hold our principal industry&mdash;agriculture; the country recognises that you are doing a man's part in developing that industry, and afforestation is part and parcel of that work.  It is one of the planks in that movement: stick to it and you will have the Dáil behind you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is one question I want to put to the Minister with regard to the forests that are cleared. Is it the practice of the Department to sell these forests in the ordinary way to local traders, and is there any prohibition put upon the export of such timber?  In the last annual report of the Department it was stated that 67¾ acres in one area had been cleared, and it was mentioned that the timber was sold to local traders. If it be the practice to sell that timber, regardless of what its destination is, could the Minister give us an idea as to the economics of such transactions?  Has it paid the State to plant trees and care for them year after year, over a long term, and then to sell them in the ordinary way at the very small price that is paid for our timber?  We would like to know what is the Government's opinion of such work. Is it a good way of spending <Col N="1785" /> public funds, or is there any other method they could adopt?  Could they make any conditions as to the use of the timber, or, at least, would it not be an advisable thing to try to keep it in the country for home use?  From what I know of the subject, and from what I heard this afternoon, it seems to me that it cannot be a paying proposition for the State to spend money on forests, and after a long period of years to sell the product at the very low price that prevails at present for raw timber.  Perhaps the Minister would give some idea as to the economics of forestry generally, and the vision of the Department on the matter.  At the present rate of progress in planting and enlarging plantations, does he consider that a time will come when the country will be able to supply itself with timber?  Does he think the outlay is justified from that point of view?  Further, is the factor of the employment it gives one of the reasons why the Forestry Department deserves support, and one of the reasons why money is being spent upon it?  We are altogether in the dark as to the real position that the Department is aiming at.  We have never been told anything as to the present position, what the plantations are worth, what they will be worth within a period of, say, ten years, or what they may be worth in twenty years.  We have never been told what is the aim of the Department, whether it is to plant timber so that the country may be as independent as possible of outside supplies, whether the idea is to give as much employment as possible, or whether other factors, such as an effort to improve the climate, are also at the back of the development of plantations.  If the Minister could spare time this evening to give us some idea of what the Department is thinking on these matters we would be greatly obliged.</P>

If that is the case, I would like to know from the Minister how many acres he has acquired in <Col N="1786" /> Kerry for forestry purposes, and how many acres he has planted.

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that oak is required for the ribs and the keels of boats.  Elm is also required for boats, so that there is a good demand for elm and oak for both purposes.  As Deputy Carney pointed out, there are plenty of uses, especially as regards furniture making, for oak.  If a man goes looking for a sideboard and it is made of oak, he will very quickly be told that, and a nice price will be put on it because it is made of oak. With regard to a substitute for white deal, during the great war, there was no fault found with spruce as a substitute for white deal.  A number of woods in which spruce was grown were cut down at the time and the timber was utilised for the making of egg boxes, butter boxes and flooring, so that there is no need to be importing white deal while we have spruce in the country. Deputy Carney has said all that I wanted to say on this subject. Before concluding, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the amount of waste land that there is in South Kerry that could be very profitably planted with trees.  I do not see that the Minister has made any move in that direction so far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is time we left out the question whether it is advisable to have hard timber or soft timber.  We should cease arguing about that and concentrate on the growing of timber, growing it on land that is suitable for the purpose, <Col N="1787" /> and not suitable for agriculture. We have an amount of such land, and why not avail of it?  Our complaint against the Department is, not that they are spending too much money, but that they are not spending enough on afforestation. Apart from the value of timber as a marketable commodity, there is another value attached to afforestation that is too often left out of sight, and that is its value to the country from a health and scenic point of view.  We hear a lot from time to time about tourist traffic, and that we should do everything possible to encourage it.  If we make the country more beautiful than it is, then we will be doing something in the way of encouraging tourist traffic.  One of the best ways to accomplish that is to endeavour to clothe our mountain slopes again, as they were in the old days, with timber.  I do not want to advert again to the hard versus soft timber question, but I have seen beech grown in very considerable quantities and sold at a very good price. The demand for it was so strong that the people who owned it refused to sell any more of it.  A sawmill which was working in the district, and which was giving a considerable amount of employment, had to clear out of the area because they could get no more of that timber.  Had they got the timber they would have used every stick of beech in the place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>That sawmill is now working in another part of Ireland and is using beech.  On the question of oak, some time ago I had to get quotations for Austrian and Irish oak.  The price quoted for Austrian oak, if one wanted to get it for the purpose of manufacturing it into furniture in this country, was considerable. <Col N="1788" /> I succeeded in getting some Irish oak that had been cut in South Tipperary and that had been properly seasoned.  The furniture that has been made from it is just as good as furniture made from Austrian oak.  I think the trouble with us in this country is that we have never had scientific afforestation.  Trees have been allowed to grow up haphazard all over the country, to grow up from saplings and to branch out in all directions.  The result has been that our timber has never been scientifically cultivated.  That, also, to a great extent, accounts for the fact that we cannot produce timber to equal the Norwegian timber.  In this country you cannot get scantlings for building purposes from the native timber to equal what comes from Norway.  I believe the reason for that is that we have never attempted to tackle this question of afforestation in the way that the Norwegians and others have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no scientific drying sheds and no scientific forestry at all.  At the present time all over the country you have hard wood growing, but not on a very good soil, and the result is that it is almost useless.  I know a case myself where there are hundreds of acres of oak growing, but it is absolutely useless except for firewood.  It would be a pity to cut it away, because it adds to the beauty of the place in which it is growing, but from a marketable point of view it is practically useless.  I agree with Deputy Gorey to this extent, that we should grow soft timber as well as hard.  It grows quickly, and I think we should grow more of it.  Our complaint against the Department is that they are not growing enough of it. Some time ago I called to the Department on behalf of some farmers who wanted to dispose of some land. This land was not good enough for agricultural purposes.  It might be made so if reclaimed, but they wished the Department to purchase it.  To carry out with success a scheme of afforestation, you must have an area of about 300 acres of land.  None of these people could supply that amount of land.  I tried to persuade a number of their neighbours to join <Col N="1789" /> in a group with them to make up the quantity of land that would really be necessary for a scheme of afforestation. I wonder would it be possible for the Department to help people in the position that these people are in, people who are anxious to make use of their land for afforestation purposes and to whom the land is of very little use for any other purpose. No individual farmer could afford to carry out afforestation, even on the smallest scale that would be possible, unless he got some State aid.</P>
    <P>If the Department, in the immediate future, cannot embark on any large schemes, would it be possible for it to help farmers who might be willing to plant waste areas of land in their possession?  There is this to be said against it, that if we are to have scientific afforestation it must be done by the State.  The individual cannot do it because he cannot devote the time to watching the trees, thinning them out, and properly fencing them, which is most important.  If we have to do it properly we must concentrate on large schemes.  If it is possible to give any assistance to farmers who are willing and anxious to do some planting it would be well if some scheme could be devised.  I hope care will be taken if trees are planted anywhere near a public road that they will be kept back far enough so as not to injure the road. At present, we have some very nice leafy lanes in the country, but where the trees overhang the road they are doing serious damage to public property. It is hard to keep the road in proper repair if the boughs of trees overhang it.  In any scheme under the Department I hope the trees will not be planted too near a public road.  In foreign countries trees that are planted near the roadsides do not branch out and spread over the roads in any way.  In my county numbers of people are threatened with prosecution every year because they find it almost impossible to keep their trees cut.</P>

I would like to ask the Minister if he would give me information as to the amount of <Col N="1790" /> work done in County Mayo by the Forestry Department.  To my knowledge, there has been none whatever done.  I am aware that three or four men combined and offered 300 acres along the main road, near Newport on the Castlebar road.

      <P>Dooher was the name of the man with whom the Minister was in communication.  On the Jones and Gibbons estate, about 500 acres were offered, and nothing has come of the offer, so far as I am aware.  I believe I am safe in saying that there are upwards of 1,000,000 acres of mountain land not fit for tillage, and that a large portion of it could be serviceably utilised by planting it with timber, particularly soft wood, so that I am in agreement with Deputy Gorey upon that point.  In reply to another point made by Deputy Gorey, as regards hard wood, I would like to add to the reply of Deputy Carney that practically all the carriage work of the country is made of hard wood, and the framework particularly, both in the railway stock, the buses, and the road waggons.  I think the Forestry Department ought to give some consideration to County Mayo in view of the fact that it has done nothing for that county in the past, as far as I can make out, and it should give us, at least, a shelter of timber on our hillsides. That will help the game on the mountains and the murroughs.  That will be helpful in places where there may be some tillage, and it will add to the beauty of the countryside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is in the County of Waterford an estate upon which there is a considerable amount of timber grown.  That was sold during the War.  The land, I believe, would be valuable for replanting.  I refer to the Villiers-Stuart estate.  I hope the Minister will see that the matter <Col N="1791" /> will be inquired into.  Speaking generally on our criticism of the Department, one would say there is a lack of attempt to deal with this question from a really national point of view.  It is all very well to be protecting private interests and to believe in private enterprise, but it is making a fetish of private enterprise to leave the question of afforestation in Ireland to go on in a haphazard way, and simply to legislate in the way of preventing timber being cut and not making proper inquiries as to the value of timber at present in existence in the country. In Waterford, there are a number of estates&mdash;I know of three&mdash;where timber is grown.  There are demesne lands all over Ireland where valuable timber is grown.  I do not know &mdash;perhaps the Minister would tell us&mdash;whether they have made any attempt to value timber on those estates, and to put forward a national scheme which would include co-operation with the owners of that timber so that it might be used for national purposes.  I mean that, first of all, we should find out what is the need for timber in this country.  We import £124,256 worth of furniture.  That is the figure for 1928.  Surely we ought to be able, if we are trying to develop the furniture trade, to develop the supply to the furniture trade, so that we could supplant all the imports of furniture, and not only have homemade furniture, but furniture made of Irish wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey's complaint that there is no market for a certain type of wood which is admirable for making furniture, is in itself a severe condemnation not of the Forestry Department but of the Minister.  A Department, if it gets a sufficiently emphatic direction, will carry out the larger national policy.  It is the Minister's work to see that the experts carry out the national policy which his Cabinet stands for.  It is really on the question of a big policy that the Department fails.  Having found out what the need would be for the requirement of raw material in Ireland, <Col N="1792" /> then the next thing to find out is what supply there is.  There is a certain amount of mature oak in this country, and there is a considerable amount of other woods suitable for supplying our needs.  Can the Ministry tell us whether they have made any valuation of the actual supplies in the country and tried to relate it to the consumption of material in the country?  At present the general view is expressed in this way: That we grow timber that we cannot use, and that we cannot grow timber that we want to use.  Deputy Gorey tried to divide the House into those Deputies whose heads were full of soft timber as distinct from those whose heads were full of hard timber. That, I suggest, is, in a sense, a red herring across the track, because there must be use in the country for both soft and hard timber.  I suggest the idea which should be insisted upon by the Forestry Department or the Minister is the amount of timber and the kinds of timber which are required to be used in this country, and to take up the attitude that we should be able to exclude the importation of much of the raw materials in all the furniture so as to use what is in this country.  The particular advantage which would come from paying attention to the actual demesnes is that you would be building from what you have.  There is an amount of valuable timber in the demesne lands.  We should make a valuation of the timber and see how far those forests could be used for development. The seeds which come from that timber are acclimatised, and, therefore, would be most valuable for further extensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our policy with regard to forestry is completely unambitious and will entirely disappoint Fianna Fáil Deputies, but it is at least concrete.  We think that there are about 200,000 acres of plantable land in the country.  We have acquired about 30,000 acres of that, and we propose to acquire the balance at the rate of about 5,000 acres per annum.  We have succeeded <Col N="1793" /> up to the present in acquiring about 4,000 acres per year, but we hope, with the additional powers given by the Forestry Act to acquire something like 5,000 per annum. Going at that rate, we would acquire something like 200,000 acres in about 40 years, but when we get more money next year or the year after&mdash; there is nothing to stop the Dáil, as Deputy Heffernan pointed out, putting more money at the disposal of the Forestry Branch&mdash;and have a clearer idea as a result of experience where suitable land is for forestry purposes, and have developed our nurseries, we can increase the acquisition of land after some time to 7,000 or 8,000 or 10,000 acres annually, and it is quite on the cards that we might be able to finish the programme in 25 or 30 years, which would be quite good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked what is the big idea behind this.  It is that, so far as we have any information, there are about 200,000 acres of really suitable forestry land.  Deputy Kilroy is wrong in saying that there are a million acres suitable for forestry in Mayo; there is not.  He is thinking of land along the sea coast, which is poor land entirely unsheltered.  It is much the same type of land as there is in Connemara.  That is entirely unsuitable for forestry, and will never be planted, as far as we know now.  There may be discoveries and possible new varieties that will settle that, but we do not know of them at present.  Experiments were made in Connemara and have failed. There was an attempt made to plant areas along the sea coast on the best land we could get of this kind; of course there is no good land there. These experiments were a failure to a great extent, and we are not in a position at present to waste money upon propositions which were conclusively proved to be uneconomic. We believe, as I said, that there are about 200,000 acres of plantable land, and we propose to acquire that at the rate which I have indicated and to plant it.  On the other side, about 200,000 acres of State-owned forests will produce about two-thirds of the total requirements of <Col N="1794" /> the country in soft woods.  If we were in a position to produce two-thirds of our total requirements, we would be in a fairly sound position. The beauty of this programme, which I am quite sure Deputies opposite will not see, is that it is achievable.  If in future years there is more money which can be spared for that purpose, the machinery is all there, the section is going, and it will be available, and we can speed up that programme.  At present we consider ourselves lucky to acquire about 5,000 acres per annum.</P>
    <P>I need not answer Deputy Moore's question.  What he really wanted to know was whether we thought there should be any forestry in the country at all.  I take it for granted that everyone would like to see increased planting.  It would be a waste of time to go into all the reasons for increasing the forest area.  I take it it is common ground on both sides of the House that it would be an advantage to increase the area.  I need not labour the reasons&mdash;they have been given by several Deputies.  I do not propose either to go into the question between soft and hard timbers except to say that, roughly speaking, Deputy Gorey is right.  There is practically no price for hard timber. Nobody denies that there are uses to which it can be put.  Deputies indicated these uses.  At the same time, the fact is that there is practically no price for it.  With the exception of ash and sycamore, there is a very poor price for hard timber. While there are uses for it, the price is bad.  Furthermore, it takes very much better land to grow hard timber, and that is a serious consideration in this country, where we have much congestion; where the farms on the average are so small; and where you have a very small area of untenanted land left. So that we have to take into account, on one side, in thinking out our programme, that land is very valuable in this country; that a large section of the people have no other means of making a living but out of the land.  That is a rather <Col N="1795" /> bad point of view, but the fact remains that it is so&mdash;that for a very large section of the community there is only one way of making a living, and that is to get a piece of land. Land will become increasingly valuable as estates are taken over and divided up, and we have to be very careful not to acquire land that is suitable for agricultural purposes. It ought to be obvious to anyone that it would be bad economics from the point of view of the individual or of the State to acquire land for forestry purposes which is suitable for agricultural purposes.  For these reasons, we do not plant nearly as much hard timber as soft timber, but we do plant some&mdash;ash, beech, and so on.  Moreover, there is a considerable amount of clm and other hard timber in the country at present&mdash;there is, in fact, nearly enough to meet the requirements of the country.  But commercial considerations, with which the Forestry Branch have nothing to do, enter into the matter.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by Deputy Moore what we did with the woods when we acquired them.  To begin with, most of the woods we sell are woods we buy.  We buy an area of land on which there is immature timber, and we sell that.  We go into the open market in order to get the highest price.  We could not possibly make a condition with a purchaser, say, in Tipperary, that this timber must be treated or used in the country.  If we did, we would simply have to take a very much smaller price.  The Dáil has never decided that the Forestry Branch should become a sort of economic grand council and take charge of national policy in that way.  The Forestry Branch exists for the purpose of growing trees.  They are concerned with the economics of forestry as such, but they are not concerned&mdash;that is the business of other Departments&mdash;with the use made of the trees afterwards.  If the Forestry Branch took that into account, the Tariff Commission, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and other Departments, could <Col N="1796" /> be abolished.  That is their function. The proper function of the Dáil is to decide a question like that, not in relation to a forestry estimate, but in relation to a tariff debate, or some other of the economic debates that arise out of the estimates I mentioned. The Forestry Branch, on the other hand, is performing its functions if it confines itself to acquiring land and growing timber in the largest possible quantities, having regard to the amount of money at its disposal.  If there is a national policy definitely laid down by the Dáil and adopted by the Government that all the requirements of the country in the way of woodwork must be produced from native-grown timber, it is the business of the Minister to alter the policy of the Forestry Branch to coincide with that.  But, until that decision is come to, the business of the Forestry Branch is to decide what are the most suitable trees that can be grown on the land they are likely to get, and to grow as many of them as possible at the smallest possible price.  When it comes to selling, it is not the business of the branch to decide that there is not enough furniture and that there are not enough chairs and boats made in the country and that it is a condition that must be made with the buyers of trees from the Forestry Department that they must make them into chairs and furniture in the country. It is the business of the Forestry Department to get the highest possible price they can for the trees and to put it to an appropriation-in-aid of the Vote and use it again for the planting and growing of more trees.  It is the business of the Dáil and the Government to decide whether chairs or furniture or boats made in the country should be made from the timber of trees that are grown here.</P>
    <P>I have been asked a question as to why we do not produce the seedlings we require.  We do not produce them all; we produce round about three-fourths of them, and our aim is, and it is an aim that we are carrying out, to increase our nurseries each year so that all the seedlings <Col N="1797" /> we require after a few years will be produced in the country.  We realise it is quite sound, from every point of view, that our seedlings, as far as possible, should be produced in the country, and we are approaching that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were concerned that their own counties were neglected and not included amongst those where land is purchased.  With a modest forestry programme of acquiring about five thousand acres a year, it is not unlikely that certain counties, for some reason or other, will be for some years neglected, if you like, or that in certain counties no land will be bought for forestry purposes.  The Forestry Branch has to buy land where it can get it and where it is suitable.  Wicklow land is notoriously suitable for growing trees.  There are lots of poor land which for special reasons is not suitable for agriculture, but is notoriously suitable for the growth of trees.  If a proposition comes from Wicklow for the purchase of five or six or one thousand acres for the Forestry Branch, they cannot afford to say: &ldquo;We have already four thousand, or five thousand or seventeen thousand acres there, and because we have we will not buy these.&rdquo;  That would be bad business and would be a mixing up of their functions.  The function of the Forestry Branch is to buy land where it is cheap and suitable, and in that matter they cannot afford to be provincial.  They take into account first, that they are getting the land cheaply; secondly, that it is suitable for forestry; and thirdly, that it is not suitable for agricultural purposes; and they put these three considerations together and they deduce from them that the purchase of that land will be good value for the country as a whole, that the trees planted will do well and will make money which can be used elsewhere. It is because they approach the matter in that way that Donegal and Mayo&mdash;where there is not so much suitable land, where there is a tremendously keen demand for any middling land for the relief of congestion&mdash;have <Col N="1798" /> been neglected, if you like.</P>
    <P>With regard to estates that were mentioned by Deputy Kilroy and others, I have not the particulars by me at the moment.  I have not the list of the estates offered to the Forestry Branch, but I will undertake to see what has happened and whether the proposed deal has fallen through; and I shall do that also with regard to the Villiers-Stuart mentioned by Deputy Little.  We must get areas of about three hundred acres in order to have them economic areas.  We do not intend, and I do not think the Deputies were ever led to believe that we intended, to enter into vast schemes of afforestation such as are produced in countries like Czecho-Slovakia, where they buy up thousands and thousands of acres, and where they keep foresters and gangers and surveyors in charge of them.  While Deputy Buckley's speech was quite interesting and while his statistics were, I am sure, quite correct with regard to Norway and Sweden and Czecho-Slovakia and other countries, they have really nothing to do with this question here.</P>
    <P>Sweden has about fifty million acres of forest always renewing themselves.  They do not do any planting.  Probably there is a body in Stockholm, such as the Deputy mentioned, to control the growth of trees, but they have not to do any planting except experiments with new varieties.  Anyway there is no comparison at all between the conditions in Sweden and in this country. Neither is there any comparison between the conditions in Germany and in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more afforestation in this country.  From every point of view the country has been denuded of trees.  Deputy Heffernan was right in saying that for the money expended on forestry a great amount of employment is not given, but it gives a fair amount.  If you take into account not only the advantages it produces in giving a certain amount of employment, but from the point of view of producing material needed, and also from the <Col N="1799" /> scenic point of view, and from the point of view of the amenities of life, and of the tourists coming here, there is no doubt whatever about it forestry is a particular type of activity that I would like to see increased. But, again, it is a question of money.  We could handle twice as much money as we have.  We are not asking for an awful lot, but again we have to balance accounts, and we propose to ask ourselves whether we ought to wait or whether we ought to tax our people further this year for this special purpose.  Deputy Wolfe was right in saying that you must have a long purse.  He did not mean to suggest that a good dividend is not paid by forestry carried out by the State or by an individual.  In fact, it does. What he suggested is that you have to wait for a relatively long time before you get a return.  We have to take that into account when we consider what amount of money should be at the disposal of the Forestry Branch.  We have to take into account that we want money for a lot of urgent purposes at the moment, and while we take into account that forestry has a variety of advantages in the way of giving employment, and in other directions, we have nevertheless to realise that for the money expended there is going to be little return for a long time, and we have to ask ourselves when there are many more urgent matters that require the expenditure of money if it is good business to go too deeply into forestry.  I am hopeful that we will be able to increase this Vote in time to come.  We have the advantage of having what is regarded as a rather exceptional forestry section.  I hope we will be able to increase this Vote in time. I do not want to be misunderstood, but this is one of the few luxuries that I would like to see set going, if it is a luxury, and I would like to see money spent in that direction.  I know what difference it makes in a country from a hundred points of view to have trees planted and forestry going on there.  I use the word luxury advisedly in this sense, <Col N="1800" /> that it is a luxury as compared with other and more urgent things at the moment, but even if it is it is one of the few luxuries that I would like to see money spent on if we could afford it.  At any rate, we cannot afford any more money for that purpose this year.  We have enough money to acquire five thousand acres if we could get quite suitable land, but there is always difficulty about getting suitable land.  Deputy Ryan mentioned the Forth mountain.  It may surprise Deputy Ryan to know that there are about four times as many claimants for the available rights on the Forth mountain as there were before the Forestry Act was passed.  We are faced with the position that there are a number of people coming forward now and, with the greatest punctuality, claims are put in the most magnificent style.  Luckily we have compulsory powers and we propose to exercise them, but at the same time we must not ignore these.</P>
    <P>No matter how frivolous they may prove to be they must be investigated. That takes a long time.  We have the Act there now.  It will be put into operation.  That land is offered, and it is one of the places that is suitable for planting and unsuitable for anything else.  There are places in Galway and other counties which are of the same kind.  This year we will endeavour to purchase between 4,000 and 5,000 acres, and at the same time try to administer the Forestry Act, which is a very important one.  We have to approach the question, not only from the point of view of the growing of trees but of preventing the wanton destruction of trees which are immature.</P>

      <P>On the last two occasions when this Vote was discussed in the Dáil I was sorry to find from the speeches I heard that I had not succeeded in making members understand what sort of a place Haulbowline is, what we are doing there, or why it costs what it does cost.  I propose, therefore, to-day to make a somewhat fuller statement, and the Dáil will excuse me if I go over ground which has been gone over on former occasions.  But to-day, besides touching on the history and the present position of Haulbowline, I have also to explain what we are going to do to reduce expenditure and why we have not done it before.  Haulbowline is a small island&mdash;about 67 acres&mdash;partly consisting of made ground on the top of a sand bank in Cork Harbour, near Cobh.  The British Government constructed a naval dockyard there and also a military station with naval and military stores.  During the European war the dockyard was very fully employed and some hundreds of men found work there and also in the neighbouring privately-owned dockyards of Rushbrooke and Passage.</P>
      <P>When the European war came to an end this work began to come to an end also and there began to be unemployment in Cobh and the neighbourhood.  In order to avert or delay this misfortune the late Michael Collins on behalf of the Free State Government made an agreement with the British Government by which the British Admiralty kept the dockyard at Haulbowline at full work and the Free State Government paid the cost.  This lasted for one year.</P>
      <P>It was then decided that the British Government should evacuate Haulbowline and that the Saorstát Government should take it over. This was carried out on the 31st of March, 1923.  Of course the preliminary arrangements took a good deal of time and they included a considerable reduction in the dockyard's staff of workmen.  It was cut down to what it was thought might be required by the Saorstát Government which amounted to about 90 men, who were taken over.  The British troops went out and the Saorstát troops went in.  The Saorstát garrison varied in strength from time to time.  At its strongest it was about 900 men.  Besides infantry it included some special troops of the marine section.  For a time the dockyard was pretty fully employed in reconditioning some trawlers which had been purchased for the Saorstát Government and converting them into patrol boats for use in the warlike operations going on at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> It was already clear, however, that it was not desirable to keep Haulbowline permanently working as a dockyard under Government management. The vessels owned by the Government are not sufficient to provide continuous repair work for even a small dockyard and Haulbowline is not a small yard.  It was designed to deal with war ships and has a dry dock of 600 feet long, larger than those of Rushbrooke and Passage, and it has all sorts of machinery, including large sheerlegs for lifting great weights, and other powerful plant.  It is the sort of place which might be useful to a big firm with a lot of miscellaneous work of repairing ships of all sizes but it would not be suitable for the very small amount of ship repairing work which the Government has to give, except at an extravagant cost. Numerous suggestions for using the place for manufacturing purposes have been made from time to time but none of them has assumed a shape which is worth serious consideration. The Government, therefore, at once made an endeavour to lease the dockyard to a private firm. It was advertised in July, 1923, and efforts were made by Messrs Crowley and Partners, who were at that time engineering agents to the Government, to bring it to the notice of any parties who might be interested.  No offer of any kind resulted which is not surprising in view of the great depression then existing in the shipbuilding business.  It was then specially brought to the notice of Messrs. Furness, Withy and Co., who owned Rushbrooke and Passage yards.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the dockyard at Haulbowline is likely to be more useful if worked in conjunction with those at Rushbrooke and Passage than separately.  Messrs.  Furness Withy did not make any offer. The question then was whether to shut the place down or carry on for a time at a loss.  It was decided to carry on for a time.  The reasons for that decision were, shortly, these: In the first place, the garrison remained on the island, though much reduced in numbers, and the chief military hospital for the Cork District <Col N="1806" /> remained there up to September, 1927.  While they were there we could not shut down some of the expensive services, such as the steam ferry boats to Cobh, which cost at that time about £4,000 a year, and the general electricity supply. In the second place, we could not shut down the island altogether in the sense of abandoning it, because the plant and the buildings, which had cost the British Government very large sums, are too valuable to be allowed to drop into ruin, while owing to their nature and the peculiar character of the island, it would cost substantial sums merely to keep them in repair.  In the third place, we had to consider the general position of the ship-repairing industry in Co. Cork and the question of unemployment.  Cobh and the neighbourhood had been hard hit by the cessation of war work, but the Queenstown Dry Dock Company, owned by Messrs.  Furness Withy, gave intermittent employment at Rushbrooke and Passage.  The special facilities available at Haulbowline, the large dry dock, the special plant, and also the oil tanks, which I have not hitherto mentioned, were useful to the Queenstown Dry Dock Company and were from time to time used by them.  This use could not have continued if Haulbowline were shut down.</P>
    <P>The Government, still making special efforts to keep the ship-repairing industry going, voted out of relief grants a certain sum in the years 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927 to the Queenstown Dry Dock Company as a subsidy in the form of a percentage of the wages paid so as to induce the Company to keep their shipyards open.  After this payment had stopped, Messrs.  Furness Withy intimated that they did not see their way to keep the shipyard going, and asked for a renewal of the subsidy. This was refused, but, as a concession, the use of the dry dock and plant at Haulbowline, for which hitherto small hire charges had been made, was given free, and also the use of two of the oil tanks, for which rent, up to then, had been charged.</P>
    <P>These concessions, although not <Col N="1807" /> large in themselves, involved the keeping open of Haulbowline with a competent staff to work it as a dockyard. The reduction of this staff to what is necessary for mere maintenance would in the first place have involved the discharge of 50 or 60 men from Haulbowline itself, with no particular prospect of employment, and in the second place would have made it somewhat more likely that Messrs.  Furness Withy &amp; Co. would shut down the Rushbrooke and Passage yards and thus lead to further unemployment.</P>
    <P>The position has now changed in several respects.  Shipbuilding is somewhat less depressed than it was. Messrs.  Furness Withy &amp; Co. have, we understand, disposed of the Rushbrooke and Passage yards to another large firm, Messrs.  Beardmore of Glasgow.  We hope now to be able to lease Haulbowline either to Messrs.  Beardmore or to some other firm, but whether we lease it or not we have decided to cease carrying it on as a Government dockyard.  The conditions of employment have improved somewhat in the neighbourhood of Cork City by the establishment of Ford's tractor factory there, and we think our workmen at Haulbowline should now be able to find work elsewhere. Accordingly we are about to close down.  If we lease the place, of course we transfer to the lessee the obligation of maintenance.  If we do not lease it, we shall retain a small staff for maintenance purposes.</P>
    <P>The figures in the Estimates, therefore, represent a transitional period, during which we shall be closing down.  Now coming to the sub-heads of the Vote: sub-head A, £9,000, as compared with £12,300 in 1928-29.  The expenditure in 1928-29 and previous years was about 88 per cent. for labour and about 12 per cent. for materials; the great bulk is for the wages of the dockyard staff.  That staff, as I have explained, will be cut down before the end of the financial year to small dimensions, but we could not when the Estimate was made say how soon it would be feasible to make the reduction <Col N="1808" /> or how quickly it can be made, and it was therefore thought desirable to make a provision of £9,000, nearly ¾ of last year's provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B is a token Vote; we do not, in fact, expect to do any ship-repairing this year, but there might be an urgent case which we could not refuse.  Sub-head C&mdash;Fuel and Light&mdash;is much reduced from last year; naturally when we have closed down the steam ferry, which we shall do about the end of August, and closed the dockyard so that we have no longer to pump out the dry dock, and stopped the supply of electric light, there will be very small expenditure on coal and fuel oil; so that this Estimate is for part of a year only for the full establishment.</P>
    <P>If we do not lease the dockyard it will be an economy to purchase a smaller electric generator than that at present in use so as to carry out the necessary pumping and other maintenance work more cheaply. This expenditure will not be necessary if the dockyard is leased.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I think it well to mention, that is the position of the residents on the island.  There are at present living on the island about 307 people, men, women and children, occupying 57 dwelling houses, which are the property of the Government.  None of these people pays any rent.  Some of them are our work people, some are men who formerly worked in the dockyard and who now work elsewhere, and they and their families stay on in their houses on the island because they find it convenient to do so, or because they find it hard to get accommodation elsewhere. The Government maintains their houses and supplies them with water and various small services for nothing, and they have the free use of the steam ferry boats.  They also get electricity, for which they pay. When the dockyard is shut down these services will cease.  We are anxious to treat these people with all consideration, and not to turn them out of their houses without notice; we are not likely, so far as we can <Col N="1809" /> see, to have any immediate use for the houses.  But the gratuitous services which may in some cases make these houses desirable residences will shortly come to an end, and it is, therefore, to be hoped that these residents should begin to look out for other places to live in.  The very peculiar conditions under which these houses are at present occupied are not such as we ourselves should ever have allowed to become established; we took them over from the British Government, and we have been anxious, as in the case of the workmen themselves, not to produce hardship by abrupt action.  Perhaps we have carried our consideration too far; at all events, we cannot, in the interests of public economy, carry it much further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's act of contrition has been so sincere that he almost disarms criticism. At last upon this small Vote, the presence in this House of a Party which was determined to see that, so far as it could secure it, the administration of the public services would be carried out on more economic lines than hitherto, has been justified.  It is over two years ago since we forced the Minister, I think, to divulge to this House the conditions existing in Haulbowline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We were.  &ldquo;Almost two years ago&rdquo; I said.  We then discovered for the first time that the Minister had received a report from a firm of independent engineers which was almost condemnatory in the conclusion which it forced upon the Minister.  It pointed out that a large part of the plant in Haulbowline, the upkeep and maintenance of which had been made the excuse for a comparatively large expenditure of public money, was to a great extent obsolete, that the magnificent dockyard about which we heard so much was merely a white elephant, and that no engineering firm of any competency would place upon it the exaggerated value which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department <Col N="1810" /> for which he is responsible have been placing upon it for a considerable number of years.  That firm of engineers quite clearly told the Minister to abandon any dreams he had that this particular dockyard would ever become a realisable asset, and, in short, to cut his losses as quickly as he could.  We emphasised that point, I think, in February, 1928.  We are now in the middle of 1929, and it has taken almost 18 months for the wisdom of our criticisms to bring itself home to the Minister.  We now hear he has decided to close down the dockyard. I think it is high time he did decide. I think, in his own words, he has carried consideration too far for those who are living in the houses which were Government property and were rapidly establishing a squatter's title.</P>

Is Deputy Carey anxious that the debate should be adjourned in order that an opportunity should be given him to put down such an amendment?  Is he going to vote against the policy which the Minister has announced to the House, or is he going to argue that the dockyard should be kept open, and that this expenditure should be continued in order that the people on that island who do not work, who are not engaged in maintaining the dockyard, but who work elsewhere, who earn their livelihood in other establishments upon the mainland should be treated as privileged citizens in this country, and should be provided not only with houses and water free but should be carried backwards and forwards to and from their work at the public expense?

      <P>Whilst I regret the necessity for closing down the dockyard and for what amounts to the practical eviction of a number of families from that once prosperous yard, at the same time I do not want to appear as one who, to use a sporting phrase, is having a bit each way. I suggest that the last speaker endeavoured to have a bit each way. It appears to me that if the Minister to-day, instead of having an estimate, as presented to us on this paper, had an estimate for the continuation of the work of maintenance of this dockyard, we would have many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies speaking in support of it.  On the <Col N="1812" /> last occasion.  I agreed that Haulbowline under the then circumstances was not an economic proposition. I realise that to-day it is not an economic proposition.  At the same time, I cannot but have a hope, in view of the development of the aerial services and possibly other services, in the very near future arising from the intervention of Mr.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On account of those things I feel that whilst it might be good economy at the moment to close down these works, at the same time I cannot help thinking that in the long run and taking the long view it would be better policy and economics to continue a maintenance party on the island.</P>

      <P>I believe that an understanding should be arrived at or arrangements made with some group of financiers, industrialists or capitalists who would take over this yard in view of the possibilities I have suggested.  Personally I would prefer to see every industry in this country self-supporting and able to carry on and function without the aid of a tariff or subsidy, but in view of the possibilities which I have indicated, I believe that this would form a very useful site for the manufacture of things required for aerial services.  I believe that the cost would be infinitesimal compared with the results that could be achieved in the near future.  Assuming for the moment that developments occur on the lines I have suggested and that the Government has to look about for a site, I suggest that here you have a valuable plant and machinery.  I quite disagree with Deputy MacEntee when he suggests that most of this machinery is obsolete.  I suggest that much of it is quite up-to-date, and were it not for the fact that much of the valuable machinery has been sold as scrap, I think Haulbowline would be a bigger asset to any company who would be thinking of engaging in <Col N="1813" /> the industry which I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>So far as the families on that island are concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the month of August as the time fixed for the evacuation of the islands by the tenants living there. I think in view of what we all recognise as a very grave problem&mdash; the housing shortage&mdash;that the evacuation at such an early date should be reconsidered.  I think those who live on the island and who have been engaged on maintenance work there will readily recognise that they cannot be continued for a much longer period.  At any rate, I would recommend some time later than August to the Minister for his serious consideration.  In that connection, too, I would suggest that we have heard from time to time in discussions here the lack of protection off the coast for our fishing boats.  Here again, we have a field for activity.  It has been said that we have ceased to build ships there. We have ceased to build any kind of craft, but in view of the complaints heard here from time to time, here is one line, at any rate, upon which we might proceed, on a commercial basis, to do something by way of building and maintaining ships of a proper character which could protect our fisheries and fishermen.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say much more on this question, except to suggest that the families on the island should get a longer time to prepare for evacuating it.  I feel that the Minister should give it his very serious consideration.  I do so in the hope that the evacuation will be delayed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment changes in a slight way the words at the end of <Col N="1815" /> the section.  With this amendment the words in the Bill will read &ldquo;to enable a legal practitioner efficiently to receive instructions, to advise clients, to examine witnesses and to follow proceedings in the Irish language.&rdquo; Those words replace &ldquo;properly to conduct the business of his clients in the Irish language.&rdquo;  The new definition is a little more explicit.

Whatever they have asked for has been given to them.  On the whole, the change does not do any harm to the Bill; in fact, the definition is if anything a little bit clearer.</P>

      <P>Section 4.  The section deleted and a new section substituted therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" />&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  In addition to the examinations mentioned in Section 8 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, the Incorporated Law Society is hereby authorised and required to hold at least once in every year a first examination in the subject of the Irish language (in this Act referred to as a first examination in Irish), and a second examination in the subject of the Irish language (in this Act referred to as a second examination in Irish), and the provisions contained in the said Section 8 shall apply to every such examination in the subject of the Irish language in like manner as they apply to the examinations mentioned in that section save that such examinations in the subject of the Irish language shall be conducted only examiners for the time being approved of by the Minister for Education and that every second examination in Irish shall be so prescribed and conducted as to secure that persons who pass such examination have a competent knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, no person shall be capable of being bound by indentures of apprenticeship to serve as an apprentice to a solicitor unless he has obtained from the Incorporated Law Society a certificate that he passed a first examination in Irish, and no person shall be admitted a solicitor unless he has obtained from the Incorporated Law Society a certificate that he has passed a second examination in Irish within one year before the expiration of the term of his apprenticeship or within one year before being so admitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment brings about two slight changes.  As it stands, the Bill says that Irish shall be a compulsory subject at every examination held by the Incorporated Law Society.  There are three examinations held, the Preliminary, the Intermediate, and the Final.  It was stated by some persons connected with the legal profession <Col N="1817" /> that it would be rather hard on students to have the Irish examinations at the same time.  They propose that the Irish examination might or might not be held at the same time as the examination in law.  Two examinations are provided for, a preliminary examination and a final examination.  The second examination is to be held within one year of being admitted as a solicitor.  It has been considered by the Seanad that this is a more suitable arrangement and that it will help towards a better working of the Bill.  The other change proposed is that, instead of the Chief Justice being satisfied before admitting the candidate that that person possesses a competent knowledge of Irish, the examiners who are appointed by the Incorporated Law Society shall be approved by the Minister for Education.  That disposes of Sections 4 and 5, and the changes made are really more suitable than the arrangements in the Bill originally.  There was a difficulty with regard to the examination, but that is surmounted by the terms of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, very much in the spirit of Deputy MacEntee, that we do congratulate the Minister upon the different spirit of frankness with which he dealt with this matter.  We do not wish to score in any way off the Minister on that ground.  I have <Col N="1820" /> always regarded Haulbowline as really a difficult problem and a problem which even very competent members of an Executive might, under present circumstances, have failed to solve.  I am not out to say anything because they have not immediately succeeded in solving it. Haulbowline, as far as I can understand, having regard to its geographical position and its circumstances, is suitable for an industry of one particular kind&mdash;that is to say, an industry which will import its raw material in ship loads and which will export its finished product in ship loads.</P>
      <P>Up to the moment, I certainly have not been able to find an industry of that kind which is available and which is wanted in Haulbowline.  Deputy Anthony, who, if he has any name in this House, ought to be called, &ldquo;Have a Bit Each Way, Anthony,&rdquo; has made one of his usual &ldquo;have a bit each way&rdquo; speeches.  It is rather a pity that he could not follow the example of other Deputies who are interested in constituencies of that kind and frankly face the facts.  On the last occasion, he said that Haulbowline was a place that was specially suitable for an industry, having regard to the transport position, knowing perfectly well that the transport position was its, at present, fatal defect.  There was at one time a scheme for running a railway down from Monkstown and Passage over Rock Island and Green Island, and connecting it with the mainland, Passage Railway being at that time a broad-gauge railway.  The reconstruction of that railway as a narrow-gauge railway and the construction of its bridges has now made that a financial impossibility unless you have a very definite financial pressure helping you in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a full development however the port of Haulbowline may be a real asset and you have to take that into consideration.  There may be possibilities in the future in relation to Haulbowline, even as it is now circumstanced from the point of view of transport, but that is only a part of an entirely new <Col N="1821" /> organisation of that harbour.  For instance say if a great scheme of development in the Lower Harbour to Cuskinny and the rest of it were carried out, if there was that amount of large traffic coming in to break up its bulk into small trading craft, there might be a possibility.  If in the same way we were to look at the harbour in Cobh and the Great Island, possibly as a free port, as a place which itself would be in bond, then again there are possibilities in these special circumstances for the use of Haulbowline.  But the problem of using Haulbowline as a purely industrial site is, as I say quite frankly, a difficult problem and if the Government had failed in no other problem less difficult I would personally not be inclined to blame them very much in the matter.  Now the first thing that we have got clear to-day is that the Government do intend and I congratulate them, to say that that piece of property which may have potential value but which has no immediate value shall be maintained in the condition in which its potentialities can be realised, when the time comes, with the smallest possible cost to the State. That is the problem which they have had to face and I take it that that is the problem which they intend to face in this matter.</P>
    <P>I simply now want a certain amount of information.  There has been a lot of scrap realised there.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what amount that scrap realised.  I want him to tell me the total cost which he has been put to in the actual maintenance of these dwellings.  I want him to tell me what was the amount of the cost, and what was the amount which was paid for electricity by the people who occupied these premises.  I want to know whether they paid any rates. Once we have got the position clear, if they have reasserted a clear title and have got, even technically, vacant possession of all the Government property on that island, then I think they may consider the matter as sympathetically as they can.  A certain amount of costs will be involved <Col N="1822" /> in the maintenance of every house to the extent to which those houses can be let at rents which will cover such costs.  I think they are entitled to be quite reasonable in the matter.  There is no desire, and I do not think that any immediate economic purpose is gained in merely sending those people out for the sake of sending them out.  So long as the Government have got, technically clear possession of the houses, and that there is no further tendency to build up that title through occupation, I think they should be sympathetic to these people.  There is no difficulty, as far as I know there, in getting a reasonable service of transport to that island for anyone who desires to live upon it.  If the Government can let the houses there, and if they can, in any way, use the houses for the purpose of reducing the costs of maintenance of the whole island, then they are entitled, and it would be perfectly reasonable to do so.  But they are not entitled any longer actively to subsidise people by paying rents of houses and water rates.  The Government have more or less to put Haulbowline at the back of their minds.  I can envisage circumstances arising in which Haulbowline will be a real asset to the country.</P>

It is simply playing with our responsibilities to do that, although it is good vote catching for every man who has anything to do with the district to say the contrary.  But, let us be honest and say that we do not want to catch votes at the cost of asking the Government to keep on wasting any portion of £19,500 for the purpose of catching votes for the members of any Party in that district.

      <P>My sympathies are altogether with the unfortunate workingmen in Haulbowline who will be forced in the near future to leave their homes, without having any possibility of getting work.  We are told that they can go to Ford's. There is no certainty for any man that there is work at Ford's.  The men have no promise that they will get work at Ford's when they leave Haulbowline.  I have listened to Deputy Flinn for the last twenty minutes telling us what might possibly occur in one, two or three years' time.  To use the Deputy's words, it is a real Kathleen Mavourneen scheme for the people in Haulbowline.  There is no hope for them when the Opposition and the Government are one in this matter.  There is only one thing I would ask, and that is, to be merciful to the men in regard to the housing and not to put them out of their homes.  The least the men and women of Haulbowline can expect is to get cheap houses, because they will not be able to pay big rents.  I am at a loss to know any other way out, as I am surrounded by the Opposition and by the Government, both being against the poor people down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the sake of £19,500, we are such economists.  That £19,500 could be used for the protection of a couple of hundred thousand pounds' worth, or a million pounds' worth of property, that was there one and a half years ago, when we were first told by the Opposition that such expenditure should no longer continue.  I hold that the money would have been well spent and would not have to be given in a doleful way, given as the dole is given, if these men had been allowed to protect the machinery that was on the island.  What is the use of putting up the island for sale or inviting an industry to come there when the machinery is gone?  The place is now a big empty shed.  There was some chance for <Col N="1824" /> Haulbowline while the machinery was there.  The machinery was not obsolete, because any machinery that was there was put in ten or fifteen years ago by the British Government. The House can rest assured that the machinery was up to date at that time.  Now that there is no chance for the men I appeal to the Government to make it a condition that these people should, at least, be made caretakers in their homes, or that they should be given the houses at the cheapest possible rent, so that they would not be put to the hardship of leaving and having no place to go except the county home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the Government has decided to close down this place definitely, I suppose there is not much to be said about it. At the outset I would like to impress on Deputy Flinn and his colleagues who are opposing this Vote that the people who work in Haulbowline, and who earn a livelihood there, do not want something for nothing.  On many occasions during the past few years they have come forward with proposals for providing work there. We have all recognised that this problem was a difficult one since the Government took the place over, but hold that on the grounds of public policy the Government were justified in coming to this House for the past few years, and asking a Vote for the maintenance of Haulbowline. If the Government had not done that, and had allowed the place to go into disrepair the very first cry against the Government for doing such a thing would have come from the Opposition Benches.  Economies might be effected in Haulbowline. Economies might be effected in the running of the launches, I suggest, because I believe these services are war-time services.  Surely there is no need now for war time services in transport between the island and the mainland.  There are other services there which might also be termed war time services, and in which economies might be effected without reducing the staff which is necessary to keep the place in proper order <Col N="1825" /> until such time as the Government disposes of it.  The money saved in that direction might be used in maintaining the staff.  I do not propose to point out now where such economies might be effected, but I think the Board of Works inspector, when he visits the place, should go into these matters closely, and he will be able to get sufficient indication from the people in charge there as to where such economies might be effected.  I do not think it is a good policy to close Haulbowline next September definitely.  I think the place should be maintained until such time as it is advertised, and until the Government are satisfied that there is no hope of letting it to any outside concern.  If it fell into disrepair I do not think there would be any hope of letting it, as it would be no use to anyone.  There is very valuable machinery there that should be kept in repair until it is disposed of.</P>
      <P>The Queenstown Dry Docks Company, which has been referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, has had facilities there for some time past; they have had the use of the tanks and of the large derricks, and these facilities encouraged the Queenstown Dry Docks Company to keep open and facilitated them in getting work at Rushbrooke Dock.  Recently, I understand, the Board of Works intimated to the company the withdrawing of these facilities.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how the matter stands at the moment&mdash;whether these facilities are finally withdrawn or whether they will be continued.  I think it is very essential that they should be continued, and I do not see any reason why they should not.  If we are not using these tanks and these derricks, I do not see any objection to the Queenstown Dry Docks Company using them.</P>

At the present moment there is no <Col N="1826" /> accommodation for those sixty families on the mainland, and I think it would be a very serious hardship on those families to disturb them.  I do not think there is any necessity to disturb them until such time as the place is leased to some private concern.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain that these families would be prepared to pay a reasonable rent for the houses and to keep them in a state of repair if they are allowed to remain in occupation, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that aspect of the question. Leave the families in the houses, see that they maintain them and collect a reasonable rent from them.  I do not think that they would have any objection to meeting him on that point.  With regard to the reduction of the staff, I think some arrangement ought to be made whereby married men with dependants ought to be retained in preference to single men.  There are a number of married men there, and I heard recently that some of these were among the first to receive notices I cannot understand that.  I think that preferential treatment ought to be given to employees with dependants.  I say to the Government that in reducing this Vote still further, or in closing down the place, they ought to hasten slowly; they ought to maintain a staff there to keep it in proper order, in the hope of letting it in good repair to some private concern later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the position with regard to this Vote&mdash; in fact, the position with regard to Haulbowline from the start&mdash;is like handing over something valuable to a child to play with.  I cannot describe in any other way the manner in which this dockyard has been dealt with by the Government. They started off with what was undoubtedly very valuable machinery, and they have been playing with it for the last five years, at <Col N="1827" /> a fairly heavy cost to the nation. Now they say that they are going to leave it there, that they have no more use for it.  If a notice which has been posted up in Haulbowline is correct, I do not know what this £5,000 is for.  This notice says that Haulbowline is closing down as from 29th June.  &ldquo;It will be necessary to dismiss the staff, but this will be done by degrees with a view to facilitating the men to get other employment.  All employed on the Island are advised that they should at once endeavour to obtain employment. The steam ferry and scavenging services will cease to operate as from 1st September, 1929, and the maintenance of houses on the Island by the Commissioners will cease from the date of notice.&rdquo;  What is this £5,000 for if they are now going to clear out?  That is what I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Flinn asked the Parliamentary Secretary how much he got for the scrap which was sold by tender a short time ago.  I have been informed, and my information is fairly reliable.  Before I continue I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me what exactly he got for the scrap.  Is the information available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only what I would expect.  From what I have seen and from reliable information which I have got on the Island, this gentleman who took the scrap made something like 300 per cent. profit, or more.  The scrap is being sold at present to Henry Ford.  I cannot see why the Government, if it intended economising, or if it had any idea of working the place at all, did not put the men there to work preparing this scrap and sending it up to Henry Ford; but of course, we must do things on an imperial scale, and I suppose it would never do for the Government to be jobbing in scrap iron.  But the men there are idle, and other men were imported to break up the machinery and turn it into scrap iron for conveyance to <Col N="1828" /> Ford's factory.  Surely to goodness something could have been done in that way.</P>
      <P>Last year the Parliamentary Secretary stated on this Estimate that they were breaking up the hulk of the &ldquo;Garnet.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;It is of very little value as it is, but it will be of some value when broken up.  It has a copper bottom.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that both the copper bottom and the hulk are still there. I do not know whether that is information to those who are responsible for the working of the yard or not, but I can say that I saw it there myself the day before yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question is if, as has been alleged by the Government for the last five or six years, there is valuable machinery there, what do they intend to do with that valuable machinery?  As regards the disemployment of the men, I believe that the same trouble exists in Haulbowline as exists in the Land Commission&mdash;that the Unionist minority have taken over control&mdash;and I think that is very much evidenced by the manner in which the men are being dismissed.  It is stated that these men will get employment in Henry Ford's.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary seriously suggest that a man with one leg would get employment in Henry Ford's?  That one-legged man has no other employment and no pension, but still he has been notified that he is one of the first twenty to go, while gentlemen are retained.  One gentleman has a pension of £46 a year, his wife is a school teacher in Cobh, with £4 or £5 a week, and he has a motor-car and a large motor yacht for pleasure.  He has been continued there, and has not been notified to go, whilst, on the other hand, unfortunate men are being dismissed who have seven or eight children to support, who have no visible means of support, who have no hope of getting employment, and who will become charges on the rates.  I think that the manner in which this whole matter has been handled is like handing over valuable property to a few school-children <Col N="1829" /> to play with and smash up. Apparently what is being done is on the report of a gentleman who was sent down to give his views on Haulbowline. I do not know whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary will give us the name of that gentleman, but I suggest that he was a former manager of Haulbowline, who is now occupying a prominent position in a Dublin dockyard.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would not be to that gentleman's interest to see the Government using Haulbowline for any purpose whatever or to see Haulbowline ever kept there, or to have the machinery there at the convenience of the Rushbrooke Dock Company.  Of course, it would not&mdash; they are rival firms.  Then take the power station.  Apparently electric light is so badly wanted on the island that the power station has to work on Sunday.  It has to be kept going all day on Sunday, with day and night shifts.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of that or not.  In thirteen weeks, forty tons of oil were used at £10 per ton.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us figures as to the amount of oil used in the power station during the twelve months.  I believe myself that Haulbowline could be run without any loss whatever, and that the machinery could be maintained there without any loss to the State if there was any kind of a sane head put in charge.  But, of course, it is public money, and the Ministers who are responsible here apparently do not care.  They are depending on the majority they hold.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I would like him to state definitely who has the discharge of the hands there, and on whose advice are they being singled out for dismissal.  Is it intended, as was stated in the notices, to dismiss all the hands, or is it only intended to dismiss some of them?  Is it intended merely to use the notices that have been given as a cloak for the dismissal of some and for the keeping on of the Masonic institution which, I believe, exists there at present?  I have <Col N="1830" /> before me a list of those who were dismissed and who have been notified that their services are to be dispensed with.  I have also a list of large pensioners whose services are being retained.  Several of those large pensioners are single men, while the men who are being dismissed are men with large families. Is it intended to get rid of those on the island who are badly off and need employment and to keep on a gentleman who has a pension of £46 a year and whose wife is a school teacher in the town with a salary of £4 or £5 a week, a gentleman who keeps a motor car and a motor yacht for his pleasure and enjoyment.  Is that the system under which the Parliamentary Secretary is working? I have here a list of men with pensions ranging from £68 a year down to £45.  All those gentlemen are being retained, while the men who have been discharged are men who have no pension whatever. Will the Parliamentary Secretary state definitely in his reply who has the discharge of the hands?  Who is responsible for it, and on whose advice is he acting when he discharges men who, when unemployed, will become a drug on the labour market.  He knows well that they cannot get any other employment.  I wonder would the President give us a guarantee in regard to this?  He is, after all, the senior representative for Cork city.  I am sure that he would have a pull with the firm of Messrs.  Henry Ford &amp; Son.  I wonder, when he comes down to Cork next week, will he pay a visit to Ford's factory and see if he can get employment for these men.  If these men are not able to get employment, they will become a burden on the ratepayers of Cork County.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this matter has been handled in a manner that is disgraceful to any Executive Government. From the commencement it has been handled in a disgraceful manner.  I see practically no hope of improvement while this system exists&mdash;of stating one year that you are compelled to keep these men there on account of the value of the machinery that is on the island. <Col N="1831" /> Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what was obtained for the machinery that was sold during the last twelve months, or whether any machinery was sold.  Would he also state the exact value of the machinery at present on the island. Who is going to remain in charge of it, if anyone is going to remain in charge of it, and who is going to keep it in order?  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I would like to have this information from him.  I think we were entitled to have that information from him in his opening speech, and I regret that he did not give it to us then.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony opened up for us several vistas of what might be done with Haulbowline in the way of starting new industries. All I can say is, we will leave no stone unturned in the effort to discover any industry that can possibly be carried on in that particular place.  At present we are making every effort to lease the premises, but without success.  I think that Deputies are under a misapprehension as to what is going to happen in September.  I did not say that the present occupants of the houses were going to be evicted.  All I said was that the steam ferry and other services will have to be closed down because they are very costly.  They cost £4,000 a year.  We cannot continue these services merely to gratify the people living in these houses, and who perform no duties and do no <Col N="1833" /> work for the State, but we are prepared to give them every consideration, and there is no prospect of evietion. Deputy Flinn has put to me several questions, most of which would be more suitable as Parliamentary questions.  I cannot possibly be expected to have detailed information of that kind at my finger-tips.  There are a few points on which I can give him the information required.</P>
      <P>In regard to the scrap, that realised £3,268 0s. 6d.  I cannot give him the cost of maintenance of the houses.  The amount paid for electricity is £45 4s. 10d.  The occupants of those houses do not pay the rates. The number employed was 85.  We expect when our reductions have been completed to carry on that station with a skeleton staff of about 20.  We have not yet finally decided how they will be divided, but it will be necessary to have men who are capable of maintaining the yard in good condition, and different types of tradesmen will be required for that purpose, and they will be skilled mechanics.  Deputy Corry seems to be very solicitous as to who is in charge of the dismissal of those workers.  Since the Minister for Finance has control of that, all I can assure him is that none of the terrible things he fears are going to be perpetrated is likely to occur.  We are paying very close attention to this question ourselves, and I am personally looking into every one of these cases.  The staff that will be retained will be retained primarily because of efficiency, but in dismissing men we are taking into consideration whether they are married or not, and where possible we avoid any unnecessary hardship.</P>

      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary certain questions which he has not answered, and which ought to be within his knowledge. He told us of the running of a certain plant, and that he proposed to buy in substitution for that plant another plant of a similar character. Therefore, I suggest that he must have gone into this question.  Does he know the capacity of the electric light plant?  Does he know the amount of the load?  Does he know there is a battery on the island? That is a matter of ordinary knowledge. He says that £45 would pay for the lighting of 57 dwelling-houses. At what rate, and how does he calculate it?</P>

      <P>The details of this Estimate are pretty nearly settled by legislation.  As to the first item, liability for this service arises under the Railways Act of 1924, and the amount of that is specified in the ninth schedule to the Act.  Item B also, to a certain extent hinges on the Railways Act, because under a certain section of that Act the repayments to the County Councils, except in regard to the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Company, ceased as from 31st December, 1924.  In regard to the third item, this represents instalments of annuities in repayment of advances made.  The decrease is due to the redemption of the loan of £80,000, for which the final instalment was provided and paid last year.  Item D still appears on the Estimate.  It was thought it might be got rid of this year, but there are still some small questions outstanding in connection with the title of the land.  It is expected that £1,000 more will clear it.  Certain progress has been made during the year in clearing up title.  The payments under Item E are in respect of <Col N="1836" /> steamer services.  These are an inheritance from the Office of Works. They are founded mainly on the experience of the last couple of years. There is special attention required as regards the working of the steamer from Sligo to Belmullet. That accounts for the increase.  The Appropriations-in-Aid are specified under the Railways Act.</P>

      <P>The amount specified in respect of Sub-head A is a payment given to the Great Southern Railways Company under the Railways Act, 1924, by which the amalgamation of the southern railways was effected.  That Act, while it conferred certain benefits on the railways concerned, also conferred certain obligations on them.  I think it would be in order at this stage to inquire whether certain obligations imposed upon them have been carried out, and if not, why the Minister did not take steps to ensure that they would be carried out?  I refer to the obligations under Section 55 (1) and (2), which I will read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  From and after the passing of this Act the rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of railway employees shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between the trade unions representative of such employees on the one part and the railway companies and other persons by whom they are respectively employed on the other part.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The original or a counter-part, or a copy, certified in such manner as the Minister shall direct to be a true copy, of every such agreement as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section shall be deposited with the Minister within one month after the passing of this Act or the making of such agreement whichever shall be the later.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Some time ago the railways posted notices at their works at Inchicore and Broadstone to the effect that <Col N="1837" /> new conditions of service would come into operation from a specified date, and that only those of the workmen who were prepared to accept the new conditions of service need turn up for work on that date. The men in these workshops were working under an agreement arrived at in 1922, it being the award of a tribunal established by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that time, and presided over by a person appointed by him&mdash;the present Governor-General.  That agreement was no doubt deposited with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not saying that.  What I am saying is that the Minister has placed upon him the obligation of putting the Act into operation, and if certain parties failed to carry out a section of the Act, it was for the Minister to take such additional power as he thought necessary to see that the section would be carried out.  The point remains that the Minister did not take steps to ensure that that particular sub-section would be given effect to, and that the agreement arrived at in 1922 would be deposited with him. I submit, however, that that is a minor matter.  Whether or not the agreement was deposited with him, the obligation was on the Minister to ensure that that agreement would not be departed from, except as a result of agreement between the railways company and the trade unions representing the men concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the railways company posted notices at their works terminating the agreement and announced that new terms of service would apply as from a specified date they were breaking sub-section (1) of Section 55, and it was for the Minister to take steps to ensure that they did not do so.  The Minister, however, did not take these steps. There were certain conferences between the unions and the railways company, and then, as a result of a question from Deputy O'Connell, the Minister informed us that one of the parties concerned had approached him, and said that they did not think any useful result would come from the continuation of the conferences. As a result of the representations made to him, the Minister brought the parties together in conference, arising out of which a tribunal was established by agreement which made an award which has been published <Col N="1839" /> in to-night's papers, involving a ten per cent. reduction on the wages that came into operation after the 1922 agreement.  The point I want to make is not whether the award was a just award or not, or whether the conditions of service that will now operate in these shops are all that should be desired, but that the Minister had placed upon him an obligation by this Act to ensure that effect would be given to all these clauses, and that effect would be given to the particular clause that the conditions of employment or terms of service could not be altered except by agreement made between the representatives of the trade unions representing the employees, on the one part, and the railways company on the other.</P>

      <P>I can see what the Minister is driving at.  I think he is intending to imply that the agreement made in 1922 did not come within the terms of the first sub section, because it was not deposited with him.  I do not think that is a fair interpretation of the sub-section. I think the agreement was in operation in any case, and would continue in operation, whether deposited or not.  I think further that the Minister was lax in his duty in not taking steps to ensure that it would be deposited in order to prevent a situation arising such as did arise within the last month.  This is, I think, the only opportunity we have of raising the matter on the Estimates, when we are proposing to make a Vote of over £48,000 to the railways company. The railways company have, as I said, had this obligation placed upon them by the Act, which they departed from, and the Minister, in permitting them to do so, was guilty of a dereliction of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is probably the proper opportunity for directing the attention of the Minister and the House to the possibility of industrial unrest on the railways due to the recent notification of the railway companies of their intention of withdrawing from the negotiating machinery as far as wages and conditions are concerned. I would at the outset direct the attention of the House to the fact that since 1923 no strike has taken place upon the railways, as far as the grades who were parties to the negotiating machinery were concerned. It might be well, at this stage, if I pointed out the origin of this railway <Col N="1841" /> negotiating machinery.  In 1921 there was a considerable amount of unrest on the railways, and at that time there were a number of lockouts, strikes and threats of strikes. That was when the Government gave over control of the railways and when the railway management threatened to reduce wages and salaries of employees and to worsen the conditions generally for the employees. At that time, through the intervention, I think, of the Provisional Government, a tribunal was set up, presided over by Mr. Carrigan, K.C., and the whole question was gone into.  No agreement was arrived at, with the result that Mr. Carrigan made an award.  As far as that award was concerned, it practically involved the setting aside of all the conditions and rates of wages which the railway trade unions had fought for for a number of years previously.  It was objected to by every railway man, North and South, from Mizen Head to Malin Head, with the result that the Provisional Government again intervened, and a temporary arrangement was arrived at as far as wages and conditions were concerned, which lasted from February, 1922, to August, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the termination of that temporary agreement the country was in, I might stay, a state of chaos, and had the railway employees at the time liked to take advantage of the situation, they could have demanded from the railways any terms they desired; and if such demands had not been acceded to the railways would have had to close down, which would have meant a lot of dislocation as far as the commercial life of this country is concerned. Certain suggestions were made at the time that negotiating machinery should be established.  This negotiating machinery was established. The machinery is very comprehensive, working up from local departmental committees covering big groups of employees at places like Kingsbridge and Cork to the Irish Railway Wages Board, which is a body composed of an equal <Col N="1842" /> number of representatives of the companies and the three railway trade unions, with four representatives of the users of the railways, and presided over by Mr. Justice Wylie.  A majority finding of the board is operative.  The findings are not absolutely binding on either side, but no side has so far endeavoured to break away from any of them.  As far as the findings or the awards of this Railway Wages Board is concerned, there is no gainsaying the fact that the railway companies have got the lion's share. In one finding in April, 1926, they got three cuts in wages against the whole of the traffic grades, and four cuts in the case of one section.  Not long afterwards they secured a finding giving them all-round reductions in rates of pay in the case of the whole of the new entrants to the service, as far as the operative grades are concerned.  Subsequently they got concessions in the case of the locomotive grades: drivers, firemen, and cleaners.  As far as these findings are concerned the position of the men employed in the grades I have mentioned is much worse than the position of men in similar grades in Great Britain.  However, the men loyally abided by the award, with the result that they are now in a worse position than their colleagues on British railways employed at the same class of work.</P>
    <P>I might mention, for the information of the House, that as far as this negotiating machinery is concerned, it is similar to that in existence on the British railways, only in a somewhat modified form.  Last year, in so far as the British railways were concerned, more especially the four principal groups, there was a falling off in receipts of nearly four and a half million.  As a result of that the companies approached the machinery in operation in Great Britain, and asked for a ten per cent. cut in salaries and wages.  After the situation was threshed out fully as between the representatives of the men and the companies, the men agreed, at any rate, to accept a two and a half per cent. reduction lasting <Col N="1843" /> over a period of one year.  As a result of that, the Irish railway managers, although their employees were working at a much lower rate in certain grades than the employees in Britain, approached the Irish Railway Wages Board and put forward a demand for a ten per cent. reduction in the wages of the operative grades and a five per cent. reduction in the salaried grades, and that notwithstanding the previous reductions already made by the tribunal under the chairmanship of Judge Wylie.  However, this application of the railway companies went to the Railway Wages Board, and the companies' advocate, Mr. Shanahan, Accountant to the Great Northern Railway, gave evidence on behalf of all the railway companies.  It was shown, notwithstanding his statement, that the reductions in revenue which he said took place during the previous year were more than counterbalanced by the reductions in working expenses, with the result that the year 1928 was the best year, from the view-point of net receipts, that the railway companies have had since 1924.  After a full hearing the Wages Board found as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As such restrictions (if any) as this Board could agree to would not materially benefit the companies, and would further divorce the efforts of the employees from concentrating on improved working and popularising railway transit with the public, we refuse the application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Board turned down the application of the companies as far as the ten per cent. reduction in the wages of the operative grades and the five per cent. reduction in the wages of the salaried grades were concerned.</P>
    <P>The companies took this very badly.  It was one of the first adverse decisions given by the Railway Wages Board against the companies; and although numerous decisions were given against the men they had loyally abided by these decisions.  The companies have now <Col N="1844" /> given notice to the parties concerned that they want to withdraw from the negotiating machinery altogether.  In April next, I understand, this withdrawal will take place, as, according to the agreement, twelve months' notice must be given on either side in order to comply with its terms. The companies having intimated their intention to withdraw, I can see that they are preparing to make drastic attempts to reduce the wages of the employees, and if such takes place I want the House to realise that it is the duty of the Minister and his Department to see that steps are taken to prevent the railways from being brought into the chaotic condition which will be brought about if a strike takes place.  It seems to me extraordinary that at a time when abnormal attempts are being made to bring about peace in industry the railway companies are flinging the sword into the industrial area as they are doing on this occasion.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe that it is the duty of the Minister to see that every effort should be made to bring the railway companies to a full sense of their responsibility.  The machinery that was set up has been working satisfactorily to all concerned, but because one adverse decision was given by the Wages Board against them the company is going to throw down the gauntlet and will probably withdraw from the Board and attempt to reduce the wages of the employees.  If they do that, it will throw the whole railway situation into a chaotic state, with great disadvantages so far as the trade and commerce of the country are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to emphasise very briefly the appeal made by Deputy Cassidy to the Minister to take serious notice of the recent action of the principal railway company in the country in giving notice to terminate the existing negotiation machinery. Deputy Cassidy has presented an accurate picture of the position so far as it dealt with the machinery <Col N="1845" /> which has been regulating the conditions of service of the railway men.  The only reason which I can assign for the action of the railway company in giving notice to terminate the existing negotiation machinery, is that they are dissatisfied with the recent action of the arbitration board in declining an application submitted for a further reduction of wages.  I dare say that the Minister has read the detailed report of the arbitration proceedings held by the Railway Wages Board on the 31st January.  Everybody knows &mdash;and the railway directors more than anybody else&mdash;that the reason why they failed to secure a further reduction in wages as a result of the application, was because the advocate who presented the case for the railways before that board, really gave the railway case away.  Certain questions were put to him at a certain stage by the Chairman, Mr. Justice Wylie, and he was asked whether the railway companies, if they were working under fairly healthy financial conditions, were of opinion that a wage of £2 a week for a man living in Dublin, and with the cost of living at its present high figure, would be considered high.  The representative of the companies foolishly answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Mr. William Hewat, ex-T.D. and the nominee of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, and other representatives of the employers, were not prepared to accept that view, and they consequently signed a majority report turning down the application.  The directors have sulked, and, apparently after due deliberation, have decided to adopt a provocative policy and to terminate the existing machinery, which deals with the conditions of service of railway men, without putting up any alternative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as it is recognised to be the duty of all Ministers occupying a similar position in other countries, to face the problem created by the railway companies&mdash;not by the railwaymen&mdash;in presenting that ultimatum. There is no doubt, and I am <Col N="1846" /> not making it as a threat, that the action of the company, if not dealt with by the Minister, is certain to lead to trouble in April next.  The actions of the railway company, so far as I am informed, not alone in terminating the existing machinery, but in its dealing with the men, are deliberately provocative.  I ask any Deputy whether it is fair or right that the directors of a railway company, when dealing with men who have given thirty or forty years' service in responsible positions, are acting wisely in giving instructions to individual officers and servants to take their holidays, that at the end of their holidays their services will be terminated without giving the conditions of retirement.  That has been going on for the last few months.  The least that the directors can do to such men is to give them a friendly farewell and grant them the conditions promised when they entered the service.  I do not think that the directors who are responsible for such provocative policy would themselves like to be treated by the shareholders in that manner. I hope that the directors of any company, particularly a company getting money under this particular sub-head, will be dealt with by the Minister who is responsible for making those payments. I could quote several cases to prove what I have said, namely, that individuals holding high as well as those holding low posts have been treated in that scandalous way. One would imagine that the directors would not scrap even the rolling stock in such barbarous fashion. No doubt that line of policy is bound to lead to trouble in the long run.  The position with some of the companies is that as a result of men having been treated in the manner in which I have indicated some of those who are still in the service have naturally got the idea that their turn is coming next.  Men in that frame of mind are not likely to fail to take action if called on to do so.  Arising out of what Deputy Lemass said, I have no complaint against the Minister in regard to the action which he rightly took in connection <Col N="1847" /> with the recent dispute as regards the shopworkers at Inchicore. I think that the Minister has regularised his position and, whether the award is acceptable to the railway company or to the men, it is, at any rate, an award given as a result of conference, negotiation, and arbitration to which both sides were parties.</P>

I have no complaint to make against the Minister in regard to the action which he took in connection with that dispute. Even if the railway company made an attempt to evade the obligations laid on them in that particular <Col N="1848" /> section, I say that the action of the Minister has brought them back to the right position and that the whole position has been regularised.  I do not think that I can usefully add anything to what Deputy Cassidy said.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that the action of the company in giving notice to terminate machinery which has been successfully in operation, so far as the company is concerned, since 1922 is likely to lead to trouble.  It is the duty of the Minister to intervene and try as far as possible to prevent that trouble coming about so far as it affects the railway transport of the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the mail arriving in Raphoe, Co. Donegal, each morning at 11.35 a.m. is not delivered until the following morning at 9 a.m.; and whether, seeing that the postman is unemployed between (approximately) the hours of 11.45 a.m. and 1.50 p.m., and does not come off duty until 2.15 p.m., he will arrange for delivery of letters on day of arrival.</P>

      <P>The principal mail of the day arrives in Raphoe at 8.35 a.m. and the delivery of correspondence commences at 9.0 a.m.</P>
      <P>A second delivery is not afforded at towns similarly circumstanced, and the additional expenditure involved in providing a second delivery at Raphoe would not be justified.</P>
