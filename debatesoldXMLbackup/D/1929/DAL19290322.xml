      <P>On a point of order, I do not wish to stop discussion on this matter at all, but as a matter of general principle, if a particular thing like this has been decided in Committee, is it in order to propose to reverse that decision on the Report Stage?  It is as a general matter of procedure that I am raising this.  On the Committee Stage, there was a definite decision taken as to the number seven as against the number six.  This amendment, if carried, would clearly reverse that decision.  The question is, can a motion be taken which tends or has the effect of reversing a decision reached on the Committee Stage, on the Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving my amendment, I desire to say that it is not my wish or intention to impede the passage of this Bill.  Nor do I wish particularly to stand for the incorporation of five members in this particular section.  I would appeal to all parties to entertain my amendment in the most liberal fashion possible. Those vitally interested in the successful working of this Bill feared that this section, as now worded, might have very disastrous consequences upon the smooth and speedy operation of the measure.  As the Bill now stands, if two members of the Censorship Board happen to be absent from a meeting, either through illness or some other cause, then the remaining seven members present must be unanimous before a decision prohibiting a book can be carried.  Should three members of the Censorship Board be absent and six of the others constituting the Board be present, they can do nothing.  I think all members will agree that would be a very regrettable condition of affairs.  In my opinion, it would mean indefinitely holding up the prohibition of a book. Circumstances like that might easily arise.  A couple of members of the Board might be absent through illness, or through causes arising from business, and the result would be that the Board could not function.  It is not my intention to impress upon the House the necessity for accepting five or any number, but I suggest that as the section is framed prohibition <Col N="1835" /> could not work smoothly or efficiently.</P>
      <P>I think some provision should be made to deal with contingencies of the kind that I have suggested might arise.  I realise the difficulty of finding a set form of words to cover exactly what is in my mind.  It is important when the Censorship Board begins to operate that there should be no impediment to its efficient functioning.  I move this amendment, not because I stand strongly for a prohibition of books, and not because I have any objecttion to have a book prohibited by as large a majority of the Censorship Board as possible, but because I honestly believe the point with which it deals is a vital defect in the Bill. If by some general agreement of the House a remedy could be found to deal with the contingencies to which I have referred, I would be very willing to accept anything in the nature of a compromise.  If the Minister could find some remedy for this serious defect in the Bill I think it would be a good thing for all parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Byrne in this matter.  When we brought forward our amendment, which was carried, for having a Board of nine instead of five, we had in mind that the number requisite to prohibit a book should be six, but to my astonishment I found the Government, I do not know why, for they had been in favour of having a book stopped by only four, suddenly jumped from that number to seven.  I would imagine that they would have been consistent in the matter, and would have stood for the smallest number, and, having regard to the fact that the total number of the Board would be nine, they would have chosen six as the next best thing to four.  Instead of that, in order to take it out of the Opposition, they went one better, and they took an attitude which was completely inconsistent with their original attitude.  I suggest as a compromise between Deputy Byrne's proposal and the attitude of the Government <Col N="1836" /> that our original proposal would be a reasonable compromise, and that the number should be six out of nine.  The weighty argument has been put forward by Deputy Byrne that you might have absentees, or you might have cranks on the Board.  On the whole, it might be more reasonable to limit the number to six rather than to make it seven. I suggest that we should compromise and come to an agreement on this matter.</P>

      <P>The observations I desire to make are rather in the nature of queries.  I want to know has Deputy Byrne visualised how this Censorship Board will work, because I do not think that casual absence would interfere with the efficiency of that Board as would be the case, say, in the working of the Film Censorship Board where a member must be present and see the film.  I imagine members of this Board will receive copies of the books and periodicals in question and consider them at leisure.  It would be impossible, I think, really to attempt to consider and form an opinion of, say, a book on the borderline at a table where everybody is talking, debating and squabbling as to whether this line is right, whether that chapter is right, and what do you think of something else.  You would need to consider it in the quietude of your study, and I think that at the actual meetings of the Board the work will simply be to ratify decisions already arrived at.  Therefore, I do not think that the efficiency of the Board would be interfered with to any prejudicial extent by the absence of members from the causes to which Deputy Byrne has referred.  If a quorum did not turn up on a particular date I think it would be quite easy to arrange to have a meeting a couple of days later.  The decisions arrived at by the Board will be rather short and to the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle of the Bill, to which we assented on Second Reading, was that there should be substantial agreement amongst the members of the Board before any newspaper was prohibited.  The Bill, as it passed the Second Reading, required the consent of four-fifths of the members of the Board.  It provided that the absence of one out of the five would not mean the prohibition of any book, but that the absence of two would.  In other words, the Board have to be practically unanimous. Deputy Byrne suggests that we should have a bare majority, that four members should not be prohibited from giving a decision, and that a majority of one would decide. I think that that is almost a departure from the principle of the Bill, and an unnecessary departure. Deputy Little's suggestion of two-thirds of the Board is certainly an improvement on Deputy Byrne's, but I think it is also a departure from the principle of the Bill.  Two-thirds is substantially less than four-fifths, and I do not know why, having agreed to the principle on Second Reading, we should now depart from it.  I think that Deputy Byrne is visualising imaginary dangers.  I hope that the Minister will not appoint on the Board gentlemen who are so busy that they can attend only at irregular intervals, and I hope he does not intend to appoint habitual invalids.  Of course, there might be occasions, such as that of a month ago, when all the members of such a Board might have been laid up; you really cannot legislate against an influenza epidemic.  I think that Deputy Byrne's point is an imaginary one.  I think he partly foresaw a dissenting minority of the Board who would try to hold up the proceedings by absenting themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>If so I think the Deputy is making a very severe imputation on the people whom the Minister will appoint&mdash;that men will deliberately undertake membership of a Board of this character with <Col N="1838" /> the intention of frustrating and nullifying its proceedings.  Is the Minister likely to appoint men of that character?  It seems to me to be extremely unlikely.  I think that Deputy Byrne's whole attitude is tinged in this way by suspicion, a suspicion generated&mdash;I do not want to use an offensive word; I was going to say ignorance&mdash;by a lack of appreciation of the spirit in which responsible people approach a question of this kind.  I do not believe that that danger is a serious one, any more than I believe that people who would have to be absent through illness or prevented by business from being present would undertake the work of the Board. Of course, you will not get as good an attendance with nine as with five. Everybody knows that with a large committee it is very difficult to get people to attend, while with four or five, as in the case of a Private Bill, the attendance is generally regular. With big committees people are rather more casual, and that, I am afraid, may be the result of the acceptance of the amendment to have nine members on the Board.  That being so, I think the Government have reasonably not insisted on making it eight out of nine, but seven out of nine, and that is what I prefer.  I would certainly prefer Deputy Little's proposition to Deputy Byrne's, because I think Deputy Byrne's is a violation of the whole principle approved of on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in any case like that which Deputy Byrne is afraid of the Minister has retained powers in the Bill to remove from the Board people who are causing obstruction.  I do not think Deputy Byrne need be afraid of obstruction.  The very worst that could happen would be that a decision would be postponed from one meeting of the Board to the next&mdash; perhaps a month.  But the real point is this, I think, that the Government, in proposing that four out of five should be required to agree about a book, were carrying out the obvious wishes of the Committee in <Col N="1839" /> accordance with the general tone of the Report of the Committee.  What the Committee thought, and what I think the Government agreed with them in thinking, was that the important thing in prohibiting a book was that it should be felt that there was a strong body of public feeling behind such a prohibition.  Now, if the prohibition is made to rest on the decision of a mere majority, or even on Deputy Little's suggestion of two-thirds, I do not think it will carry the same weight as if there is evidence that there is such a strong body of feeling against a book as would be shown by the fact that seven out of nine agreed that it should not be in circulation.  I think that Deputies generally felt that there was weight in that kind of argument when they decided on the Committee Stage that they would substitute seven for six, and I strongly hope that the House will stick to that decision.  I believe that it would make a very great difference to the smooth working of the Bill to retain the seven, and I do not believe it will have the very smallest effect in preventing the Board from deciding to prohibit books which ought to be prohibited.  Again, I stress the point that seven out of nine is a smaller fraction than four out of five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing, if Deputy Little's amendment would meet with the approval of the House, to accept it.  I am sure Deputy Thrift would agree that even a two-thirds majority would be a sufficiently strong prohibition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should go into Deputy Little's rather naive arithmetic.  On the same principle we might argue for a Board of twenty-one, and we ought to be satisfied with a decision of six; in fact, that the smaller you make it the better.  I do not know that Deputy Little was quite serious, and I gather from his own Party that his argument was not quite conclusive. I think we will admit that <Col N="1840" /> there has been pretty substantial agreement by all parties on the Bill. That was evidenced on Second Reading. Undoubtedly it was recognised that the Bill constituted an interference with liberty&mdash;a perfectly justifiable and necessary interference in the circumstances.  That is the reason why the Bill was brought forward and why it received support from every part of the House.  As I listened to the Second Reading debate, I thought there was general agreement that what should be prohibited were books that were obviously offensive&mdash;pornographic in their purpose.  It was felt that if you could be sure in the original Board of five, that you could get five normal men, always normally functioning, a case could be made for unanimity in those circumstances. It was felt after all that, a choice having to be made, a person with rather cranky views, at least cranky views in some cases, at all events, might be present, and therefore it was felt it was not wise and not proper to press for or suggest that there should be unanimity.  Personally I believe that had the number remained at five, the Bill would be more effective in functioning. That is a matter, however, that has already been discussed, and a definite view has been expressed by the House&mdash;namely, by increasing the five to nine.  But I think, having increased it to nine, it is not proper to consider, not the normal functioning of the Board when the various members would be present, but abnormal cases in which there might be absences owing to illness or for other reasons.  At the very worst it has been pointed out that that might mean postponement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee did agree to have seven out of nine, and it was felt that that would give the general sense of the community&mdash;that if you had a verdict of that kind, that is, on a book which was condemned by seven normal people out of nine, that would present the normal view of the community that such a book was pornographic and should not circulate, that its circulation would do damage, and that it was the kind of <Col N="1841" /> book that this Bill was meant to deal with.  The Committee came to a conclusion which, I think, is in general accord with the main purpose of the Bill, namely, that seven out of nine would be required when, so to speak, a book was put into the dock and found guilty.  There have not really been any serious reasons alleged, I suggest, why the House should now disagree with the view expressed in Committee.  As I said, all sides of the House were pretty definite when the Bill was getting a Second Reading as to its purpose.  We felt that would be secured in the first instance by four signatures out of five. It could not be secured equally well if the fraction was smaller than seven out of nine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not be regarded as entirely out of order if I do not follow Deputy O'Kelly into a minute consideration of the virtues and vices of Trinity College, and if I address myself rather to the cognate, if somewhat remote subject of the Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Bill.  On the Second Reading I expressed some doubts as to the efficacy of this measure.  I did not vote upon it because, unlike most people, I find that I have not got my opinions ready-made before I see a measure and before I consider it.  Since that time I have been giving a good deal of thought to it, and I am bound to say quite frankly <Col N="1842" /> that my feelings about it have become rather more hostile than less. Now I want to look at it for a moment, if the House will allow me, from a double point of view; from the point of view of the two sets of people who are more directly and immediately concerned; from the point of view of the litigants and from the point of view of their professional advisers.  First of all from the point of view of the litigants, I, like my good friend and colleague in the representation of County Donegal, Deputy MacFadden, who I think is the seconder of the Bill, have within my area, and very near to my own home, a very considerable number of true Irish speakers, that is, people to whom Irish is not merely an acquirement or a language occasionally used by them but is the natural, real home language. One of the matters which has weighed with me favourably to the Bill is that I do think, in so far as such people, although they may know English, all speak and express themselves much more naturally and easily in Irish, it is a hardship if they do in fact find any difficulty, when they are so unwise or so unfortunate as to engage in legal proceedings, in obtaining the services of legal advisers who are able to consult, speak, examine and deal with them in the tongue with which they are most familiar, and in which they are most at home.  But I have made some inquiries&mdash;I am quite prepared to admit that my research has not been very thorough and there may be evidence which I have not yet come across&mdash;and I have not yet heard of any cases in which these people&mdash;they are, as I say, probably wise enough not to resort to the courts frequently &mdash;complain of being unable to find suitable persons to represent them professionally who have got this qualification.  I am told on the contrary, and I believe it is true, that whether you are dealing with the solicitors profession, or whether you are dealing with the profession of the Bar, there is no dearth at all of persons who are themselves Irish speakers, or who have made probably a much more thorough study <Col N="1843" /> of the language than anyone is likely to make under compulsion, and who are therefore as well qualified as anyone is likely to be under this Bill to deal with whatever small number of cases there may be in which that matter arises.</P>
      <P>I am open to conviction on that point.  On the other hand, there is the other profession.  I do not suggest that this ought to be an overwhelming consideration, but I do not think that there is any serious doubt that the great bulk of opinion in the two professions concerned is opposed to this Bill.  Quite possibly that may be wrong.  National interests are supreme, but I do suggest that the Oireachtas ought to be very slow before it disregards altogether too cavalierly the opinion of these two great professions.  So far, the House will observe, I am somewhat undecided.  I am less able to come to a definite decision, because, I venture to suggest, this question hangs on a much larger question, and that larger question this Dáil is quite incompetent to decide.  That larger question is this: Is Ireland, five years hence, ten years hence, going to be, in fact, an Irish-speaking country?  We cannot possibly tell. We cannot possibly know.  Not only we in the Dáil, but the people of our age throughout the country cannot possibly tell.  There is one class or body of persons who will decide that question without any reference to us and without any thought of us, and those are the children who are to-day in our primary and secondary schools, and who will be there during the next generation of school children.  They, and they only, will decide whether this country is going to be an Irish-speaking country or not.  Nobody can tell what they are going to do.  I confess that I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these children come out of the schools are they going to do what I am afraid a great many of us did with our classics, even when we enjoyed them, and say, &ldquo;Now, that is done,&rdquo; and, in fact, think of them no more?  If so, it does not really <Col N="1844" /> matter in the least what we decide upon in this or similar Bills, because in fact, the language will be quite useless.  Will those children, on the other hand, regard it as their most cherished possession?  Will they determine that whatever else they may forget they will not forget the language, and whatever else they may be careless in they will cherish the language as their dearest possession? No one knows.  Until we know no one can say what the effect of this measure will be.  Being of a conservative turn of mind, I confess that when we are in doubt and when we are taking a leap in the dark I like to remain on comparatively firm ground.  I do not think that I should have spoken at all to-day but for one consideration.  When men whom I know to be good patriots and good Irishmen are assailed, as people have been assailed here, when they are publicly held up to execration as anti-Irishmen, as hostile to Ireland and as bad citizens, then I must say that my instinct is to go to their side.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I ever heard anything more regrettable than some of the speeches delivered by advocates of the Bill.  Deputy Mullins on the last occasion said that if it were necessary to re-impose the penal laws in order to re-establish the Irish language then the penal laws, or something like them, ought to be reestablished. As this matter goes far beyond the scope of this particular Bill, I would ask the Dáil to consider whether the penal laws against religion in the 18th century were so successful in their operation as to make it at all wise for us to take them as an example.  Is it a fact that the penal laws directed against the Catholic religion in the 18th century routed out that religion in this country?  Is it a fact that they endeared the Establishment to the Irish people?  I am quite certain of one thing, and that is that it is not by compulsion, it is not by penal laws, it is not by the methods of the jackboot that you are going to endear the Irish language to any section of our people.  It is not by such <Col N="1845" /> methods you are going to make Ireland again what nobody can say it is to-day, an Irish-speaking country.</P>

      <P>I had really no intention of speaking again on this Bill.  I consider that practically everybody who has spoken during this stage of the debate has simply repeated what he said on the earlier stages.  I feel that I cannot let the debate pass without expressing my own opinion on the matter.  From the concluding part of Deputy Law's speech I feel that a great deal too much heat and wild language has been engendered on this whole matter.  We have had complaints of persecution, complaints that penal methods were being adopted, and, on the other hand, we have had the usual answers which such complaints are likely to provoke.  We have had a situation created on this Bill which is, in my view, largely artificial and similar to that which was attempted to be created outside this House on the Censorship Bill.  I fail to see what there is penal about this measure.  We may be in disagreement with each other about the educational advisability or inadvisability of this Bill or any section of it, but where the penal part of it comes in or where punishment is involved I find it hard to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Bill which lays down that a subject shall be obligatory and that a certain standard in that subject shall be obligatory for certain examinations. There is hardly any examination held by such authorities in which rules of that kind do not apply.  When we have Deputy Alton talking about the dangers of compulsion with regard to Irish and discussing compulsion with a capital C as if it were something unheard of and some highly dangerous principle that was being imported into this country for the first time, I really wonder whether Deputy Alton was never compelled to learn anything, whether he was not compelled to learn Latin, for instance, at some stage of his career.  All this talk about compulsion, as if it were some unChristian or unheard of <Col N="1846" /> principle which had never been introduced into education before is really astonishing to me.  When you have added to that the further attempt to suggest that there is something analogous to the Penal Laws, some element of persecution, contained in this measure, I must confess that I find myself in the region of amazement.</P>

      <P>I must say that the allegations of punishment and statements from one side that people are being persecuted and that penal measures are being put into operation against them have the natural result of bringing forth from the other side threats which are no more seriously meant than the allegations which called them forth.  I believe that neither the complaints about penalisation nor the threats to use penal measures have any real meaning in this whole context at all.  What is being done is to make compulsory for young people about to enter a profession one subject, in addition to other subjects which are already compulsory. Unless there is something peculiarly horrible and difficult beyond all other subjects about Irish, I do not see where the penalisation, or even hardship, comes in in this measure at all.  The statement issued by the Incorporated Law Society seems to go along these lines very much.  It may be that the admirable gentlemen who compose that association and who drafted that memorandum were under the impression that in asking students to learn Irish you were asking them to do something which would absorb all their energies for the next ten years to the complete exclusion of every other subject. Irish may not be easy to learn, but it is not very much, if at all, more difficult than other languages which boys and girls manage to learn very well even under compulsion.  It seems to me that the whole atmosphere <Col N="1847" /> engendered in this matter is one of complete and absolute unreality. I believe myself, on this question of reviving the Irish language, that by far the best way to progress is by agreement and by enlisting, if possible, the enthusiasm of the people of the younger generation for the language.  I dislike just as much the threats of penalisation on the one hand as I dislike the complaints of penalisation on the other. If it could have been done, I would have preferred to see the Incorporated Law Society and the Society of Benchers taking steps in this matter themselves.</P>

      <P>Were they asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they be asked?  Are they not Irishmen? Have they not duties to the people of the country and to the nation in the same way as everybody else?  Why should they be asked? One would imagine from the attitude they take up that they are a foreign body which has nothing to do with the aims and the aspirations of the people of this country.  They waited for seven years to be asked.  It is exactly for that reason, in addition to the tone adopted by the Incorporated Law Society in the memorandum which they circulated to Deputies, that I feel myself for one bound to vote for the Bill.  If the Incorporated Law Society and the Society of the King's Inns had paid any attention to what was going on around them in this country for the last five or six years, and had shown any sympathy with, or understanding for, what was being attempted to be done in this country for the past five or six years, they would act themselves and have prevented this whole situation from arising.  It is no defence to come along now and say, &ldquo;Were we asked?&rdquo; They knew very well, as everybody knew, in 1922 that a movement was going to be set on foot in which every effort was to be put forward to restore the Irish language as far as it could be restored.  They sat still for seven years and took no action whatever that would be of any assistance to <Col N="1848" /> that movement, although they occupy positions of very great educational responsibility in this country.  They took no action, and as the result of their inactivity other people found themselves compelled to step in and to see that these two great professions did not remain outside the educational policy in the country in the way in which they were remaining outside it.</P>
      <P>In that connection I would like to deal for a moment with the sort of argument put forward by Deputy Redmond, and which I think was implied if not explicitly put forward in the document circulated to Deputies by the Incorporated Law Society.  It was suggested that the Incorporated Law Society would be willing to adopt Irish as a compulsory subject for their students if the Dáil were to pass a measure making Irish a compulsory subject for candidates for election to the Dáil. Personally, I would not very much mind whether the Dáil decided to do such a thing, but I do think it is little short&mdash;I do not like to use the word&mdash;of impertinence for the Incorporated Law Society, or any society, which owes its existence in this country to the protection afforded by the legislative body in this country, to put itself on a level with that legislative body and to come forward and make suggestions which can be regarded as nothing but gibes.  The Dáil has an absolute and complete right to make whatever regulations it likes in regard to these professions.  In addition to that, these professions occupy a position in this country and in Great Britain altogether out of analogy to the positions which they occupy in other countries.</P>

      <P>I hold that the legislature or State would be quite entitled, if it chose to do so, to take over, absolutely out of the hands of the Incorporated Law Society and the King's Inns Society, the whole business of educating candidates for the legal profession and laying down, not only the standard required in the Irish language, but the standard required in every subject which is compulsory for entrance to the legal profession. That being so, and in view of the fact that these professions owe their continuance and their existence in this country, to the action of the legislature, I think it is very little short of impertinence on the part of these professions or on the part of people who speak from them, to put themselves on a level with the legislature, and to make suggestions, when the legislature is considering an important national question, which can only be considered as gibes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, but I hold that in making the suggestion that the Dáil before dealing with the professions, with which it is its duty to deal, should itself pass laws making Irish compulsory for Deputies, these professions are simply gibing at the legislature and nothing else.  They do not mean anything serious by the suggestion.  The question whether Irish should be made compulsory for members of the Dáil is a question that may arise at some later time but it is a question which has nothing to do with these professions. A great deal has been said about the difficulties which would be created for candidates for the legal profession by this Bill and it has been suggested that candidates for the legal profession have to work so terribly hard already, and that they have to pass such terrifically stiff examinations, that the imposition of compulsion to learn Irish will add three or four more years' hard labour to their existence.  I know a <Col N="1850" /> good deal about the amount of work that is necessary for law students to do before they pass examinations, probably as much as any non-legal member of the Oireachtas and a good deal more than some, and I cannot see that it will do them any harm if a little more work is added to the rather exiguous amount of work they have to do at present. That is another point of unreality that is added to this whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who is making the statement has had the honour of the acquaintance of a larger number of candidates for the legal profession than Deputy Wolfe has had.  He has not only had the honour of their acquaintance but he has had the honour of their company when working for these examinations which the Deputy speaks of.  I quite admit that the final examination for solicitors is the most difficult of these examinations, but I do not admit that it is anything like as difficult as the final examination for the medical profession.  I do not admit it is any more difficult than a large number of other examinations that I could mention, which do not confer anything like the privileges and benefits that the passing of that examination for the solicitors' profession confers.  All this talk about interference with the professional working student and about the heavy drudgery that will be enforced is to my mind full of unreality.  It means nothing, and it is intended to do nothing except create a wild atmosphere in which this whole discussion can be carried on with as much heat as possible.  I feel a bit uncertain about the provision in the Bill that a competent knowledge of <Col N="1851" /> Irish shall mean a capacity to conduct legal business in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I think there is some force in the argument that at the present moment you have not the legal terminology or vocabulary to enable that to be done; but there, again, I think it is possible to attach far too much importance to that side of the question. If we can get a state of affairs in which candidates for the legal profession will have a really competent knowledge of Irish, spoken and written, at the time of their entrance or their passing of the final examination, I think we will have done as much as we could expect to do under this Bill.  I fail to see why we should not aim at achieving, some time or other, a state of affairs when all the business of the courts will be conducted in Irish.  The only thing I would be sorry for is that there should be any attempt made to set up that as a kind of excuse or screen to prevent people doing the really important work of securing that the Irish language, written and spoken, is attained.  I feel there is some danger that time will be lost and labour spent in the invention of a new legal terminology for the Irish language, and in that invention the work of securing a good spoken and written knowledge of the language will be rather neglected.  If I thought there would be a real danger of that I would be dissatisfied.  I rely on the good sense of those who will administer the Act to see that that state of affairs will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I would like to refer. Deputy Dr. Hennessy quoted some analogies or cases which had arisen in regard to the medical profession, and in regard to the competition between senior medical officers who have no Irish, or only a small amount of Irish, and the younger medical officers who have not the same qualifications but who have more Irish.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the Deputy on that matter.  I feel it would be much better in the case of the medical profession that a knowledge of the Irish language <Col N="1852" /> should not be allowed to weigh to any degree against knowledge and training in the profession itself.  If cases of that kind do arise, if it is possible a more highly qualified medical man can be kept out of a position as against a less highly qualified man who knows Irish, then I think something should be done to remedy that state of affairs.  I am in sympathy with the Deputy there, and I feel that if the Deputy's point of view were met he would not be so ready with his picturesque and lurid phrases about jack-boots and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says they are the grievances of the people.  I quite agree with him and I say it would be well if those grievances were met.  I do not think that any heat that has been engendered by that injustice should be allowed to affect our minds on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say one more word about compulsion.  I feel that in so far as compulsion is justified at all &mdash;and I believe it is justified in this as in other matters&mdash;there is no other department of education in which compulsion is more justified than it is in regard to entrance to the professions.  I believe the State could almost afford to abandon or slacken compulsion in other respects if it were strictly applied to entrants to the professions and the Civil Service, and if it were made a fixed rule that nobody would be allowed to practise in a profession or enter the Civil Service without a thoroughly, a reasonably competent, <Col N="1853" /> knowledge of the Irish language. When I hear people complaining about compulsion I am all the more astonished because I think whatever else we do, whatever our attitude may be towards compulsion in other departments, in regard to entrants to the professions in particular we cannot abandon the principle of compulsion as long as the language is alive and as long as any demand is being made to restore the language. I am going to vote for this Bill largely under compulsion.  I regret the necessity, but I do feel the necessity has been altogether imposed upon me and people like me by the action of those responsible for the conduct of those professions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion I gave this Bill what I might term a negative rather than a positive support.  Now that the professors are out of the arena, perhaps we will settle down to business in a more practical way.  In the course of his speech which, by the way, was very much out of order, but with his usual generosity the Ceann Comhairle was very liberal and generous, Deputy O'Kelly invited plain speaking on the part of Deputies. My experience is that any Deputy here&mdash;and for that matter my remarks would apply with equal force to public men outside the House&mdash;who has the temerity to indulge in plain speaking on the subject of the revival of the Irish language and kindred matters and who has the audacity to say something not quite to the liking of the big battalions, is immediately labelled as anti-Irish or retrograde or even something worse.  As one who has taken a very deep interest in and has given practical support to educational programmes in this country and who has taken an active interest in educational matters both in this country and outside it, I want to say that it is altogether wrong to shut out the light from dark places. Do we or do we not want to move in step with the people?  It is my belief that there are on all sides of the House men who, if they had the courage of their convictions, would <Col N="1854" /> call a halt to the excessive zeal displayed by active spirits in a rather small minority in this country.  I believe such speeches as we have heard from the Ministerial Benches and the official Opposition had their urge, not so much in the sincerity which should be the urge, but rather in a desire to score off one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A sincere desire.  It appears to me as it appears to a good many others who give the subject any thought, that this is a case of trying to out-Herod Herod.  Both big parties in this House are simply afraid of a noisy active minority outside the House.  The same mentality is displayed here, and I rather regret to see it pandered to by the speeches on both sides of this House, and pandered to very largely by the Minister for Finance, where the Minister for Finance is prepared to administer not one jack boot but two jack boots so far as this matter is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained already.  I have said that a noisy and active minority outside this House is the urge which has found expression in this and like Bills.  I do say that it is altogether beneath the dignity of this House to stigmatise as anti-Irish or retrograde, Deputies who do not agree with them on this subject, men who are cultured and educated, and who because they are in opposition to this Bill, are dubbed and labelled &ldquo;anti-Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;retrograde.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of the whole question to which I do not think the Ministers or the House itself have given the consideration which the whole matter deserves.  I know that here again I am going to say something unpopular, and that here again I will be possibly misquoted.  Whether we like it or not, we have got to face the position that we are a prolific race.  Whether we like it or not we have to face an economic fact, and that is that many of our people are forced to emigrate year after year.  I know that the super-patriots will tell me that emigration is a crime; that our people should remain at home and starve.  Personally, I want to say this: that I would not ambition and would not visualise the time when this country is to be peopled by eight millions.  I would much prefer to see half that number comfortably housed, comfortably clad and well-fed <Col N="1856" /> rather than to see eight millions of people living on the borders of starvation as they did one hundred years ago.  Are we, or are we not, to consider that aspect of the whole question?  Are we to consider the position of those thousands of our fellow-countrymen and women who will be forced by economic circumstances to emigrate year after year? These people represent a very large proportion of our population.  That exodus will continue, and is it not our duty to see that these people will be thoroughly well equipped for the struggle in life in other countries? Are we, by our present methods of devoting one-fourth or one-fifth of the school week to the Irish language, and the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish, equipping those people for the battle of life in another country?</P>

      <P>I was studying some of the Ministerial diplomacy, and I thought I would be able to get away with it.  Now I would in conclusion make this appeal, and that is in so far as the movement for the restoration of the Irish language is concerned, and with which I feel myself in full sympathy, that we should proceed slowly.  The zealots in the language movement will ultimately kill it.  As I said, we are not altogether in step with the ordinary people of this country who have school-going children.  I voted over this measure before.  As I said I gave it a negative rather than a positive support, believing, as I believe now, that we have already <Col N="1857" /> ruined the education of one generation of children, and I do not want to ruin the education of a second generation of children.  Assume that those people who are antagonistic to the language had their way, and that they got rid of the Irish language altogether out of the schools, in another year or two perhaps another Government would re-introduce those measures, and again we would have the education of another generation of children neglected, if not ruined.  I would suggest, sir, that we should take a little note at least of those people whom we represent.  It is my experience from meeting the parents and guardians of the children in school that they are not at all pleased with this educational programme.  That is my experience.  I believe that if this measure were left to an open and free vote of this House, a different result would accrue.</P>

      <P>I see that it would be quite impossible to deal with Deputy Anthony's speech.  All I can say about it is that I came to the conclusion that the speech showed an inexhaustible source of unfortunate ideas.  I want to congratulate those opposed to this Bill on having succeeded in holding it up for a considerable time.  In fact, it reminded me of the words of Robert Louis Stevenson about &ldquo;fifteen men on a dead man's chest.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I left out the bottle of rum on purpose for fear of becoming too personal.  The Opposition have succeeded in holding up this measure which, I hope, will be put through its Final Stage to-day. This question, although the two big parties are voting together on it, is a political one in the essential sense of the word, because it ranges round the conflict of cultures which exist in this country.  There is a definite conflict of two cultures.  You have people with a sincere point of view on each side, one holding that something has occurred in this country which must mean a resurgence of the Gael, and, on the other hand, you have people who sincerely hold that there is an Anglo-Irish culture which must be maintained at all costs, and that the language of that Anglo-Irish culture is the English language.  Therefore, we have the conflict expressed in the views of Deputies.  Frankly, I take the view that Gaelic culture is the proper one. This is the first opportunity on which we were able to get unanimity between parties, who, some little time ago, were fighting each other in arms; they have, at least upon the question of Gaelic culture, found a common ground by which to proceed towards the real aspirations of the Irish nation.  I feel, too, that the stronger and the more united that development is the more peaceful will be the results, the less conflict there will be: the more power <Col N="1859" /> there will be to absorb those elements into the nation which are at present outside the Gaelic culture.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that a great hardship is being inflicted upon the legal profession by this measure.  I must say that I was very disappointed at the attitude taken up by the Incorporated Law Society, because, being a member of that Society myself, I had the feeling in the beginning that they might have been consulted, but, on the whole, I see now that consulting them would have been quite fruitless, and that their attitude is such that it may make it necessary for us to pass legislation in order to see that they carry out the duties of citizenship and obey the laws of the country.  It may be necessary for us to insist by law that the Chief Justice shall have a very competent knowledge of Irish, so as to secure in the future that he will not allow the Incorporated Law Society to play fast-and-loose with this measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Redmond said that if we were consistent we should apply the same kind of law to the Oireachtas. Personally, I should not have any objection to having a similar law passed in reference to the Oireachtas, because if boys of fifteen were from November next&mdash;I think that is the date in the Bill&mdash;to have a competent knowledge of Irish for the legal profession, it would be quite reasonable to make a law that no one could be a member of the Oireachtas in future who had not a competent knowledge of Irish whose age was now 15 years of age or under.  There is really no hardship in this.  It is merely directing the culture of our general education in the country&mdash; that is the only effect of it.  There is another element in the opposition to this Bill which I was sorry to see&mdash; perhaps it has its qualities as well&mdash; a certain conservatism in lawyers.  I have here a quotation from Blackstone, who points out that it took seven hundred years for English lawyers to talk the English language. From the time of the introduction of Norman or French law until 1730 the English language was not used officially in the English courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> Strangely enough, Blackstone thinks entirely with us on this question, and if he had been an Irishman he would have been a good Sinn Feiner.  He refers to the use of Norman as &ldquo;an evident and shameful badge, which must be owned of tyranny and foreign servitude.&rdquo; These are the words of Blackstone. Apparently it is inherent in lawyers to be conservative about whatever language was imposed upon them originally. They continue to use it, because there is, naturally enough, an instinct about precedents, and about the danger of using new terminology. We have to help lawyers to get over this over-caution.  The question of legal terminology is being solved by the Dáil, as Bills are being constantly translated into the Irish language, and they are supplying the terminology.  People who find objection to the introduction of the Irish language on the basis of terminology are unconsciously affected by the old prejudice of mid-Victorian times, that the Irish language is a barbarous one and was a language which was incapable of being adapted to modern ideas. That, of course, has passed away, and one has only to bring to the minds of people otherwise sympathetic that the language is quite capable of being adapted to any modern requirement.  It is possible that there are branches of science for which there is a kind of international language as the words are taken from Greek roots but so far as law is concerned there was a big body of laws attached to the old Irish culture and there is no lack of sources from which to draw a proper terminology.</P>
    <P>I happen to have a slight experience of the difficulties which have arisen in the attitude of lawyers because a person with whom I am associated made an attempt at having legal documents and difficult deeds even drafted in Irish.  So much difficulty arose however and so much opposition to him in the profession that it became impossible to go on.  The opposition is there.  It is partly as I say that conservative attitude and partly the fact that the <Col N="1861" /> older generation of lawyers are infected with the Anglo-Irish culture rather than by Irish culture.  I think there is really a large amount of agreement in the House in favour of this Bill and I hope that it will go through its final stage to-day.</P>

      <P>I would like to add a word or two to the debate, which has dragged out already to a considerable length.  I am not going to start off by saying what I am in the matter, because the other night one found that when a person stated what he was somebody immediately began to go away back to see what he was not, and, as in the case of Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly and Deputy Thrift, it was like that old fable&mdash; we all read it in our school books&mdash; about the wolf and the lamb drinking at the pool.  The wolf said to the lamb: &ldquo;You disturb the water.&rdquo; The lamb protested and said it was not he that disturbed the water, and the wolf answered: &ldquo;Well, if it was not you it was your father or grandfather.&rdquo; Deputy O'Kelly went back as far as thirty years with regard to the statement that Deputy Thrift made.</P>

      <P>It is interesting in this debate to find that the supporters of the Bill have abandoned all semblance of argument in this matter and have ceased to put forward any valid reasons, as commonsense men, why the Bill should pass.  At every stage they have shown less and less argument for the Bill, taken by itself, until we are left with the one outstanding argument that it is an awkward stone that they are trying to fit in to the structure of national polity.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the promoters of this Bill, but they have turned their attention not to arguments that might be in favour of it, but rather to try and disprove arguments which have been put forward against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One stock argument was used a few weeks ago in regard to this matter.  Great play was made of the numbers that voted against this Bill, and that there was a humble 15 <Col N="1862" /> against over 110.  That, I think, is a very poor argument.  We have the example of the man who talked about right being on the side of the big battalions, and yet who found in the years of his exile that that was not so.  It is said there is a demand for this Bill, yet we cannot discover who wants it.  The lawyers do not want it; the people going to law do not want it, so that one is driven to the opinion that this demand only exists in the imagination of those promoting the Bill.  Speaking earlier on this subject, I ventured to suggest it was premature by many years and that the undue haste would be its undoing.  We have the words of Holy Writ: &ldquo;He that believes shall not make haste.&rdquo; If we believe that the language is sound and that it is a right thing to go into the structure&mdash;and I am not disproving that in any sense&mdash; we surely can afford to let it grow naturally.</P>

      <P>No doubt it will be profitable to the Deputy, he will find it in the Book of Proverbs.  That this Bill is cumbersome has not been disproved, and that it makes for inefficiency has not been disproved. We have to recognise this: that whether we live in this State or any other State, the race of life is getting more difficult, things are becoming more concentrated and that a smattering of a lot of subjects will not do.  If a person is going in for a profession he must needs be a specialist in that profession.  If a person is going in for law it is incumbent upon him to become a good lawyer rather than a general linguist. If a person is going in for medicine he will get on the top of the tree more quickly if he specialises in his own department rather than ranging over other subjects. It is too bad, I think, that we do not realise that we should give every facility to those who want to make themselves proficient in their profession instead of throwing unnecessary burdens upon them.  We have <Col N="1863" /> to realise that the brains and memory of our young people are not exactly to be reservoirs into which we pour all our particular pet ideas at an unduly quick rate.</P>
      <P>I was very much interested in the speech of my own colleague&mdash;I think I am right in calling him that&mdash;the Minister for Finance coming from the same constituency as I do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said my own colleague, and I am sorry if I did not make myself distinct.  The Minister for Finance has a right to speak because he made sacrifices for the language.  We recognise that. But in vain I looked for any argument in his speech, save the one I mentioned earlier, that it was part of the national policy.  He said one thing which I think proved his honesty, that it meant a year or more for the student of law to qualify.  I think that it is a very serious thing.  In this age of tariffs and high taxation and the many other handicaps there are, it surely is a serious thing if the parent of a boy going in for the law has to support him for another year because of one particular thing.  That means an additional tax of £100 or £150 for his keep.  Yet, we are told that that is not a hardship.  Put it to the majority of people who have not means in abundance as to whether that would be felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think any Deputy would feel it if, putting a member of his household in for this profession, he had to spend another £100 or part of a second hundred to get him qualified. I think that would be putting a real tax upon the people of this country. I have been told that perhaps I have not the experience, and that people do not talk to me in the same way that they do to others.  I move about the country as much as any other Deputy, and from no quarter have I found any enthusiasm for this Bill. I believe that if this was left to the free vote of the constituencies, there would be no doubt whatever as to what the result would be.  I say, in <Col N="1864" /> another way, that this Bill is unstatesmanlike. Legislation should originate from necessity, either of economy, efficiency or social service. Now, there has been no attempt to show that this Bill originates from any of those three things or any other thing.  It is brought forward and not supported by any substantial argument, or it is not put up that it will be of social service or benefit to the people when it is passed.  What can be the effect of this when, in the name of economy, for instance, a great many social services are being cut off from the State, when we have less social services or dearer social services than in other States?  We take this view, although we quite appreciate the effort of the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget and look for fresh taxation but we cannot say that we agree to what was suggested, and that was to cut the rural deliveries of letters, say, by half, or that we should be paying another 6d. for our telegrams and delivery as well, or that we should be paying an additional halfpenny for every letter we send.  Then, on the other hand, without any semblance of social service, economy, or efficiency to bring this in, which is a direct tax on those who are going forward for the profession and which will not yield to the community or to the State any social service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have never posed as being an opponent of the teaching of Irish through the ordinary channels. I have given proof of it on different occasions.  Members of my own family are studying Irish in a natural way from their childhood, but it is quite a different thing when we put it on at an age when it will require a huge effort on the <Col N="1865" /> part of any person to acquire the new language.</P>
      <P>There is another thing that we must keep in the forefront of legislation along the lines of language. We must recognise that whatever language the commerce of our country is done in must necessarily occupy the front place.  An eminent judge said, not very long ago, that empires cannot subsist on culture. We must get the necessaries of life and the necessaries, from all these benches, have been stressed to a very great degree.  We have heard of the need for more social services, for more economy or rather more distribution of the money by this State amongst the poor.  I think that the commerce of our country at present should be our chief consideration. We can afford to wait on culture, and I will put it on that high plane, until our country has really turned the corner and until we can have time to devote our energy to those things which go to the improvement of the intellect.</P>
      <P>Life is a difficult and a serious thing, and we must in the first instance see to it that the commerce and the livelihood of our people are the first concern.  To my mind, this is a wrong attitude in regard to this. Commerce and law have been, and must necessarily be, closely associated. One cannot go on successfully without the other, and to make a scapegoat of the law and burden, hamper and hinder it is not the way to help forward the commerce of our country, to make that law less efficient and to hinder an honourable institution of the law which is so important to the growth and development of our State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, told us the other day, that there was a method by which this could be furthered, and if the Law Society or those concerned with the law did not conform to the will of the House, that there was a method of dealing with them.  To my mind, it is a free country, and while legislation is in process of being formed, it is only right that the people so affected should take an interest in it, and should express themselves in <Col N="1866" /> whatever way they feel.  Even so, it is known to everyone in this State, and we are not so ignorant in this State as not to know, that the jack boot must fail just as the mailed fist failed a few years ago.  That age is past.  These are not the lines of progress I should like to see stressed strongest at this particular moment. I would rather take the panacea of the most eminent statesman of this House for the upbuilding of this State when he says: &ldquo;He serves Ireland best who offers unromantic but laborious years of the service of his arms or his mind to construct her industries, develop her institutions and regain and uphold her ancient name throughout the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a word of personal explanation.  I certainly did not indicate that the normal student or that any considerable number of students would be obliged to spend an extra year in qualifying if this Bill were passed.  I indicated on the contrary that the normal student would require no extra time, but even in the case of a student whose parents did not send him to a school where he would learn Irish before, it would not entail more than an extra year.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this particular question because I have not made a full study of the Bill.  I was following it up very closely in the newspapers, but lately I experienced such extreme difficulty in getting into this House that I have not had time to read them.  I do not take it for one moment that all the people who are in favour of the progress and spread of the Irish language are to be found entirely amongst those who stand for the passage of this particular Bill.  I believe there is just as high a percentage of those in favour of the spread of the Irish language to be found amongst those opposed to the Bill. Personally, I tried to follow up the Bill fairly closely since I came into this House.  On the first evening I came in, two Deputies were speaking in Irish, and I knew they meant what they said, but, unfortunately, what they said meant very little to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> They were followed by Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly who spent a considerable amount of time pointing out what bold, bad men Trinity College held 31 years ago.  But he did not say very much with regard to the Bill.  I have come to the conclusion that this particular Bill in its application of compulsory Irish to one particular profession leaves it to the individual to choose whether he will support the Bill and place a further definite obstacle between one end of this country and the other.  I regard this Bill as being well-intentioned by those behind it, but I regard it as a Bill that will be entirely provocative in its effect on the North-Eastern corner of this country, and the idea that it will put up a further barrier or a further barricade between this Free State and the North East of Ireland is the one and only reason that decided me to vote against this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not antagonistic to the Irish language.  I may be a slow or a stupid student, but I am a fairly diligent student of the Irish language and I am happy to feel that I am making a certain amount of progress.  I am happy that my children, for their age, are fairly proficient in the Irish language.  And, on every occasion on which I was approached, I have subscribed one way or the other to assist in the promotion and spread of the Irish language. But the one thing that decides me to oppose the Bill and to vote against it is that I feel the passage of such a Bill will make Partition more established.  Not only that but there is a further danger that it will put up a few other little areas of partition through the country, that different elements that are gradually coming together for the welfare of Ireland will be separated again by a provocative measure of this kind.  I further think, as a medical man, that the tongue is an anatomical organ, one of its principal functions being to look after the food supply to the stomach, and that it is flying in the face of nature to make that tongue an obstruction to the food supply.</P>

      <P>I have seen very suitable candidates for various professions, suitable professionally and in every other way, rejected for those positions because they had not a competent knowledge of Irish. Such a state of affairs as that might be reasonable enough in ten or fifteen years' time, but I think, in our anxiety and enthusiasm to have things right some day, we are too much inclined to say that that day shall be next week rather than ten years hence.  That kind of enthusiasm will, in the long run, do more harm than good.  I would be more in favour of a Bill of this kind if it were general in its application. I do not like to see one profession or one small body picked out and Irish made compulsory for them.  It would be more in the spirit of those who believe in compulsory clauses to spread the Irish language and it would be more in keeping with that idea if the Bill said that for entrance to all trades, professions, etc., Irish will be compulsory.  To pick out a particular profession is, I think, unfair to that profession and will, I think, result in driving numbers of young people who might be going for that profession to do their studies abroad and return with their diplomas from abroad, thereby losing money for this country and for the teaching institutions in this country. The big idea that decides me on this Bill is that it will be placing a further obstruction to unity in this country; the other ideas are secondary. Those are the ideas that induce me to throw in my weight with what I consider are the small battalions.</P>

      <P>I think that this Bill in its passage through the House has really got more attention than it should have got.  I think that the opposers of this Bill have drawn out the debate rather too long.  They admit that the country is anxious for the development of the Irish language. They admit that they themselves or their children are learning <Col N="1869" /> the Irish language as hard as they can, and some of the opponents of the Bill say that it is, in effect, out of the generosity of their hearts or from the possession of certain national aspirations that they oppose it.  I think in this country, in which the State takes this stand for the Irish language as co-equal with the English language, there should be no necessity at all to bring in a Bill of this kind to make it a rule for the members of any profession to qualify in Irish.  It should be automatic that these people should learn the Irish language, from the national point of view, being Irishmen.  They are getting the means of education in this country provided by the people, and later they are given the opportunity of practising in this country, and the least they should do, in my opinion, is to study the language which enshrines the aspirations and the feelings of the Irish people, and which also, in my opinion, tends to develop the efficiency of any profession in the bread-and-butter side of national life.</P>
      <P>The last speaker, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, referred to this Bill as a compulsory measure.  In my opinion it is no such measure.  In fact, I do not think it states it is compulsory even for the legal profession.</P>

      <P>To my mind, it is a Bill to ensure that candidates for the legal profession will have a certain general knowledge of Irish, and that they will later on be able to discharge their duties in the courts through the medium of the Irish language where it is necessary.  I know it is necessary in some cases, particularly in the constituency which I come from.  If the Bill were to be compulsory, it would be compulsory perhaps owing to the time allowed for the learning of the language or to the intensity of the study it would be necessary to undergo.  I think in this Bill it has been so arranged that there is no hardship as regards time. Sufficient time is being given.  The Bill, if it passes, will not apply to people already in the profession.  It <Col N="1870" /> will refer particularly to those under 15 years of age.</P>
      <P>I think that ample time is afforded to these people to learn Irish.  The last Deputy who spoke said that if candidates for the profession were given 15 years more to learn the language, that that would be all right. The Gaelic League was established 30 years ago or more, and since then people have been given ample opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of Irish.  It was not altogether because of the activities of the Gaelic League that a good many people took up the study of Irish, but rather as a result of the intensive campaign carried out during the last six or seven years, backed up by the Gaelic League and the Department of Education. A number of those people who profess to stand for the aspirations of the Irish people in so far as they are contained in the Irish language were influenced by that fact. It is for those reasons that they took up the study of the language.  In my opinion, sufficient time has been given to people to learn Irish.  Therefore, I do not see that there is any hardship likely to be caused by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as candidates for the profession are concerned, the study of a language is really a part of one's general education.  Already provision has been made in the schools for the study of Irish.  People who will be studying the language and who will be likely to come under the provisions of this Bill, will have ample opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the language.  I, myself, had some connection with the teaching of Irish in a school.  At the time I took over the school the inspector's report on it was &ldquo;good.&rdquo;  There was no Irish being taught in the school at the time.  I took up the teaching of Irish in the school.  I observed that concurrently with an improvement in the children's knowledge of Irish, they also became more proficient in the ordinary school subjects. The inspector's reports on the other subjects taught in the school, and on the general tone of the school also improved.  After some time, <Col N="1871" /> the inspector's report on every subject taught in the school, including English, was &ldquo;highly efficient.&rdquo; The teaching of the language itself was reported to be &ldquo;excellent.&rdquo;  I mention that in order to disprove that the study of the Irish language leads to inefficiency in other subjects, or in studying for a profession. In my opinion, if the teaching of Irish is carried out conscientiously, there will be also observed an improvement in the teaching of other subjects.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that he objected to this Bill because it might interfere with the unifying of the country.  I think the Deputy should be aware that even in the Six Counties there is a great demand for the Irish language.  Since the inception of the Gaelic League, branches of it have been doing good work in the Six Counties, particularly in Belfast, where a college was recently established for the study of Irish.  There are many people in the Six Counties who are anxious to see Irish the spoken language in this country.  The Deputy seemed to forget that Cumann na nGaedheal, as well as the Fianna Fáil Party and every national party as long as I can remember, has always held that the study of the Irish language was considered essential if we were to attain to a full development of the national ideal.  His party and our party stand for the development of the Irish language, and making this State not alone free, but Gaelic, as was said by the late Pádraic Pearse.  We want not only to nationalise, but to Gaelicise the country as well.</P>
    <P>I do not believe myself that the Irish language is the one test of nationality, but it is a great contributory factor towards making a person really national.  I hold the same views with regard to national games.  A good deal was said about the rejection of candidates for public positions in this country because they had not a knowledge of Irish. It was said that, as a result of that policy, public boards had to accept less eminent men, particularly <Col N="1872" /> in the medical profession, than they otherwise would have got.  I think that is not so.  I know of cases in the West of Ireland where we have very eminent men who have made a study of the Irish language, and are able to use it in the course of their professional practice.  For several years, it has been necessary in the Co. Galway for medical men to have a knowledge of Irish.  The fact that they had to have that knowledge has not, in my opinion, diminished their efficiency as medical officers.</P>
    <P>Some of the opponents of this Bill said they would support it if a knowledge of Irish was made essential for other occupations and professions, from farm labourer up. That is absurd and ridiculous.  If you want to make any progress, you have to make it in a reasoned way. Some of the opponents of the Bill, perhaps, have in mind that if such a provision was to be inserted in it, it would mean simply blocking it.  We want to get this Bill passed, to hasten slowly, as they profess to be anxious to do.  We want to start somewhere.  Steps in regard to the Irish language have already been taken as far as the medical profession is concerned.  It is not unreasonable, I think, that we should now try and get candidates for the legal profession to qualify themselves as regards having a knowledge of Irish.  The study of a language should not come hard on candidates for a profession who may be expected to have had a good general education.  The position would not be the same in the trades, where a good many in them were denied the advantage of a good general education. In my opinion, there is no hardship in obliging candidates for the legal profession to have a knowledge of Irish.  I do not believe that the passage of this Bill will cause any delay to candidates in qualifyfying for the profession.  The study of a language, as those connected with education are aware, helps to develop the memory and the reasoning powers.  It has been said that a man with a knowledge of two languages <Col N="1873" /> is twice a man.  In many colleges in the past the study of different languages and of scientific subjects was undertaken for the development of the mind, the memory, the intelligence and the reasoning powers, and so on.  Now here, we have something that will help to do that.</P>

      <P>There are other Deputies in the same position as Deputy Coburn.  I am sure his views have been expressed by other Deputies. I feel there is a desire to hold up the passage of this Bill.  I do not see what great purpose can be served by that endeavour, except that it shows the inclination of those opposed to the measure.  I do not think there is very much necessity for going over the ground covered by those speeches.  A few points which were made on the Second Reading debate have been repeated on this stage.  For instance, Deputy O'Higgins said that this Bill would erect a further barrier between this State and the north-eastern part of the country.  Well, many other things have been done in this country from time to time that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; told us were calculated to prevent unity between these two parts of the country.  There are many things that we consider desirable for this State which the people in the other part of the country do not consider desirable.  I do not want to mention them, but they are well known to everybody. I would go further and say to Deputy <Col N="1875" /> O'Higgins that we can have the unity which he seems to desire by many methods.  If we give up our ideals in this part of the country, if we declare that we are prepared to see the Irish language die, if we are prepared to adopt emblems that part of the country cherish so much, if we are prepared to throw over the emblems we have adopted ourselves, we would by that means be getting nearer, perhaps, to that unity which some people desire, but it would be at that cost.  We do not want to arrive at unity at that cost.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Second Reading stage, it is my opinion, and the opinion of many others, that unity will and must eventually come. Some Deputy said on the Second Reading that the unity of the country was more urgent and important than the salvation of the Irish language. I would like to repeat what I said on that occasion, that in my opinion, and in the opinion of a great many others, the preservation of the Irish language is much more urgent and important than even the unity which we all desire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my honest opinion that the preservation of the Irish language by any methods that would be considered necessary is justifiable.  If any question as to that was put to the country I honestly believe the vast majority of the people would be on the side of the Irish language.  One thing that has been made clear from the debate is that every Deputy who spoke in the House is in favour of the preservation of the Irish language. It is a good thing that we have reached that stage.  Anyhow, no speaker has had the temerity to come out and say that he was opposed to the Irish language.  We only differ as to the methods.  The method those opposed to the Bill would advocate <Col N="1876" /> is that the study of Irish should be voluntary and not compulsory. The question of compulsion has been dealt with fairly well by Deputy Tierney, but suppose it was left in that position and that the matter was to be left to the voluntary decision of bodies like the Incorporated Law Society, I wonder when we would succeed in having Irish brought to such a position within the legal profession that litigants in Irish-speaking districts, or any other part of the country, who desire to use the national language would reach the stage when the legal profession would be in a position to deal in the Irish language with the cases that come before them?  It is quite clear the position would be that you would never reach that stage, because no effort has been made towards that, and no gesture has been given in that direction. Another point made over and over again was that no consultation took place with the profession.  I have already explained that a private Deputy introducing a Bill has no locus standi in approaching parties concerned until the Second Reading of the Bill has been passed. If the Second Reading did not pass there would be no necessity to do so.  Following the passing of the Second Reading a consultation did take place.  That consultation took place months ago, following the Second Reading, with the Incorporated Law Society, and you know the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result has been the issue of this document by the Incorporated Law Society.  I may say that a different attitude has been adopted by the other branch of the legal profession, because I understand that when a similar motion to that passed by the Incorporated Law Society was brought before the Bar Council it was negatived.  Consequently, I think that branch of the legal profession is likely to take up the subject of the Irish language for its examinations in a much better spirit than the Incorporated Law Society.  However, I do not propose to deal with that particular point now.  It was also stated during the discussion that <Col N="1877" /> there was no enthusiasm for this measure and, as a matter of fact, Deputy Cooper said that I was a very simple man.  I drew a wrong conclusion from a simple statement that he made.  I agree that I was not quite right, and I agree that the Deputy is not quite so optimistic about the future of the language as I thought he was.  But I am afraid he also shows some simplicity when he drew the conclusion from what occurred at a meeting of the Gaelic League held in the Mansion House, and said that as far as he could see I was not received like a Columbus who had discovered a new Gaeltacht in the King's Inns.  As a matter of fact, the Deputy drew a wrong conclusion as to what occurred.  It was a Gaelic League meeting, and any want of enthusiasm was due to the fact that they were not satisfied that enough was being done to compel people to do something for the Irish language.  I think the Deputy drew a wrong conclusion, and I would say this, that if Deputy Cooper or anyone concerned in the matter would like to call a public meeting in the Mansion House to deal with such a measure as this, I am afraid the enthusiasm with which he would be received would not be anything like the enthusiasm with which I was received at that meeting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift seemed to indulge in a prophecy that in a very short time the people of this country will condemn those who brought forward this measure.  Of course, that is only a prophecy.  I would be inclined to prophesy the very opposite.  I would be inclined to think that the people of the future will certainly not regard with any great feelings of pride the actions of those people who have opposed this measure.  Certainly, I have greater hope for the future of this country, and for the success of the Irish language, than to believe that such a thing would happen.  I believe the contrary.  It was stated by Deputy Anthony, I think, that various contradictory things were brought forward.  I think it was he stated that we wanted to pander to a minority for political purposes.  I <Col N="1878" /> think there is not much use in pandering to a minority in a matter of this kind, to compel people to do a particular thing.  The language used during the discussion of this measure has been very strong.  For instance, we were told that it was an oppressive and a tyrannical measure.  These and other words were used by professors and others.  They were taken up by the newspapers and the words &ldquo;tyrannical&rdquo; and &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; appeared in practically every report. I cannot understand why any person could believe that it is oppressive or tyrannical to require young people, who will be fifteen years of age next October, and who are going into a profession, to have a knowledge of the language of their country.  I cannot understand why such strong language was used, or why such headings were given to reports dealing with a simple measure like this. As a matter of fact, there seemed to be some contradictory views with regard to the Bill.  Deputy Hennessy and other Deputies stated that they were very fond of the Irish language. Deputy Hennessy stated that he had endeavoured to learn it himself, and that his children were learning it. Yet, in another sentence he suggested that if Ireland wanted a particular course of its own, there was no reason why it should not have the Irish language.  These are very mixed statements to come from an opponent of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift stated that he did not consider Irish was essential to nationality.  I do not think Deputy Byrne would agree with him, because he said that the language of the conqueror in the mouths of conquered was the language of the slave.  Notwithstanding that statement, Deputy Byrne made a peculiar speech.  As far as the question of the language being essential to nationality is concerned, in the peculiar circumstances of this country, if we are to preserve our nationality the Irish language is essential, and it is because I regard it as essential that I advocate the passing of this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I think that in other phases of national life <Col N="1879" /> similar efforts should be made.  This Bill is such a moderate measure that I cannot understand why there is so much opposition to it.  We could have introduced a much more drastic measure.  As a matter of fact, whether it is that they have only glanced at the newspapers, a great many members of the public believe that this Bill applies to existing lawyers, and I have had letters from people of round about 48 years of age&mdash; from solicitors' clerks&mdash;complaining that because of their rather advanced age, it was very wrong to compel them to learn Irish.  It is most extraordinary that such things as that should happen.  The people probably have not had time to read the papers through, and when they read such headings as &ldquo;tyrannical legislation&rdquo; and &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; they came to a wrong conclusion.  It was all a matter of propaganda; but I think that the newspapers ought to be a little more fair in the matter. The statements in the reports themselves might be all right, but the headings have certainly not been what they ought to have been.  I do not suppose that there is much necessity for going into these matters at any greater length.  I simply wish to say that I do not regard this as tyrannical or oppressive legislation, and I ask the House to agree that this measure, which only applies to young people of fifteen years and under on 1st October next, is a reasonable measure. It certainly cannot be regarded as an injury to anybody.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this might have been done in fourteen or fifteen years' time, but, of course, when that time came you would find people saying that it would be better to put it off a little longer.  I <Col N="1880" /> think it has been put off too long. It might have been introduced four or five years ago, but if it had I would agree that the argument that it was brought too soon might have had a little more force. But considering the position of this country, considering the Constitution that has been adopted, and considering the policy of this Government, or any other Government that comes into power, I do not think it is rushed legislation or that anybody can be taken short by it.  I ask Deputies to vote for the measure, and by doing so to make a declaration that this is not an oppressive measure, that it is an ordinary, normal measure, and that it will not inflict any hardship on anybody.  It is no hardship to require that young people who are going in for any business or profession, especially in the profession in question, should be in a position to conduct that business in the national language.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is 28.  In regard to the second part of the question, persons who by their behaviour give grounds for suspicion that they are engaged in a conspiracy to murder must realise that they cannot be allowed to pursue their activities without interference.  The Government is aware of the existence of such a conspiracy, and it is its intention to take every possible step to frustrate the designs of the conspirators and to bring the guilty parties to justice.  There is ample legal authority for any action taken in connection with the detention of suspected criminals.</P>

A party named Rooney, a party named Cusack, a party named Farrington, and a party named Rowe have been arrested several times&mdash;one party nine times, two parties eight times, and another party seven times&mdash; within the last ten days.  If these parties are under suspicion, why are they released after some hours' detention and re-arrested?  Is the President also aware that certain houses have been raided fourteen times within the last fifteen days? There is, for instance, the house of Mr. O'Donnell, which has been raided fourteen times within the last fifteen days.

      <P>The President said the provocation was given by the other side.  If we accept that from him, surely he does not maintain that, even if that were shown, a Government ought to act illegally.  I suppose he has some respect for the law&mdash;perhaps not much, as somebody beside me says&mdash;but does he stand up here to defend the illegal acts that have been taken every hour of the day during the past fortnight? At least, I am informed that these acts are illegal.  I am not a legal authority.  I am told that men have been arrested, kept ten or twenty or thirty or forty hours in custody and then released.  They are only an hour out, or perhaps two hours, when they are arrested again.  If there is a charge to be laid against these men, surely it ought to be formulated, and they ought to be brought before some court.  Is it not bringing the law into great disrespect, from the President's point of view&mdash;he is supposed to have respect for the law&mdash; when his officials arrest men, bring no charge against them and allow them out after ten or twelve hours, only to arrest them again?  At no time is a charge formulated against them.  In some cases, I have come across statements made by people who were arrested that they were never asked any questions.  They were arrested and held for days, and they were never asked a question of any kind.  That is not the way that the law should be maintained, if it is to be maintained.  If there are people who are suspected of crime of any kind, surely the ordinary procedure of the law ought to be adopted.</P>

      <P>These men have not been associated with political movements since the cessation of the Civil War.  Is it to be understood that it is the definite policy of the Government to drive these men out of the country because they are known to be in sympathy with national ideals, while not definitely associated with any political movement? What I have stated can be proved.  I have known cases where men who were definitely outside the political movement, and all other movements, lost their employment as the result of being arrested, released and re-arrested.  Their employers have said: &ldquo;We cannot have you here.&rdquo;</P>

I would venture to suggest that the Deputy would require to have information both as regards the conspiracy and as regards <Col N="1887" /> the individual to give a certificate of innocence to some of these people.  I say that advisedly. The Deputy has said that these are men who have no political affiliations and who do not belong to any associations.

      <P>That question was debated here at some length the other day, and it was debated in a manner which, to my mind, will not conduce to public confidence.  There was brought to the consideration of this question, on the one side, a <Col N="1888" /> rooted prejudice against the police forces and against the Government &mdash;and we expect, as a result of what transpires here, I presume, to inspire public confidence.  I would hesitate to say that any impartial person, reading the report of the discussion that took place here a few days ago, could be convinced that there was any other desire than simply to hamper or to make difficult Government procedure in this case.  This is a serious matter&mdash;a very serious matter.  We are agreed that in respect of recent activities they are to be condemned by all sides.  We have unfortunately got the sole responsibility of taking what we consider to be the steps necessary to deal with them.  In the course of police activities in that connection certain action has been taken.  It would appear to me, from what I have heard here, that every step taken by the police has been wrong. That is not the method of approach to the solution of a very difficult question.  As I have said, we want no interference whatever with any innocent person in this connection. If there are innocent persons who are being interfered with, I am prepared to consider representations in respect of them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether the Land Commission, in purchasing as untenanted land an area of 742 acres 3 roods and 3 perches, in the townland of Alleendarra West (estate of John A. Lewis, Co. Galway; Record No. S. 1990), took into account the fact that ten tenants in the above townland are the rated occupiers of that area, and have a right of turbary there, and also the exclusive right to the grazing of that area as part of their holdings; and further, to ask the Minister if he will state what other interests the landlord had for sale in that area, the price being paid to the landlord for it, and how and by whom such price is to be paid.</P>

      <P>In offering a price to the owner, which has been accepted, for his fee-simple interest in the untenanted lands on his estate, the Land Commission were aware that tenants on the townland of Alleendarra West held rights of turbary and grazing on the part of the untenanted lands of Alleendarra West returned by the above owner as in his occupation.  The offer for the untenanted lands, comprising some 3,500 acres, was made as a whole and was not apportioned as between the various townlands.  If the Deputy will refer to the final list of tenanted lands on this estate published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; on 25th January, <Col N="1830" /> 1929, he will see that on the vesting of the tenants' holdings on 8th February, 1929, in the Land Commission, and the re-vesting of the holdings in the tenants on the same date, there were vested in these tenants with their holdings the rights of turbary and grazing as heretofore exercised on Alleendarra West.</P>

Galway, have not yet been vested in their holdings; that although the estate was purchased under the Wyndham Act of 1903 at 3¼ per cent. interest on purchase money, the tenants have been charged for the past twenty-one years at the rate of 4 per cent.; and, if so, whether he will state the reasons for the delay in vesting and the high charges paid by the tenants, and further, if he will now consider the question of refunding the over-payments made by the tenants in the past twenty-one years.</P>

      <P>The estate of C.M. Maguire, County Galway, comprising the townlands of Knockballyvisteal and Gerrauns was purchased by the late Congested Districts Board. The tenants are paying interest in lieu of rent calculated at 4 per cent. on purchase moneys of their holdings in accordance with an agreement entered into by them prior to the purchase of the estate by the Board.</P>
      <P>The resale of the estate was delayed to a great extent by the destruction of documents in the Four Courts fire, but arrangements for resale have recently been completed and the issue of purchase agreements is being expedited in order that the tenants may have their holdings vested in them subject to the Land Purchase Annuities at 3¼ per cent.</P>
      <P>The reply to the last part of the question is in the negative.</P>
