      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Tariff Commission has yet submitted a report on the application for the imposition of a tariff on packing and wrapping paper, and, if not, whether he can state when it is likely that a report thereon will be made.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  I understand that the investigation of this application by the Tariff Commission has reached such a stage that the Commissioners will shortly be in a position to consider their report, but it is not yet possible to indicate when the report will be presented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if during the current financial year any sums have been collected in respect of excess profits duty; and, if so, whether he will state (a) by what statutory authority such sums were collected, and (b) for what years or accounting periods such sums were collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  As regards (a) in the question, the excess profits duty was imposed by Part III. of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and the provisions governing the duty are to be found in that statute and in the following Acts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Finance Act, 1916, Sections 45-57;</P>
      <P>Finance Act, 1917, Sections 20-28;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> Finance Act, 1918, Sections 34-35;</P>
    <P>Finance Act, 1919, Sections 32-36;</P>
    <P>Finance Act, 1920, Sections 44-51;</P>
    <P>Finance Act, 1921, Sections 35-42;</P>
    <P>Finance Act, 1922, Sections 34-37;</P>
    <P>Finance Act, 1926, Sections 32-36.</P>
    <P>As regards (b) in the question, the liability to excess profits duty, while computable by reference to separate accounting periods, is adjustable by reference to the liability for the whole period to which the duty applied.  The duty collected relates, therefore, to all or any of the accounting periods to which the duty applied.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the determination of accounting periods are too complicated to detail.  They will be found set out in full in the provisions I have quoted.  It may be said broadly, however, that excluding special provisions relating to exceptional cases, new businesses, etc., the first accounting period was the period ending after the 4th August, 1914, and before the 1st July, 1915, and that the last accounting period was the period ending eighty-four months from the commencement of the first accounting period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the very great delay in connection with claims for the repayment of income tax in Saorstát Eireann; if he is aware that claims which have been lodged for nearly a year have not yet been paid, although vouched and certified by the Inspector of Taxes for several months; if as a result serious inconvenience has been caused to taxpayers, and the winding-up of estates of deceased persons has in many cases been held up and serious hardships incurred by legatees, next-of-kin and creditors; and if any steps will be taken to expedite the putting through and settlement of these claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there is at the present time no general delay in dealing with claims <Col N="1871" /> for repayment of income tax in cases that are satisfactorily vouched and substantiated.  Of the large number of claims dealt with annually it is inevitable that some should present difficulties that give rise to delay.  If the Deputy will let me know of any particular case that he may have in mind, I shall be glad to have inquiry made into it.</P>

      <P>The application of a system of promotion for members of a class common to all departments of the Civil Service requires the working out of machinery by which the persons who are best entitled to be promoted can be selected.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) if, in view of the prevailing practice in other employments where salaries are paid monthly, he would be prepared to grant to the lower grades of the Civil Service an advance of salary prior to Christmas, having regard to the fact that these officers have in former years intimated their desire for such payment, so as to enable them to meet the extra strain on their resources which inevitably accompanies the Christmas season; and (b) if he is prepared to consider the payment of fortnightly, instead of monthly, advances of salary to such of these officers as express their desire to be so paid, as being a more appropriate method of payment in the cases of officers in receipt of small salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1872" />
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The question of special advances of salary prior to Christmas has been brought before me in previous years and, after due consideration, I have felt unable to agree to the concession.  I am not aware of the practice in other employments referred to.  It has never been the practice to make such advances of salary in the Civil Service, and the introduction of the practice as now suggested would be undesirable.</P>
      <P>(b)  The question of payment of salary advances fortnightly instead of monthly to officials who express a desire to be so paid is one which I referred to the Representative Council of the Civil Service for their views a considerable time ago.  The Council have not yet furnished me with their observations on this matter, but when they do I shall be prepared to give an early decision on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a list of Dáil Loan (1920) subscribers, amount subscribed £223, and number of subscribers 129, covering Currow (Killeentierna) parish was lodged in his Department in the beginning of 1928, and that blocks representing counterfoils of the receipts issued locally to above subscribers were lodged on same date in his Department, and that a receipt was issued by his Department acknowledging above lists and counterfoil blocks, and whether he will now state the cause of delay in repaying those subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The list and blocks of receipts referred to were received in my Department on the 22nd February, 1928.  The particulars contained in the list and blocks were not furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance during the period in which the Loan was raised, and the names of the subscribers concerned are not, therefore, entered in the primary register.  The delay in authorising repayment is due to the <Col N="1873" /> fact that no evidence has yet been furnished to show that the amounts in question were included in the remittances received in the Dáil Department of Finance from East Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgCrowley" hpid="Mr. T. Crowley Mr. T. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if his Department has received a list of subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan (1919-20) from Mr. Edmond Tracey, Holycross, Bruff, Kilmallock, Co. Limerick, who collected and certified the subscriptions; if he will state the names of the subscribers on the list, with amounts, who have been paid; and also, when it is proposed to pay the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The list referred to in the Deputy's question has been received in my Department.  Repayment has already been authorised in the cases of six persons mentioned in the list whose names were furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance during the period in which the loan was raised.  I regret that I cannot see my way to give particulars of the names of these subscribers or of the amounts refunded to them.  I hope to be in a position to authorise repayment at an early date in the cases of the other subscribers whose names are on the list, and who applied within the prescribed period.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Tracey lodged a sum of £230 in the National Bank at Bruff to the credit of these subscribers and has accounted in his list for £190?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think ten additional names will be inserted in the register immediately, so that the matter is nearing completion so far as it can be completed in view of present information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Mr. Tracey has been embarrassed by reports spread by some subscribers to the effect that he never deposited the money in the bank would the Minister get his Department to inform the remaining <Col N="1874" /> subscribers that their claims are in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that Mr. Tracey has furnished certificates from the manager of the National Bank at Bruff in which it was stated that a sum of £230 was lodged to the credit of the late Sean Wall on a particular date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will authorise payment of the Dáil Eireann Loan (1920) to subscribers who did not make formal application themselves but about whom representations have been made in writing to his Department by Deputies previous to April 30th, 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Where Deputies made representations in writing to my Department regarding individual cases within the prescribed period and stated that they were authorised by the individual in question to make application on their behalf for repayment in respect of subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann Loan forms of application were addressed to such persons and if the particulars furnished on these forms corresponded with those of entries in the records in my Department repayment was duly authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware what the Minister states is inaccurate because I have made representations about certain individuals and they did not get these forms.  I was going to ask whether the Minister would extend the application time as has been done repeatedly in America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that those subscribers thought that the application of Deputies on their <Col N="1875" /> behalf was sufficient will he reconsider the matter in cases where no forms were issued to subscribers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to extend the time.  Where, as I say, Deputies furnished written applications in which they stated that they were acting, or were authorised to act, on behalf of applicants such statements have been taken as applications. The mere mention of a case by a Deputy is not taken as an application.  So far as I can learn in fifteen cases in which application was made by a Deputy repayment has been authorised.  In certain other cases it has not yet been authorised for various reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If people were under the impression that Deputies were making application for them, why should they not get another opportunity of applying, as has happened in America?  If people have subscribed, I do not see what reason the Minister has for declining to give them another opportunity to apply in cases where they have been more or less led astray by thinking that Deputies were applying for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has been extended greatly.  I do not know what the total extension from the original date was, but it was very great.  Deputies have complained of delays in dealing with cases which presented some difficulty.  These difficulties could never be overcome if we were not to close down.  I would not undertake to reopen the matter.  Ample notice was given in a variety of ways to persons that they ought to apply.  Those who did not apply in time must, therefore, take the consequences.  If it were merely a question of paying people who certainly subscribed, I do not say that there would be any reason for fixing a final date, but there are a great many cases of doubt and difficulty.  In many districts we have already more applications than there is money.  It is impossible to deal with the determination of cases <Col N="1876" /> in such districts until the list is finally closed and no more applications will come in.  If we were to reopen the list we would delay the work of settling the register in those districts and we would probably still have people claiming that they subscribed and were not aware of the regulation.  I would not be inclined to reopen the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I might assure the Minister that I put down the question because I was informed in the Department that my personal application in certain cases would not do. There was no question of determination at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it arises in respect of the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be understood that in cases where a Deputy made a representation, the usual forms were not issued and, consequently, the person who gave the subscription is not being treated as having applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to read the answer again when he sees it in print.  Where a Deputy made an application, that would entitle him to be regarded as acting as agent for the person who subscribed or claimed to subscribe the money.  That case has been dealt with as if the person had made application himself, but I would not undertake to say that because a case was simply mentioned by a Deputy, and no application was put in by the Deputy, the applicant can now be entitled to send in one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy could not raise such a case unless informed and authorised to do so by the person who lent the money. Where would he get the information otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Without pursuing the matter further, I believe that everybody in the country understood that he should apply.  Any persons who did not apply, after all the opportunities they had of knowing their duty in the matter, are not entitled to any consideration.</P>

      <P>The grant which the Government have offered for the proposed improvements at Buncrana pier and harbour is contingent upon the Buncrana Harbour Commissioners making a local contribution of one-fourth of the estimated cost of the works. The Commissioners were advised on the 28th ultimo of the terms and conditions on which the Government are prepared to issue a loan for the sum required, which is estimated at £6,000, and their decision on the offer is awaited.

That was on 7th October. As stipulated in the Order, they had this resolution inserted in the local papers.  In addition to that, 14 days after passing the resolution they confirmed the resolution at a further meeting.

Twenty-five per cent. of the cost was borne by the State and the balance with interest is charged on the occupiers of drained and improved lands under a Charging Order dated 19th January, 1927, made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and duly enrolled in the Central Office of the High Courts of Justice.</P>

      <P>The only documents issued from the Registry of Deeds bearing the signature of a clerical officer are &ldquo;Common Searches,&rdquo; and these documents can hardly be described as important documents of title. The certification of common searches by the officer actually making them is required by Statute (2 and 3 William IV. c. 87) and the <Col N="1879" /> Finance circular quoted cannot of course repeal a statute.  In any case that circular was drafted without advertence to the peculiar position of the Registry of Deeds.  As regards the last part of the Deputy's question the position is that representations have been made by the staff to the effect that they are not properly graded and to enable a considered opinion to be formed on this matter I have requested the Department of Finance to arrange that an expert establishment officer from that Department should collaborate with an officer from my Department in an examination of the duties of clerical officers in the Registry of Deeds with a view to ascertaining whether the clerical grade is the appropriate grade or not.  There will be no solemn commission of inquiry. There will be an expert examination of the duties of the office from an establishment point of view and I hope this examination will take place at an early date.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, I should like to ask the Minister is he not aware that common search is &mdash; and it is a tribute to the officers there &mdash; largely resorted to by the public now instead of a negative search and is being relied upon; that it was stated in the Report of the Whitley Council in 1920 that such work did not come within the sphere of the clerical grade; that in 1927 the Department of Justice was memorialised by the clerical officers who have been doing this work for three years and that they got no reply; that there was a reminder in July, 1928, and that in July, 1929, a promise was given that the matter would be inquired into before October of this year?  I am quite certain if the Minister for Justice was here he would recognise, owing to what he has done in another capacity as counsel in requisitioning searches, that these documents are of great importance and I am surprised at the Minister for Agriculture stating they are not, as solicitors know that they are of importance.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any case in which payment has been refused where it could legally be made.  The express purpose of Section 2 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1926, was to terminate the previous right of insured contributors to a refund of their contributions, provision being made for the payment of compensation on a basis which depended on the applicant having reached the age of 50 before 5th July, 1926, and having lodged his claim before the 4th July, 1929. The time-limits were carefully fixed to avoid hardship so far as possible and an alteration now, which in any event would require legislation, must upset the whole basis on which compensation has already been assessed and paid.</P>

As I explained in reply to the Deputy on the 27th November, it is a doubtful matter of law whether any of the property of the Board is at present rateable, and because of that doubt, no payment in the nature of rates has yet been made by the Board.  As I stated on the 27th November, legislation dealing with this matter will be introduced at an early date, and I would suggest that the question should be deferred until a copy of the Bill is available, when particulars in a shorter and less detailed form than the present question would involve, may prove sufficient for the Deputy's purpose.</P>

      <Col N="1886" /> I do not know if the Deputy has any particular cases in mind.

      <P>I am not concerned with the difficulties that Deputies have in the matter of applications for old age pensions&mdash;I am concerned with the proper discharge of the duty of deciding pension appeals&mdash;and I submit to Deputies that the arrangements that have been made are adequate for their purpose, and that it is undesirable that Deputies or others should have personal approach to the deciding officers when they have other means of an unlimited kind of communicating facts upon which decisions have to be taken.</P>

      <P>The scheme referred to has been examined. Generally it does not commend itself. There is no statutory authority to enable me to approve of any such scheme.  As already stated in reply to a previous question:&mdash;In November, 1928, local authorities administering the Labourers (Ireland) Acts were communicated with for the purpose of ascertaining their views and those of the tenants as to the propriety of selling the cottages to the latter.</P>
      <P>Up to date, of the 31 bodies concerned only 6 have submitted schemes, 10 have expressed themselves as being in favour of the principle of the sale of cottages, 8 have expressed themselves as opposed to the principle, and the remaining 7 have taken no action.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (1) what steps have been taken to ascertain the incidence of (a) contagious abortion; (b) sterility amongst the breeding cattle of the country; (c) mammitis amongst cows in the Saorstát, and if steps have been taken, what are the actual figures of losses; (2) what steps have been taken to prevent losses from these diseases and what are the positive results; (3) whether the clause in the Live Stock Breeding Act which prohibits the showing for sale or otherwise in any public place of an animal which has aborted within the preceding two months has been enforced, and if not, whether he will state the reason, and if so, if he will state how many prosecutions have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) In connection with this question it must be borne in mind that the Epizootic Abortion Order, 1925, is worked by the local authorities, and not by the Department. With regard to (a) and (b) no special steps have been taken to ascertain the incidence of contagious abortion and sterility amongst breeding cattle, and no actual figures are available as to possible losses on this account.  From communications received <Col N="1895" /> from stockowners and veterinary practitioners it is established that these diseases, which are world-wide in their scope, are fairly widespread in this country.  It would not be possible, however, from the data supplied to give even approximate figures in this respect.  With regard to (c) no special steps of this nature have been taken, but it is a matter of common knowledge that the disease of mammitis is also comparatively widespread in this and other countries.</P>
      <P>(2)  The steps advised by the Department towards preventing losses through these diseases are set out in a special leaflet (No. 13) issued by the Department, which has been widely distributed.  In addition, the Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory is available, so that veterinary practitioners may be afforded advice as to the diseases, whilst preventive vaccine for carrying out blood tests for diagnosis purposes is supplied from the Laboratory. The results of vaccination against abortion show that the incidence of the disease is reduced to about seven per cent. following upon vaccination.  The information afforded on the results of blood tests has often proved of great use to stock owners, as it has enabled them definitely to ascertain the infected animals in a herd, and to isolate these animals accordingly. The diagnosis and treatment of sterility require the services of a veterinary surgeon to examine each animal and to treat any abnormality found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  In regard to the third part of the question, the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  There is no clause in the Live Stock Breeding Act prohibiting the exposure in a public place of an animal which has aborted within the preceding two months.  The prohibition in this respect is contained in the Department's Epizootic Abortion Order of 1925, issued under the Diseases of Animals Acts, which, as I have said, is enforced by the different local authorities in the country.  The <Col N="1896" /> Department have no information as to prosecutions for offences against the Order.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether mammitis is considered by his Department to be a hereditary disease, and if not why cows which have developed deformed udders from this disease are rejected by his inspectors for this reason alone, when presented for inspection with a view to having them registered as dairy cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department do not regard mammitis as a hereditary disease.  As, however, deformed udders are by no means invariably due to mammitis, and as the inspectors would find it impossible to determine the cause of deformities of the under in cows presented for registration, the Department consider it necessary, in the interest of the Dairy Cattle Improvement Schemes to refuse to register any cow having a deformed udder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it that because the inspectors find it impossible to say whether the deformed udder is due to mammitis or not they reject?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and anybody else would find it impossible to say so also.  It is very difficult to see the difference between a lesion arising from mammitis or from T.B.  In any case mammitis may develop into T.B.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the attitude of the Department is on that question.  I would like notice before I could give an answer, but I would be inclined personally to say at the first blush that they ought not, in view of the probability that disease of the tissues of the udder in most cases if it is not quickly cured will develop into a tubercular udder.  The English veterinary service is in exactly the same position and that is why we have all the trouble about udders. The English veterinary surgeons do not undertake to say whether the induration is or is not tubercular. In practice they refuse to accept any cow which has an indurated udder for the register of dairy cattle which must be kept.</P>

Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that if they were advertised the seventy or eighty people who are shooting over that estate would have tendered for it, and that it would be of much larger profit both to the Land Commission and the Revenue Department owing to the number of licences that would be taken out?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The shooting rights were always an adjunct of the house. Mr. Kelly has these shooting rights since 1915.  They were leased to him originally by the Congested Districts Board in 1915.  He had these rights continuously until 1924, when he purchased the house.  These sporting rights, as I have stated, were always regarded as an adjunct of the house. As a matter of fact, they are the only amenity in the district.  The house was vacant for a considerable time, and possibly we would not have secured Mr. Kelly as a tenant were it not for the fact that we leased him these sporting rights.</P>

Only this summer he and an official of the Local Government Department and another person drove off people who had been shooting for the last eighteen years over those lands.  Two people have already been prosecuted and fined £20 for doing what they have been doing for eighteen years.

    <Col N="1922" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main argument used in support of this Bill has been that the city of Dublin is being asked under it to do what the rest of the country has been doing for years.  In my opinion, that statement will not bear examination.  It is a statement that is not true either in substance or in fact.  I am of opinion that by the passage of this Bill preferential treatment will be given to other parts of the country at the expense of Dublin.  If the estimate of the City Commissioners as to the cost of outdoor relief be true, 5,000 cases of relief will cost the city the gigantic sum of £250,000. To this amount must be added what is already being expended on poor law relief.  In the North and South Dublin Unions at the present moment the sum of £264,000 is being expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is £514,000 of an annual debt charge on the trade and commerce of Dublin.  I know of no other part of the country, I know of no other county in the Free State that has got to bear a similar burden to that which this Bill imposes upon Dublin. It has been suggested that, as far as the commerce of this city is concerned, the burden imposed by this Bill can be transferred in the usual way to the consumers.  I would point out to this House as a business man with vast experience in these matters that such a thing is not possible. Really the volume of trade available at present is too small and the competition is so keen that the ordinary business man cannot afford to risk the loss of a reduction in his turnover by increasing the price of the commodities he sells in the ordinary way.  To explain my meaning I would just cite the case of three firms who will be affected by this Bill.  I do not propose to give their names.  The first is the case of a firm with a rateable valuation of £2,900.  If the estimate of the Commissioners be correct, the rates payable by that firm would be increased by 5/- in the £.  There is a difference of opinion as to the actual figure, but taking it at 5/-, the increase in rates to this particular firm will be £725. <Col N="1923" /> That is the effect the passage of this Bill will have upon that firm.  The dividend paid by that firm is ten per cent.  In No. 2 case which I cite, the rateable valuation of the firm, which is a firm in my constituency, is £2,500.  If an increase of 5/- in the rates, as suggested by the Commissioners, is added, the increase will amount to £625.  That firm has only been able to pay a dividend for some years past by drawing on its reserves. In case No. 3, the rateable valuation is £800, and the increase under this Bill on the firm will be £200.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On what did the firm you mention pay a dividend?  Was it on the Preference or on the Ordinary shares that they have been paying a dividend out of the reserves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the ordinary shares.  Now, this third firm that I have cited was unable to pay a dividend.  It is a firm employing a large amount of labour, and it has been unable to pay a dividend on the ordinary shares or preference shares.  The net profit for the year was £316.  This Bill will add to the burden of that struggling firm a sum of £200.  That firm has been giving a large amount of employment. What will the reactions of this Bill be upon unemployment in the city of Dublin?  I say it is particularly unfair and inequitable to ask the city of Dublin to shoulder this staggering load.  I say that in view of the sacrifices that the city of Dublin has already made so far as the national interests are concerned. I think I may briefly refer to the fact that the city of Dublin electricity undertaking has been compulsorily acquired from the ratepayers of the city without one penny compensation being paid for the undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratepayers of Dublin have lost £2,121,000 by the electricity undertaking exclusive of the burden placed on them by this Bill.  That is a fact that should be borne in mind when country Deputies say that we in Dublin have no grievance and that we are in the same position as the rest of the country.  I say that is a statement which no country Deputy can substantiate. If one looks at this amount of money that is being spent &mdash;if one looks at the total relief expended by the whole country; if one looks at that figure, and if one realises that £2,000,000 odd is extracted from the city of Dublin under this Bill, and when we see the bill for both outdoor relief and indoor relief for the whole country we realise the magnitude of the load Dublin is asked to bear.  A sum of £1,196,000 is imposed on the whole country for the relief of distress. The gigantic sum of over half a million of money will have to be contributed by the city of Dublin in excess of the total relief paid by the rest of the country.  To argue under such circumstances that this Bill gives the same treatment to ratepayers of the city of Dublin as has been meted out to the rest of the country is a gross perversion of the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that this is a problem for the citizens of Dublin alone.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that Mr. MacLysaght, the Chairman of the Dublin Union Commissioners, claimed that three years' residential qualification should be inserted in such a Bill as this before the Bill had been introduced.  He also stated that in a period of nine months of 866 persons admitted to the workhouse none of them had been resident for a period of three years <Col N="1925" /> in the city of Dublin; 513 were under thirty years of age, and 230 were 59 years of age and upwards. I think that clearly and distinctly points out that as far as we are concerned the responsibility for the burden that is sought to be imposed by this Bill should be borne by the rest of the country as well as by Dublin.  We are told here frequently that the whole burden as far as the rates and taxes of this country are concerned has been thrown on the agricultural community.  If the figures I have laid before the House are accurate&mdash;and it is up to any Deputy to disprove them&mdash;I maintain that agriculture is becoming the pet of this country, and that it is getting preferences to which it is in no sense entitled.  Perhaps it would be too late now to incorporate in this Bill an amendment to double the agricultural grant which the farmers of the country are to receive and to grant the £2,000,000 for the cost of derating which is to be put into operation soon.  I think that is the only way to satisfy the agricultural community.  Give them everything at the expense of Dublin City.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the difficulty in which the Minister for Local Government is in trying to get those people to shoulder their responsibilities. We can realise that when we hear the arguments that have been put up in the House here in the last few days by the combination against this Bill.  I hope that the pressure brought to bear on the Minister will not induce him to withdraw the Bill as he withdrew his amendment the other night.  As for Deputy Byrne's remarks, I have an answer here, and <Col N="1926" /> I will quote from Deputy Good, who gives the answer to Deputy Byrne in a nutshell.  Deputy Good states: &ldquo;It has been pointed out in these discussions that Dublin is a distributing centre.  As we place these taxes on those who distribute in Dublin, we put on them an additional overhead charge.  That overhead charge is passed on to the commodities which these agents distribute.&rdquo;  And then Deputy Boland added: &ldquo;A little more.&rdquo;  And Deputy Good went on to say: &ldquo;These commodities are sold with this super-tax to the local shopkeepers.  The local shopkeepers sell these commodities, with a little bit added, to the farming community and other industrialists.&rdquo; I am quoting from volume 32, No. 5, columns 1791-2.  Now there I hope Deputy Byrne will see the strength of the arguments used by Deputy Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply deny the truth of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill not alone does not put a burden on the shopkeepers of Dublin, but it gives them a financial advantage inasmuch as it gives them an excuse for putting a little more on to the unfortunate agricultural community to whom they sell their commodities. That is Deputy Good's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Corry sees it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy deny his statement?  Can the Deputy read anything else into it?  &ldquo;The local shopkeepers sell these commodities with a little bit added to the farming community and other industrialists.&rdquo; That is Deputy Good's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly agree that Deputy Byrne and Deputy Good are well able to shift any burden placed on them to some other shoulders.  I wish that we could find some other means by which we could prevent them from shifting that burden. That is the difficulty.  The whole argument used by Dublin Deputies in regard to this Bill seems to be that the burden should be borne by <Col N="1927" /> the country at large.  In Cork we provide for our own poor and we do not ask Dublin to contribute to their relief.  As regards the argument about the influx of country people into Dublin, I have never heard Deputies stand up here and argue that we were gaining by the emigration of young men to America. If people from the countries are migrating to Dublin it should be remembered that the country people have to feed and educate them when they are unable to work and, if they come to Dublin afterwards, the people in Dublin benefit.  The people who come from Cork are not, of course, unemployed because they are people with brains, who can hold their own anywhere.  I was rather surprised at the action of the Minister when I saw the area of charge in this Bill and when I compared his attitude with that which he has taken in other areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill confines the area of charge to the city of Dublin and some adjoining townships, but in the area controlled by the South Cork Board of Assistance the rural portions have to pay 4½d. in the pound for the relief of the poor in the city, some twenty or thirty miles distant. On two occasions we sent a unanimous resolution from that body asking that relief of the city poor be made a separate charge but, so far, we have got no reply from the Minister's Department.  The argument of Dublin Deputies is nonsensical. The country at large is actually supporting Dublin.  Dublin is living on it.  We are paying the hosts of officials out of taxes levied on the country at large, but these officials spend their money in Dublin.  Look at the income which Dublin derives from the 152 members who come up here each week.  All these things count.  If there is a nurse to be appointed down in Cork she has to come to Dublin to interview the Appointments Commissioners.  All the doctors in the country who are looking for dispensary appointments are dragged up here and have to spend a week or a fortnight in hotels while <Col N="1928" /> waiting for an interview with these Commissioners.</P>

      <P>They are not.  I know some of them who came up here at least twenty times but were not successful, and every time they came they left something in Dublin. Dublin is becoming more and more centralised.  Instead of the country at large contributing towards the relief of the Dublin poor, it is time that the Dublin people paid something to the country at large.  Last week I gave instances in which, under the central purchasing scheme, practically everything, even the brush for sweeping the Union yard in Cork, has to be bought in Dublin. I do not know whether Deputy Byrne has got these in addition to the &ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; shovels.  It is about time that those who represent Dublin realise that they ought to pay the piper.  Deputy Lemass remarked that he was afraid that the Bill might result in some industries leaving Dublin, but it will have a good effect if it results in bringing back to Cork some of the industries that ran away from that city to Dublin. The whole idea behind the Executive Council seems to be to drag every industry to Dublin.  For instance, speaking on the question of a tariff on flour, the Minister for External Affairs said that if the mills in Cork would shift their business elsewhere it would be a good thing; in other words, that they should follow such firms as Crosse and Blackwell to Dublin.  In my opinion the country at large is paying too much to Dublin at present, and those who squeal about Dublin having to bear the burden should be made to shoulder their own responsibility.</P>

      <P>Although he eloquently protested at various stages of the measure, he walked into the Division Lobby in support of the Minister when he challenged a division.  Is that an example of political honesty?  Then we have Deputy Good, who speaks for the Chamber of Commerce, moving an amendment at a particular stage of the Bill to extend the proposed area of charge. The members of this Party sat silent and listened to the Deputy's case for the proposal to extend the area.  We never said a word one way or the other.  We had decided beforehand to support the amendment so that we might standardise the area of charge so far as the poor law relief areas are concerned.</P>

      <P>We deliberately remained silent in order to find out whether Deputy Good was sufficiently sincere to put the matter to a division, because, if he had done so, I am sure that he would have been surprised to find the Labour Deputies walking into the Lobby with him.  These are the examples of political honesty which we have had from the so-called opponents of this measure.  I do not think that the residential clause in the Bill is justified by any facts or figures so far given by the Minister or those who support him.  I think that the administration of that clause will cause a great deal of confusion and, perhaps, hardship on those who are genuinely entitled to relief.  Generally speaking, the able-bodied destitute poor have not a permanent address.  As soon as the Bill becomes law they will apply to the recognised authority for relief.  I presume that they will be asked their names and addresses, and then there will have to be verification concerning them.  I suppose that by the time the information given in their application has been verified some will be looking for relief in the shape of a coffin. I do not think that that clause has been justified by any arguments here.  Of course Deputy Good has been repeating like a parrot the language used in a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; in reference to the question of the influx of country men and women to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; in a leading article dated the 26th November, stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the persons who will derive benefit from the new law were natives of the area which is being required to bear the cost of their maintenance, there would be a logical case for the Bill, but it is a notorious fact that a very substantial proportion of them has no real connection with the capital. Dublin has always attracted the unemployed, and thousands of men and women who are on the dole&rdquo;&mdash;the dole, mind you&mdash;&ldquo;in Dublin are natives of other counties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to have to say that a good <Col N="1931" /> many of the young men and women of the country, more of them than should, are coming to the City of Dublin.  For the last four or five years I personally have always discouraged young men and women from coming to the city, where there is no hope of their getting work for which, in the ordinary course of events, they would be qualified. Take the situation as it existed up to four or five years ago.  I should say that a few thousand per annum of the people who normally came into the city were absorbed in undertakings like the railway companies, Guinness's Brewery, Jacob's, the big drapery houses, and the other trading houses of the city.  All these avenues are closed and have been closed to them for the last four or five years, but these young people still continue to come to the city.  I regret to have to state that many of the young women of the rising generation are looking for jobs of a kind where they will not have to wash their hands after the day's work is done.  It is regrettable, but it is on record so that any Deputy or any person may know, that we have a waiting list of six or seven thousand for the Gárda Síochána; we have thirty or forty applicants for every dispensary medical officership in the country, and we have hundreds looking for jobs as typists or drapers' assistants.  All that goes to prove that the rising generation are looking for employment in a direction where they will have to wait a long time before they get that which they seek.</P>
    <P>The avenues of employment normally open to such persons five or six years ago in the firms I have named are now closed.  Therefore, there is no opening for those who may come to the city in the hope of getting employment, or there is less now than in the past.  So far as my constituency is concerned, I can say that the young men and women who have been coming to the city looking for employment and who did not get it, or who, having found employment, lost it, do not in the ordinary <Col N="1932" /> course of events become a charge on the rates.  I state that most emphatically. If those people come to the city, find employment and lose it after a short period, or if they fail to find the employment for which they are looking, they usually return to their families, their friends or relations and become a charge on them instead of on the ratepayers here.  I am sure that Deputies from other areas can speak in the same manner as I speak, having regard to the knowledge which I have on this matter.</P>
    <P>I wonder has Deputy Byrne or Deputy Good taken any trouble to find out what is the percentage of publicans, drapers and professional men, or those engaged in professional or clerical occupations in the city who have come to the city within the last twenty or thirty years? What would be the percentage of that particular type of person as compared with the unskilled person who came to the city within the same period and who is now a charge on the rates of the city? Would Deputy Byrne furnish some figures on that matter in the same manner as he tried to enlighten the House on other figures without giving the names of the firms?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.  I think the Deputy merely <Col N="1933" /> wishes to say something for the purpose of interrupting me.  If he listened to what I said he would know that I certainly did not describe a publican as a professional man, but if the Deputy wishes me to do so, I shall, for the sake of saving any further argument on that matter.  Is the Deputy aware that 54 per cent. of those on the Civil Service Estimates are living in Dublin?  Will he deny that that fact alone is a big asset to the city of Dublin compared with any other town or part of the country?  While I dislike, very much dislike, certain sections of the Bill, I am not going to take the responsibility of voting against its final passage.</P>
      <P>I suspect&mdash;I hope I am wrong; I will express regret to the Minister if I am&mdash;that there is a certain amount of friendly relationship between Deputy Good, in spite of his protests, and the Minister in regard to certain clauses.  That was shown very clearly in the Division Lobby. I suspect that the Minister, and we must go by past experiences in the matter, is going to attempt to utilise certain clauses for the purpose of making use of the destitute able-bodied poor by employing them at a rate of wages that will undermine the conditions of those engaged in industrial occupations in Dublin.  If that be so, I would be very sorry to vote for the Final Stage, but in spite of the deliberately dishonest criticisms on this Bill, I am going to take the risk of voting for the Final Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to be very brief.  The remarks made by Deputy J.J. Byrne and others, which I resent, would give the impression that every down-and-out in Dublin has come from the country, simply because he feels that Dublin is going to give him a dole.  That is not so, as has been pointed out by Deputy Davin.  In fact if Deputy Byrne <Col N="1934" /> would ascertain who the prosperous men in Dublin are, he would find that the greater percentage of the men who built Dublin have come from the country.  I think it might very well be said that it is very hard to find a real Dublin man in Dublin, with the exception of Deputy Byrne. I believe this Bill will do good in one direction which Deputy Byrne has not yet seen.  It will make those people, who represent the independent business-men, the Chamber of Commerce, open their eyes to the real situation in the country.  For the past six or seven years we have heard nothing from these people about the unemployed in Dublin or about the state of unemployment in the country.  These are the people for whom Deputy Good and Deputy Byrne now speak.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, the only thing we have had here from the Chamber of Commerce and these independent business men for several years past is the cant of prosperity and &ldquo;round-the-corner&rdquo; and about how well the country and the banks are getting on.  If, instead of that trash and humbug they came forward with during the past six or seven years, they had seen the situation as it was, there would probably be no necessity to introduce this Bill. Everyone deplores that the people in Dublin have to pay more rates to meet this Bill.  It is still more deplorable that the business men, for whom these few Deputies speak, did not impress on the Government that there should be some other means of finding the money to foot the bill besides putting it on the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have often suggested that there are means of finding the money to meet unemployment besides putting it on the rates. If our advice was taken on many occasions, and these Independent Deputies and Deputy Byrne and the Chamber of Commerce told the Government that there could be economics effected to meet unemployment and similar matters, there would be no necessity to burden the ratepayers with 4/- or 5/- in the £ to meet the Bill.  I am glad in a way that they are burdened with that extra amount.  It will probably make the Chamber of Commerce and these other people change their tune, and instead of the humbug of &ldquo;round-the-corner&rdquo; and the prosperity cant that we have heard, now that their pockets are being hit they will begin to realise the real situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of everything that has been said, the introduction of this measure is simply extending to the city and county of Dublin the provisions of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions)  Act,  1923, making arrangements for the giving of a particular type of relief in the city and county that is available in every other city and town and county. Exception has been taken to the area of charge.  I want to suggest that the area of charge in this particular measure is not out of keeping with the area of charge, say, in Cork, where part of the county has entered <Col N="1936" /> into a joint scheme with the city, or in Waterford, where the county as a whole has entered into a joint scheme with the city.  There is a big difference between a metropolitan area of 397,000 persons, such as the present borough of Dublin when joined up with Rathmines and Pembroke, and a city like Cork where the total population is about 78,000, or a city like Waterford or Limerick where it is much less.  We have, after discussion with county council representatives and those interested in the representation of the county, decided to make in this measure what will be a new county borough &mdash;that is, Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke as one area&mdash;and the proposition that the Bill puts before the House is that a city of 397,000 persons ought to be able to deal with its own poor relief problem.  Why the county, including the remaining urban districts in the county&mdash; Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney&mdash;is not one special area is that, in fact, you have in County Dublin a situation in which the boards of guardians have not been dissolved.  You have the Balrothery area, the Rathdown area, and the rural remnant of the Dublin area. You have a board of guardians in the Balrothery area at present distributing poor relief to the infirm, with the Balrothery area as the area of charge.  In the same way, you have the Rathdown Board of Guardians doing the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing in this measure to continue this board of guardians area as the area of charge for the relief of the able-bodied in the same way as it is the area of charge for ordinary poor relief, and to continue that situation until the local government position of the city and county is changed by the Bill dealing with Greater Dublin which I propose to introduce to-morrow.  That disposes of the area of charge.  As far as the residential clause is concerned, I do not know what kind of statistics might be brought forward to prove that the unemployed in other parts of the country would not be attracted in fairly large numbers to-morrow, if it were possible for them <Col N="1937" /> to receive outdoor relief in Dublin, in case they found themselves in Dublin and unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you make the period two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, after full consideration, we consider that the period is a reasonable one, and that no hardship will be done to any person in the matter of providing them with relief, because institutional relief is available for them.  It is a protection that the city is entitled to against the unnecessary influx of unemployed persons. Various types of remedies have been proposed so that Dublin ratepayers may escape this burden, which is supposed to be very great.  Amongst these are a fifty per cent.  State grant; a proposal that anything above an increase of 2/- or 3/- in the £ shall be paid by the State; a proposal to reduce the amount of rate leviable for this particular class of relief to a certain amount.  I hope that those persons who are convinced that the city of Dublin cannot bear the cost of giving this particular class of relief will pursue their inquiries in the matter as to how it might be relieved of this burden&mdash;pursue them in a more systematic fashion than they have been pursued, although this question has been before us since June last. Deputy Good maintains that the cost of relief in Dublin is the second or third highest in the country.  In fact, the total cost of poor relief in the city of Dublin is less than in any of the other county boroughs.</P>

      <P>I would like to examine that question further.  If the Deputy is interested in the percentage per thousand of the population in receipt of home assistance the proportion in Dublin is 15.6, in Limerick county borough 38.8.  The proportion in South Cork, which includes a rural district as well as the city, is 22.4, and the proportion in Waterford, which includes the county of Waterford, is 36.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give the figure for the valuation of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford per head of the population? Do we understand that the valuation per head of the population in Dublin is less than the valuation per head of the population in Cork?  You cannot take one set of figures without the other.  The position is that certain rates are paid and certain specifics brought forward as to what should be done in regard to Dublin.  I have stated it would be a disastrous thing in the matter of poor law relief and cost to the country if a claim was put forward from Dublin that fifty per cent. of the costs should be borne by the whole country because that example would be followed and has been followed by Limerick's demand and has been preceded by a demand from Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet that is the recommendation of the Commission which the Minister set up.  That was the recommendation of the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest further that a closer and more systematic examination should be made of this matter.  The Conference discussed the matter in the frame of mind that Mayo people would never hear about or that Donegal people would never hear about, and they would never dream of asking for fifty per cent. from the whole country as a contribution to their cost of outdoor relief.  The Deputy also suggested that any increase above 2/- in the £ should be borne by the State.  At present, the cost of poor law relief in Dublin is 2/10 in the £, and an additional 2/- to that would be 4/10 in the £.  Will anyone suggest that out of the cost in Limerick, which is 8/- in the £, 3/2 should be borne by the State? I wonder what protection there <Col N="1940" /> would be against the distribution of general outdoor relief above a certain point if it was to be borne by the State, what check there would be?  It would be the same when you came to that point as though you were going to put the whole burden upon the State.  If we, by the work we are doing in Limerick, reduced the expenditure on Poor Law relief by the same amount we have reduced the total in Dublin, the rates paid in Dublin would be less than the rate paid in Limerick to-day for poor relief.  This Bill, so far as it goes, enshrines our best judgment in the matter, and I sincerely say this: That if the question of the administration of poor law relief for the able-bodied in Dublin is to be approached either by public mind or the machinery administering it with the idea that there is a burden there to be shifted on to shoulders other than the shoulders of the people of Dublin because they form part of the country, then you are approaching the solution of a very serious problem in a very undesirable way, and your problem is going to go on growing because you are not looking at it justly, effectively and efficiently.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good suggested that in the matter of dealing with poor relief the different counties should support their own nationals.  I would describe that as going back to the flood in the matter of poor law.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is a small and not a very important Bill but one which practical experience has shown to be necessary. Under the Courts of Justice Act at the present moment if a Circuit Judge is incapacitated by illness a substitute can be appointed for him, but only in the case of illness.  It has been shown in actual working that sometimes the services of a Circuit Court Judge are required to do other work and there is one of them, as Deputies know, at the present moment, who is chairman of a commission and that will take him away from his work as Circuit Court Judge for some little period.  The Bill is to enable, whenever circumstances arise which prevent a judge sitting wholly or in part to transact the business of his office, a substitute to be appointed for him.</P>

      <P>I am perhaps happy in the position of not knowing very much about courts.  I suppose one should be congratulated on that.  It is a disadvantage sometimes, certainly a disadvantage to me at the moment in trying to discuss a Bill of this kind, but having read the Bill it occurs to me that the principle which is enshrined in it is not one which we ought to adopt.  I do not think it is at all wise or proper that we should have what I might call temporary judges.  That would especially be so if these judges were to deal with cases in which the Government of the day would be involved. It is certainly a practice to which, in my mind, the House here ought not to give its assent. Anybody who considers the matter seriously and thinks of the consequences, must realise that it goes to the very roots of law, that a judge, when law is practised as it is practised in these countries at any rate, ought to have permanency of office and, that judges <Col N="1943" /> who are removable by the Government of the day are exactly free men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally a barrister, having left his practice and being nominated to a temporary judgeship, runs the risk of losing whatever practice he may have had, and therefore it is up to him to endeavour to hold on to the temporary position that he has been promoted to, the temporary judgeship.  In order to do that it is possible, human nature being what it is, that men would be influenced in dealing with cases where the Government had an interest, without adverting to other types of cases, in their decision in favour of those by whose word their employment is to be continued or otherwise.  Now, that is not a desirable practice.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said he thought it was not very important, but I am afraid I cannot see it in the same light.  The principle is entirely wrong, and I think it is not one we ought to countenance.  The Minister referred to the instance in one case of a Circuit Judge being needed to be chairman of a commission.  I have no doubt it is a wise thing to have a man who has a training in law and is of a judicial type of mind to be chairman of commission which the Government might set up.  That is desirable, but surely there is a fairly large number who have had a long experience at the Bar, the older members of the profession, and there could be found men of judicial mind and of legal practice and experience who would be as efficient as a judge to act as chairman of any commission which the Government might set up for any purpose.  It is not to my mind sufficient excuse for taking a man away from the important position of Circuit Court Judge, or any other type of judge, from his ordinary court work and putting him in as chairman of a commission. It is not sufficient because the Government needs a man for that type of work that they should be <Col N="1944" /> given permission by this House to appoint temporary judges.  Some of us are old enough to remember the removable magistrates and their history in this country.  It is not one I would like to see repeated here.  I am not suggesting that the professional gentlemen who will be appointed will act as a number of these removable magistrates did for the Government of the day in their time, but the risk is there, and the temptation is there, and I think the Government would be well advised in withdrawing this Bill and finding some other way to complete the arrears of work that have accumulated, and the other work which they think it is desirable to put Circuit Court Judges on to do.  Other ways should be found of doing that work.</P>
      <P>It is entirely wrong if we are to consider the question of justice, the question of the authority of the Courts and if we are to believe in the impartiality of the Courts and have confidence that those who are acting as judges will not and cannot be influenced by those in authority in the country.  The suggestion will be there at all times that where temporary judges are concerned they can be influenced because the term of their appointment may be brief and if they have to come for renomination the men themselves run serious risks in their profession by cutting themselves away from practice. On the whole, I think the principle is wrong and I hope this House will not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this Bill changes the form of law.  Formerly if a Circuit Court Judge was ill the Attorney-General could appoint a substitute for the time being and arrange accordingly for his payment. Now, according to this Bill, the power is given to the Governor-General, and the powers are extended somewhat in this way, that it is not merely a matter of sickness but also for any other reason that might occur.  If the Circuit Court Judge is taken off to do other work, then the Governor-General can appoint someone to do his work.  Now <Col N="1945" /> the reasons against having this arrangement in principle have already been put forward by Deputy O'Kelly, and there is really not a great deal to add to what he has stated already except this that the vacations of the Circuit Court Judges are very long.  The Circuit Court Judges get 19 weeks' holidays in the year.  It would be well to go into that matter.  I think the Minister will find that I am correct.  I imagine that 12 weeks ought to be ample holiday for men.  I do not say that Circuit Court Judges are not hard worked or do not give value or that the work is not satisfactory, but I think 19 weeks is a little bit excessive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy had better revise his statement, because, with some knowledge of Circuit Court Judges and their work, I certainly say I could not make any such statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there are some who get these holidays.  On the other hand, there may be others who do not get such a long period of time, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are cases where they do, and possibly they may be brought in to do a certain amount of work instead of appointing substitutes.  The principle of appointing substitutes is harmful to the unpartisan character of a court; it is harmful to the dignity of the Bench, and injurious to the individuals who are appointed. We know that men have been appointed for a time, and when they have gone back to the profession they have found a considerable part of their practice cut off.  Solicitors get into the habit of employing certain counsel.  If one of these counsel is appointed to a temporary position and holds it for some time the solicitor would have to employ somebody else and will not want him back again.  Once a connection in a business <Col N="1946" /> is broken it is very hard for temporary men to get back to their profession again.  Supposing the man who is appointed to a temporary position is hearing a case where the solicitor who has employed him for many years is engaged. If he fails to employ him when he goes back to his profession he is in a very awkward position. The judge is in a more awkward position.  He will be more sensitive in dealing with a case of that sort.</P>
      <P>I have two suggestions to make to the Minister&mdash;one that it might be better for him to hold over this Bill until the matter is discussed and dealt with by the Committee which has been appointed to examine the whole of the Courts of Justice Act. I think he might very well wait and let that matter come up for discussion and solution by them.  Then I would like to point out that if a man is appointed to the position of a Circuit Court Judge he should do the work of a Circuit Court Judge and should not be taken off to do other work.  Other men can be got to do that work.  Appointing a man to do Circuit Court work, and then taking him away to do other work which is not identical with that duty, is a little bit Gilbertian.  It would be better to appoint a man and leave him on that work, and not be taking him away to other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister persists in going on with this Bill before the Committee has had time to deal with it, I think he should accept an amendment that such temporarily appointed judges should not deal with cases where the State is a party, because naturally they will not be in a position of independence.  They will not be on the footing of any other judge. Constitutionally, the principle involved is that a judge stands as a protection to the citizen from all and especially from the State, and the independence of the judiciary secures the rights of the individual as against the State.  So that when the State comes into Court, it comes in on an equal footing with any individual citizen.  Where the man is appointed temporarily he cannot maintain an attitude of independence. <Col N="1947" /> The man himself has nothing to do with it.  The independence of the judiciary as a principle is not maintained because it is merely a temporary position.</P>
    <P>This measure might be used also for the purpose of appointing a man who would be used like the removable magistrates, as has already been pointed out by Deputy O'Kelly. Even to allow the possibility of such a thing would be a great evil.  I would, therefore, suggest that the Minister, when replying, should indicate to us whether he would be willing to accept an amendment excluding any case where the State is a party being tried by one of these temporary judges, or whether he would not allow this matter to stand over until it has been dealt with by the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general purport of the remarks made by the last two speakers I am in complete agreement.  I have always opposed the creation of anything in the nature of temporary judges for the reasons as mainly outlined by the last two speakers. This Bill, as far as I can gather, merely proposes to extend the provision that already exists in Section 45 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, in case of the illness of an existing Circuit Court Judge, to cases where that judge or other judges may have had to do duty or service temporarily imposed upon them by the Executive Council or Government of the day.  I would certainly like to support the argument put forward by Deputy O'Kelly that there are plenty other good fish in the sea and that there are many capable people outside the existing Circuit Court Judges who could be called upon to discharge, and would discharge, all the duties in as able, efficient and impartial a manner.  There is no lack of talent, if I might say so with all due modesty, and experience at the Irish Bar, and if the Minister for Justice requires efficiency, impartiality and ability I think he will be able to find all these outside the existing Circuit <Col N="1948" /> Court Judges.  I say that with the greatest possible respect to the Circuit Court Judges.</P>
      <P>I was also impressed by the suggestion made by Deputy Little.  I think it is a very reasonable one.  We have now set up a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad to consider practically the whole working of the Courts of Justice Act, and surely this is not an expedient moment, at any rate, to introduce a Bill such as this, even if the principle contained in this Bill were a proper one, which personally I entirely dispute. At the time of the passage of the Courts of Justice Act I ventured to say that the number of Circuit Court Judges would not be sufficient. I made the same remark in regard to High Court Judges.  I think when the Committee comes to consider these matters, and when their recommendations come before the House, that the House will discover that I was not far wrong.</P>
      <P>I say it is better to create more permanent judges if they are required than go in for, I think, the unconstitutional expedient of creating temporary judges.  It is better for all concerned.  It is better for the State.  It is better for those who attend the courts and for the judges themselves.  I think it places a practising barrister in a most invidious position to put him upon the bench and to expect him to act with such a degree of impartiality as would be expected of him if he were made a permanent judge of the State and yet all the time have him there in a temporary capacity.  From his point of view, and more especially from the point of view of the public and from the point of view of the State, I think the principle is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, apart from the principle being wrong, I do suggest to the Minister that this is a most inappropriate and inopportune time to bring in this Bill.  Why not let this Committee which has been set up investigate these many other various subjects that are germane to the working of the Courts of Justice Act, bring in their reports and recommendations? <Col N="1949" /> We are now proposing to have an adjournment at the end of the week.  We are told that the Recess is to last for two and a half months.  This Bill, even if it gets a Second Reading, will not very likely become law before the House resumes in February.  Where is the hurry and where is the haste to pass legislation such as this, especially when in the meantime you will have this Committee sitting to consider the whole working of the Courts of Justice Act?  By the time we resume in February we hope, at any rate, that we will have the recommendations of that Committee before us.</P>
    <P>I would therefore seriously suggest to the Minister that taking everything into consideration it would be far better if he would see his way to withdraw this Bill now.  He will lose nothing by doing so because as I have said it is not possible it will be passed into law before the Dáil resumes in February.  Let the Minister withdraw the Bill now.  Let us see what the Committee are going to recommend in this respect, because surely the matter must come before them, and if they do not satisfy him in their recommendations he can bring forward the Bill again when the Dáil resumes.  I think that is a very reasonable and a very sensible course and I think he would be doing the wise thing if he were to adopt Deputy Little's suggestion and take that course.  Before I sit down I may say that if the Minister does insist upon going on with this Bill now, I for one, if a division is called in the matter, will feel constrained to vote against it, as I have always voted and spoken against the creation of temporary appointments of this character which, I think, are injurious to the Constitution and to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to support this Bill on one ground only. I am satisfied from what the Minister has stated and from what I know of the facts that the Bill deals with an absolute necessity and with a matter of extreme urgency.  I share the same dislike to the appointment of temporary judges as Deputies <Col N="1950" /> O'Kelly, Little and Redmond have given expression to.  I agree that they should only be appointed where it is absolutely necessary and that there is rather a serious objection to these continual appointments from day to day of temporary judges.  I noticed that in lieu of the appointment of temporary judges as proposed by the Bill introduced by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Little said something as regards the curtailment of the holidays of the existing judges. I do not think that he could have entered into the facts when he made that suggestion.  I cannot speak of other circuits, but I can speak of the City and County of Cork and there I know the present position.  I do not think that that present position can have been before Deputy Little when he made the suggestion that the present circuit judges were getting too many holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how it works out. Take the Cork Circuit Judge.  What has he to do there?  He has to do first with the work done by the late Recorder of Cork and with the work done by the late County Court Judge of the West Riding of the County of Cork.  He has to do the work thrown on him by the increased jurisdiction in contract cases and in cases of tort, which means, being translated into nonlegal language, that his work so far as time is concerned is increased by about half as much as formerly. He has to deal with increased criminal jurisdiction, inasmuch as he discharges nearly the whole of the work that it took five judges in the spring, summer and winter assizes to discharge formerly.  He has now to discharge that work and he has, in addition, to discharge the increased jurisdiction thrown on him in the hearing of appeals from the District Justices, which have now become a very serious matter so far as time is concerned.  It is true that his work has been slightly lessened by the transfer to the District Courts of some work formerly done by the County Court Judges.  But on the whole it works out that the present Circuit Judge has to do, at <Col N="1951" /> practically the same salary as the former County Court Judge, four times as much work.  If you take it as regards the importance of his work, you can see that he is doing higher work.  In other words, one man does now what four men did formerly, and I think that in all fairness and having regard to what we all must look to&mdash;the preservation of the efficiency of the Circuit Court&mdash;it would be impossible in any way to increase that task, and any attempt to increase it will only result in failure.  That being so, I would like, when looking for a remedy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy for a moment to ask him a question as to the holidays of the Circuit Judges?  My opinion was that the Circuit Court Judges get three weeks' holidays at Christmas; three weeks' holidays at Easter; three weeks' holidays at Whitsuntide, and ten weeks' holidays in the summer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Little has not studied the subject or he would not have made the suggestion that he made.  I know that a considerable portion of the time supposed to be spent on holidays, or on what the Deputy calls holidays, has to be spent by the Circuit Court Judge at home or elsewhere discharging the duties of his office or discharging those many duties which have to be performed out of court in the case of the Circuit Judge.  In the case of the Supreme Courts these duties have not to be performed.  I do not think the facts can have been before Deputy Little or he would not have made the suggestion that he has made.  That suggestion amounts to this, that the Circuit Court Judge at present gets holidays which can afford to be cut down as a remedy <Col N="1952" /> for the want which does exist of an additional judge.  The other alternative which I gather was suggested, and which I must say appeals to me, was that the Minister for Justice should take his courage in his hands and appoint an additional Circuit Court Judge forthwith.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely imperative for the proper carrying out of the Courts of Justice Act, no matter what the findings of the Committee may be, that an additional judge be appointed.  At the present moment the Courts of Justice Act deals with three courts.  It deals first with the High Court, and in the High Court, for the want of a judge, a shocking state of affairs has resulted.  The hearing of appeals is backward to the extent of one and a half years. It was only last week that the High Court was able to get rid of appeals that were lodged one and a half years ago.  The Minister for Justice will have to face the difficulty sooner or later that our present judicial system cannot continue with the existing staff.  I hope the Minister for Justice will take this criticism in the spirit in which it is meant.  In the District Court, the Minister has, during the current year, strained the machinery of his office against the appointment of temporary justices. The result has not been altogether a success.  I know he has made money by it.  Money has been saved that would otherwise have been expended, but the result has been inconvenience and delay, and loss has resulted to litigants of a kind which I hope will not be repeated in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am prepared to vote for this Bill rather than have the Circuit Courts which, with one or two exceptions, are in arrears, getting into the same state of chaos as exists in the other courts, I would ask the Minister to employ the necessary labourers to do the job.  We cannot be running the thing for ever with handy men.  The present High Court, the District Court and the Circuit Court will require some additional appointments, and while I agree it would be wise to have those appointments permanently made <Col N="1953" /> rather than continue appointing journeymen, at present no harm could be done by allowing this Bill to pass.  At the same time it is well to bring under the notice of the Minister for Justice the desirability of appointing permanent judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>With a great deal of what Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Redmond have said I am in agreement.  I am no lover of temporary judges, and I think I have already proved that.  Deputies must be aware that I introduced a Bill to get permanent assistant District Justices in order that we might as far as possible do away with temporary District Justices.  Nor do I, on the other hand, like that there should be temporary judges of any kind.  But there are certain emergencies which can only be met and countered in a certain fashion.  One of those emergencies, as I briefly explained to the House, has already arisen.  This Bill is urgent.  One of the Circuit Judges in Dublin will not be available, as is known, for the purpose of carrying out his entire work.  On the other hand there are two circuits which are in a very bad way; one, indeed, in a tremendously bad way.  Unfortunately, one of our unattached, if I may use the expression, Circuit Judges is at the present moment recovering from a very long and tedious illness.  Possibly Deputy Little may know that. This judge is not well, but he is able to sit in Dublin.  He is not able to go down to transact business in the midlands and the north-west, where there is a terrible pressure of work, and where there are very heavy arrears indeed.  I can see no conceivable way of clearing up these arrears and giving litigants the consideration they are entitled to.  Deputy Wolfe has put it more forcibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, litigants are entitled to have their cases disposed of with reasonable expedition.  There should be sittings of the Circuit Court arranged for each county during the autumn.  There is no judge available to go there during the autumn. That is what has happened, and unless the position is remedied there <Col N="1954" /> will not be a judge there for the spring.  It is not fair to the people there.</P>

The question is urgent, and I do not see any way in which it can be dealt with except by appointing assistants. No suggestion came from the opposite side with regard to that existing principle which was the principle in the days of the old County Courts and which has been the principle down to the present.  No one has suggested that that should be swept away.</P>

      <P>Would it not be more advisable to use the law as it exists? The Minister has power under the existing Act in the case of illness to appoint someone as a substitute. Would it not be better to operate under the existing law and wait until the Committee reports?</P>

      <P>Yes, but this judge is in a condition physically to sit in Dublin, and he is doing so.  While he is sitting in Dublin it is not possible to appoint a substitute for him.  Therefore we cannot appoint a substitute to do the arrears which it is necessary should be cleared up.  That is the position. At the moment there are very heavy arrears, and there is no way under the existing law in which we can appoint another judge.</P>

      <P>I do not like interrupting and I do not wish to make another speech, but may I <Col N="1955" /> throw out this suggestion as an alternative? What I object to about the Bill is its permanent nature for the appointment of temporary judges. Why not introduce ad hoe legislation, if necessary, and name the particular judges whom you require to relieve?  If that is done, I, for one, on the statement made by the Minister as regards the immediate necessity for the appointment of temporary judges, would have no objection, but what I object to is the permanent nature of a Bill to appoint temporary judges.  It is setting a precedent and it will be there for all time.  If there is necessity to relieve the judges mentioned let him introduce ad hoe legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a permanent measure which will be on the Statute Book for all time.  It is giving power permanently to create temporary judges.  If the Minister were to introduce and hoe legislation to relieve the two cases mentioned, I would support him, but I cannot support a measure which is altogether permanent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is interpreting the statute in such a narrow sense as really to misinterpret it by saying that you cannot appoint a temporary assistant when a judge cannot do his own work owing to illness?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the law.  I am advised that there is no question about it.  It is obvious that you cannot have a man sitting as a judge and at the same time have a substitute sitting for him because he is too ill to sit.  That is what Deputy Little suggests.  It has been suggested that there should be a permanent judge appointed.  I think <Col N="1956" /> that we will be able to carry on the Circuit Court without an extra permanent judge.  It would, of course, require legislation to appoint another Circuit Judge, but, apart from accident, we will be able to carry on the administration of the Circuit Court with the present staff.  That is, of course, unless rare occasions occur like the present crisis.  I do not think that at present there is any necessity to bring in legislation to appoint another permanent judge.  A good deal has been said against the appointment of temporary judges, but I would point out that some of those arguments were mutually destructive. While I say that I am no lover of temporary judges, at the same time I must say that I think the arguments put forward were not quite fair.  In the first place, it has been said that a temporary judge would lose his position at the Bar.  I do not think that that would be so to any great extent.  If a judge is doing temporary work for a month or two I do not think that he would injure his position at the Bar very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I completely grant you that if someone leaves the Bar for a year or two he would have to begin his whole work at the Bar again when he returned, as he would be out of touch with all the offices with which he was previously in touch.  I do not think that that will happen in the case of a judge who is appointed only for a short period as a temporary judge during the illness of a judge or for some other cause.  I do not think that those short periods would materially interfere with the Circuit Judge.  Deputy O'Kelly asked why we would not get the Chairman of the Committee from the Bar.  To appoint him as Chairman of the Commission would take him away from his work at the Bar just as would appointing him Circuit Judge.  To put it bluntly, if you say that he is going to be corrupt and in favour of the Government because he is hearing cases as a judge, could not that argument be pressed further?  It might be said that because he is Chairman of a <Col N="1957" /> Commission, giving his time voluntarily, &ldquo;Oh, he was influenced because he wants a job from the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could not the argument which Deputy O'Kelly put forward in the first instance be used much more strongly in the other case?  I have great belief in the honour of the men in my profession.  As a body of men the Irish Bar, in my opinion, contains men of as great personal honour and as of high principle as any other profession in the world. I personally think, whether permanently or temporarily appointed, that the men who are appointed from the Irish Bar to do work for this State will always be found to be men of honour, doing their work as work should be done.  It was suggested that this measure should be allowed to stand over until after the findings of the Committee dealing with the operations of the Courts of Justice Act.  There would be a good deal to be said in favour of that if it were not a question of urgent pressing importance.  If the Bill gets a Second Reading I propose to ask the House to take the Committee Stage to-morrow and to pass the Bill, which really involves no new principle, although Deputy Redmond said it did, because the principle of having a substitute Circuit Judge is not new, as it is in the Courts of Justice Act.  You are not establishing a new principle by extending it only to such cases where a judge is taken away from urgent public business.  That is not establishing a new principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">

      <P>No, he is unable to do his work.  It seems to me exactly the same principle.  You fill the place which is vacant owing to the temporary incapacity of the judge to act.  If this Bill gets a Second Reading, I purpose to take the Committee Stage to-morrow.  As far as the new Committee which has been set up is concerned, it, of course, can explore this Bill as it explores every other aspect before bringing in any suggestions.  If this Bill is inconsistent with its findings, and if these findings are embodied, as I suppose the bulk, at any rate, of its findings will be embodied, in legislation, whatever substitute the Committee may find for this Bill will then come into force.  If the Committee come to the conclusion that there is any other way in which you can fill up temporary gaps except by temporary appointments, that can be embodied subsequently in legislation, but I think it is unfair to litigants that they should not have judges at the present moment to hear their cases.  I have explained to the House that a very unusual situation has arisen, and I would ask the House to pass the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that that is something on the road, and that it does away with part of my objection.  My principal objection to the Bill is that it is a permanent measure to create temporary judges.  The Minister has gone so far as to say that he is prepared to bring in an amendment limiting the operation of the measure to two years, but I ask if the matter is one of extreme <Col N="1959" /> urgency, as he states, would it not be sufficient to have this measure for one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I would like to have the measure in existence until such time as the recommendations of the Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad are embodied in legislation. I do not want this Bill put on the Expiring Laws Continuance Act because the other legislation is not finished.  Certain aspects of the Courts of Justice Act may be reviewed by the Committee.  I do not suggest that they will find any other expedient for filling up temporary gaps except through permanent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two hundred other expedients to be found in the Law Library.  Apart from that, the Minister has met me to a certain distance and he has given an undertaking, I understand, <Col N="1960" /> that he will limit this measure to two years.  I am prepared to accept that undertaking on the part of the Minister.  My real objection to the Bill is that it gives a permanent right to create temporary judges.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2.</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 37 to 40 inclusive, to delete Section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a typographical error on the Order Paper in connection with this amendment.  It should read, &ldquo;lines 33 to 36.&rdquo;  In Section 112 of the original Act dwelling-houses were expressly excluded with regard to examination by an inspector. I do not know for what reason it was sought to bring the ordinary private dwelling-house under the same category as a workshop or business premises.  There are various objections to an inspector of the Department coming to a private dwelling-house and demanding to see a domestic servant or other person and to examine her privately.  I do not want to go into details.  The Minister did not refer to this particular amending section in the original introduction, but I certainly feel that there is great objection to an inspector having the right to go to a private dwelling-house at any time that suits him, to interview a domestic servant or any other person working in the house to the exclusion of the lady who runs the house.  He has that right under this amending section.  If the inspector can take that person into any room he likes and discuss with her matters which concern the Act, if you like, I think it is very unwise to extend that power which was not given when the original Act was going through.  It was objected to on the grounds that I am putting, that it is most undesirable to give an inspector the power to enter a private dwelling-house and go through the form of examination which he is empowered to do under Section 112. Section 112 (c) states that this inspector is entitled &ldquo;to examine, either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit, with respect to any matters under this Act, every person whom he finds in any such premises or place, or whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be, or to have been, an employed contributor or workman in an insured trade, and to require every such person to be examined, and to <Col N="1964" /> sign a declaration of the truth of the matters in respect of which he is so examined.&rdquo;  I have no objection to the inspector making such an examination in a private house provided he has not the right to go into the house and say to anybody in it &mdash;it may be a visitor&mdash;that he wants to examine that person privately and bring that person into an adjoining room, and go through a kind of &ldquo;Third Degree.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Minister would consider either withdrawing the section or altering it in the case of a private house, by deleting the words where it specifies that he may examine the person alone.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that under the present Act an inspector may walk into a workshop and say to a particular person he wants to examine him alone, take him into a room and put him through, what the Deputy calls, a &ldquo;Third Degree&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He has the right under the Act if he wants to.  I understand that it is not the purpose underlying this section that the inspector should use that power in a &ldquo;Third Degree&rdquo; measure.  It is quite clear that there may be a person employed to whom the employer might have said that he was not going to insure him&mdash;that if he insisted on being insured he would have to get rid of him.  I admit there is that danger, particularly in a private residence.  Nevertheless, I say that the privacy of a private residence should not be invaded with so little cause, because of that danger which may be expected in a private house.  I do not want to remove the section altogether, if the Minister would put in some phraseology which would give the owner of the house some right in his house in connection with such visits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy does not suggest that there is anything objectionable in the powers given to inspectors with regard to workshops and places like that under the original Act.  The only power given is a power to approach the employer and require that he will <Col N="1965" /> give certain information, and if the information is not forthcoming, that the employer is guilty of an offence &mdash;power with the consent of the employer to see workmen on his premises and question them with regard to their insurance or otherwise under the Act.  What the Deputy asks is to take out this, and the taking out of it would mean that he would refuse to grant power to national health inspectors to approach private persons as to the extent to which they are carrying out their duties under the Act in respect of their domestic employees&mdash;power to see the domestic employees of a private person and question them.  When the Deputy talks about taking them into a room in a house and putting them through the &ldquo;Third Degree,&rdquo; etc., he is not approaching the matter in a commonsense way.</P>
      <P>He has not taken into consideration the way in which the section is administered in respect of workshops. He has not taken into consideration that if the inspector abuses his powers in any way he will be open to complaint.  The only thing implied in Section 16 is that in order to overcome non-compliance and the financial loss to the insurance system and the unfairness to other insured persons, we are taking powers to approach, and to require all persons who run private dwelling houses and keep domestic servants to get such information from them as will enable us to know whether they are complying with the Act or not.  We think that is a very fair and reasonable power to seek.  We ought to be left with all the fair and reasonable powers that will enable us to overcome noncompliance.</P>

    <P>The Deputy takes exception to that because the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is not &ldquo;and.&rdquo;  Then he takes exception to a situation in which a person might go into a workshop and see a person being shown through the workshop by the manager, or looking round the workshop.  The Deputy claims that there is power under that section for the inspector to take up such a person and examine him. That is stretching the common sense of the section altogether.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to a workshop, but I am referring to a private house.  I say that under that sub-section the inspector has power to examine alone any person found in the house without requiring the permission of the owner.  The section specifies reasonable hours.  What are reasonable hours so far as a house is concerned?  He can interview a servant in the house with or without the permission of the owner of the house or the person running the house, and he can speak to that person privately whenever he likes and examine him.  I object to the words by which he can examine them alone.  I would have no objection to the section if the word &ldquo;alone&rdquo; were taken out in the case of a private house.</P>

      <P>Under the section, if a National Health Insurance officer wanted to get into the private part of a workshop and the manager refused him, I doubt if, without going to the courts, he could make a forcible entry.  As far as I understand it, if a National Health inspector went to a private house, and if he was told he could not see the owner or was refused permission to see the owner, what he would do would be he would take proceedings, because he had these powers and was refused the right to exercise these powers.  It does not say that he would force the door or that he would get in through the window.  The whole thing is governed by the introductory part of the clause, which says that for the purpose of the execution of this Act the inspector shall have the power to do things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 47, to add at the end of Section 22 (1) the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;but every insured person duly recommended by an approved society for sanatorium treatment and which recommendation has been approved by the medical officer of health for the county or county borough or by the tuberculosis medical officer of said county or county borough shall be entitled to receive from the council of the county or county borough of which the insured person is an inhabitant or from an authorised committee therof, such sanatorium treatment for tuberculosis as the insured person would <Col N="1968" /> have been entitled to receive if recommended therefor by an insurance committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is practically in the exact terms of one that was down already on a former stage of the Bill.  Its intention is to endeavour to secure, as far as we can, that the insured persons by reason of the passing of this Bill will not lose any of the rights that were secured to them so far as sanatorium treatment is concerned.  The Minister has drafted another amendment which goes some way towards meeting the demands of those anxious to secure for the insured persons their full rights, but as drafted I take it that his amendment does not give to the insured persons all that we wish to secure for them.  The Minister's amendment states: &ldquo;So long as the total cost of institutional treatment afforded by them in any year to such persons in such year does not exceed three-fifths of the sum distributed in such year as aforesaid, treatment for tuberculosis shall in any year in which the total cost afforded does not at any time exceed the limit hereinbefore specified be entitled to receive such treatment free of charge.&rdquo;  If my construing of that phrase is correct, it appears to me that only in so far as three-fifths of the money concerned, that is, the £27,000 that will be given to the local authority, will the insured persons be guaranteed their sanatorium treatment.</P>
    <P>That is the way I read it; if that be correct it does not meet what those of us who are anxious to secure free institutional sanatorium treatment for insured persons, wished to get in putting down a former amendment, and what we had in mind when putting down this amendment.  I would like to hear the Minister on that.  If that interpretation of his amendment is correct I will be obliged to press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that I stated that in a large number of counties&mdash;as a matter of fact, in 22 out of 27&mdash;agreements have been come to between the Insurance <Col N="1969" /> Committee for the county and the county council by which the funds at the disposal of the Insurance Committee are handed over in a lump sum annually to the county council, and the county council apply these sums under their tuberculosis scheme to the treatment&mdash;I say treatment as distinct from institutional treatment&mdash;of insured persons.  There is a regular form of agreement that in each of the 22 cases I have referred to is being entered into.  I want to read for the information of the Deputy one or two sections of this agreement.  It is a standard agreement.  Section 5 states: &ldquo;Out of the amount credited to the Committee, for the purpose of sanatorium benefit in pursuance of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1926, or any Order or Regulation made thereunder, the Committee shall pay to the council a sum calculated at the rate of 1/2 per annum out of every 1/3 so credited to them by the Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, there has been paid to the council 1/3 instead of 1/2, so we are dealing with the payment from the Committee to the county council of 1/3 per insured member.  &ldquo; The Committee shall also pay to the council out of each 1/3 in addition to the 1/2 such portion of the remaining penny (hereinafter called the ` reserved penny ') as shall be found on the audit of the Committee's accounts not to have been required to meet the Committee's expenditure on the administration of such sanatorium benefit.&rdquo;  That is, 1/3 per insured member has been available out of each sum of 1/2. &ldquo; Out of each sum of 1/2 &rdquo;&mdash;that is now 1/3&mdash;&ldquo;so payable to the council the sum of 8d.&rdquo;&mdash;now under the circumstances the sum of 9d.&mdash;&ldquo; together with any portion of the reserved penny payable to the council&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, now the sum of 9d.&mdash;&ldquo;shall be allotted towards the cost of treatment of eligible persons in sanatoria or hospitals provided in pursuance of clause (2) (d) out of the 6d. remaining in respect of each sum of 1/2 so credited a sum equivalent to one-fifth of the salary and travelling expenses of the tuberculosis <Col N="1970" /> officer shall be paid in respect of his services and of the tuberculosis dispensary system.  Any sum remaining shall be available for the provision of treatment otherwise than in a sanatorium or other institution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that out of every 1/3 per insured member handed over from the Committee in any one of these 22 counties, 9d. or 3/5ths was made available for sanatorium treatment, and the remaining 2/5ths was allowed to cover the services of doctor, the dispensary system and for any other kind of, say, domiciliary treatment.  The amendment I propose here in sub-section (2) secures that all the money handed over is to be used for the treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis, and that the 3/5ths which the standard scheme arranged would be reserved for sanatoria treatment would continue to be reserved, but that the other 2/5ths would continue, as in the past, to be available for domiciliary and dispensary treatment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 22 (4), to delete all words from the words &ldquo; and who is not,&rdquo; line 57, to the end of sub-section (4) and substitute the words &ldquo; shall be entitled, in the case of an official who has less than ten completed years of service with such committee, to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-eighth of the amount of his annual remuneration on the 31st day of December, 1929, for every completed year of his service, and in the case of an official who has ten or more completed years of service with such committee, to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of the amount of his annual remuneration on the 31st day of December, 1929, for every completed year of his service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to replace the amendment that Deputy Davin carried in the Committee Stage.  As I explained on the Committee Stage, I was prepared under the particular section there, which I showed gave me power to apply to the officials of these committees who are part-time, non-pensionable persons, explicitly subject to a three months' term of notice on dispensation of services, the terms applied to the officials of school attendance committees, persons that to my mind were most closely analogous <Col N="1972" /> to them, but in certain circumstances I wanted to have power left to me to grade up the amount of one-tenth where funds allowed.  I propose in this amendment to take powers that in the case of an official of an insurance committee who has less than 10 years' service he be given a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-eighth of the amount of his annual remuneration at the end of the first year, or in the case of an official who had 10 or more years of service the payment of a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of an official with 15 years' service and an official with 8 years' service.  What in effect that means is that an official with 8 years' service will receive under my proposal in respect of every £100 of his present annual emoluments a gratuity of £100.  An officer with 15 years' service will receive a gratuity at the rate of £250 for each £100 of his present salary and emoluments.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised that these officials are part-time, that to a large extent they are very much part-time, and that in twenty-two counties out of twenty-seven the whole of their funds are transferred to the county council and they instruct the county council who has administration of them.  Their other duties are very small.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Act of 1929 contains provisions for the paying of pensions to persons who are full-time pensionable employees of local bodies.  In the case of a full-time pensionable employee of a local body who has eight years' service and who is being dispensed with because of the abolition of office, he would receive a gratuity of £133? per £100 of his annual full emoluments. So if we compare the officials of one of these insurance committees with a full-time pensionable official of a local authority, each of them having eight years' service, and each of them having his office abolished, the comparison is per £100 of emoluments annually, £100 to the officials of insurance committees and £133? to the full-time pensionable officials of a local body.  The full-time <Col N="1973" /> pensionable employee of a local body who has fifteen years' service would be given a pension, but the amount of his pension would be £36? per year for every £100 of his emoluments.  We are proposing a gratuity of £250 per £100 of emoluments. If we take a civil servant who has eight years' service he would be going out with less.  He would only get a gratuity of £93? per £100.  A civil servant of fifteen years' service would only get a pension of £18 15s. in respect of every £100 salary and a gratuity of £50.  I submit that I have met the wishes of the House rather considerably in making the proposal that is contained in this amendment, and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>

The proposed gratuities <Col N="1974" /> in these cases are, in the first case, £364, in the second case, £341 5s. and in the third case, £227 10s.

      <P>Before the words &ldquo;shall be entitled &rdquo; to insert &ldquo; and whose income from other employment does not exceed £200 per annum.</P>
      <P>Our idea is that those who have been acting as secretaries or officials of these insurance committees have other sources of income.  In many cases their insurance work has been only a proportion of their work, in some cases a very small proportion. In a number of cases&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;this work was done by officials having adequate salaries from public funds.  Where persons are already in receipt of adequate salaries&mdash;and when I say adequate I mean a living wage, and a good living wage&mdash;we do not think, in the present state of the State's finances, it right or proper that such people should get compensation for loss of these offices.  These offices, as I say, in such cases as these, are a relatively small part of their work, and the salaries they receive for such work are a small part of their income. They are well able to live. They have employment and incomes as well as this, and we think it would not be fair to the State's purse that compensation such as is suggested by the Minister should be paid.  We propose then to limit the payment of compensation to those who have an income from other sources of less than £200 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have bowed to the wishes of <Col N="1975" /> the House on the last occasion in regard to Section 22 as it now stands, supported by the Schedule.  I want to point out to the House, of course, that it is not necessary to do that in the case of Deputy O'Kelly.  Deputy O'Kelly and his party voted, without the slightest pressure of any kind from us, in favour of the section and Schedule as now inserted in the Bill.  Whatever one can say about the Minister coming to the House, feeling, I suppose, to a certain extent, the effect of the fright he got in the Committee Stage, and attempting to modify the section in the way he has now proposed, I am absolutely flabbergasted that Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly, who is recognised as a shadow Minister, should cooperate with the Minister in making the Minister's own amendment worse than what it was proposed to be.</P>
      <P>I say deliberately that the words proposed to be inserted by Deputy O'Kelly make the section, as modified by the Minister, worse than it otherwise would be.  Deputy O'Kelly talks about people who have other means of making a living and who have had other jobs in addition to the job they will lose as a result of the passing of this Bill. I quite agree.  If we are going to give compensation for loss of office, let it be compensation for loss of office, whether whole or part-time. The compensation will be based on the salary given for whole or part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly limits the compensation to those who will have an income of £200 a year or less from other employment.  Does the Deputy realise that it is possible for an individual to have a military pension of £350 and yet he can get compensation under this very amendment? Does he also realise it is possible for a certain official who will receive compensation under the Act to have an income from two shops which may bring in anything from £15 to £20 a week?  Does he realise that an official who may get compensation may have an income <Col N="1976" /> from a farm, and this income will be added to the amount of compensation that he will get under the terms of the Minister's and the Deputy's amendment?  Income from other employment would not mean a pension and income from a farm and income from two shops, whether it be £10, £15, or £20 a week, cannot be proved to be income from other employment.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Kelly was well posted in this matter before he put down the amendment.  If he knew the facts, I doubt if he would continue to insist on the insertion of the words mentioned in amendment 16.  The whole issue is nothing more or less than the giving of compensation for loss of office, the compensation to be based on the whole or part-time salary.  Why insert the words that Deputy O'Kelly proposes and that the Minister accepts?</P>

Does he realise that the Minister's modified compensation clause, if it passes, will not impose any taxation at all?  As I understand it, the whole of the amount payable under the proposed amendment will come out of surplus funds.  A good deal less, and perhaps none at all, will come for those who deserve it if Deputy O'Kelly's words are inserted. I am going to stand over the wording of Section 22 as adopted by the House in Committee.  I am flabbergasted at the attitude of Deputy O'Kelly and his Party who voted for Section 22 and who have now changed their minds and are attempting to make the position worse than even the Minister has tried to make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appeared to be against the amendment because it did not go far enough or did not exclude enough.  He said that the passing of the amendment would hit people who did not deserve to be hit. The amendment proposes that compensation for loss of office, in consequence of the passing of this Bill, should not be given to persons in receipt of an allowance or an emolument of £200 a year from other employment. The persons who most deserve to be compensated are those who have smaller annual emoluments than £200.  Persons with a larger income than that require and deserve less compensation.  It will have to come from insurance funds, because insurance funds will, until they are disposed of, remain the property of insured persons.  The surplus that will remain in the funds after compensation has been paid will go back into a joint insurance fund, because these funds are being wound up in consequence of the termination of the insurance committees. These moneys, until they are expended, are the property of the insured persons.  The moneys, if not expended, will remain in insurance funds for the benefit of the insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>The point at issue is not whether we should on principle compensate people whose offices are dispensed with in consequence of the passage of an Act of Parliament irrespective of whether they want compensation, but whether in the particular circumstances now existing we should commit ourselves to compensate officials for part-time employment when they are in receipt of salaries from public funds in excess of £200 a year.</P>

We do not think so.  We think that those who have a salary from other employment of less than £200 should be compensated.  Those with a salary in excess of that figure can well afford to maintain themselves without putting this additional charge on insurance funds.</P>

      <P>From what Deputy O'Kelly has said, the House would be led to believe that this amendment proposes that one whose <Col N="1979" /> income from public service does not exceed £200 would be debarred, whereas the amendment as it stands reads: &ldquo; whose income from other employment.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo; from other employment &rdquo; are very wide. I desire to say that it struck me that the principle of this amendment is most peculiar, that where it is proposed to give compensation presumably for the loss of office, inquiries are to be made into the private income of the person to whom compensation is to be given. I never heard of such a proposal, and such a proposal, to my mind, was never inserted in an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>No.  The position is that the Minister actually moved amendment No. 4.  If amendment 4 were passed it would have the effect, consequentially, of removing the Third Schedule.  Deputy O'Kelly has on the Order Paper amendment No. 16, which in fact is an amendment of the Third Schedule.  The only way in which amendment 16, standing in the name of Deputy O'Kelly, could be discussed would be by moving it as an amendment to the Minister's amendment No. 4.  The Minister moved amendment No. 4, and Deputy O'Kelly moved amendment No. 16 as an amendment to the amendment. The amendment moved by Deputy O'Kelly to the Minister's amendment is now before the House.</P>

      <P>I oppose amendment No. 16, in the name of <Col N="1980" /> Deputy O'Kelly, because you will have to consider whether a person had private income from investments. Not only that, but you might have to go and see whether he lived in a good, well-furnished house or whether he lived in a house that did not indicate the same degree of wealth.  I do not think it is feasible to entertain an idea like that at all, and I am opposed to it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16&mdash;In page 13, line 13, Third Schedule, Rule 2, to insert after the word &ldquo; Committee&rdquo; the following words: &ldquo; whose income from other employment does not exceed £200 (two hundred pounds sterling) per annum &rdquo;&mdash;put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he would consider any case of officials who have over 15 years' service&mdash;would the Minister consider in such cases going a little further?  At least I think it would meet all concerned if he would agree to add the abolition year as set out in the Third Schedule, if he has fifteen or more completed years of actual service, with seven years to be added thereto.  I do not think that would apply to many people.  Somebody showed me a list of persons affected. I think there were only twelve or thirteen people, or perhaps one or two less.  That is my recollection of the number affected.  It would not affect the funds very materially while it would be a very substantial benefit to those concerned.  I think if the Minister would go that far in meeting Deputy Davin and others interested he would probably satisfy all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I have gone very carefully into this matter, and, in spite of everything that was said at the Committee Stage, very sympathetically into this whole matter. The utmost I say that we can do is what we have put down in amendment No. 4.  Those persons who have fifteen years are getting one-sixth instead of one-eighth.  I would not be prepared to go any further into the matter to meet <Col N="1981" /> them, considering all the circumstances of their work.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to have worked out very carefully the figures which he read out to Deputy Sir James Craig as to the cost of paying compensation under his own proposed amendment.  I wonder could the Minister give the House the cost of the payment of compensation covering the section in the Schedule as it now stands?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very big principle involved in this.  As I argued with Deputies, the class of official, the people we are dealing with at the present moment are almost analogous to the class of official that has been dealt with under the School Attendance Act where the persons, whatever their years of service, got one-tenth of a gratuity based upon one-tenth of the annual salary and emoluments.  We have been advanced by certain present circumstances which I would wish to have avoided under which we offer a gratuity based on one-eighth and in other cases on one-sixth.  A principle is involved.  Next year we are going to be dealing with the principle of the amalgamation of a number of approved societies.  You are going to have redundant officials in a very large number of cases.  You bring about very great economies of staff.  I do not want to open a situation here in respect of part-time unpensionable officials with three months' notice of service, doing a very small amount of work.  I do not want to open the principle of giving added years like that and to bring about a situation which, as Deputy Sir James Craig says, would be more than generous.  These are not his words, but it would be more than generous on the facts of the case.  It <Col N="1982" /> would be argued that the officials of approved societies are full-time officials as compared with these officials.  I do not know where the extension of the principle of added years in the case of these officials might lead us when we came to deal with the amalgamation of insurance societies.</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinary position for the Minister to adopt.  He talks about principle, though the House gave expression to the principle already which it desired to be adopted when considering this question of superannuation.  I think the Minister should have given some consideration that way and when he came to this House with an amendment I think he ought to be able by quoting corresponding figures under each arrangement to show that the compensation which he proposes to give will be in fact less than under the amendment adopted by the House.  He referred to the statement of Deputy Sir James Craig but Deputy Sir James Craig was astonished at the amount of compensation which these officials were going to get under the Minister's proposal.  I think that before asking the House to accept his amendment the Minister should be able to produce figures and calculations showing that his amendment is, as a matter of fact, going to be of greater benefit to the State and to the insured persons than that which has been adopted by the House.  If a question of principle is involved, the major principle is that the Minister should meet the declared wishes and intentions of the House in regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that what is proposed is that, as well as giving one-sixth for each particular year of service, years <Col N="1983" /> would be added on and it is the question of the number of those added years that is being discussed.  It is an arithmetical sum.  If you add on a number of years to the number of years that a person has served you are going to spend more money.  In all these matters of compensation for loss of office you have to take in a certain scheme.  I have compared the scheme under which we are proposing <Col N="1984" /> to grant gratuities in this case with the scheme under which full-time pensionable employees of local bodies are dealt with and I have shown that, in the circumstances, we are dealing with the employees of insurance committees in a fair and reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy can say that I said the Committee was not functioning in Westmeath.  The facts are that the Westmeath Committee has approximately £446 to administer, that it hands over £446 to the county council, and that the county council administers that for them and expends it on the persons whom the Westmeath Committee nominate to the county council for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get away if possible from the atmosphere engendered in this debate by the silly, inconsequent, and demonstrably ignorant speech of the Minister for Agriculture who, I am sorry, is not here.  I should like to do that for two reasons.  First, because no one with any sense of responsibility or any feelings of public decency desires to have an issue so important as is raised in this Bill decided by the tactics of the virago or the weapons of Billingsgate.  And secondly because this issue is one upon which, no matter how they may be divided upon other issues, those who desire to see clean government in this country or, if you like, to maintain clean government in this country, may co-operate with each other in resisting any proposal which may render these objects less easy to secure.  In speaking to this Bill also, I would like to deprecate the frequent reference which has been made to the Public Accounts Committee. That Committee renders <Col N="1991" /> most valuable service to the whole community.  It is able to do that solely because of the fact that it is an impartial Committee representing the general body of the Dáil and rendering decisions regardless of Party affiliations and Party advantages. The whole usefulness of the Committee and its capacity for service would be utterly destroyed if its proceedings were to become the shuttlecock of Party discussions in this House.  I desire, therefore, if I can, to refrain from any specific reference to the proceedings of our own Public Accounts Committee and to base my arguments against this Bill on the principle of financial administration and practice which long experience has established elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This Bill, I should like to repeat, strikes at the very roots of good government and sound financial administration in this country.  It violates an important constitutional principle&mdash;the principle that the Dáil has complete control over public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that the manner in which this violation will be made may be clear to this House, I should like to re-state how the control of the Dáil over public expenditure is made effective.  The Dáil enforces its control over public expenditure first, by examining and sanctioning every head of that expenditure.  It completes that control by learning from its own officer&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General, against whose powers this Bill is deliberately aimed &mdash;after the close of each year, whether the limits which it has imposed had been obeyed and whether, generally, the financial administration of the public service has been orderly and sound.  If the directions of the Dáil and its intentions as expressed in the several statutes or orders thereunder, and in the voted Estimates have not been observed, or if the expenditure has exceeded the amounts granted, the Dáil learns of this fact from the Comptroller and Auditor-General and, through its own Committee of Public Accounts, <Col N="1992" /> judges the infraction of the law and regulations thus brought to its notice.</P>
    <P>Now, if there is one service which requires constant supervision it is the disbursement of public moneys. The history of other countries and the history of our own emphasise how easily that service may be abused and how grave the public evils which follow upon such abuse. To prevent that abuse and to escape those evils, the most constant vigilance must be exercised by the officer appointed to safeguard the public integrity.  In other countries such an officer has been appointed by ordinary statute, but in this State the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is commanded by the very Constitution itself.  By this fact, it is clearly indicated that the functions of this office are of no less importance and are no less indispensable to the well-being of the State and the whole community than are the functions of the legislature, the Executive or the judiciary.  Like these, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is set in a class apart, with powers, duties and responsibilities not to be circumscribed nor limited except for the gravest reasons.  In fact, in Great Britain, as long ago as 1876, after a prolonged and careful discussion extending over a period of years the following principles were authoritatively laid down for the guidance of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Great Britain in the discharge of his duties.  &ldquo;You should,&rdquo; it was stated in a formal communication to him from the Treasury, &ldquo;if you think fit examine the Vote, sub-head of a Vote, or head of a sub-head, as often as you please. In short, your discretion in the conduct of your examination should be absolutely unfettered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution and the Acts relating to his office subsequently enacted or adopted by the Oireachtas, the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were in no way curtailed, nor was the general principle which was to govern him in discharge of his duties, and which I have just quoted, qualified <Col N="1993" /> or limited in any way whatsoever. For instance, Article 62 of the Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again under the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Act (No. 1 of the year 1923) it is laid down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to control all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas at such time and in such manner as shall from time to time be prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Section 7 (3) of that Act it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless and until it shall be otherwise provided by the Oireachtas the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have and exercise all such powers and perform all such duties as are prescribed by this Act or are conferred or imposed on him by any Act of the Parliament of the late United Kingdom having the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and adapted to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann by or under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, and particularly by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now so much importance did those who framed the Constitution and those who drafted the Constitution Act and the Adaptation of Enactments Act attach to the functions and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that actually after the section of the Adaptation of Enactments Act which established the Central Fund, the following section is inserted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every mention of or reference <Col N="1994" /> to the Exchequer or the Comptroller and Auditor-General contained in any British Statute shall in respect of the doing or not doing of any act, matter or thing after the 6th day of December, 1922, in Saorstát Eireann under or in pursuance of such Statute be respectively construed and take effect where the context so admits or requires as a mention of or reference to the Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann or to the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Saorstát Eireann as the case may require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, under the law the office of Comptroller and Auditor-General here was established with exactly the same rights, power, privileges and responsibility as up to the year 1922 appertained to that office in Great Britain.  Under the law, therefore and from the nature of the Constitution the Comptroller and Auditor-General has control over all disbursements&mdash;there is no exception made of disbursements under the Military Service Pensions Act&mdash;and is required to examine every appropriation account on behalf of the Dáil.  There is no reservation that the appropriation account relating to military service pensions is to be exempt from the Comptroller and Auditor-General and not to be examined in the same way as he is entitled to examine other appropriation accounts.  And in the conduct of such examination the principles laid down by the report of the Public Accounts Committee, 1876, are definitely adopted, and in the conduct of such examination therfore, as we have seen, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to be absolutely unfettered.  I have shown how the Dáil exercises and makes effective the constitutional principle that it controls all public expenditure of the State.</P>
    <P>It may be asked what are the practical results which have followed from the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Unfortunately our own control over our own financial affairs has been too brief to enable me to cite any instance from our own records which <Col N="1995" /> here have stood the test of time.  We have always had a Comptroller and Auditor-General here.  The State has always reaped the advantages of such an appointment, but in Great Britain where the principle that the House of Commons has sole control over supplies has been admitted for centuries, and where the operation of that principle had not been given proper effect until 1866 when, by the Exchequer and Audit Act, the Comptroller and Auditor-General was appointed, not as an officer of the Crown or even of the Parliament, but as an officer of the House of Commons, to supervise the disbursement of all public moneys in Great Britain, from that country we are able to cite opinions and to cite, if you like, considered judgments setting forth the beneficial results which have followed from the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>In the report for the year 1876 the Public Accounts Committee printed a memorandum from the Treasury in which the benefits which had followed the establishment of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were set forth in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Lord of the Treasury, indeed, believes that even many of those who have studied such matters are hardly aware of the revolution in the public accounts that has taken place under the Exchequer and Audit Act, through the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General addressed to the House of Commons.  These reports are submitted to the judgment of the Public Accounts Committee, and each irregularity, which in former days would have been judged and buried within the walls of a Department, is examined and reported on.&rdquo;&ldquo;Judged and buried within the walls of a Department,&rdquo; in exactly the same way as the Minister for Defence and others presenting this Bill to this House wish the findings and activities of this Board of Assessors to be judged and buried.  &ldquo;Judged and buried <Col N="1996" /> within the walls of a Department,&rdquo; where the skeletons would be always kept in the cupboard and never uncovered by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This great administrative reform has been gradually effected during the 10 years which have elapsed since the passing of the Exchequer and Audit Act.  The success of the measure may be tested by the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General ... as these reports testify to a regular and orderly administration of the public money.....  If exception be made of certain questions which have stood over from former years and which are approaching settlement, the irregularities are few.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Lords gratefully acknowledge the result as showing the efficacy of the independent audit administered by the Comptroller and Auditor-General....  If on the one hand the responsibility of Parliament for financial order through the Service has been rigidly enforced, on the other hand... my Lords have, with the co-operation of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, been enabled to exercise far more completely than previously the control entrusted to them by constitutional usage and essential to the maintenance of the financial order for which they are responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the House to the terms of the report. &ldquo;My Lords, indeed, believe that even many of those who have studied such matters are hardly aware of the revolution in the public accounts....  Each irregularity which in former days would have been judged and buried within the walls of a department is examined and reported on.  By &ldquo;this great administrative reform&rdquo;&mdash;the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General with the wide powers given him&mdash;&ldquo;my Lords have been enabled to exercise far more completely than previously the control entrusted to them by constitutional usage and essential to the maintenance of financial order.&rdquo; These words are not my words.  They <Col N="1997" /> express the balanced and considered judgment of those who are responsible for a system of public administration unchallenged and unsurpassed by that which exists in any other State.  This judgment has no partisan relation whatever to the matter now immediately under discussion. It was not expressed in relation to the awkward inquiry or request from the Comptroller and Auditor-General for certain files.  It was expressed after that office had been established for 10 years, and after those who expressed that opinion had 10 years experience of its working and, therefore, it may be unreservedly applied in the present instance to indicate what the position might have been in this State if the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General did not exist, and if the present occupant of that office had not endeavoured to fulfil his responsibility in accordance with the principles and practice so long established and accepted elsewhere.  In the course of the report to which I have referred it is stated that the duty is imposed on the Comptroller and Auditor-General of ascertaining that the accounts of all the moneys provided for the service of the year:</P>
    <P>(1)  Are supported by proper vouchers and are ordered by proper authority;</P>
    <P>(2)  Are accurately computed;</P>
    <P>(3)  Are applied to the purposes for which Parliament voted them;</P>
    <P>(4)  Are in accordance with the Statute;</P>
    <P>(5)  Are in accordance with the Treasury authority&mdash;in our case in accordance with the authority of the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>(6)  Are in accordance with the formal regulations of the Department.</P>
    <P>In exemplification of the purposes to be served by these inquiries, the Public Accounts Committee pointed out that in auditing the Military and Naval expenditure, the Comptroller and Auditor-General sees that a stated sum has been expended, and he receives the explanation <Col N="1998" /> of the Department that it has been expended on a certain object, and that this particular sum has been charged to the Vote in which such provision has been made, and to the proper sub-head of that Vote, as set forth in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>To avoid misunderstanding I would point out to the House that in the year 1876, when the accounts of the Army and Navy were being considered, the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my purpose. I will make the matter immediately relevant.  I was pointing out that in the case of the Military and Naval expenditure in Great Britain the Comptroller and Auditor-General up to 1876 was confined to saying that a stated sum had been expended on a certain object, and that this particular sum had been charged to the Vote in which such provision has been made, and to the proper sub-head of the Vote, as set forth in the Estimates, and with that the Comptroller and Auditor-General's inquiry will end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House will consider for a <Col N="1999" /> moment it will see that this is precisely what the present Bill proposes to do in regard to Military Service Pensions.  If it passes, the Comptroller and Auditor-General will know that a stated sum has been expended on this service.  He will then satisfy himself that the Dáil has provided money for that object, and that the amount so expended has been charged to the Vote in which such provision has been made, and to the proper sub-head of the Vote as set forth in the Estimates, and with that the Comptroller and Auditor-General's inquiry will end. This further quotation from the Report of the Public Accounts Committee of 1876 regarding the situation which is thus created will, therefore, be of particular interest to the House:&mdash;&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; the Report goes on to say, &ldquo;he accepts more or less the evidence of the departmental examining officers on heads 1 and 2, and upon certain of that evidence he certifies that the money has been expended upon the services for which Parliament voted it; but upon such an examination alone he can never be in a position to certify of his own knowledge to the last three heads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, that he can never be in a position to certify that the moneys have been expended in accordance with Statute, in accordance with Treasury authority or in accordance with the formal regulations of the Department, and therefore he is unable to discharge to the full the duties and responsibilities which have been imposed upon him in this State by the Constitution and by the law.</P>
    <P>In view of the arguments which have taken place in this House as to the powers and responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, I would like to point out that in Great Britain, to which we must go back for precedents and to which by the Act which appoints the Comptroller and Auditor-General we are entitled to refer, the wide powers which were given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, limited as to examination <Col N="2000" /> and investigation as they were simply by his own discretion, were not given without question. For instance, as I have said, it took just 10 years to establish the fact that he was bound to examine the expenditure of two of the great spending departments.  Similarly, year after year, the spending departments attempted on many occasions to confine the investigation of the Comptroller and Auditor-General within what they thought were the statutory limits.  I do not think there is a single case on record in which those efforts were upheld by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons.  Here I may point out that this Committee like our own was composed of representatives of all Parties, from the Government Party as well as the Opposition Party, and that in many cases it might have been thought that the incidents reported upon reflected more or less unfavourably upon the administration of the party in power.</P>
    <P>But in every case, so far as I have seen, the Committee acted regardless of such considerations, remembering only that the principles laid down and the practice defined when a Party was in power might be the greatest safeguard of that Party when it was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>One particular problem which came before the Committee was the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to examine confidential documents, upon which payments were based.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to deny in one particular instance to the Comptroller and Auditor-General access to such documents. In the course of his speech moving the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister for Finance stated: &ldquo;the applicants who came forward were promised that the evidence submitted by them would be kept secret.&rdquo;&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that was necessary and that it was proper that that matter should be confidential.&rdquo; The reference is Col. 1012, Vol. 32.  I will deal later with the question as to whether the submission of these documents when required <Col N="2001" /> to the Comptroller and Auditor-General could constitute a breach of any pledge which may have been given.  I will content myself by noting here that any such promise must be interpreted in the light of constitutional and statutory requirements, and that no promise of this kind could be held to override any responsibility imposed upon the Comptroller and Auditor-General by the law and Constitution.  Let us, however, consider the principles which have already been laid down in this matter, the powers to perform all such duties as are prescribed by this Act or are conferred or are imposed on him by any Act of Parliament of the late United Kingdom having the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and adapted to the Constitution by and under and on behalf of the Adaptation of Enactments Act of 1922.  Here was the regulation which was to govern the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the heads of all Departments in relation to confidential documents.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is admitted that no Department has a right to refuse information, even although of a highly confidential character, to the Comptroller and Auditor-General if he requires it to satisfy himself that the expenditure agrees with Parliamentary appropriation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General,&rdquo; it went on to state, &ldquo;is alone competent to say what information is necessary for the discharge of the statutory functions, and must exercise his discretion as to communicating to Parliament any information in his possession that is relevant to the Accounts upon which he is reporting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in the year 1881.</P>
    <P>In 1919 this question of confidential documents again arose, and in that connection the Public Accounts Committee for that year made the following report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with payments to a firm which were based on an examination by a Department Accountant of confidential documents, the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="2002" /> requested that his officers should be associated with those of the Department in that duty.  Your Committee are glad to learn that the Ministry concur in this course, as they regard it as of paramount importance that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have access to all documents substantiating payments out of public funds, so that he may satisfy himself as to the propriety of the payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One further point, I think, remains to be brought out in this connection. It has been said that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has exceeded his duties in asking for these files. I have shown that he is bound to ask for all documents, even the most confidential documents, in order to satisfy himself as to the propriety of certain payments which have been made.  In that connection, it has to be pointed out that, as the law stands at present, and as it stood in the year 1925, I think, when these documents were first asked, the Comptroller and Auditor-General was bound to ask for these documents. If he had not asked for these documents then he would not have discharged properly the duties of his office, and it would have been open to any Deputy in this House to move a resolution asking that he should be removed from office, on the grounds that he had not properly discharged the functions of it.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, as I have said, it was laid down that the Comptroller and Auditor-General holds office neither for life nor during the pleasure of the Crown, but during good behaviour&mdash;that is to say only during that period during which he fully and completely discharges the responsibility which has been laid upon him of ensuring that so far as possible the control of the Dáil over the expenditure of public moneys is effective and complete.  In the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act of 1923 it is stated that the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall retire upon his attaining the age of 70 years and shall not be removed from his office except upon <Col N="2003" /> identical resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann respectively and then only for misbehaviour or incapacity to be expressly stated in such resolutions.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this point, to summarise the principal facts relating to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in this State.</P>
    <P>First, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to ascertain whether money has been applied for the purposes for which Parliament granted it.</P>
    <P>2.  This is to be done by examining the accounts for the purpose of ascertaining whether the payments made are supported by proper vouchers and are ordered by proper authority;</P>
    <P>(3) are accurately computed;</P>
    <P>(4) are applied to the purposes for which Parliament voted the money;</P>
    <P>(5) are in accordance with Statute;</P>
    <P>(6) are in accordance with Treasury authority;</P>
    <P>(7) are in accordance with the formal regulations of the Department.</P>
    <P>So far as the first two requirements are concerned the Comptroller and Auditor-General may accept more or less the evidence of the Departmental examining officer; but it is laid down that upon such evidence alone he can never be in a position to certify of his own knowledge first that the moneys have been expended in accordance with statute; second, have been expended in accordance with the authority of the Department of Finance, and, third, have been expended in accordance with the formal regulations of the spending Department.</P>
    <P>It has further been laid down that in discharging his duties the Comptroller and Auditor-General, if he thinks fit, may examine the same Vote, sub-head of a Vote, or item of a sub-head, as often as he pleases. In short, his discretion and the conduct <Col N="2004" /> of his examination are to be absolutely unfettered.  Further, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is entitled to look to the accounting officers for the information he requires, and such officers must be at all times ready to afford such information to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter the Comptroller and Auditor-General is alone competent to say what information is necessary for the discharge of his statutory functions.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, not open to any Department, to anybody acting in any Department or anybody acting possibly under a statute of this Dáil, to refuse to the Comptroller and Auditor-General any document or any information as to the manner in which this money has been expended which he may think fit to require. The Comptroller and Auditor-General has, as I have said, in Great Britain, always exercised the functions of his office in accordance with the principles which I have stated. It is clear and manifest from the Acts which I have quoted, from the Constitution and from the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923, that it was intended that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should function here in this State in exactly the same way and in accordance with the same principle as the corresponding officer shall function and did function in Great Britain. That position was generally accepted until in February, 1926, the Board of Assessors challenged the right of access of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to their files and refused to submit to him the original application for Service pensions paid during the financial year ending 31st March, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have dealt, because I think the House has not been aware of the important Constitutional principle which is involved in this Bill, with the important position which the Comptroller and Auditor-General fulfils in the economy of the State.  I have dealt fairly fully with the <Col N="2005" /> position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to consider what is the object of this Bill. Possibly the full purport has not been set forth in the Title of the Bill. At any rate, the Minister for Finance left us in no doubt as to the object of the Bill.  According to him the object is to put the awards of military service pensions on the same basis vis-a-vis the Comptroller and Auditor-General as awards of the Court, so that, as the Minister says, if a pension is paid the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot examine the merits of such payment.</P>
    <P>What are the grounds for this extraordinary procedure?  The Minister apparently wishes to justify it on the grounds that some promise was made to those who applied for pensions that the evidence submitted by them would be kept secret.  I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not present.  Possibly, the Minister for Defence, when he rises, as I understand he is to rise, to conclude this debate, would tell the House where any record of such a promise exists.  Where was it made, by whom, and to whom?</P>
    <P>Where was it made, by whom and to whom?  Even if it were made, does the Minister for Defence hold that such a promise must override the Constitution and the Statute?</P>
    <P>I have shown that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, under the Constitution and by the statute, is entitled to have access to all documents, confidential or otherwise, if he thinks fit to require them in the course of his investigations.  I ask the Minister for Defence, who will defend this Bill to the House, to state here does he think that a promise given in secret and given privately is to override the Constitution? Apart from this altogether, as I have shown, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has a right to examine all documents substantiating payments out of the public funds, even documents of a highly confidential character.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> Since that principle was established before such a promise was made, the submission of such document to the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not constitute a breach of confidence, and any promise made to the applicants under the Military Service Pensions Act could not be held to prejudice, much less entirely to oust, the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have access to all documents for the purposes of his investigation. The Minister for Finance, in the further course of his speech, stated that it would be quite impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to come to any conclusion on the files.  Why?  Because, the Minister went on to state, the Board of Assessors were, in fact, a court.  They had to examine written evidence and hear oral evidence, apparently keeping no written transcript of the latter.</P>
    <P>I would like to make this clear, that this Board was not a court at all in the sense in which the Minister for Finance used the word.  The Board of Assessors did not sit in public. There were no representatives of the Press present at these hearings. There was no report of the proceedings or recommendations of this Board of Assessors in the Press, and, therefore, the safeguard of publicity, which is of the utmost importance in all judicial proceedings was wholly absent.  The findings of the Board of Assessors may have been wholly contrary to the evidence submitted to them.  I am not suggesting that they were, since I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but if they were wholly contrary to the evidence there is no information given to the public which would enable it to satisfy itself upon that head.  The public had no security whatever that this Board came to its findings in accordance with the evidence that had been put before it.</P>
    <P>The second point which the Minister apparently wished to make in this connection was that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not come to any conclusion merely on an examination of the files, because <Col N="2007" /> the Minister, apparently, thought that there was no record of oral evidence given to the Court. The Minister for Agriculture apparently was under the same misapprehension for he said: &ldquo;But of the considerations that arise here the certificates are the least important part.  Oral evidence which must be given on oath and given by persons who have been promised that their evidence was confidential is really the important evidence.&rdquo;  He went on to say later, &ldquo;Their applications which are governed by no rules of any kind must be decided on the merits of each case by oral evidence in which certificates of various parties are of no importance whatsoever.&rdquo; There is the position taken up by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Agriculture, that the most important element in the whole of this matter is not the certificate of service issued by the Board but that it is the oral evidence tendered to the Board.  The President, in reply to a question which I put to the Minister for Agriculture during his speech completely torpedoed all this spurious reasoning by admitting that a longhand note of all the evidence was taken.  Therefore, the file is as complete as it could possibly be.  This oral evidence, which must be given on oath and which the Minister for Agriculture contended was the really important evidence, is there, and is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General if this House, in the proper discharge of its duty, will reject this Bill and demand that such evidence be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General in accordance with the principle that all confidential documents are to be available to that officer if he requires them for his proper investigation.</P>
    <P>With the statement that a longhand note of the evidence was taken, what becomes of the arguments of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance wished the Comptroller and Auditor-General to accept only the certificates issued by the Board of Assessors, <Col N="2008" /> on the plea that no record of the oral evidence was available. The Minister for Finance wishes the Comptroller and Auditor-General to rely entirely on the certificate of the Board of Assessors. The Minister for Agriculture comes along and cuts the ground from under the feet of his colleague by stating that the certificates are the least important or, in fact, that they are of no importance whatsoever, and that the whole issue of whether these pensions are rightly or wrongly awarded must be decided on oral evidence.  As I have said, when the Ministers were talking, neither of them was aware that a longhand transcript of the oral evidence existed.  Then the President came along and in reply to a question which I put to the Minister for Agriculture exploded a bomb under their feet and blew their case sky-high by admitting that a longhand transcript of the evidence existed. Is it any wonder that while his argument was thus spinning in midair the Minister for Agriculture should have lost his temper and should have stated that the proposition that this transcript of evidence should be available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General in order that he should satisfy himself whether the awards of pensions were rightly or wrongly made was just the silly sort of proposal that he would expect from Deputy MacEntee?</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here, because, apparently, he has still something to learn about the process of justice in this State.  I know, of course, that on one notable occasion he admitted that his knowledge of the law was not worth a halfpenny.  At the same time, if he read the daily papers he might have had intelligence enough to gather for himself what actually was the procedure in certain courts in the land.  Apparently, the Minister for Agriculture is unaware that all cases submitted to the Appeal Court in the Free State are decided, not upon oral evidence freshly tendered to the court, but upon the <Col N="2009" /> transcript of the evidence tendered to the court below.  Apparently, the Minister for Agriculture is unaware of the fact that in criminal cases, involving the life or death of the subject, appeals from death sentences imposed in murder trials have been heard and decided entirely upon the transcript of such oral evidence.  The issue of life or death might be decided upon a written transcript, but not the issue, according to the Minister for Agriculture, as to whether a pension has been rightly or wrongly awarded, whether it has been awarded in accordance with the statute or whether it has been awarded in defraud of the State. The most important issue that can be tried in the courts of this land, the issue of whether a citizen is to live or die, can be decided upon a written transcript.  The mere paltry issue as to whether a pension may be paid or not is too important to be decided upon anything except the oral evidence, freshly tendered to the new investigator.  That is the position which this lawyer, who has already admitted that his knowledge of law is not worth a halfpenny, wishes this House to endorse, if it accepts his arguments and votes in favour of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Those who have spoken in support of the Bill have endeavoured to create the impression that the examination of the files by the Comptroller and Auditor-General must lead inevitably to the publication of the names of individuals and of occurrences in which those individuals were concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, for instance, said it would not be in the public interest to rake up details and the specific activities of individuals during that period.  Later, he went on to say: &ldquo;Do we not know that year after year that particular report, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, is made the subject of rather large headlines in the daily papers?&rdquo;  I regret very much that Deputy O'Higgins, who is himself a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and to whose impartial and zealous services thereon <Col N="2010" /> I can testify, should have made that statement which, unintentionally, no doubt, may mislead the House as to the procedure adopted by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in making his report.  First of all, when he has examined the files, if this House permits him by rejecting this Bill to examine these files, upon what cases will the Comptroller and Auditor-General report?  Upon those cases, and only those cases, in which, upon the face of the application made and the record of the evidence given before the Board of Assessors, it is plain and manifest that the intentions of the Dáil have not been carried out and that the requirements of the law have not been observed.  I do not know if there be such cases; neither does the Comptroller and Auditor-General know if there be such cases; neither does this House know if there be such cases; but if, upon examination of the files, he finds no such case as this, then the Comptroller and Auditor-General will make no report.  If upon that same examination he does find such cases, then that report will inevitably be made and this House will be made quite aware of the fact that some persons in this land, with the connivance or intended connivance of the Executive Council, are receiving moneys in defraud of the State. But, as I have already stated, and as I wish to repeat and emphasise, it will only be in those cases in which on the face of the documents and the evidence it is clear and manifest that awards have been wrongly made that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will report.</P>
    <P>Is it the contention of those who are backing this Bill that if such cases do exist&mdash;cases where pensions have either been procured or granted in defraud of the State&mdash; that such pensions should continue to be paid and the State should continue to be defrauded thereby? Is that the attitude which the Minister for Defence takes up?  Is that the attitude which the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance take up?  Is that the <Col N="2011" /> attitude which the Executive Council takes up?  Is that the attitude which those who will follow the Whips of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party into the Division Lobby upon this Bill will take up?  Is it their attitude that if pensions are at present being granted in defraud of the State, those pensions should continue to be wrongly paid?  It may be said that they are introducing this Bill because they have the fullest confidence in the Board of Assessors.  Have they not the same confidence in the permanent heads of every one of the other Departments? Have they not that confidence, for instance, in the permanent head of the Department of Justice, who has to account to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the expenditure of almost two million pounds of public money? Have they not that confidence in the permanent head of the Department of Finance?  Have they not that confidence in the permanent head of the Department of Defence? Have they not that confidence in the permanent head of the Land Commission? I take it they have.  I take it they have the fullest confidence in each and every one of these officers, and yet, for every penny piece of expenditure, these high, responsible and trusted officials have to account, and every document, confidential or otherwise, upon which such expenditure is based must be submitted without reserve and without question to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, should he see fit to call for it in the course of his inquiries.  If you so far trust the Board of Assessors as to render their proceedings exempt from investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, why not render all the other Departments which I have mentioned similarly exempt?  In short, why maintain an office which, upon your own showing, is redundant and unnecessary? Why not abolish altogether and save to the State the £17,000 odd which is spent thereon? Or, if you are not prepared to exempt from the supervision and <Col N="2012" /> control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General all the other Departments for which these highly-competent, highly-trustworthy and permanent civil servants are responsible, why exempt this Board of Assessors whose personnel was not permanent, who were not civil servants of the State but who, instead, were political partisans out, if they could, to do a good turn for their supporters?  Why exempt the Board of Assessors from this inquiry, while at the same time you enforce the inquiry in the case of those officers who are the most highly-trusted and the most competent in your service?</P>
    <P>I have stated that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will make no report except in cases in which it is clear and manifest awards of pensions have been wrongfully made.  In what manner will he report such cases?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and others stated that it would not be in the public interest to rake up details and specify the activities of individuals during that period.  I think that by that he wished the Dáil to understand that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in his report would mention individuals by name and give such information as would enable such individuals to be identified. Possibly the best way to deal with that argument is by illustration. I will turn to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on the Appropriation Accounts for the years 1924-1925.  These will illustrate to the Dáil not only the manner in which these reports are made, but the kind and type of case which is reported.  In Paragraph 58 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1924-5 the following statement is made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 4, sub-section (1) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, provides that the pension shall commence on the day on which the officer or soldier to whom the same was granted was discharged from the force.  On comparing the date (the Comptroller and Auditor-General went on to say) with the <Col N="2013" /> last date on which pay was issued I observed some discrepancy in a number of cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that the paragraph has been clearly heard.  What names are disclosed in that passage to harrow any person's feelings?  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the manner in which the feelings of certain persons might be harrowed by reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  What names are disclosed in that paragraph to harrow any person's feelings, to endanger any person's life, liberty or occupation, or to reflect upon any person's character?  So much for the manner of that particular report.  What was the consequence of it?  The consequence was disclosed by the Accounting Officer for Vote No. 56, the Vote on Army Pensions.  In his examination before the Committee he admitted that recovery was made in particular cases referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;that is to say, that these public moneys which had been wrongfully paid had been recouped to the State simply because the Comptroller and Auditor-General had access to the files and was able to say that these moneys had been wrongfully paid.  In the same paragraph to which I refer the Comptroller and Auditor-General also reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My examination of the awards of pensions to members of the Irish Volunteers showed that while a certificate stated that the claimants were wounded in the course of duty, in some instances the files&rdquo;&mdash;the files, mark you, which are now not to be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;&ldquo;disclosed that the injury was received while individuals were engaged in their private occupations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you ponder over these words you can understand why the Minister for Agriculture declared in this Dáil that the certificates were of no importance whatever.  The certificate in these cases, as reported by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, showed that the claimants were wounded in the course of duty, <Col N="2014" /> whereas the files&mdash;these precious documents which are to be locked away from the public gaze and withheld from the officer who, under the Constitution, is charged with the control of all public moneys expended on behalf of the State&mdash; showed that the injury was received while the individuals were engaged on their private occupations.  Again, what information relating to any particular individual is disclosed in that report that would bring odium on him or endanger in any way his present or future?  Remember, we were told if these files were once given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that the lives of men, possibly not living under the authority of this State, would be in danger, that their occupation would be in danger, and that they themselves, if allowed to live, would be made outcasts in their homes.  The same report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I also observe that some ex-members of the forces in receipt of wound pensions were accepted for service in the Gárda Síochána, and continued to draw wound pensions without any modification of pay or pension.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one last case.  The Report went on further to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In one instance an individual who offered himself for service as a Volunteer during the Rising in April, 1916, and who was apparently not accepted as such, was wounded by a sniper's bullet.  He received a pension on the certificate of the Adjutant-General that he was a member of the Irish Volunteers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the written report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in relation to this particular matter. In the course of his earlier evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts the Comptroller and Auditor-General stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is a case which the Audit Office felt bound to bring forward. The Adjutant-General thought fit to grant a certificate for pre-Truce service and in that way opens a door which may possibly lead to expense on the State later on.  The Audit Office in considering this matter had before it a letter from the Director of Intelligence which states that the man was not a member of the Volunteers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the further course of evidence the Comptroller and Auditor-General went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have definite information here that the man was not a member of the Volunteers.  By granting him a wound pension you also grant him a certificate that may entitle him to a service pension later on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be one of the service pensions awarded by the Board of Assessors.  The man had post-Truce service, a further reason, possibly, for believing that he is one of the pensioners involved in these cases. The man had post-Truce service, and by getting this certificate of the Adjutant-General that he had pre-Truce service he might be entitled to <Col N="2017" /> a service pension&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not say it, but I am going to say it&mdash;under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924. Think of it.  A man who, it was admitted, offered himself as a Volunteer and was not accepted, received a certificate from the Adjutant-General that he was, in fact, a Volunteer.  On the other hand, the Comptroller and Auditor-General receives a written communication from the Director of Intelligence stating that the man was not a Volunteer.  On the strength of the Adjutant-General's certificate the man was awarded a wounds pension, but, as the Comptroller and Auditor-General pointed out, the award of that wounds pension may have made that man eligible for a military service pension later on.</P>
    <P>We do not know, and never will know if the Bill goes through, but that this man who, according to the Director of Intelligence, was not a Volunteer in 1916, may have been awarded a pension amounting to&mdash; after 5 years' service, which he did not render&mdash;if he is a private, £50 a year.  If he is a second-lieutenant or captain, it may be £75 a year.  If he is a major or a commandant, it may be £100 a year.  If he is a major-general, as some of them were, it may be £125 a year&mdash;£125 paid out of the exchequer of the State to which that man is not entitled, and the facts are locked up in the files, which are not going to be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General if the Bill goes through.  Again, consider the cases I have cited.  In the first place, the Comptroller and Auditor-General reports that, in connection with the disbursement of Army pensions under the Act of 1923, he found that a number of pensions had been paid at an earlier date than that on which they were lawfully due.  As a result of that report, the sum of money wrongfully paid was repaid to the State.  In the second case, he reported that although wound pensions were only paid to Volunteers wounded in the course of duty, in some cases the files disclosed that the <Col N="2018" /> injury was received while the claimant was engaged in a private occupation.</P>
    <P>In the third case wound pensions had been paid to persons accepted for the Gárda Síochána, and they continued to draw the pensions without any modification of either pay or pension.  In the fourth case to which he drew attention, the claimant was drawing a wounds pension as a result of a certificate received from the Adjutant-General that he was a member of the Irish Volunteers in 1916, whereas the Comptroller and Auditor-General says that he had received a communication from the Director of Intelligence that the individual referred to was not a Volunteer.  In this case, the Comptroller and Auditor-General further pointed out that the certificate of the Adjutant General might involve the State in further liability in respect of a service pension to this man.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the investigation of the Public Accounts Committee upheld the Comptroller and Auditor-General in relation to the reports which he had made.  Whether they did or not is not really pertinent to the issue.  What is pertinent is this: whether, on the facts as disclosed to him by the files, the Comptroller and Auditor-General was justified in reporting these instances to the House in order that they might be investigated in the manner in which they are in the Public Accounts Committee, where never, from first to last, is a name mentioned or printed.  I want to know if there is anyone in the House, even one so recklessly foolish, say, as the Minister for Agriculture, who will get up and say that the good name, the reputation, the livelihood or liberty of any single person, no matter who he might be or where he might reside, was jeopardised by the manner in which these matters were reported by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Dáil?  The case, I repeat again, has been made that if the Comptroller and Auditor-General had access to these files, information is going to be given to the public which is going to put some <Col N="2019" /> man's life, some man's liberty or livelihood in danger.</P>
    <P>You have heard the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Is there anything in the manner in which those reports are presented to the Dáil which would justify that argument which has been advanced in support of the Bill?  Further, is there any Deputy who will get up and say that any one of these matters should not have been mentioned in his report by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Dáil?  Is there any Deputy who will get up and contend that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in drawing the attention of the House to these matters and saying that they were fit matters for investigation, exceeded his power or did anything which he was not bound to do by the trust which is reposed in him?  All these cases I have cited arose out of the Pensions Act of 1923.  Is there a disinterested Deputy in the House who will get up and say, if the files of the Board of Assessors under the Act of 1924 were examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the way that the files relating to the cases of the 1923 Act were examined, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General might not find there matters just as worthy of report to the House as the instances which I have cited?</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this question, that of confidential secrecy, to which I must refer.  In the course of his reply to a question the President has, it has already been stated, admitted that a longhand transcript had been made of the oral evidence obtained before the committee.  I am sure, furthermore, that there can be no doubt that the applications for pensions were made in writing and must have contained particulars of the applicant's service.  Thus there is a record of every detail relating to each case from first to last.</P>
    <P>The three members of the Board of Assessors had access to this written record.  Then, the Adjutant-General had access to this <Col N="2020" /> written record.  When the applications came in and when the transcript of evidence was made, no doubt, they were filed and indexed. Later these files must have passed from hand to hand throughout the Department in relation to inquiries which had been made regarding each application.  And thus, without a doubt, the documents in each case must have come under the notice of a number of individuals ranging from the highest to possibly the lowest ranks in the civil service. I am quite sure that in no single instance was that confidence abused. I am quite sure that no member of the civil service would divulge confidential information which he acquired in this way.  But, if there is any case at all to be made by those who are supporting this Bill, it is that the one officer who is not to be trusted in this State is the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that the one Department to which confidential documents should not be sent is the Department presided over by that officer, because it is only when documents reach that Department that the pledge of secrecy is likely to be violated and that only by the officer who, under the Constitution, is called to one of the highest positions of trust in our giving.</P>

      <P>Any attack of any sort.  Yet the Chair can hardly prevent the reaction from decisions and speeches made in this House.  That is beyond the control of the Chair&mdash; possibly beyond the control of those who make them.  I was going to say that this Bill, in my opinion, is a reflection on the Public Accounts Committee of the House.  Since it was formed, that Committee has had to investigate matters often of a highly controversial nature.  Never once has a member of that Committee exceeded the bounds of discretion in any comment he has made. Never once has any member of that Committee been guilty of disclosing or referring to matters which came before him in the course of his duty as a member of the Committee, and which it was not in the public interest to disclose.  Yet, if there is anything at all in the case which the Government is making for this Bill, it is that the members of the Public Accounts Committee are not trustworthy and discreet, and are, in fact, not honourable, and, therefore, matters involving pledges of secrecy or confidence cannot safely be entrusted to them for investigation. This Bill is a reflection upon the several members of the Public Accounts Committee which considered the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the year ending 31st March, 1925, upon which the question of these documents was first raised.  It is a reflection upon the members of the Committees which were appointed during the subsequent years of 1927, 1928 and 1929. It is a reflection upon Deputies J.J. Byrne, Cooper, Hennessy and Esmonde, Senators Johnson and Wilson, Deputies Derrig, Doherty, Wolfe, Good, Briscoe, Flinn, Davin. Cassidy, Bennett, O'Higgins and Haslett, Gun O'Mahony, Jordan, Ryan and Conlon, who are all of them branded by this Bill as unworthy of confidence and trust, incapable of honourably discharging <Col N="2023" /> their duty upon what is perhaps the most important Committee of this House.  If Deputies Cooper, Esmonde, J.J. Byrne and Wolfe go into the Division Lobby in support of this Bill they will, by their votes, declare that they believe themselves to be incapable of discharging honourably their duties as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, and will brand themselves as Deputies who are capable of betraying a confidence and violating a pledge of secrecy.  I will return again for a moment to the argument of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture in support of the Bill.</P>

      <P>He cannot, and it is well for him he cannot.  I was referring to the argument of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture in support of the Bill.  Here, I should like to say that if this Bill goes through it will not be the fault of the Ministers who have spoken in support of it.  In the course of his speech, the Minister for Finance said that this Bill would prevent further references to the Public Accounts Committee, and discussions and disagreements which may take place in the Dáil.  How are these discussions to be prevented? By compelling the Comptroller and Auditor-General to accept the findings of the Board of Assessors as final and binding, and to pass payments made merely upon their certificate.  If the Bill goes through, the only documents the Comptroller and Auditor-General would have the right to examine would be the certificates of military service issued by the Minister for Finance, and issued on the report of the Board of Assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Minister for Agriculture say in regard to such proceedings and such certificates?  &ldquo;Am I not right in saying,&rdquo; said the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the greatest Minister for Agriculture in Europe &mdash;after listening to the speech of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;am I not right in saying that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no function worth twopence in the matter if he is not to examine the files?&rdquo;  And that is precisely the position in which this House is going to put itself and its own officer, charged with a particular duty to this House, if they pass this Bill, in regard to the moneys issued and paid <Col N="2025" /> under the Military Service Pensions Act.  They are going to make the functions of that officer in regard to the disbursement of those public moneys not worth twopence.  Possibly, it is not fair to quote the speech of the Minister for Agriculture against the Bill.  In this matter, we remember his rather hurried intervention at the end of the debate, thrust into it by the Party Whips as mere debating cannon fodder, ignorant of the whole matter, and for the sole purpose of slinging mud so as to obscure the issue.  We may remember that during the debate the Minister was so mixed in his arguments and muddled in mind that he could not distinguish between myself and my colleague, Deputy Lemass, on this Front Bench&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be hard to make that distinction, without paying any compliment to Deputy Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President will wait for a moment I shall come to him.  The quotation which I have given shows that the Minister for Agriculture did not know whether his arguments were for the Bill or against the Bill.  Let me repeat it: &ldquo;Am I not right in saying that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no function worth twopence in the matter if he is not to examine the files?&rdquo;  But the whole purpose of the Bill, as the Minister for Finance said, is to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor-General from examining the files, and to prevent him from bringing before the Dáil cases in which public moneys have clearly and manifestly been wrongfully paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, pensions amounting to large sums will be paid annually without the Comptroller and Auditor-General being permitted to examine the basis on which they were calculated, and without being able to satisfy himself, and through him the Dáil, that the terms of the original Act have been complied with.  Surely the Dáil did not contemplate when passing the original Act that the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to audit these <Col N="2026" /> accounts on their behalf would be restricted, or that his duty in that respect would be foregone.  Deputy O'Higgins, I think, made the case that they did.  To sustain that view it would be necessary to show that the Oireachtas by a specific provision of the Act deliberately debarred the Comptroller and Auditor-General from examining the validity of any payments, and unless that provision is deliberately written into the Act then those who withheld those files from the Comptroller and Auditor-General were guilty of an illegality. The Minister for Defence and the President of the Executive Council have acted in this matter in violation of the law and the Constitution, both of which the President has often boasted, on public platforms, he has done such terrible things to maintain.</P>
    <P>I would like, at the end again, to remind the House as to the principles which are to determine the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the conduct of these investigations. Amongst other things, the first and most important is that no Department hitherto has had a right to refuse information, even though of a highly confidential character, to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, if he required it to satisfy himself that the expenditure agrees with the Parliamentary appropriation.  The second principle is the Comptroller and Auditor-General alone is competent to say what information is necessary for the discharge of his statutory function.  The third is that in all these matters the Comptroller and Auditor-General acts as the officer of this House.  If he is not permitted to act and to examine moneys paid under the Military Service Pensions Act in accordance with these principles, what position is going to be created?  If this Bill goes through the findings of this Board of Assessors will be made binding upon him, upon the Minister for Finance, and upon other tribunals and persons whatsoever. Even if it came to the knowledge of the Comptroller and Auditor-General that public moneys were being <Col N="2027" /> wrongfully paid, that pensions were paid to persons not entitled to them, the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not report to the Dáil the facts which were within his own personal knowledge.  The Minister for Finance could not even report the facts. These pensions would continue to be paid year in and year out, and this Dáil and the people would have no redress in regard to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the adjournment took place the other night I had just said that, encouraged by the success of Mr. Neville, of Furness, in the years 1778 and 1780, and by the old account books that we had in our possession for practically one hundred years, I began growing wheat.  I had been tilling it long before in another place, but when I moved from the place which has now become the property of the Land Commission to where I am at present&mdash;it was about the year 1909&mdash; I began the growing of wheat.  I am sorry that although I grew it for about nine or ten years, from 1909 or 1910 to 1918&mdash;that was the last year I did grow it&mdash;I had, on the whole, no success.  A couple of years were extremely good, but one year, 1918, which I mentioned before, was an absolute wash out, and for years before that the result was very indifferent. I was growing this for a cash crop&mdash;it was the only cash crop I ever did grow.  I consume all the other stuff I grow on my own land. All the roots and the oats I require for my horses, and all that I grow for myself.  This, of course, I grew to sell, because I thought the ground, having such a good reputation, and apparently it deserved it; so far as the crops were concerned they looked all right.  But when it came to the saving actually that was quite a different matter.  I believe a small <Col N="2029" /> amount can be quite successfully grown; that is, if you are content with what will do your own house. My nearest neighbour during the war grew a certain amount of oats. He would like to have it quite pure, without any foreign stuff in it, but he was told by the millers that that was quite impossible.  I am bound to say that I admired his energy and determination to use his own stuff. I do not think it was quite satisfactory. I should not have thought it sufficiently good to use.  I would much rather use oaten bread myself than that.  I was rather misled when I undertook the growing of wheat.  I was led to do it on account of the reputed goodness of the land, because I looked up my old ledgers and, as I say, I have them a very long time.</P>
      <P>They are as clear as if they were written yesterday.  The handwriting is quite a lesson to us in these days when we trust to typewriters and when our writing is so bad.  I looked up for instance the year 1800.  I employ all the men I can afford.  I have a large garden to work and a lot of other things to be looked after.  I work in one thing with another.  I find that in the year 1800 for the same amount of land as I have got there were just ten times as many people employed. I could not afford naturally in these days to employ that number of people to save my crops or to carry on my business.  Of course, I regret to have to say that the wages paid in these days were infinitesimal. The names of these people in my ancestors' employment were all given with their ages, their sex and what they got per week.  The wages of this number, ten times as many as I have got at present, did not come to as much as I pay at present. Of course, that was a very disgraceful state of affairs and not one that we would recommend in these days, but that was the case and it was no wonder with that number of people that they were able to save their crops satisfactorily. As I conclude they were able or they would not have gone on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> Furthermore,, I think comparisons with other countries are very fallacious.  Their conditions may apparently be somewhat similar to ours, but when you come to examine them critically it does not work out to the same extent.  I had some property in Yorkshire; I had also some in Lancashire.  The latter I have still.  Round my place in Yorkshire was an excellent wheat-growing district.  The climate was apparently very much the same as it is over here; the seasons seem to be very much alike.  There was about the same amount of rain and the crops came in practically the same time, with the same lateness and one could see in the farms around splendid fields of wheat collected carefully into stacks in the farmyards and kept carefully thatched until spring when it suited them to thrash them out.  I have always found over here if I am going to preserve them at all that the threshing has to be done instantly.  The sooner the better.  I was never able to keep my wheat for any time.  The sooner it was threshed the better.  I think all those in my neighbourhood who went in for it have had the same experience.  There is nobody who does it now particularly.  Of course I found the straw extremely valuable for my horses; there is no better straw for horse bedding than wheaten straw, for the very good reason that they will not eat it.  I think it was Deputy Kent who said that wheat was excellent for calf feeding and that sort of thing, but it would be rather expensive to grow wheat especially for that when there are other forms of food much less expensive and quite as good.</P>
    <P>Statistics prove that the growing of oats does suit the country.  I think it was stated that six or seven hundred thousand acres of oats were grown last year.  I think there is great room for development in the oats growing.  A great deal more could be done in that way.  There are too much Canadian oats used in this country, and it is not necessary to use them.  Even the racehorse could be very well supported on oats that are grown in this country.  We <Col N="2031" /> could practically do without seed oats except for a change, perhaps, every four or five years.  What we are all anxious about is that there should be more employment.  That is at the bottom of the whole matter with all of us.  There is certainly a necessity for it.  There was never more so.  Of that there is no doubt. This present winter, unfortunately, one sees a great many of the most excellent working class men going about unemployed.  I never saw before unemployment to the same extent.  Only the other day I had occasion to fill up a vacancy and I could have filled it many times over. It is a very deplorable state of things, and it is necessary that something should be done to lessen it.  The question is what.  It is no use trying to force on the growth of a cereal that will not do well in the country, and that the people will not grow. You may bring a horse to the water, but you will not make him drink.  I do not think that any reasonable subsidy that could be given&mdash;I say reasonable because, of course, you could give something that would be absurd&mdash;would induce people to undertake wheat growing to any large extent.  As Deputy Brennan said, you would grow what you want for yourself if you could save it, and be sure of it, but to grow it in any large quantity is out of the question. I speak with a certain amount of experience.  I have gone in for working with my own hands, and learning everything about the work, because I believe in understanding these things.  I found it paid me more than once exceedingly well to be able to carry out any and every part of my farm business.  I can do everything of that kind myself, from milking to stacking, and I think everybody who does it in these days is wise.</P>
    <P>To return to the unemployment question, I think if anything can be done to increase the consumption of oats and to increase the land under cultivation of oats it will be all to the good.  People will do it in certain <Col N="2032" /> circumstances.  It would not be difficult to induce them to do it, because they believe it can be done successfully.  In the case of oats a bad season, in my experience, does not tell so fatally as it does in the case of other cereals.  You may see a field swept down as if a steamroller had gone over it.  When it is cut, threshed, and put in a proper loft where it can be turned and get plenty of air it is perfectly usable, although it may be slightly discoloured. It is quite good for horses. I do not know about racehorses.  For that reason, I think it would be a much more sensible idea to foster oats than wheat.  Of course, there are many ways in which an extension of tillage, which is so desirable, may be fostered.  I quite agree that 12½ per cent. of tillage in the country is absurd.  It ought to be increased. I do not see why by inducement it could not be done, but it will not be done by wheat.  I am perfectly certain of that.  There is now consideration going on before a Commission of a certain proposal.  We have got to see if it will have the effect of increasing production.  I hope, if it is proved that it will increase production, that effect will be given to it, because anything that will give employment to the men who are going about at present is all to the good.  I have never seen it so bad in the country districts about me as it is at present.  As Senator Johnson said last night at the National University&mdash;and I quite agree with him&mdash;we want more production of food and we want more industries.  Anybody who can increase either one or the other is a person who is of service to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow on the lines of many of the speakers who have preceded me in speaking to this motion by quoting statistics, but I just wish to re-state the position of the Labour Party in relation to this motion.  We are supporting this motion because it embodies in its proposals the system of control.  There are, of course, points of difference between the Labour Party's addendum to the Minority <Col N="2033" /> Report and the Minority Report itself which I shall quote later.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that while we agree with the motion moved by Deputy Ryan almost wholly, we disagree with some of its details.  In the addendum signed by my colleague on the Economic Committee, Mr. Kennedy, and by myself, we stated that we disapproved of the proposal that the suggested Wheat Control Board should be a limited liability company capitalised and partly directed by private stockholders subject to the veto of the Minister for Finance.  In our view &ldquo;any such Control Board ought to be a public body directed by people of experience in the business and in no sense ought it to be a private corporation.&rdquo; Deputy O'Connell, the leader of the Labour Party, asked, on a previous occasion when discussing this question, why a limited liability company.  He asked also if it were a limited liability company where would the profits go when the profits were made.  These questions have still remained unanswered. We of the Labour Party suggested that any such organisation should be controlled by the State.  That, of course, may sound a little too much like socialism to certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  At any rate, these questions have not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have listened to many eloquent speeches from Fianna Fáil Benches and from other benches also.  We have had very eloquent speeches directed to show the immense advantages that this Control Board, which would be composed just as a limited liability is composed, would be to the State.  I have already indicated what our view on that matter is.  We saw and still see in the proposals outlined in Deputy Ryan's motion a better means for putting the milling industry on its feet than say, for instance, a tariff on flour.  We believe that by the control of the imports of flour as suggested again in this motion that more good would be done for one of our staple industries. But we do suggest that this <Col N="2034" /> Control Board should be under the control of the Dáil with a Minister responsible in the Dáil who should, of course, answer any question with regard to the activities of this particular Board.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Wolfe, who has just sat down, said that it would be useless to force on the country a cereal that would not do or that would not thrive.  I have here a report from the County Cork Committee of Agriculture which is composed in the main of some of the most efficient farmers in the country.</P>
    <P>They have carried out a number of experiments in the growing of wheat, small scale experiments and large scale experiments, and they said that in these experiments, which were carried out to test the capacities of certain varieties of wheat, they were very successful. In the comparative return which was given in this report we find that in 22 centres tests were made in the matter of black oats.  They find that there was an average of 23 cwt. 1 qr. of oats which worked out at 5/3 per cwt.  In 28 centres white oats worked out an average of 22 cwt. 1 qr., bringing in 5/6 per cwt.  We had barley in the same district which worked out at 23 cwt. at 8/- per cwt. We had wheat, too, the matter under discussion at the moment.  This was grown in ten centres, giving an average yield of 26 cwt. 3 qrs., and which realised a price of 10/6 per cwt.</P>
    <P>That goes to show that in the districts from which these returns were taken wheat growing at any rate has proved to be a success.  It has proved to be a very useful cash crop, and from what I know of the sound common-sense of the farmers of East Cork they would not put that large area under wheat unless they knew they could turn it into cash at the earliest possible moment. In the large scale experiments we find according to this report that the average yield was 23 cwt. per statute acre.  The average moisture content in the case of the samples sent to the State laboratory was 19.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> This matter of moisture content was one of the things that was stressed both by the Economic Committee and from time to time by Deputies in this House opposing the motion.  A report on the samples from each plot area submitted to the Irish Flour Millers' Association for examination says:&mdash;&ldquo;Six samples graded A were reckoned to be of first-class milling quality, while the remaining 11 were graded B and were considered to be of fairly good quality.&rdquo;  None of the samples submitted was returned as inferior from the milling point of view.  Now I could go on to quote from this Report, giving you very excellent extracts from it, but one or two others will, I think, suffice, and will go very far towards strengthening the case for the motion standing in the name of Deputy Ryan.  There is contained in one or two sentences in this report a warning note so far as this country is concerned, and one to which I would like the Minister responsible to give ear.  It is rather interesting to learn that 8,658 acres or roughly one-third of the total area of wheat grown in the Saorstát, was grown in the Cork county.  Here is an extract from the Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The fall in the wheat area is chiefly attributable to the opening up of virgin soil in the United States of America and Canada in the sixties of the last century, and in Australia and in the Argentine at a later date.  The Irish farmer found it was quite impossible under the conditions obtaining here to produce wheat in competition with these new countries.</P>
    <P>This was the point that has been stressed, and I want you to bear in mind the ensuing sentence:</P>
    <P>Now, however, as a result of the increased consumption of wheat in countries such as China and Japan, where it was formerly little used as an article of diet, as a result of the steadying effect of the American Wheat Pools upon prices and the increased cost of production abroad, the outlook for <Col N="2036" /> wheat cultivation is much brighter than heretofore.</P>
    <P>As regards wheat growing in our own country they say:</P>
    <P>The combined imports of wheat, flour and offals amount to nearly £7,000,000 annually.  To eliminate our imports about half a million acres would require to be placed under this crop.  After consideration of all the factors, we are of the opinion that a considerable portion of the half million tons required annually to feed our population could be profitably produced at home.</P>
    <P>In addition to the depression in agriculture that exists here, and to a greater extent across the Channel, we are faced with the fact that German wheat, bounty-fed, has been poured into England within the last couple of months.  The price for German bounty-fed wheat was from 48/- to 50/- a quarter.  In one or two cases it went to 39/6 a quarter.  Germany has placed import duties on wheat going into her own country. We might easily suggest that if Germany has seen fit and wise to protect her grain industry, at least some measure of protection should be adopted here.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which this country is being made a dumping ground.  We know that in or about last April or May the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board declared that they would exempt goods exported coastwise from harbour dues.  This of course, represents a very big advantage to the flour-milling trade going out of the port of Liverpool, in addition to the relief that this industry is getting from de-rating.  We feel that unless something is done to encourage the growing of wheat in this country we will be faced one of these days with a very grave crisis, not alone in so far as unemployment is concerned, but in very many other ways.  We support this motion because it aims at some kind of control; it aims at restricting some of the imports of wheat.  Because of these things we support this motion moved by Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>

      <P>I feel it my duty to raise my voice on this motion.  I have been classified as a silent member of this House, but on this occasion, please God, my voice will carry some argument with those who are prejudiced against this motion.  It might, at least, make them reconsider their attitude in the light of the interests of the Irish nation and the Irish people, and it might induce them in fair play to give this motion the consideration it deserves.  I ask you not to approach the matter from a Party point of view; approach it rather from a national point of view.  I have figures here which will help to prove my case.  The figures have been supplied by the Department of Agriculture, the Department for which Deputy Hogan is responsible. He is its spokesman in this House.  The Department of Agriculture has been set up and is being paid by the State to investigate matters that concern the biggest of our country's industries, agriculture.  In this industry 60 per cent. or more of our population are engaged, but their interests seem to claim the least attention and their position to-day in Ireland is the worst of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a past student of the Department of Agriculture's College at Glasnevin, as one who during the last 16 years has supported the agricultural industry consistently, and as one who has tried to emulate what I was taught by the Department, I propose to read significant portions of a report of the Department with regard to its wheat propagation scheme carried out in 1925-26.  I leave it to the common-sense of each individual Deputy to come to a reasonable decision on that report.  I will ask every member in this House to examine it and to make up his mind whether he is doing right or wrong when it finally comes to a question of deciding on this important issue.  I will now read portion of the Department's report: &ldquo;The wheat variety experiments which the Department have conducted annually throughout the country for a period extending over <Col N="2038" /> 20 years have demonstrated that in practically every county in the Saorstát there are large areas where heavy crops of wheat can normally be successfully propagated.  Moreover, as a result of the work of the Department's seed propagation division in connection with the propagation and testing of Red Fife it has also been shown that wheat possessing high quality for milling and baking purposes can be grown in this country.  Owing, however, to the adverse climatic conditions frequently experienced during the harvesting and saving of the wheat crop, the moisture content of the grain is high as a general rule, and in this respect Irish-grown wheat does not compare favourably with wheat imported into the country from wheat-producing countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us examine the moisture content that we hear so much about.  I will quote for you from the same source extracts about the samples of wheat taken from that extensive survey of this wheat problem in 1925-26, and that were submitted to the millers for their report.  In Mr. Claude Odlum's Report&mdash;one of the most successful millers in this country, and a man who is an authority on the subject&mdash;there is important information.  It is worth while going through all the Report, but I will come to it on some other occasion. What we want to get at is, can we produce a milling quality wheat in this country good enough for the Irish people?  Here is the answer in regard to flour produced from Irish-grown wheat in 1925-26, examined by the millers in this country: &ldquo;The flour was very bright and granular. It was an excellent sample of flour.&rdquo; Now, with regard to banking qualities: &ldquo;The loaf made from the yeast fermentation of the flour was good for this type of flour.  It was small in volume, very clear and bright in colour, and of unusually fine flavour.&rdquo;  And, by the way, I think that to-day we get a lot of bread that has no flavour at all.  &ldquo;The scone made by using soda and buttermilk was very satisfactory.  The colour and flavour were both excellent.&rdquo;<Col N="2039" /> I think that is the important point, the home-baking question, not minimising the importance of bakers' bread.  It is said that &ldquo;the scone made by using soda and buttermilk was very satisfactory.  The colour and flavour were both excellent.&rdquo; I would like to quote further to the House, but time is limited, and I would advise anybody interested to get the Journal of the Department of Lands and Agriculture, Vol. 27, No. 2, and study it for himself. This is a quotation from the same source:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During recent years, owing principally to the steadily increasing world demand for wheat flour and to the operation of the large wheat pools, which have now been set up by farmers in the great wheat producing countries, the price per bushel of wheat has shown a tendency to become stabilised at a figure which makes the cultivation of the crop in this country a proposition well worth consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that&mdash;&ldquo;which makes the cultivation of the crop in this country a proposition well worth consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a summary of the Department's wheat scheme for 1925-26. There were 286 plots laid down that year, of which only 24 were said to be failures.  The weight was determined from 197 centres out of the 286, and the average yield from the whole country turned out to be 23 cwts. 3 qrs. to the statute acre, or approximately 38 cwt. to the Irish acre.  That is the return from 17 counties in 1925-26, and similar yields are returned from over 200 plots grown in 25 counties in 1926-27. These experiments were undertaken to obtain useful information for the Irish farmers and were carried out by the farmers themselves. The Millers' Association undertook an examination of some of the samples in respect of milling quality, and as a result of that examination, 51 samples were graded A quality, 54 graded B quality, and 18 C quality.  It is mentioned in the report <Col N="2040" /> that both A and B quality were fit for milling purposes.  These are not my words.  They are the millers' own words as given in the report. This is valuable information, to my mind, because I look upon the work done by the Department in a great many spheres as very useful work.  I believe the instructors of agriculture, on the whole, are sympathetic towards the work in which they are engaged.  I believe that the men put in charge of the plant-breeding scheme of the Department are sincere in their endeavours to find out the best varieties of seed and to advance wheat growing.</P>
    <P>These are the figures of the results of the experiments, and I put it to any honest man in the House that he can agree with me that the matter is worthy of consideration and that, therefore, it should not be approached from any prejudiced point of view. I submit in all sincerity that the Minister for Agriculture has not met this motion fairly in the sense that he has come here to oppose this motion with his mind made up.  In a speech made before the summer recess he said definitely that he was opposed to this altogether.  I would refer the House to his own statement as reported on page 286 of the Official Report of the proceedings on 23rd May of this year.  I am only taking the quotation, and I ask in fairness to the Minister that Deputies should read again what he stated. Do not say that I am treating him unfairly if I quote him here in this debate.  What he said on 23rd May satisfies me that now in this debate he has not faced the position as he should as the Minister for Agriculture. I want to qualify that statement by saying that I mean that the Minister for Agriculture, or any other Minister, should be in this House, above every other man, unprejudiced in regard to a motion coming from any part of the House until he hears all the pros and cons.  Here is what the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not believe in this policy and we are not going to make experiments.  If other Parties believe that experiments <Col N="2041" /> should be made, let them make them and let them take all the credit or all the blame attached to them.  I have no faith in that policy.  I do not believe in subsidies, particularly in regard to wheat, and we do not intend to subsidise wheat.  As I have said before, I do not care what your protestations may be, there never will be a subsidy for wheat except, perhaps, for one year.  We may get away with it on political issues, but when we get down to hard practical facts and try to get the farmer to do certain things we have to stop talking in generalities and we find that we are up against insuperable difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister as a young Irish farmer, as one whose sole means of livelihood, if I were at home, is on the farm&mdash;please God, I will always remain a farmer &mdash;that he is not playing fair with the Irish farmers to make a statement like that.  I submit that no one deserves as much consideration and fair play as the Irish farmer, because Irish farmers and agricultural workers, as the Minister himself stated last night in University College, represent 60 per cent. of the population.  There are over 60 per cent. engaged in agriculture.  It is because of that fact that I chose, although I remain silent in most other debates, to raise my voice on this occasion in this matter which vitally affects Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I propose to go back as Deputy Anthony did.  He quoted from the report by the county instructor in Co. Cork, and I should like to let you know what occurred in Co. Leix, the county from which I come.  I shall summarise the words of our agricultural instructor, a man I am glad to say who was well selected for his position, a man who is a practical man, who has sufficient theoretical knowledge to face any agricultural subject.  I am summarising his report or his deductions from the cultivation of wheat in Co. Leix.  He says that wheat does best on rather strong heavy soil with well-drained subsoil, but satisfactory <Col N="2042" /> crops can be got on lighter soil, if proper attention is paid to sowing, dressing and manuring. Wheat should preferably follow a manured crop, but if necessary it may be grown after stubble.  In this case the ground should either receive a light dressing of dung or a dressing of superphosphate or kainit before sowing.</P>
    <P>It is said that wheat is the worst paying crop for farmers.  In that connection I propose to give some figures in regard to experiments conducted in my county by Mr. Tynan, the agricultural instructor.  I made my own deductions, and every Deputy is entitled to make his.  I contrasted the prices with this year's average price which the farmer has to accept.  The experiments in my county showed that barley yielded 19 barrels, wheat 14 and oats 27. These are the average yields.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDwyer" hpid="Mr. Dwyer Mr. Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dwyer</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a correction. I am quoting in terms of Irish acres, and that makes a difference. That gives a return of £15 4s. per acre.  Wheat, 14 barrels at 25/-, gives £17 10s, and oats at 11/6 per barrel, which is a high figure, gives £15 10s.  Thus you have wheat giving £17 10s as against oats at £15 10s. and barley at £15 4s.  I am prepared to reduce average figures down as low as 15 barrels for barley, 12 for wheat, and 20 for oats, per Irish acre.  On these figures wheat would be on top, showing a return of £15 as against £12 15s. for barley and £13 10s. for oats.  I will not take into consideration the extraordinary statement made by Deputy Brennan as to the possibility of getting 5/-, 6/- and 7/- a cwt. for straw.  I would like to be able to get that figure, and I think it would be well if we could get farmers in other districts to send a few loads into Roscommon, where such high prices are available.  On the last occasion, last night at University College, when the Minister <Col N="2043" /> for Agriculture was speaking on this problem he mentioned a figure of 18 cwts per acre.  I would call his attention to the fact that in the 1925-1926 and 1926-27 experiments, conducted under his own Department, the average yield from over five hundred plots was 23 cwts. 3 qrs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Summarising the results of the 1926-27 experiments, we find that there were eight plots out of every nine successful.  We have heard how precarious the wheat crop is but that is not in accordance with the evidence of farmers generally. These returns have been collected and summarised by agricultural instructors and they say that eight out of every nine plots were successful. In connection with that report I think that County Clare deserves special consideration from the point of view that a certain amount of play was made here against the leader of our party, Deputy de Valera, as to why he should interest himself in this question.  He had every right to interest himself in it and to speak upon it as leader of our Party.  He was in a position to get from his constituency in County Clare a more rosy report as to the possibility of the development of wheat growing than could be got from other districts.  I find that all the plots in Clare gave an exceptionally high yield and that the majority turned out &ldquo;A&rdquo; quality flour.  They got to the statute acre as high as 2 tons 3 cwts., 1 ton 15 cwts., 1 ton 13 cwts., 1 ton 10 cwts., 1 ton 9 cwts., 1 ton 13 cwts., and so on.  I think it is unworthy of any Deputy here to attack another, no matter who he is or what constituency he comes from, in order to try and score mere political points in a debate of this kind.  It is unfair to the nation that expects us to legislate for it.  We are expected to come here, put our heads together and formulate the best policy for the people.  I now turn to what is being done in outside countries and, again, I take my source of information from the present issue of the <Col N="2044" /> Department's journal.  I am satisfied to take the figures contained there because I have some faith in the Department.  I have a knowledge of its inner working and my sympathy is with its work.  I always have been sympathetic towards experiments carried out by the Department because I realise that they are conducted in the interests of Irish farmers.  We find that wheat growing is engaging the attention of the Italian Government, the Swiss Government, and the Governments of several other countries.</P>
    <P>Let us consider why these other countries are taking such a great interest in it.  I will give a short quotation from the report of the Department, Volume 29 (1), and I advise Deputies to study it closely. It says in regard to the wheat growing campaign in Italy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Owing to the appreciation of the lira and the great drop in international prices, the price realised for their crops was not sufficient to compensate the farmers for their outlay.  To alleviate the distress the Government immediately took the following steps.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The steps which were taken are then set out, and I hope that members will study them for themselves. But it says that to alleviate distress amongst farmers the Government were prepared to take certain steps.  So far so good.</P>
    <P>Let us come to Switzerland.  We are often told to take an example from Denmark and other countries in connection with what should be done for Irish agriculture: I am prepared to look around and see what is being done in other countries, to see can we fit in any part of the agricultural policy of other countries into ours.  If we can it is our duty to do it.  What is occurring in Switzerland?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Referendum taken in Switzerland on 3rd March, 1929, resulted in a majority of over two to one in favour of the acceptance <Col N="2045" /> of the Federal Assembly's Scheme for maintaining the country's wheat supply and controlling the import grain trade.  The whole farming community, both the wheat growing lowlander and the stock breeder in the higher Alps, stood solidly for the measure, which found considerable support also in the towns.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I note that the question was submitted to the people of Switzerland by a Referendum, and I am sorry to say that the Executive Council thought fit to remove the Referendum here, because a big issue of this kind could be submitted by means of the Referendum to the farmers for decision.  I feel that if it were submitted, and if we had a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market, both of which are possible under certain conditions, the farmers would rise to the occasion, as they rose in 1917, when they were asked to produce more food, and when the area under wheat rose to about 100,000 acres.  The Swiss scheme contained three main proposals, the first of which was &ldquo;With a view to ensuring the national food supply, the Confederation shall maintain a sufficient supply of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some people here are inclined to think that we cannot be cut off from our food supplies&mdash;that we are always sure of our wheat supplies. Every Deputy knows what has occurred from time to time here. Even if we were sure of the control of our wheat supplies, in so far as getting a sufficient supply for the people, or nearly sufficient, we are not sure, when the wheat and flour get scarce here, that the millers and other importers would not take advantage of the position, as has often been done, and force up the price of flour by 4s. or 5s. per cwt. before the Government could take action.  That is only one aspect of the question.  It is to the interest of every nation to look after the food supplies of the people.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy asked: supposing this scheme is a success what will occur to our surplus?  Let me point out to him that in Switzerland they <Col N="2046" /> have taken precautions against that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Confederation shall promote the home cultivation of bread-corn and shall support self-supply. They shall take over good home-grown grain suitable for milling at a price which will render possible the home cultivation of cereal crops.  The Confederation shall take steps to maintain the native milling industry, while protecting the interests of the consumer of bread and flour.  To this end, they may impose import duties upon foreign flour, or reserve to themselves the right to import flour.  They may, if necessary, grant special facilities to mills in remote districts with a view to equalising the higher costs of transport, and may help to defray the cost of transport of flour supplies in mountain districts.</P>
    <P>If it is useful that the Department of Agriculture should go to the trouble and expense of carrying out experiments with a view to submitting reports, breeding material to guide our farmers, surely when the results are published in the Journals of the Department they should receive consideration, and I hope that every Deputy will take an interest in these matters.  It is suggested that the Irish farmers would not rise to the occasion and cultivate more wheat if they had a guaranteed price and the possibility of a steady market for a marketable quality of wheat.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow any red herrings drawn across the track.  Red herrings are too often drawn across the track when important matters are being discussed here.  It is time for us to approach this question seriously.  As to whether Irish farmers will rise to the occasion, I can speak on behalf of farmers of the type that this will interest in the tillage districts, where they will <Col N="2047" /> have to continue in tillage because the quality of the land is not generally suitable for grazing or other purposes.  In these districts the production of cereals as a cash crop is vital to the farmers.  No matter what the Minister for Agriculture or any other Deputy may think as to changing the position in the country, and getting farmers, who of necessity are selling their corn as a cash crop, to change over and accept a new policy of feeding all their grain, such a sudden change is impossible. I am in agreement with the Minister for Agriculture or anyone else who advocates the progressive and increasing use of our Irish grain in the feeding of live stock or the production of poultry or butter.  I do believe that we can reach that stage, but it must be reached gradually.  I do believe that everyone would be comparatively better off if we did, but we cannot do it at once.  We might as well face the facts.  At present, half the population of the country have not the wherewithal to do that.  Speaking for the midlands, I would challenge contradiction when I say that almost fifty per cent. of the corn&mdash;barley and oats&mdash; produced there must be sold as a cash crop in the harvest.  I will make every allowance for farmers who are reserving sufficient for their own needs.  There are farmers, to my own knowledge, who have kept this year a ton or more of barley, and afterwards had twenty, thirty or even fifty to seventy barrels of surplus corn for sale.  I shall quote now from a letter which I have received from one farmer, giving his views on wheat growing.  I am sorry that I am not free to give his name, but if any Deputy wishes he can see the letter in confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to a number of farmers in my own constituency to ask them if this proposal went through would they be prepared to grow wheat and would they think it good policy to encourage wheat growing and gradually get back into wheat growing again.  Of course I believe it would take probably ten years to <Col N="2048" /> reach the stage when we could grow sufficient quantities of wheat to meet, say, 60 or 70 per cent. of our requirements.  I should not wish the farmers to rush headlong into it, because wheat growing like beet growing requires a certain amount of knowledge, and it is lack of knowledge of its cultivation that prevents the farmers taking it up more extensively.  It was lack of knowledge and encouragement that prevented the farmers when wheat was selling at 30/- a barrel here in Ireland taking advantage of the situation and putting in the crop at the right time.  They were not interested in wheat growing and their attention was not called to it.  They were principally concerned in sowing oats or barley.  But if the Department of Agriculture had made it worth their while and if we had as much propaganda in favour of wheat growing as we had in other things I submit that the farmers as a whole would rise to the occasion.</P>
    <P>Here is a sample of what one farmer thinks and I would pit his knowledge as a practical farmer against that of any other farmer in Ireland.  He says: &ldquo;During 1929 I sowed four Irish acres of wheat, seeded at the rate of twenty stone to the acre; grass seed sown&mdash;looks splendid&mdash;after cutting the wheat, and it is so still.  The chief reason for sowing wheat was the fear that barley would rot and destroy the seed.  The yield was 16 barrels to the Irish acre and sold at 25/- per barrel at Goodbody's Mills, Clara. Comparing this year's prices of grain crops I believe the farmers if they have suitable land for wheat would be far better paid at 25/- a barrel than with any other grain crop, but as other years may not be as favourable as this it would be well to advocate a guaranteed price of 30/-.  I believe that a person who can get winter wheat properly sown would get a far better yield than from spring-sown wheat, but very often it is found impossible to get it properly sown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree the difficulty of getting winter wheat is there, but I submit <Col N="2049" /> as against that if the farmers knew that the wheat crop was going to be profitable, if they had a guaranteed price for it, and if they believed that they would have no trouble marketing it so long as they produced good quality grain, the difficulty of getting wheat grown at the right time would be minimised very much.  It is well worthy of note that in the experiments conducted by the Department in the years 1925-26, 1926-27 almost 600 plots had been cultivated, scarcely fifty were classed as failures, and of these fifty classed as failures fifteen or sixteen were failures due to the depredations of rooks, and another 15 per cent. of them was due to heated seed which failed to germinate, so that it will be seen that a very small percentage of the crops failed when we examine the whole thing.  As a farmer, I put it to any farmer if it is not a fact, that almost every season on every farm some portion of the barley or oat crop can be classified almost as a failure.  Any farmer who looks at the latter fairly will admit that on his own farm year after year he has met with some degree of failure in both oats and barley in regard to yield and to its condition at harvesting. Too much importance is placed upon these things.  It is very easy to raise an argument in order to prejudice things.  Our duty as Irishmen and our duty as farmers in this country should be to point out the difficulties that exist, but not to discourage the farmers further.  The farmers of the country are discouraged enough.  Heaven knows at the present time it is encouragement they want.  Therefore, I say it is bad for the agricultural industry to do anything that will depress the farmers more than they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>I say that this motion of Deputy Ryan's should receive fair consideration, and by fair consideration I mean that Deputies should agree that the motion is of first-rate national importance and that, as has been done with regard to the matter of the mixture of barley and maize, they should agree to submit it to the good sense <Col N="2050" /> of all parties in the House, and that they should refer it to a committee that would hear evidence for or against it.  I am perfectly satisfied that if you go to the farmers of this country and put things before them in an unprejudiced manner, and if you could give them a guarantee that 30/- per barrel would be paid for wheat&mdash;it would be better if the price were higher&mdash;but if you do that, and also guarantee them a market, the farmers will rise to the occasion both in their own and the nation's interest.  Then there is the question as to how it would affect beneficially other people than the farmers.  It would affect several people in this country.  It would affect men on half time in our Irish mills.  It is an unfortunate thing that the ratepayers here in Dublin or anywhere else are called upon to pay taxes for the relief of unemployment. I say deliberately there is no need for it if we explore, as we could with advantage, these things, and by helping the farmers they could find employment for a large percentage of the unemployed, a big proportion of whom were reared in the country and found employment in the fields of this country before coming to the cities, and who are only waiting to return to work in the country if a proper policy were adopted to give them employment.</P>
    <P>I have other letters here, but I do not want to take up too much time by quoting them.  I have a letter even from a man in a labourer's cottage who sowed this year half a statute acre of wheat because he saw a neighbouring farmer growing wheat successfully.  What has he done with his half acre of wheat? He wisely brought it to the local mill and had 4 or 5 cwt. wheatmeal ground for the use of his household and the balance ground for pig and poultry feeding.  Please God, in time we will see most of our derelict mills working again throughout the country, milling our wheat into wheatmeal for consumption in our Irish homes, and also grinding our oats into oatmeal.</P>
    <P>This labourer from his half acre <Col N="2051" /> plot of wheat produced for his family besides having a little surplus for feeding to his pig, five or six cwts. of wheat meal, and as I say had a surplus for other purposes, I suppose for his fowl as well. Is not that worth while considering? We can grow wheat for the millers and to supply our own needs and also grow it to supply wheat meal ground in the local mills for our Irish people.  Unfortunately at the present time many of them have closed down.  But I say, please God, many of them will start rolling again in the future.</P>
    <P>We have often heard statistics quoted in this House on less important subjects than this.  Therefore I submit it is well worth our while considering this in all its implications, and giving fair play to the motion before the House.  I intend quoting to you from the report on large scale wheat experiments, 1926 and 1927.  Of the 176 samples examined and classified by the millers' representatives; 85 were graded into Class A, 83 in Class B, and 8 in Class C.  Therefore over 95 per cent. of the samples were, in the opinion of the judges, suitable for milling purposes, and, mark you, the judges were very prominent millers, Messrs. Odlum and Odlum and Mr. Shackleton, Carlow.  It was also found that first quality samples of grain were produced in almost every county in the Saorstát.  These results are satisfactory, especially when it is considered that the weather which prevailed during and prior to the harvest of 1927 was unusually wet and unsuitable for the development of good quality grain.  The best quality samples examined were grown in East Clare; every one of the samples from those plots being graded as Class A.  Again, after the experiments had been concluded, after an examination of the wheat had been made by the millers, and after the flour produced from grain grown on these plots had been submitted by Mr. Odlum for baking tests, &ldquo;Mr. Odlum also made arrangements to have the properties of the flour produced in the milling <Col N="2052" /> test further investigated by Mr. G. S. Kirby, of the Dublin Port Milling Company, and to have sample loaves baked from the flour in the Dublin Port Milling Company's experimental bakery.  Subsequently these loaves were exhibited in the Department's Educational Exhibit at the Royal Dublin Society's Spring Show, where they attracted considerable attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want you to note that.  It was thought well worthy of their consideration by the Department to bring to the notice of the thousands and thousands of people who visited that progressive show the fact that satisfactory quality bread could be produced from Irish wheat.  Mr. Claude Odlum submitted the following report on the milling and baking tests:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This wheat was quite a fair average sample, although the moisture content was greater than the average of the previous year.  It was prepared for milling as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Firstly it was dried on a tiled kiln and 5.6 per cent. of moisture was dried out, leaving the wheat to contain 14.2 per cent. moisture.  This was then washed, screened and milled in the ordinary way, and the milling yield on this dried wheat was as follows:&mdash;Flour, 69.7 per cent.; bran, 17 per cent.; pollard, 11 per cent.; tailings, 7 per cent., and loss (on the milling) was 1.6 per cent.  The flour produced was quite a fair sample, but not so good as in 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again the final part of the report is worth nothing.  It winds up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is therefore evident that whilst the Yeoman types of wheat produce good crops when sown on soil in good condition they cannot be generally recommended for cultivation on all soils, and consequently it is recommended that prospective growers should consult the local agricultural instructor before deciding on the variety of wheat to sow on any particular soil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> The point that I want to make is that we have too many farmers in the country who think they know everything about agriculture, and think that the work of the agricultural instructors is not worth considering. I am satisfied that we can improve matters by active co-operation between the agricultural instructors and the farmers.  It should be our ideal to build up close cooperation between the Department of Agriculture and the farmers rather than that we should do anything to lessen confidence.  We should get the farmers of the country to take an interest in the work of the Department of Agriculture. I am very sorry, and I make a good deal of this point, that both the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Brennan of Roscommon belittled the work of the Department of Agriculture to a certain extent the other night when they were referring to certain statistics compiled by the officials.  As to the average farmer reading the Department's report, what would he think when he hears the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Brennan, who claims to be a practical farmer, saying that the statistics compiled by the officials of the Department of Agriculture are not worth the paper that they are written on?  Surely there is something wrong and if we are to effect economies and, God knows, a lot of economies want to be effected, we should call upon the Minister for Agriculture to tell the Minister for Finance that this money is wasted on compiling statistics which are all wrong.</P>

      <P>The question which I addressed to the Minister to-day and the subject of which I want to raise to-night was as follows&mdash;(Question 24, and reply, Col. 1887, read).  I raise this matter because I think the question involved <Col N="2054" /> is one of very great importance and because I think the principle behind the Order made by the Minister is quite unfair and unsound.  I am not so much concerned with the rights of members of this House in this connection, although I think it is an important consideration also, as with the rights and the giving of the fullest possible fair play to claimants for old age pensions.  I submit that there is enough hardship and injustice associated with the administration of the Act without increasing that hardship and the disabilities under which poor people labour in order to sustain their claims.  At the outset, I would like to say what I have said more than once in this House and that is that I believe the decisions of the deciding officers in the Local Government Department are invariably quite fair.  I have had personal experience of that over and over again, and I think it is the experience of every member of this House, but I believe, and I have some experience of what I say, that very often the facts connected with the old age pensions appeals are not properly presented to the officers I have referred to.  I assert that many pensions officers in the country, whatever their instructions, are apparently setting themselves out to secure the rejection of as many old age pensions claims as they can.  I say that from my experience of a local pensions committee and from the fruitless work that that committee has had to embark on time and again in order to do their part in securing justice for claimants to old age pensions.  The consequence of that position is that the facts are not fully put before the Department from the end that the Department must, for the future, in consequence of this Order, rely on solely.  I felt that it was very important that personal representation could be made in cases of this kind, because from questions and answers arising out of the statements in the hands of the deciding officers a good deal of information in connection with the claims could be elicited and invariably a fair decision could be <Col N="2055" /> arrived at.  It is particularly true of cases where the question of age is involved.</P>
      <P>I can anticipate the argument of the Minister that the case I am making will give an unfair advantage to the old age pensions claimants who will be able to secure the interest of members of this House in their cases. My answer to that is that the present operation of the Old Age Pensions Act in many parts of the country is so obviously unfair that every possible facility ought to be afforded to reduce hardship and unfairness to the minimum number of cases.  Again, I think if the administration of the Act was changed considerably the need for making personal representation in the cases I have mentioned would disappear entirely.  Some years ago, in this House, I asked the Minister for Finance if he was prepared to lay on the Table of the House the instructions issued to pensions officers. That request was declined.  It seems to me that this regulation made now looks at any rate like an attempt to enshroud the whole administration of the Act in secrecy.  I am quite willing to say that there is a great deal in connection with the Act that will not bear very much investigation. I speak altogether of what is happening in the rural areas at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some concession in response to these supplementary questions that we addressed to him to-day.  He said that he had made arrangements to enable verbal representations to be made to an officer of his Department.  An arrangement of that kind will be satisfactory, if that officer, when taking verbal representations of that kind, is enabled to discuss the cases and by an examination of the facts as he finds them on the records before him, to help in coming to a decision that would be fair to all concerned.  I am quite willing to admit, and I know it has been the case, that the presence of a large number of members of this House in that particular branch of the Local Government Department would be <Col N="2056" /> embarrassing to the deciding officers, but there is, I submit, an unanswerable case to be made for the giving of facilities to members of this House by the selection of an officer or officers who would be prepared to continue the practice of hearing verbal representations and of being able by question and answer, if necessary, to elicit the facts in cases before them.  The Minister suggested that it would be unfair to allow personal contact with the deciding officer in cases of this kind, that the deciding officer would assume the functions of judges.  In the courts people are entitled to be heard and they are entitled to be heard through their advocates.  I want to ask the Minister if, in making this regulation, he has recognised the position that illiterate people down the country, in an endeavour to sustain their claims, have to rely on the advocacy of their claims in this form or in some such form, and no amount of correspondence will give the deciding officers the facilities that they can get by personal contact with people knowing the facts in arriving at the decision.  I want to say that in cases that I have personal experience of very often I was asked&mdash; sometimes at least&mdash;what my opinion was about particular cases.  My opinion sometimes was adverse to the claimant because I wanted to be fair and honest in connection with the whole case.  Again, I submit that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned that personal contact in cases of this kind should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I only want to say, in conclusion, that if the Minister is not in a position to make a more satisfactory arrangement than he has indicated in his reply to-day I can see no other way of calling attention to cases of which I have and will have personal knowledge than by putting down questions in this House, and by raising, night after night, here on the adjournment, individual cases which I can stand over and which I believe would not be dealt with in the proper manner otherwise.</P>
    <P>I hope that we are going to have from the Minister some assurance <Col N="2057" /> that the fullest possible facilities will be given in any cases of this kind, and that the rigour indicated both in these regulations and in his answer to-day will be relaxed in the interests of all concerned, with the end in view of giving a full, complete and satisfactory hearing to the people who are concerned in cases of this kind, and who have no other way to make the representations necessary in order to sustain their applications.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice a case which occurred in my constituency.  This is the case of an old lady who, when she made a claim, filled up the usual forms.  That claim was rejected apparently on the grounds that there was not proper evidence of age.  In this particular district the Baptismal Register was not kept at the time. I understand that compulsory registration was not enacted until 1864, and the census returns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The census returns before 1901 were destroyed, and I am told that the only way to prove age is by reference to the census returns of 1901 to 1911.  When the Registrar was approached to have this claim investigated the people were informed that these registers were not open to the public, and I am informed that that is the only way in this particular case in which the age can actually be proved.  I would like to bring that to the Minister's notice.  In other words, the form was filled in and the claim rejected through lack of information and the registers which are the only means of proving the age are not open to the inspection of the claimants.</P>

Having no party affiliations I think I might truthfully say I am one of the Deputies in this House who gives the least trouble to Government Departments, either by personal call or otherwise.  I do say that a more outrageous idea than the one introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to shut out the representatives of the people from advocating the cases of the poorest type of their constituents, I have never heard in my life.  This is not a question that should be discussed on a motion for the adjournment. It is a question that must be dealt with in the light of the administration of Local Government in this House.  In my experience of all the Ministries there is none that requires the attention of the elected representatives of the people so much as the Ministry of Local Government. The people's representatives need to keep their eye on that Ministry.  That Ministry is at present drifting into a state when the term &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; is a misnomer.  There is no such thing as Local Government in this country and every day in this House we are learning the lesson that Local Government has ceased.</P>

The Ministry of Local <Col N="2059" /> Government has set itself up as a barrier between the representatives of the people and their constituents. I do not want to go into particular cases, but if anybody else belonging to one of the larger Parties in this House does, I hope that a motion will be put on paper when we sit here next February to consider the whole question of local government and the manner in which it is carried on.  I do not see for the life of me why the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should bring in a barrier of this sort&mdash;a barrier shutting out the representatives of the poor people in the country from access to the officials administering the old age pensions.  The time has come, and this motion has brought it to a head, when I hope this House will have to take into consideration the whole system of local government as administered under the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up any of the time left to the Minister to reply, but I would like to point out that this is the one particular Department where the intervention of Deputies is most needed. As Deputy Murphy has pointed out, the old age pension claimants are not practically, in the majority of cases, able to put their cases properly forward.  I must say that in the case of inspectors down the country I do not know what instructions they have received.  I am sorry that Deputy Murphy did not succeed in getting a reply from the Minister as to the instructions the inspectors do receive.  I am sure if the people knew the instructions the inspectors had received, or the instructions that they are getting, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would get such a doing from public opinion that he would be hunted out of the Front Bench.  I ask the Minister if that order has also applied to defeated candidates for Parliamentary honours.  If it does, I would wish that he would pass on that advice to other Ministers on the Front Bench so that they could act likewise.</P>

If the Minister is prepared to face that, we have no grumble with regard to it.

      <P>My function in this matter is to see that the work of dealing with old age pension appeals is dealt with systematically and fairly and in every way that will command public confidence. If expense is caused in another direction because of our doing this work in the best possible way, well, I have to repudiate responsibility for it; it has to be and it must be. Let us consider what the position is.  A person makes an application for a pension in the usual form. Normally the application form goes to the pensions officer first.  He investigates it and makes a report on each case to the pensions committee. The local pensions committee considers the application and considers the report of the pensions officer.  The committee decides the case in the presence of the applicant, allowing the applicant to supplement the facts.  At any rate, the committee is there&mdash;a certain number of people specially constituted in the locality for the purpose of considering the facts carefully and for the purpose of helping the applicant in every way to bring out the facts so that they may consider them.  There are, therefore, brought out the facts by the applicant on the one hand in as complete a fashion as possible, with all the help the local committee can give, and the facts as put forward by the pensions officer on the other hand, if he controverts the applicant's facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No case against the applicant comes to the Department complete details of which are not before the pensions committee and there is not before the deciding officer any statement of facts against the applicant from the pensions officer which is not available to the local pensions committee below.  How Deputies can suggest that they do not know what the facts of a case are when they come to argue for, say, the granting of a pension, I do not know. How they can make that statement in the light of the facts as I have now put them forward, it is difficult to understand.  As I have said, all the facts that come before the deciding <Col N="2064" /> officer are known to the local pensions committee.  The adjudication is on a statement of facts.  When each case comes before the deciding officer he has to decide that case on the facts placed before him.  If there are difficulties he can communicate directly with the claimant, and very often does, with a view to helping the claimant out in the presentation of his case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The following statement contains the details asked for as far as it is practicable to summarise the information.  I would also refer the Deputy to the information contained in the Department's Annual Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Poultry Demonstrators:&mdash; Save for the instructors in poultry-keeping employed by the county <Col N="1908" /> committees of agriculture, there are no such officers specially appointed for poultry work.  The thirteen junior marketing inspectors employed principally in connection with the egg trade deal also with the marketing of agricultural produce generally, including poultry. Four of them (ladies) specially conversant with the poultry trade give instruction to traders and their employees in the killing, plucking, grading and packing of poultry for export, and in the winter hold classes at suitable centres for the training of people in the business of fattening and marketing poultry. These classes, which are attended by two pupils each, were instituted in the winter of 1926-27.  Sixteen pupils have so far been trained.</P>
    <P>(2) and (3) Cow-Testing Instructors and Supervisors:&mdash;Fifteen cow-testing instructors are employed by the Department in connection with schemes of encouraging improvement in dairy cattle, and for the registration of pure-bred dairy cattle.  Their duties include the promotion of cow-testing associations, the superintendence of the work of the local supervisors employed by the associations, the checking of the associations' records, the paying of visits to herds owned by members of the associations with a view to ascertaining whether milk weighings are being regularly made and recorded, and, if necessary, making check weighings of the morning and evening yields of the cows under test.  They make periodical visits for check-weighing the morning and evening yields, and taking samples of the milk, of pedigree dairy cattle which are being tested.  Subject to the exigencies of their other work, they deliver lectures on cow-testing, and in the management and feeding of dairy cattle, at the general meetings of the cow-testing associations, or at meetings held for the establishment of new associations.  Their visiting work is of so constant and recurrent a character that the keeping of detailed particulars thereof would not justify the requisite labour and expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> Approximately 240 supervisors are employed by the cow-testing associations.  Their duties include the keeping of the associations' records, and the periodical visiting of the members for check-weighing and sampling purposes.  For reasons similar to those already indicated no detailed record is kept of the work done by these local employees.</P>
    <P>(4) and (5).  Agricultural Overseers and Assistant Overseers.&mdash; There are 4 agricultural overseers and 57 assistant agricultural overseers in the Department's service. The duties of assistant agricultural overseers consist in giving advice and instruction to small holders in the congested districts as to the best method of working their holdings, including the general cultivation and management of their land, the care and treatment of live stock, the spraying of potatoes, the use of suitable seeds and manures and the erection of fencing and outhouses. They arrange for the distribution to smallholders of selected seeds and manures at specially reduced prices, and for the placing with approved applicants of pure-bred bulls and rams to be used for the service of animals belonging to the small-holders. They also arrange for experiments and the laying down of plots to demonstrate the value of improved strains of seeds and of artificial manures, and for the distribution of trees and shrubs in connection with the county committees' tree-planting scheme.</P>
    <P>The agricultural overseers are responsible for the supervision of the work done by their assistants.  Their services are required when any new schemes are formulated, and frequently their advice is sought by other departments when their local knowledge would be helpful in the administration of schemes by those departments.  Each assistant overseer pays on an average 2,000 visits to farmers' residences during the course of a year.  The average number of demonstration plots laid down by an assistant overseer in the year is 117.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> (6)  Potato Inspectors.  &mdash; Except for six men engaged temporarily each year as spraying demonstrators in the congested districts, the only officers employed by the Department in connection with potato cultivation are 18 inspectors.  Twelve of these officers are employed on development work, comprising the inspection and certification of growing crops intended for seed purposes; arranging with merchants for the sale, sealing of bags, etc.; supervision of the grading and packing of table potatoes to ensure that they are sent out in sound marketable condition; advice to growers as to varieties in best demand; up-to-date methods of cultivation, introduction of fresh seed; and generally the fostering of improved business methods between farmers and merchants, so as to facilitate the collection of bulk orders.</P>
    <P>Five inspectors are engaged in enforcing the provisions of the Department's Orders for the control of black scab disease, inspecting growing crops to ensure that only varieties immune to black scab are planted, preventing the movement of potatoes from the infected districts to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; areas, and inspecting potatoes for shipment with a view to certifying same in regard to immunity and marketable condition.</P>
    <P>One inspector is engaged in the testing of new varieties of potatoes, and the production, by a system of selection, of improved stocks of existing varieties.</P>
    <P>The number of farms visited by potato inspectors is not recorded. Their work lies entirely among farmers and potato merchants, and comprises no class work, or theoretical instruction.  The work is entirely practical, and inspectors are required to demonstrate in the field any method which they recommend to farmers.</P>
    <P>Experiments carried out by potato inspection staff includes the testing of varieties for immunity to black scab at one centre, the testing of new varieties for cropping capacity and general suitability at two centres, and testing the effect of <Col N="1911" /> varying climatic and soil conditions on potato yields at five centres.</P>
