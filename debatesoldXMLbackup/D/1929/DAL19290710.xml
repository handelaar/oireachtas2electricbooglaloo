      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="603" /> Finance if he is aware that officials of the Revenue Department have been and are demanding, threatening to demand, compute or assess compound interest or simple interest on arrears of tax or upon income not previously assessed for income tax, and, if so, if he will state by what authority, statutory or otherwise, and with what object this is being done; if he can state approximately what sums have been collected by such methods; if such demands have been wrongfully made whether any such moneys thus obtained will be refunded, and if steps will be taken to prevent the future demand or collection of moneys in such cases by such methods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch (for the Minister for Finance) Mr. Lynch (for the Minister for Finance)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 222 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, provides that &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners may, in their discretion, mitigate any fine or penalty or stay or compound any proceedings for recovery thereof.&rdquo; When a taxpayer has rendered himself liable to proceedings for penalties under the Income Tax Acts it is obvious that the Revenue Commissioners, in considering the question of mitigation, must take account of all the relevant circumstances, including in particular the extent to which the taxpayer has profited by his fraud or neglect in unassessed duty and interest thereon.  The following case, which is an actual example, illustrates the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners deal with these cases:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A taxpayer made fraudulent income tax returns from 1922-3 to 1927-8.  The maximum penalties recoverable in respect of these years amounted to £6,068, in addition to which the sum of £643 was recoverable by means of additional assessments for the six years.  It was found on investigation that the total duty lost from 1914-15 to 1927-28, inclusive, amounted to £1.240 and interest thereon to £456.  The Revenue Commissioners accepted the sum of £2,000 in full settlement, including the amount of £643 recoverable by additional assessments; <Col N="604" /> so that the mitigated penalty imposed amounted to £1,357, instead of the full penalties amounting to £6,068.</P>
    <P>In this and all similar cases there is, of course, no interest in fact collected, and the payments made may be regarded in strict law as including duty only to the extent to which such duty could be recovered by the ordinary process of assessment. The balance of the payment in excess of the duty recoverable by assessment is a payment of a penalty pure and simple.  The duty for earlier years and the interest have simply come in indirectly as factors which the Commissioners have taken into consideration in determining the amount of the penalty.</P>
    <P>The practice of the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the question of the mitigation of income tax penalties is one of very long standing and there is nothing new or revolutionary about it.  It was specifically discussed in the High Court in England in the case of Attorney-General v. Johnstone, and was emphatically approved by the judge who dealt with the case.  I am having a leaflet containing a copy of the judgment placed in the Library for the information of Deputies interested in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is one further point to which I desire to refer so as to obviate any misunderstanding.  In the course of the question the Deputy refers to the assessing of interest on &ldquo;arrears of tax or upon income not previously assessed to income tax&rdquo;. Arrears of taxes which have been assessed, i.e., unpaid duties outstanding in respect of assessments which were made at the proper time, are in a totally different category from the matter with which I have been dealing. Such duties must, of course, be paid whatever the year to which they relate.  There is no question of computing or demanding interest on such arrears.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="605" /> Finance if it is by his authority that persons who have been assessed for and paid income tax are now being asked for returns for periods so far back as 40 and 60 years, and if these returns are not being asked for with the authority of the Minister, if he will take steps to have the demand for same withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained in answer to question No. 3 on to-day's Order Paper, it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners when considering the mitigation of income tax penalties to have regard to the amount of duty evaded, i.e., the amount which the taxpayer has gained through his fraud or neglect, and it is customary in such cases to invite the taxpayer to furnish information to enable the Revenue Commissioners to ascertain such relevant facts.  He can, of course, if he chooses, drop the question of mitigation of penalties and allow the Commissioners to proceed for the full penalties incurred.</P>
      <P>It may be stated, however, that it is not the usual practice of the Revenue Commissioners, even for the purpose of considering mitigation of penalties, to request returns for anything like 40 years.  There might be an odd case in which the circumstances necessitated such a course, but the Revenue Commissioners have no knowledge of any such case.  If the Deputy will be good enough to furnish me with particulars of any specific case he has in mind, I will have the matter considered with a view to ascertaining whether an adequate knowledge of the circumstances could not be gained from a review covering a very much shorter period.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that income tax on property is being demanded from persons other than the then existing landlords for the years 1914-1922 in respect of houses and premises in Saorstát Eireann, and that the collection of same is accompanied by threats of distraint, threats <Col N="606" /> of collection by warrant directed to the sheriff and threats of collection under the procedure prescribed by the Income Tax Act, 1924, and, whether it is intended to enforce these threats against the present occupiers of these buildings from whom payment has for the first time been sought in this present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle is that Property Tax (Income Tax Schedule A) is recoverable on the property irrespective of a change of ownership (Income Tax Act, 1918, Section 199, and Schedule A, No. VII., Rule 3).  This principle is well known to the legal profession, and solicitors acting for purchasers of property usually safeguard their clients by obtaining an allowance from the purchase price in respect of any Property Tax outstanding on the property.  As the Deputy is aware, the Revenue Commissioners have no power to discharge duty legally assessed and for which a legal means of recovery exists.  If, however, he will be good enough to furnish me with particulars of any specific cases he has in mind, I will have them looked into.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state by what statutory or other authority taxpayers who have paid income tax under Schedule D, upon the profits of their trade or business, for periods prior to 5th April, 1922, upon assessment made by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax upon appeal, are now being asked to obtain and furnish full accounts properly audited as from 1914, and including the years for which they had previously been assessed by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax on appeal, and in respect of the income from the trade or business upon which they have already been assessed and paid income tax for the same years.</P>

      <P>The answers which I have already given to Questions 3 and 4 on to-day's Order Paper furnish to a great extent the information <Col N="607" /> which the Deputy desires.  As I have indicated, where a taxpayer has made incorrect income tax returns in recent years, and has thereby laid himself open to proceedings for penalties, the Revenue Commissioners cannot determine the extent to which such penalties should be mitigated without having before them satisfactory evidence as to the extent to which the taxpayer has profited by his fraud or neglect.  If the taxpayer does not wish to furnish such evidence, it is open to him to refuse to provide the material for settling the matter out of court and to allow the Revenue Commissioners to take proceedings for the full penalties incurred.  If appeals have been heard by the Special Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners have reason to suppose that incorrect evidence was given or material evidence withheld in connection with such appeals, they would be failing in their duty if they agreed to mitigate penalties without clearing up this question. In this connection I may quote the following remarks made by the Minister in the course of the debate on the Revenue Estimates last year:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I mentioned that I had lately a case brought to my notice where a man was giving a good deal of trouble over the production of information in regard to sums on deposit in the banks.  Here is what happened.  He was in a comparatively small town where there were a number of banks, and he produced a certificate from a bank manager that he had no deposit account, but after further investigation it transpired he had withdrawn money that was on deposit in that particular bank a few days before the appeal meeting of the Special Commissioners, that he had held the cash until after the hearing of the appeal. and then re-lodged it.  Further investigations disclosed that he had both a deposit account and a current account in every other bank in the town, and that he had deposits in the names of his wife <Col N="608" /> and daughter.  There were, in fact, eight deposit accounts in all. No doubt, that is the type of gentleman who could go to the Deputy and tell him about the dreadful iniquities of the income tax officials.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A search order was issued on the 21st May last under the Firearms Act, 1925, authorising the search of the house at Inchintray, Cahireiveen, occupied by one Denis Curran.  When the party of police to whom the execution of the order was entrusted called at the house, Mrs. Kate Curran explained that Denis Curran, the former rated occupier, was dead. The police then withdrew without having conducted any search of the house.</P>

      <P>The section of the Museum buildings available for the display of (a) the general mineralogical collections, and (b) the special collection of Irish geological specimens was in use until recently for the purposes of the Dáil restaurant, kitchen, buffet, etc.  It is hoped that these rooms will be restored at an early date for Museum use, when arrangements will be made for the exhibition therein of the geological specimens that were placed in store when part of the Museum was appropriated <Col N="613" /> for use in connection with the work of Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the marine and other specimens referred to in part (c) of the question are unsuitably housed.  I am informed that the Commissioners of Public Works have agreed to the provision of a new spirit store, but that it will not be possible to have the necessary works completed this year.  (d) It is hoped to appoint an assistant to take charge of the Geological Collections of the Museum in the coming financial year.  (e) As soon as arrangements are completed for the restoration of the Museum annexe to my Department, and for the display therein of the Geological Collections, it will be necessary to provide access between the annexe and the main Museum buildings, but I am unable to say when this will be done.</P>

The temperature of the place where it is kept is far too high.  In view of the interest taken in geology by a large number of students in the secondary schools in this country, especially in my own county, I hope the Minister will see that immediate action is taken in regard to the housing of the specimens and the proper arrangement of them.

      <P>My Department cannot find any record of a proposal to erect a school at Gurthacoola thirty-six years ago.  I am not in a position to require that the building of a new school shall be undertaken in any district.</P>
      <P>Where I am satisfied that the necessity for a school exists, a grant normally two-thirds of the expenditure may be made by my Department, under defined conditions, towards the cost of erecting a school on the application of the parish priest, local clergyman, or other person whom my Department would be prepared to recognise as patron or manager of a National School.</P>
      <P>The parish priest who is manager of the National Schools in the district has been consulted in this case. He is of opinion that, as the school-going population will decline in number in the near future, expenditure on the erection of a new school building would not be warranted, and suggests that, owing to the existence of rights-of-way, Mass-paths and short-cuts for the children affected to the existing National Schools, the educational facilities afforded are reasonably sufficient.  In the circumstances my Department is having further enquiry made in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he will state the cause of the delay in vesting under the Land Act, 1923, the 113,969 acres which are still pending for sale under this Act in the county of Kerry, and if it is correct that only 5,044 acres were vested in Kerry, under this Act, up to April 17th, 1929, and whether he will now consent to transfer some of the existing officers in the Land Annuities Collecting Department to the Purchases Department, and thus expedite the division of land in the county of Kerry.</P>

      <P>The area stated by the Deputy as having been vested in County Kerry up to the date mentioned is correct, in so far as it refers to tenanted land coming under the provisions of the Land Acts, 1923-7, but, in addition, up to the end of June last, 3,490 acres of untenanted land in County Kerry <Col N="622" /> have been vested in the Land Commission under these Acts, and in respect of estates which were being sold and not dealt with under the Irish Land Acts, 1903-9 at the date of the transfer of the Land Commission to the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  135,136 acres in County Kerry have been vested in purchasers by the Land Commission since 1st April, 1923.</P>
      <P>In dealing with estates of tenanted land under the Land Act, 1923-7, the work of the Land Commission had of necessity, up to the present, to follow the order of the lodgment of maps and schedules of particulars by owners over the whole twenty-six counties of the Saorstát.  The Land Commission had no means of regulating the lodgments and the earlier lodgments were first taken up.</P>
      <P>As a part of the rearrangement of the work of the Land Commission which is at present in progress, it is intended to take cognisance of counties which are backward as regards the unvested holdings, and now that practically all the lodgments have been made, it is hoped that this can be done with better results than hitherto.  Every effort is being made to speed up the vesting of tenanted land generally, and the Bill at present before the Dáil is one of the means to that end.</P>
      <P>There can be no question of transferring staff to the Purchase Branch from the Collection Branch, as the Collection staff is barely sufficient to cope with the volume of collecting work, and the collection of annuities in the County Kerry is especially troublesome, and requires more than normal attention and expenditure.</P>

With this end in view the holding of a man named James Kelleher, who has applied for a transfer to the Midlands, has been inspected to ascertain whether it would be suitable for Mrs. Cronin, but the arrangement, if found to be feasible, could not be completed before the Recess, as it will involve two migrations, and will depend on whether it is possible to find a suitable holding for James Kelleher.</P>

      <P>That the Cobh (Queenstown) Gas Order, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before the Dáil on Friday, the 5th day of July, 1929, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cobh (Queenstown) Gas Order, 1929, is for the purpose of authorising a reconstruction of the existing capital and the raising of additional <Col N="640" /> capital.  The Queenstown Gas Company operated under a private Act passed in 1879, the capital of the Company and its borrowing powers being defined by that Act and by the Capital Issues Consent Order made in 1921.  The financial powers were confined to the issue of shares to the amount of £25,000 and to borrowings to the additional amount of £12,500.  The Company appears to have been hampered in its development by the financial restrictions imposed, and accordingly it is proposed to make an Order in the form submitted, with the object of conferring revised financial powers within the following limits:&mdash;(a) To convert the existing shares into £20,500 Consolidated Stock; (b) to create and issue additional stock from time to time as required up to the maximum amount of £25,000; (c) to raise by borrowing, for special purposes up to an amount not exceeding one-half the value of the paid-up stock.  The opportunity has been taken to include in the Order a number of general provisions which appear in practically all modern private Acts and Orders for the purpose of defining the powers of and the obligations on the Company. The prices chargeable by the Company for gas supplied are required by the Order to be those prescribed for the time being by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the provisions of Section 1 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.</P>

    <P>That the proceedings on the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st day of March, 1930, in Committee on Finance and on Report, on the Resolution, in Committee on Finance and on Report, for the issue out of the Central Fund of the sum necessary to make good the supply granted for the service of the year <Col N="641" /> ending on the 31st March, 1930, and on the five stages of the Appropriation Bill, 1929, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, July 10th, 1929, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion: Provided that after the said hour on the said day a Question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment, nor upon any motion other than a motion necessary to bring the proceedings forthwith to a conclusion and then only when moved by the Government: Provided, further, that on the Report of the Resolutions of the Committee on Finance, in respect of the several Estimates for the year &mdash;ending 31st March, 1930, only one Question shall be put from the Chair, namely, That the Dáil agrees with the Committee on Finance in the said Resolutions, and that, in Committee on the Appropriation Bill, 1929, only one Question shall be put from the Chair, namely, That the several Sections, Schedules, stand part of, and that the Title be the Title to, the Bill.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, when moving that the hour of adjournment be extended from 10.30 p.m. to 8 a.m.  I said that the Appropriation Bill should pass this House in time to allow 21 days for consideration by the Seanad.  During the early part of this session the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had the question of Estimates before them.  There are something like 65 Estimates to be considered.  They take up something like 100 hours of Parliamentary time each year.  To date, something over 100 hours&mdash;I think, approximately, 109 hours&mdash;have been so occupied.  There was an understanding or general acceptance that the House should conclude discussion of Estimates about the 20th June, provided that every Thursday was devoted to the consideration of Estimates.  So far as the provision of every Thursday up to 20th of June for Estimates is concerned, that understanding was slightly <Col N="642" /> altered, but a sufficient amount of time was allowed to make up for any alteration that might have taken place.  Allowing for the length of time which will elapse between this and 10 o'clock to-night, more than the normal number of hours have been provided for the consideration of Estimates.  It is, therefore, not an unusual step to bring the consideration of Estimates to a close.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the President would inform us as to the real reason for this motion. Is it mainly for the purpose of conveniencing the Seanad?  Is it for the purpose of enabling the Dáil to adjourn this week?  Or is it for the purpose of preventing proper discussion of the remaining Estimates? If the President would reveal his heart to the Dáil, I think he would say that the last was the main reason.  I do not know upon what ground he assumes that because the Estimates passed through this House in 100 hours of Parliamentary time when there was no real Opposition in the House, necessarily it will only take the same time now when there is a real Opposition here.  It is in the discussion of the Estimates that Deputies get an opportunity of criticising the administration of the Government. The one design of the Executive Council seems to be to prevent them getting a proper opportunity of criticism.  I do not know if they think they are above criticism, or if they think the criticism they will get from this Party need not be taken seriously.  But the design appears to be to avoid criticism in any case, whether they find it inconvenient or politically injurious to them.  I think that the whole attitude of the Government towards public business at the end <Col N="643" /> of this session indicates that their respect for democratic institutions and their working is very slight. If the Government were really anxious to reduce the volume of business before the Dáil to permit of the Dáil adjourning early, then the obvious course would have been to withhold the numerous Bills which they rushed in with at the last minute.  I take it that these Bills were rushed in at the last minute for the very same reason that the discussion on the Estimates is to be curtailed&mdash;to prevent proper examination of them by Deputies.  Assuming that the Government, as I suggested in a previous discussion, believe that if they could govern by decree and without Parliamentary discussion they would do much better, why do they not say so?  Instead of doing what they are actually achieving by trickery, they should do it by an open and honest amendment to the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am smiling at the very naïve excuse which the President has advanced to the House for moving the closure on the Estimates at this stage.  He stated that last year the discussion on the Estimates occupied 100 hours of Parliamentary time, and that this year it has occupied 109 hours.  He did not explain to the House how much of the excess was due to the fact that on the Land Commission Vote the sole purpose of the Government was to waste time in order to avoid a division being taken on that Estimate.  He did not explain to the House that at the beginning of the session Deputies were brought here for one day only in two successive weeks and sent home again because the Government had not enough business for them to do.  If we could have got the Estimates at that stage we could have discussed them and given them all the consideration that was necessary.  It seems to me, in view of the fact that <Col N="644" /> the Government did waste time at the beginning of the session, they ought to extend the time now in order to give the House an opportunity not only of considering the Estimates, but, as Deputy Lemass said, of considering, also, the large amount of legislation that the Government is now proposing.  The statute book is littered with amending Bills, amending mistakes in legislation which the Government made when they introduced particular measures.</P>

      <P>The President in moving this motion mentioned that the Appropriation Bill had to pass the House prior to a certain day. Deputies realise that, but, at the same time, the President should admit that if the House had met on Tuesdays, as it is empowered to do under the Standing Orders, there would be no necessity to rush the Estimates as they are being rushed at present.  The President also remarked that already the normal number of hours had been provided with regard to the Estimates, and he mentioned 109 hours as having been spent upon them.  There is one Estimate&mdash;Fisheries&mdash;which has not yet been discussed and which I consider is very important and should not be rushed through the House. As the President knows, there is great dissatisfaction amongst fishermen owing to the way in which that Department has dealt with the fisheries during the past year.  In addition to that, this Department is also responsible for putting into operation the recommendations contained in the White Paper dealing with the Gaeltacht Commission. Deputies should not be curtailed in any criticism or suggestions that they may have to make in respect of this particular Vote.  The President, instead of curtailing the time of the House, should, if necessary, allow the House to sit on next week and give time to have the Fisheries Department fully discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We have had the usual stock opposition this afternoon to resolutions of this sort to <Col N="645" /> bring business to a conclusion towards the end of the session. Deputy Lemass asked whether we were in a hurry to get away, whether it was to convenience the Seanad or whether it was trickery to avoid discussion.  I do not know whether the Deputy knows the conditions appertaining to the Central Fund Act passed in March.  The supply granted under that Act will last only to the 1st August.  The Deputy is aware that on and after the first day of August no money can leave the Exchequer for any purpose whatsoever, because the Vote on Account was for four months only.  Therefore, if the services of the country are to be carried on, the Appropriation Bill requires to be passed and must be law before the 1st August.  Then he wanted to know whether it was to convenience the Seanad.  Under the Constitution, a Money Bill leaving this House is not subject to amendment by the Seanad.  The Seanad can make recommendations in respect of any of its provisions and these recommendations must be received here within twenty-one days.  If this Bill leaves this House to-morrow, then by 1st August it will automatically become law.  The recommendations of the Seanad can be considered in the meantime, but the Bill cannot be held up any longer than the difference in time between the 10th July and 1st August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One-hundred-and-nine hours have already been given this year to the discussion of the Estimates.  Note that there is a marked difference between &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; and &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;<Col N="646" /> of the Estimates.  Deputy MacEntee smiles because he himself discussed the Estimates at some length and knows well that while he was discussing them no one was considering them.  The same applies to other Deputies opposite. There is as much anxiety on the part of the Deputy opposite and his friends both on the front and back benches to get away and get finished with parliamentary work as there is by those on the Government Benches, the difference being that Deputies on this side of the House wish to do their work well while Deputies opposite wish to pose as if they were doing it well.  Deputy Cassidy has got from 4 o'clock this afternoon until 10 o'clock to-night to discuss this Fisheries Estimate.  Has any time been wasted on the discussion of the Estimates?  On one occasion, it was so patent that we were not devoting the whole of our time to the consideration of the Estimates that the question was moved: &ldquo;That the question be now put.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee, I think, will admit that the consideration of the Estimates does not depend on the amount of time devoted to their discussion.  We could have done as much business in a shorter time by a more pithy discussion. I am not drawing any distinction between the Opposition to-day and the Opposition in times when it was smaller in numbers, but I would say, for my own part, that I had to pay more attention to the Estimates when the discussion depended upon a smaller number of Deputies in Opposition than I have now.</P>

      <P>This Estimate for the expenses of administration of the sea and inland fisheries and for the carrying on of rural industries differs little from that presented to the House last year.  It does not give evidence of that resuscitation and development of the fishing industry which the Government and Deputies desire and towards the realisation of which I shall shortly <Col N="652" /> introduce a Bill, the main outlines of which have received the approval of the Executive Council but some of the details of which still require settlement.  The proposals in the Bill will involve, at a later date, my laying before the House a Supplementary Estimate for these services.</P>
      <P>Deputies will see that the principal variations in this Estimate as compared with that for last year are an increase of £3,320 in Sub-head A for salaries, a decrease of £3,970 in sub-head E for fishery services, and a fall of £1,965 in the sum estimated to be realised under Sub-head 1, Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The increase in the provision for salaries is accounted for by the recent appointment of a Secretary of the reconstituted Department which now embraces the Land Commission and the old Department of Fisheries. This is an additional post and it is the intention that this officer should be sufficiently free from the routine work of this large Department to devote his undivided attention to certain necessary tasks of reorganisation and to the carrying out of the Government decisions embodied in the White Paper on the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission. A small sum has been taken for additional staff to assist him in these duties but Deputies will appreciate that some of the decisions in the White Paper involve the carrying out of schemes of considerable magnitude and that as the plans for these mature it will be necessary to come to this House for further Votes either for my Department or for other Departments concerned in carrying out these schemes.  I shall have something to say later as to what has already been done in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discharge of the duty which the Government have placed upon me of seeing that the decisions in the White Paper are carried into effect, I have the assistance of a Committee, including very able officers of high standing in other Departments, the activities of which affect the Gaeltacht, for the purpose of coordinating these activities in the <Col N="653" /> Gaeltacht, and I am glad to bear testimony to the zeal and enthusiasm with which that Committee has tackled its work and to the very great assistance afforded to me by the technical knowledge and experience of its members.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the sub-head for Fishery Services is apparent rather than real because certain items included under this sub-head last year are now comprised in Vote No. 11&mdash; Office of Public Works.  If Deputies will turn to page 51 of the Estimates Book they will find provision made there for fishery stores and stations, £750; hatcheries and fishery lodges, £420; making a total of £1,170; and on page 46 they will see £1,000 set down for the dredging of fishery harbours, thus accounting for £2,170 of the £3,970, and the balance represents a reduction in the sum proposed for the purchase of fishery requisites and the elimination of £1,100 which was voted last year for the organisation of fishermen but was not availed of.  Deputies will understand from what I shall have to say later on the reasons for these two reductions.</P>
    <P>The item of grants to Boards of Conservators and Local Fisheries Associations which last year appeared as one item has this year been divided under two headings.</P>
    <P>I should call attention to a clerical error in the item, &ldquo;Office Accommodation&rdquo; (Vote 11) in the footnote on page 230 of the Estimates Book.  The figure of £13,303 as shown includes £5,491 for the Land Commission, which Deputies will see is also debited in the footnote relating to that Department on page 225.  Then there is a sum of £7,020 in respect of Fisheries and Rural Industries for items which last year appeared on this Vote and which, as I have explained, are this year borne on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  The total for &ldquo;Office Accommodation,&rdquo; therefore, for the Fisheries Office for the current financial year is £792 as compared with last year's figure of £442, the increase being explained mainly by a provision of £250 for <Col N="654" /> the installation of electric lighting in the offices in Kildare Place.</P>
    <P>I propose that there should be set up a Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association which will in future deal with the supply of boats and gear and will be in a position to assist the fishermen in the marketing of their catch.  Normally the Central Council will conduct the business of the Association, but having regard to the fact that this will be an entirely new departure, and that there will be a variety of problems to be tackled at the outset of the Association's career, the Government will assist the Association in securing competent men, and my Department will place at its disposal any advice or expert assistance which it may require in its initial years.  The coast will be divided into regional areas which will elect representatives to a Central Council.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Association will deal with the provision of boats.  Before saying how it is proposed that this should in future be done, I think I ought to correct a widespread but erroneous belief that the fishing community have habitually in the past failed in the discharge of their obligations for loans for the purchase of boats.</P>
    <P>There are no fair grounds for that suspicion.  In March, 1913, when a very large number of loans had been made by the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture, aggregating very large sums, the total instalments in arrear amounted to £3,615 in the case of the Congested Districts Board, and £1,945 in the case of the Department of Agriculture These figures do not represent bad debts, but the instalments which had fallen due at that date and had not been promptly paid.  After that normal, pre-war year came the war and conditions greatly changed. The equipment of the fishery folk increased very greatly in price.  At the same time the fish increased greatly in value and during the whole war period the fishermen paid their way.  In 1919 the arrears <Col N="655" /> on loans stood at something under £3,000.  Then came the post-war slump.  The price of fish fell very considerably.  During the time of high prices the fishermen had bought very dear boats and they found themselves saddled with a burden which they were not able to meet.</P>
    <P>The position is now that the arrears of loans stand at £120,000. The whole blame for this state of affairs cannot be justly laid on the shoulders of the fishermen.  If the proposals to which I have referred had been in operation during the period from 1914 to 1919, a much greater part of the high earnings would have been used for the purpose of discharging the purchase prices of the boats and for creating the necessary reserves for their upkeep. While I do not go so far as to say that they would be a complete remedy for the similar ills which might follow another upheaval of that sort, I do say that they would greatly mitigate them.  During 1914 to 1919 the fishermen paid their way. That is to say, they paid their instalments normally as they fell due. They did not attempt to pay off their liabilities when they were getting the high prices.  They merely paid their way.  If the proposals to which I refer now had been in operation during that time, probably the total loans would be cleared off.  Boats will, under my proposals, be supplied to competent fishermen who apply for them.</P>
    <P>There will be no necessity for the fishermen desiring to own a boat to obtain securities for the repayment of the cost of the boat, a requirement which in the past has constituted a real difficulty and has imposed on well-disposed guarantors a liability which, in my opinion, the nation cannot reasonably expect them to undertake.  The repayments will be secured in another and, I think, a more satisfactory way.  The fish caught by any boat provided by the Association will, so long as there is any part of its cost remaining unpaid, be marketed under the supervision <Col N="656" /> of the Association.  The Association will retain the greater part of the share of the catch ordinarily taken by the owner and will hand over the remainder, so that the fishermen will get the share which they have always got, and the owner, if he is a fisherman, will get that share and the part of the owner's share which is not retained.  It is, in my opinion, axiomatic that a fisherman-owner cannot be expected to pay more for his boat in any given period than the boat, properly managed, will earn.  He will be relieved of the constant anxiety which has beset him in the past as to whether or not there will be sufficient money earned to meet the half-yearly instalment when it falls due.  In good seasons he will pay more; in bad seasons he will pay less.  The share of the earnings which is usually taken by the owner is based on long usage and experience, and I am satisfied that the part which it is proposed to retain will give the fund adequate security, while the principle which I have stated will enable the fisherman-owner to put to sea with a mind freed from financial uncertainty and with an incentive to devote all his energies to the pursuit of his calling.</P>
    <P>The money retained will be applied also to the insurance of the boat under a scheme of insurance against total loss and certain other risks and to the provision of a reserve for the repair and maintenance of the boat.  The latter provision, that the repair and upkeep of the boat, particularly in the case of a large boat, shall be foreseen and shall be provided against from the very outset of its career, is vitally important.  The expenses of repairs, instead of falling with crushing weight on the owner at intervals during the life of the boat, will be distributed over the whole period of its life.  In the early years, when little or no repair is needed, a sum will nevertheless be set aside and will accumulate against the day when, in the ordinary course of things, heavy repairs will be inevitable.  The Association will see that the boat is kept in good condition and there will <Col N="657" /> be an encouragement for the owner to take care of the boat, inasmuch as whatever is not spent out of the reserve will go towards the earlier liquidation of the purchase price of the boat.  Experience in the insurance of fishing boats against loss and damage in other countries has not been an entirely unchequered one, but I have provided safeguards which will, I think, take away any disinclination&mdash;if it should in any case arise&mdash;to use every effort to avoid or minimise loss or damage.</P>
    <P>Normally, the fisherman desiring to become the owner of a boat should be prepared to put up a part of the price of the boat in advance and this would ordinarily be a guarantee of good faith and good intention and a reasonable measure of security for the person supplying the boat.  It is common practice in every such transaction. The Government realise, however, that the state of the fishing industry is to-day far from normal and, therefore, while it will be part of the scheme that at least 20 per cent. of the cost shall be so advanced by the purchaser, this condition may during the first ten years be waived by the Association in the case of any fishermen about whose abilities and standing it is satisfied.  There is this necessary corollary, however, that if after the supply of a boat the Association is satisfied that the purchaser, through want of capacity or effort, does not show a prospect of paying for the boat in a reasonable time, they may take up the boat from him.</P>
    <P>It is necessary also to deal with the existing situation resulting from the abnormal conditions I have referred to, following the late European War.  Many loan-borrowers find themselves in a position in which they are saddled with obligations beyond their ability to pay.  Deputies will remember earlier discussions of this matter.  Following those discussions, certain decisions were come to, which meant a uniform writing down of the total obligations of the borrowers with reference to the dates at which the boats were supplied.  I always felt some misgivings about that arrangement, as to whether it <Col N="658" /> would result in rather unfair treatment as between individual cases. We have now a new proposal, that there should be a committee set up at once to investigate the circumstances of each case and to report. This is being done and the committee is being set up.  I think that, as a solution of the situation and as a purely business transaction, that is the preferable course in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>In Sub-head F of the Vote, the total provision for rural industries shows a small increase, but it will be seen that under the head &ldquo;development&rdquo; there is a decrease of some £3,000, accounted for by a reduction of £1,280 in the sum for wages and allowances and £1,700 in the sum for purchase of materials.</P>
    <P>I have had under careful review the position and character of these establishments which were taken over from the late Congested Districts Board.  They are chiefly devoted to the production of knitted goods such as cardigans, pullovers, etc., and of crochet work and lace-making. They were always regarded by the Congested Districts Board as mainly instructional in purpose, it being thought that by the training of a number of skilled workers the setting up of undertakings on a commercial basis might be encouraged. This anticipation has not, however, to any appreciable extent been realised.</P>
    <P>In the past the instructresses have been left in the position that they had themselves to find markets for their output in addition to the supervision of the manufacture, and this has always proved a very great burden and anxiety on them and has seriously impeded any prospect of putting the establishments on an economic basis.  It will be seen from a comparison of the sum of £18,320, being the cost of their upkeep, with the sum of £11,840 under the Appropriations-in-Aid expected to be realised, that they impose a very heavy annual burden on public funds.  I am taking steps radically to alter the position in regard to them.  They constitute, in my view <Col N="659" /> the nucleus of a very useful industrial organisation in the Gaeltacht, in which they are chiefly situate.  I am anxious to see it greatly expanded, but on the present basis of the heavy annual loss expansion would not be possible.  It would be only practicable if I could put the organisation on a self-supporting basis or on some footing more approaching that basis than is at present the case.  I propose to treat them not as instructional but as industrial establishments conducted on a factory basis.  There is, I am glad to say, a high degree of technical skill on the part of the trained workers and I have no grounds for misgiving as to the quality and the output of work of which the workers are capable.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, that they should be afforded access to larger and steadier markets and that the work of the establishments should be co-ordinated.  With these objects in view I am arranging to set up a central warehousing and selling depôt in Dublin with agents in this country and in other countries. Premises have already been secured for the purpose.  At this depôt the goods will be examined to ensure that they are free from defects and are properly made and finished.  The depôt will receive and distribute the orders.  Each establishment will be engaged in manufacturing a particular type of garment.  By standardising the work in this way I hope that greater skill will be acquired, resulting in a larger output per worker. I am also installing new machinery. I propose that the work should be regular and constant, and although the piece-work rates per operation may be less, I anticipate that the worker will receive a larger weekly wage.  The putting into operation of these changes will probably in some cases occasion some temporary dislocation and possibly some misunderstanding, but I am confident that, with patience, when they begin to have their full effect, they will result in giving the workers a feeling of greater confidence and, I hope, an increased reward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> One grave factor in the present situation in regard to these industries is the heavy drain by emigration on the trained workers.  In the past I am afraid the assistance which has been provided has been a means only of aiding emigration.  I hope that the provision of more constant and regular employment will do something to counteract that tendency. I propose also that the appointments as manageresses should in future be reserved as an avenue of improvement for the more competent workers.  In the past ladies from different parts of the country have been brought in to take charge and, while I highly appreciate the good work which has been done by these ladies in the establishment of these industries, and have no desire in any way to disturb the existing arrangements so far as they are concerned, I think that in the altered character of the undertakings, in which the work will be less responsible and less varied, future openings should be reserved for the workers in the classes, and for Irish-speaking girls especially.  When I say that the work will be less responsible and less varied I mean to convey that under the proposed arrangement the central depôt will attend to the marking and designing.  All that work will be taken from the shoulders of those in charge of the classes, and their work will be purely the supervision of the work of manufacture.</P>
    <P>Under this sub-head there is provision for the necessary instructions and materials for the revival of the Donegal tweed industry.  Deputies will be aware that this industry had almost disappeared as a result of the use of shoddy yarns during the European War.  The Gaeltacht Commission recommended that steps should be taken for its revival on a satisfactory footing with a Government stamp of quality and in a wider range of patterns more in keeping with modern demands.  There are in this matter two distinct schools of thought.  One school maintains that the demand for a tweed made from homespun yarns has ceased to <Col N="661" /> exist or there is a very limited demand and that if the industry is to be re-established on any broad foundation it must be on the basis of the use mainly of mill spun yarns.  The other school regards the use of anything but homespun as anathema.  I have so far declined to commit myself to either of these two dogmas. I am anxious to see the use of homespun yarns developed to the greatest possible extent as that industry provides more widespread employment for a greater number of workers.  It is said, however, by the experts that certain tweeds of a light weight for which there is a considerable demand in the United States and elsewhere cannot be produced from homespun yarns and certainly not from yarns spun from the wool of the black-faced sheep found in Donegal.  I am having experiments made to ascertain what is the lightest weight of material which can be woven with yarns spun in the cottages from the finer wools produced in other parts of this country.  I am anxious that no decision should be taken which will limit in any way the legitimate expansion of this industry which is so important to many of the people in the Gaeltacht and which, adequately developed, may confer very widespread benefits.  I am not, therefore, at present disposed to rule out entirely the use of mill spun yarns if certain cloths for which there is a demand can be made only from those yarns.</P>
    <P>A wide range of new designs has been prepared by the instructor at present stationed at Ardara, the centre of the industry in Donegal.  I am glad to say that large numbers of these designs have met with a very favourable reception in the quarters in which they have been exhibited. These have been made from mill spun yarns as local wool for home spinning was not available before the clip which has just now taken place.  There are certain difficulties in the way of reproducing the whole range of these designs in home spun yarns from the local wool quite apart from the question of the weight of the resultant material, but so far as practicable they will be reproduced <Col N="662" /> in home spuns.  All these operations are necessarily slow but they are essential preliminaries to the formulation of a complete scheme for the re-establishment and extension of the industry.  In the meantime I have made such temporary arrangements as will enable those weavers who are available to resume the making of the tweeds and to that extent the revival of the industry has already begun.</P>
    <P>The sum taken for loans for industrial purposes has been increased from £200 to £3,300.  This sum has been taken for the purpose of making advances to assist, by loans on approved security, private concerns establishing industries in the Gaeltacht or existing undertakings which it may be desired to expand. I have made certain proposals on the question of assistance to private industrial undertakings in the Gaeltacht and these are under examination by the Minister for Finance.  It may be convenient here for me to say something generally about what has been done in coordinating the work of all the Departments of State in the improvement of the economic conditions of the Gaeltacht.  Deputies will understand that many other Departments are concerned with actual schemes.  Attention having been called to the extent to which potatoes exceptionally liable to disease are still used for seed in Connemara and the Arran Islands, and to the absence of facilities for obtaining reliable seed potatoes here, the Department of Agriculture this spring undertook the provision and sale of a quantity of certified seed potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that these facilities were very widely availed of and that the step will go far to improve the position there in regard to this staple food of the people.  The provision of permanent facilities for the purchase of good seed in this area in which the usual trade facilities are not at present available is under consideration.  A <Col N="663" /> similar step was taken to supply seed potatoes in Tory Island, with the co-operation of the parish priest.  In view of the extent to which the families on this island are dependent on the fishing, and in view of the risk of distress should the fishing at any time fail, the question of providing some additional means of livelihood for some of the islanders is under examination. Steps have already been taken by the Department of Agriculture to improve the breed of cattle on the island.</P>
      <P>The question of transport to and from the islands off the mainland in order to mitigate the extent of their isolation is being investigated, and I hope that before next winter it will be possible to do something in this direction, in the cases of some of the islands at least.</P>
      <P>A scheme has been formulated by the Department of Agriculture for improving the breeds of poultry in the Gaeltacht so that a larger supply of eggs may be produced at those seasons when there is a scarcity and high prices prevail, This is a source of income in the Gaeltacht which is capable of considerable improvement and, although the scheme must be modest in its inception and must be slow in development, I regard its ultimate results as of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps have been taken by my Department this year to see whether the burning of kelp, which usually takes place about this period of the year, can be carried on in a manner which will produce more satisfactory results from the point of view of the gatherers of the weed, and of the buyers of the kelp, and whether in this way the value and price of the kelp can be improved.  This industry might, I think, if put on a more satisfactory footing than is at present the case, be of much greater value to the people along the coast, and I hope that as a result of the experimental work carried out this season it will be possible to take some measures to encourage the larger collection of the weed in <Col N="664" /> future seasons and better methods of burning.  The questions of reclamation and reafforestation in the Gaeltacht are under examination.  A very important and urgent question is that of the provision of improved housing.  This problem has been very carefully examined, and I shall, at the earliest possible date, introduce a Bill giving effect to proposals which have now been accepted by the Government.  There will be provision for grants for new buildings and for loans to supplement the grants where necessary.  It is the intention to deal, in the first instance, with the poorest and most unsatisfactory areas, and with the worst cases in those areas, and a preference will be given to those households in which Irish is the home language. I also propose that an effort should be made to assist the families to increase their earnings.  No new house will be provided unless there exists, or will be provided, suitable accommodation for poultry and pigs, where these can reasonably be kept.</P>
    <P>I have not in this short survey exhausted the activities of my own Department and other departments in relation to the economic conditions in the Gaeltacht, but I hope I have said enough to satisfy Deputies that no time is being lost in giving effect to the Government decisions embodied in the White Paper on the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission. The process of improving the economic condition there can, at best, be slow, but I hope it will go steadily forward.  There is no change in Sub-head G, relating to Fishery Protection. This whole question, the present position of which is not satisfactory, has been engaging my attention for some time past.  It involves some important and difficult questions relating to territorial water and extra-territorial water.  The position has been examined, and it seems inevitable that some fresh legislation will be necessary, and this matter is under consideration in connection with the Bill to which I have already referred.  In Sub-head 1 it will be seen that there is a reduction in the receipts from schemes of fishery development.  This <Col N="665" /> is due to the fact that, having in mind the proposals which I have explained earlier, the services under Sub-head E have been somewhat curtailed. The receipts from rural industries have been put at a lower figure than last year, because the latter figure was found to be in excess of the amount in fact realised. I contemplate, however, the reorganisation and expansion of these industries, and it will probably be necessary for me to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for these services at a later date.</P>

      <P>The President, in bringing in a motion for the closure some time ago, recommended us to be brief and pithy in our discussion of these Estimates.  I shall endeavour to do so.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries spoke of having explained the activities of his Department, but I would rather say that he devoted three-fourths of his speech to promises of things to be done in the autumn or early winter and very little to what was done, or not done, by his Department last year.  We had a White Paper before the House more than a year ago, and it had then been in existence, I think, for a year, but it is still a White Paper; it is still white, so far as any assistance for the Gaeltacht is concerned.  This is a very important Vote because it covers what was at one time the Congested Districts Board, the reserves of whose funds were taken over by the Government.  What has become of them we know not. Certainly the Gaeltacht has not got the benefit of them.  We have many promises in regard to housing in the Gaeltacht and we are told that a Bill will be brought in in the autumn to provide for the building of houses for the poor people there.  The proper time to build houses is now, in the fine weather.  When the rains come in October and <Col N="666" /> November no building can be done.  We may therefore consider that that matter has been postponed for another twelve months.  We are told that the fisheries are in a bad way.  They are practically nonexistent in Cleggan and Arran. There are Deputies here who, I am sure, can recollect the time when fifty carts carried fish daily from Cleggan to Clifden, but there is not one now.  Here, again, we are told that another Bill will be introduced when certain things are considered. They must, in fact, all have their considering caps on when they are considering these matters, but that is very little comfort to those who have to leave the Gaeltacht and emigrate. We are told that a good deal of money is being spent on fostering the Irish language.  That, of course, is all right if it is rightly spent, but what, for instance, is the use of spending money on providing for a water supply if you neglect the reservoir?  It is money lost.  That is just what is being done.  If you do not save the Gaeltacht you are simply laying the pipes and neglecting the reservoir.</P>
      <P>There are rural industries and schools for lace-making and so on which, we are told, are to be the nucleus of industrial development. Take one example.  There is a lace school in Clifden, but it has been closed, and I do not know what is being substituted for it.  Monsignor MacAlpine received a letter some time ago in which it was stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Lands and Fisheries has had under consideration the question of the industrial centre of Clifden.  The upkeep and maintenance of this centre have been considered and are not commensurate with the poor results obtained.  The benefit derived by the very few workers attending has been small, and after full consideration the Minister is forced to the conclusion that the cost to the State of maintaining the centre does not justify its retention, and I am accordingly to inform you that it has been decided to close it down.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> That, I suppose, is also a nucleus of industrial development.  We would like to have heard more regarding the housing proposals; also as to what has been done in regard to the development of the homespun industry in Donegal and elsewhere, and what use will be made of the lace schools and other rural industries.  It is all very fine to be promised that we will have Bills in the autumn, but we would like to know what has been done by a Department which spends 40 per cent. of its money on administration without, so far as we can see, at any rate, any results either in the way of stopping emigration or helping industry.  I have had letters from people in Arran and other places asking when they will get grants for houses and for replacing their nets, and when I write to the Department about them the only reply I get is that the matter is under consideration.  The season for building has practically gone by and these people have no chance of building houses now and no chance of catching fish.  We are told, as I say that the matter is under consideration. What consideration, I wonder, will these people get in the autumn or winter?</P>
    <P>In regard to kelp, some time ago there was talk of establishing an iodine factory.  We do not hear a word about it now or if any steps have been taken in that direction.  I understand that some new process is being tried in London which might make the project of the factory in the Gaeltacht antiquated.  We should be told all about that&mdash; whether it is being held up to await the results of current experimentation or whether it is intended to go ahead with the factory, what will be done with the kelp, or how those people will be assisted to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be in order on this Estimate to refer to afforestation.  When discussing the Vote for afforestation we were told that certain lands are not suitable for afforestation.  There is one place at Ballinahinch where a Mr. <Col N="668" /> Berridge planted a lot of trees and got expert advice from the Department. That experiment has succeeded, and I do not see why other experiments of a similar nature in other districts should not be tried. Surely, there are suitable lands half way up mountains which might be used for afforestation.  That would provide one method of employment, but we are not told a word about it now.  We are told that poultry schemes are being formulated, but poultry schemes do not produce any eggs, at least until they are in operation. What we want to know is when they will be in operation.  All that comes under the Department of Agriculture, as does, I presume, the assistance given for seed potatoes to the Arran Islands and other parts of Connemara during the spring season.  We want to know before we pass this Vote, which we are opposing, what exactly has been done by the Department during the past twelve months to justify us in voting the sum now asked for.  We are told that we are going to have a supplementary Estimate later on.  I hope we do, and that these Bills regarding the co-operative sea-fishery associations, housing schemes, etc., will be as good as have been promised by the Minister.  Until these Bills are passed and until we are asked to vote the money for them, I fail to see why we should vote any money for the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> I move that the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.  I agree with Deputy Fahy that the treatment of the Gaeltacht by the Minister for Fisheries is deserving of the censure of the House.  For that reason I have put down a motion that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  The whole question of the Gaeltacht was debated twelve months ago and on that occasion it was proposed by the Government to set up a Committee representative of the different State Departments who would act in coordination with the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and subject to his direction would formulate and carry into operation schemes to better the economic conditions of the people in the Gaeltacht.  As far as I have been able to make out from the remarks of Ministers on that occasion they were in a pretty difficult situation, in managing to get members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to vote for them.  I think there were a great many members of the Party who thought that the Government was not doing sufficient and the different Ministers who spoke&mdash;I think practically all the Ministers on the front bench spoke on that occasion&mdash;were very careful not to compromise themselves while trying to give us the impression that their intentions were perfectly legitimate as regards the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>They laid down a few principles indicating Government policy in regard to matters covered by the White Paper.  They are principles affecting finance, and, in my opinion, the whole question in regard to dealing with the Gaeltacht is how much money you are going to spend?  If we are going to have an Estimate coming up year after year, a few thousand pounds greater one year, or less the next year, we can take it that there is going to be no improvement in the unsatisfactory condition of the fisheries and of the people in the Gaeltacht.  On the occasion when a motion in regard to the Gaeltacht was proposed by Deputy Fahy last year, the President and some of the other members of the Executive <Col N="670" /> Council led us to believe that these schemes were in hand and that they were going to spend money in the application of them.  On the 19th March, the President, according to page 2090 of the Official Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Gaeltacht does, and will require the expenditure of considerable sums of money to make it a place in which people can live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said, on the 2nd May, according to page 761 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me that in order to maintain the population where it is for the sake of the language and to improve conditions as much as they can be improved, it is worth while conducting a number of industries under the auspices of a Government Department or somebody subsidised by a Government Department, knowing there would be some loss, but knowing that the people would in the main be definitely earning what they were paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition to that he said (column 764 of the Official Debates):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a well-thought-out scheme were propounded it might be better to face a period of five, six or seven years during which considerable expenditure would be made to determine whether, with large expenditure, there would be considerable development in the fisheries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that there is no evidence whatever in the Estimates of this considerable expenditure on these various schemes. Members of the House will no doubt say, and the Minister can say in reply, that it is necessary to have schemes in apple-pie order before bringing them before the Dáil.  That is so, but there is no justification whatever for the delay that has taken place up to the present.  The Minister speaks now of reorganising the fishing industry.  Last year he had provision in his Estimates for the reorganisation of that industry, a particular subsidy <Col N="671" /> to the Fishermen's Association.  The Fishermen's Association has probably fallen through owing to bad times.  I think it exhibits negligence on the part of the Minister to allow the association to fall through, without endeavouring to take advantage of whatever ground-work in the way of organisation that association could provide.  If the Ministry have to start work on that again they will have to organise, and when a Government Department is organising it has to pay very expensively for its organisation. It will have to organise from the very foundation, because in some of the areas where it is proposed to set up schemes or industries the organisation is practically nonexistent. All that will have to be done, and it is a great pity that the organisation which was there, however imperfect it might have been, was not taken advantage of.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the re-establishment of the fishing industry on the basis of what is taking place in the fishing industry at present are nothing new.  There were proposals made by the old Dáil in 1920 or 1919.  It is an extraordinary thing, to my mind, that the Minister should take practically the same steps to implement the legislation as the old régime had in contemplation for the inland fisheries, that type of restrictive legislation which, however we may feel it is necessary, we dislike because we feel somehow that it is much better to get the co-operation of the people for the protection of the industry than to pass punitive legislation in regard to it.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that these proposals which the old Boards of Conservators had in mind for the protection of the inland fisheries were immediately rushed through this House in the form of legislation.  I have no great fault to find with that.  As far as they went they were admirable.  What I do say is that, because certain vested interests in the country were interested in that particular matter, it <Col N="672" /> was not right that legislation should have been passed for their benefit mainly, and that some steps were not taken before now to put into operation the reorganisation scheme for the fishing industry which was laid down many years ago, and which the Minister himself knows all about.  If it is that the Minister for Fisheries has snatched sufficient courage, by virtue of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has plunged the State into a large financial transaction to put the dairying industry on its feet, to approach the Minister for Finance, who seems to be the villain of the piece in these matters, I rather congratulate him. Why he should not have done so earlier I do not know.  In any case, I want to point out that there is nothing new about the proposals. They were all there years ago.  These proposals were to organise the fishermen in co-operative societies, to have a central board in Dublin similar to the central marketing board in connection with the dairying industry, and that the board should regulate fisheries and market fish.  Furthermore, that that board&mdash;and this is the important lacuna which we discern in the Minister's speech&mdash;would be provided with sufficient finance to re-organise the industry.  The money that we are providing this year, even if it were all spent on re-organising these fishermen's societies, would probably not complete the work.  I do not want the Minister to be placed in the position, when he is defending his project for the betterment of the fishing industry, that he will be told: &ldquo;You came before the Dáil and asked for a certain amount of money; you asked for approval of certain proposals, and if these proposals were not the right ones, or if you had not sufficient money at your disposal, you have no right to come back here now and look for more money.&rdquo;  I want to see the Minister doing what he said himself on one occasion during the discussion on his Estimate would be necessary to rebuild the Irish fishing industry&mdash;I want to see him getting a quarter of a million pounds or more, as was done in the case of the creamery <Col N="673" /> industry, and developing the industry on that foundation.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done?  He has taken the question of the fishery loans, and I am surprised that he contemplates the revival of the fishing industry on the basis of giving loans on substantially the same basis in future as he gave them in the past without doing away with the old loans.  This matter has been pressed and will be pressed this evening, and I do not want to delay the House further in speaking about it.  If the Department of Finance have been got to the position that they agree that each particular defaulting fisherman should have his case examined and should have a composition made or should have the debt wiped off altogether&mdash;because that would be necessary in some cases&mdash;why is it not possible to get the Minister for Finance to agree to a composition covering all the cases and getting this whole question of the revaluation of the old fishing loans out of our way?  It has been here long enough.  Another matter in connection with the re-organisation of the industry is the proposal that fishermen, if their claims are considered good, and they have been honest and trustworthy in the past, will not have to advance a portion of the purchase price. Although, as I take it from the Minister, they may not have been very satisfactory in the past, they still can get State facilities to a certain extent, but they will have to advance twenty per cent. of the purchase money in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy misunderstood me.  I did not say that.  What I said is that owing to the present position of the fishing industry, apart from men's records in the past, fishermen may be advanced loans now without paying down any sum in cash themselves in advance.  We shall not differentiate as between the person who had paid well in the past or the person who had not paid well&mdash;that is, for the first ten years the matter of paying in advance will be waived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to that.  The only thing is, that it would seem to be a pity if the twenty per cent. were insisted upon, because the whole trouble with the fisherman is that when you give him certain facilities, if you are not acquainted with the situation, you may say: &ldquo;The State has done a certain amount; why should not the fisherman do the remainder?&rdquo;  The Minister, while this question of the revaluation of the loans was hanging fire, told us in the House that, although he had not the question settled, he was prepared to grant loans up to £150, I think, for nets on the strength of his belief in the fishermen, who during past transactions had been satisfactory.  But the position is that the granting to a fisherman of a boat or a net in addition is not sufficient.  You are giving him certain things, and you are completely avoiding or neglecting the fact that he may have no financial resources to complete the rest of the work and to get his boat into running order.  The Department of Fisheries are prepared to say that a certain amount of the realised price of the fishing catch will be set aside for paying off the cost price of the vessel and also for maintenance, but the whole trouble is to put the whole finance of the fishing industry on a proper footing in the beginning. As there are no provisions whatever in the Estimate for that, no matter what the present intentions of the Department of Fisheries may be, I have moved the motion to refer back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to say, in connection with the development of the scheme, that it would be very valuable if the Minister kept in touch with the fishermen.  It would be an unforgiveable thing if the Minister were dictated to in his own ideas of what were the best things to be done for the industry by particular local <Col N="675" /> circumstances, but unfortunately each particular area, and even each particular case, has its local difficulties, and these must be taken into consideration.  When this scheme is founded I want to see it as far as possible developed with the active co-operation of the fishermen themselves. I do not want to see the position that arose in connection with the creamery re-organisation scheme, when you had a large number of farmers in certain areas rather disgruntled because a body in Dublin whom they knew nothing about had arbitrarily decreed that a creamery should be closed here and that they should have to go to another district to deliver their milk.  Therefore, I suggest that the fullest possible co-operation and discussion should take place with the fishermen.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the organisation of industries in the Gaeltacht, that is a case where the maxim of the Minister for Finance must be kept in mind&mdash;that all you can do in these cases is to see that the money is spent to the best advantage; that you cannot always expect a profit.  I feel that the Minister is on the right lines in trying to get suitable designs to cope with changing fashions.  In that connection it is a pity that those people who regard themselves as the leaders of society of the Free State would not now and again go out of their way to boost the products of native industry.  Nothing, unfortunately, is further from their minds.</P>
    <P>Whether you can have a central depot in Dublin to regulate what takes place in the industry in Donegal or in the West I do not know, but I feel that, on the whole, the Minister would be on the right line.  The proper line, to my mind, is to make the production end as useful and right as possible.  If we produce the right type of article as economically as possible and leave a certain amount of money to be spent in these districts for the benefit of the people we will be able to get good value and we will be able to tackle the marketing problem <Col N="676" /> afterwards.  What we would like to see, in the first instance, is to get as much production as possible. When we build up this central depot, or other organisation in Dublin, unhappily a large amount of the money will go in overhead expenses, and what we must try is to see that the largest amount possible is spent in the Gaeltacht in production.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in his statement last year in reference to the Gaeltacht, referred to the development of the poultry industry and of sheep and pigs and cattle. I suppose the Department of Agriculture are doing a certain amount for cattle, but the fact is that they have not, up to the present, produced a poultry scheme, just as the Local Government Department has not produced their new housing scheme for increasing the grants. It is a pity we have not some further details from the Minister as to what actually he is doing in these matters.  The kelp experiment, which a year or two ago was spoken of as a potential factory, is now only an experiment.  Are we to gather, therefore, from the Minister's statement that the prospects of building up the kelp industry are not favourable, and that the thing is going to fall through.  It seems extraordinary, after such a long time, that the Minister has not been able to get kelp out of the experimental stage.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters that I wish to refer to.  For instance, there is the question of the territorial waters which has been under discussion.  Looking over old debates on the Estimate for Fisheries, I notice that one of the promises made a long time ago was that legislation would be introduced by the Minister to give increased powers to his Department to deal with foreign trawlers and to inflict more severe penalties for transgression of the Fishery Laws.  At the same time the Minister said he had no powers in extra-territorial waters.  Now if the situation that Deputy White raised the other night exists, I think the Government <Col N="677" /> ought to take an opportunity to clarify the whole question of the jurisdiction of this State in its territorial waters, and outside, where the rights of their own subjects are concerned.</P>
    <P>The British Labour Government have now recognised the Soviet and our conservative Minister for Fisheries could do worse than to get his Government to recognise it.  The Russian and Baltic markets, I believe, are the principal foreign markets that we have to look after.  I should like to know from the Minister when he replies what our trade representative in the United States of America is doing for the herring and mackerel fisheries and what the Government proposes to do to develop the Irish foreign trade in the Baltic and these other countries.</P>
    <P>The big question that we are at variance with the Minister upon, as the House may have gathered from my remarks, is the fact that he thinks private enterprise can be got to build up the Irish fishing industry as it stands at present.  I admit if you had fishermen organised and a general feeling of optimism among them, if they were in the position that they were able to hang on and to make a living at least without making any great profits, if they had some security of employment, it might be all right to wait until some foreign syndicate came along to develop the industry and to put capital into it. But to my mind the whole attitude of the Minister has been inconsistent in the matter of encouraging private enterprise.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the Minister says: &ldquo;I am not going to spend any money in the development of the deep-sea fishery because I know from what happened in Australia and other places that it is going to be a failure, and if I did it would have disastrous effects and prevent foreigners (or natives) investing money in the industry.&rdquo;  And at the same time he turns round and goes a certain length as he does now by giving loans without any advance on the purchase money and as he has done by encouraging experiments which I think he did in Donegal recently in <Col N="678" /> deep sea trawling.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He ought to wash his hands out of the fishery industry altogether or go into it with sufficient strength and determination to say: &ldquo;I am going to make a success of it and therefore I can hand it over later on to whatever capitalists or combines will buy it.&rdquo;  His present attitude is: &ldquo;I am going to spend a certain amount of money, not sufficient to develop the industry, but sufficient to enable every person, who has not the interests of the industry at heart, to say it is a failure and that the fishermen are responsible.&rdquo;  I think the Minister is doing an entirely wrong thing and is not doing justice to the fisheries by taking up that attitude.  He ought not to put his hand to a certain scheme as in the case of the Donegal scheme and then drop out in order that he may show it is not a success when he encounters obstacles.</P>
    <P>Certainly in an industry which fluctuates so violently it would be hard to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You must go on spending money in scores of thousands of pounds every year even though you know you must lose.&rdquo;  But I am afraid the House will have to take that responsibility; if they are to put the industry upon a proper footing they will have to spend money.  Thank God there is a Government and a Parliament which is, I trust, prepared to spend that money.  The only thing necessary is to spend it in the proper way and to get the maximum result.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer to the question of the inland fisheries. The question of the inland fisheries is an extremely difficult and complicated matter, and it is unfortunate that we have no definite information from the present Government, that they have not investigated this question and put the result of their investigations on a White Paper.  There is no form in which that information is available. The Government have passed a number of Bills on the whole question, but in the matter of legal rights in connection with these fisheries, the question of whether the fishing rights are vested in the tenants, <Col N="679" /> and what fishing rights are not vested in them, and how exactly the entire inland fisheries of the State stand in regard to their value and as to who exactly owns them, and what are the present powers of the State in regard to them&mdash;we are in a state of deplorable ignorance upon a lot of these questions.  This is a matter in which we are all interested. We see Boards of Conservators which, according to their tradition, are looking after the fisheries very well.  They are subsidised by the State this year to the extent of £3,750, which is going to the development of the inland fisheries direct, but to the sea fisheries we are only giving the sum of £5,000 in loans to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The total amount that is being spent on the development of inland fisheries compares very favourably with the amount you are going to give directly in loans to the sea fisheries.  You are therefore subsidising these Boards of Conservators. I would like the Minister to state what exactly is his position in regard to these boards.  There is in the first place the claim that owing to the operation of the purchase of innumerable licences by the people who are on these boards already they succeed in keeping fresh blood out.  Whether the type that is trying to get in on the board is the best type or not I do not know.  We want to see other sections of the community coming in and taking a hand in the control of these fisheries.  You have also the farmers who should be the owners of fishing rights attached to their own land interested in this question.  A most extraordinary state of affairs, which I hope Deputy Allen will go into, has occurred on the River Slaney, where, I think, farmers have been prevented from fishing on their own lands while other people have been allowed to do so.  In certain areas you have a certain type of fishing where a net is put out and the owner of the fishing who controls the right over a single pool can gather in 60 or 100 salmon in one day.  You have certain <Col N="680" /> people having rights in the tidal waters where one would imagine the Almighty never intended anybody to have rights.  It is time that the Government would look into these matters and see whether the different people who are trying to live on the fisheries, the people who have a claim like the farmers, and the inland fishermen, who were computed before the war to amount to 8,000, are getting as good a show as they expected to get under a native Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, in reply to Deputy White, that he wants to see this question of the Bann fisheries brought into court.  What is going to be the result of that court action? Can the Minister have any doubt whatever in his mind?  The charters are there.  The titles can be proved, going back to King Charles, King John, or somebody else.  If the Minister is satisfied that these charters should be abrogated and that there are sections of the community who, from time immemorial, have lived on these fisheries I think he should take steps to protect their rights and give them a chance to earn their livelihood. Some of the landlords who have those several fisheries do not take steps to preserve them.  I am told that in parts of my constituency some of these fisheries are comparatively neglected.  Nevertheless, they are there, a barrier to the angler's enjoyment of his sport, and also to the local farmer getting his rights.</P>
    <P>In connection with angling, as in the case of what I said about the Boards of Conservators, it is a pity that the Minister could not reduce the licence fee.  If there has been an enormous increase in the number of persons holding licences it may appear to him that the number of anglers is increasing sufficiently.  It is the very best thing, I think, for the country if you can have the proper type of angler&mdash;a very large number of people interested in sport solely from the point of view of sport, and who, however these questions of title deeds and private interest go, will always look at things from a fairly detached point <Col N="681" /> of view, from the point of view of how, in the long run, these fisheries can best be developed in the country. I would like the Minister to increase the number of anglers by reducing the licence fees.  I would like to see anglers increasing in out-of-the-way places.  I would like the Minister to take steps to extend the use of hatcheries, and stock mountain lakes, which are at present unprofitable, with fish.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to refer to, in conclusion, is the earlier opening of the season.  The Minister will say, no doubt, that he is anxious to protect the fisheries and that any change in the present conditions of the closed season and the closing at the week-end would interfere with fishing.  Everyone admits that our fisheries have increased enormously in value during the past few years, and a good many people think if the system of hatcheries were developed on a large scale that the Irish rivers would be teeming with fish.  The fishermen say that after April the fisheries are very unprofitable.  It may happen that they are unprofitable for the whole year.  They are very unsatisfactory this year.  The fishermen say that when the evenings become bright they do not do very much.  Anglers tell me that the early spring season is the best for getting the fish.  I think that if it would confer an enormous benefit on the fishermen, who are the poorest class and are living on the industry, the Minister might reconsider the question of re-opening a week or a fortnight earlier, at the beginning of January.  He can close them earlier if he wishes, but at the beginning of the season the fishermen are anxious to get as many facilities as possible consistent with the protection of the fisheries.  If the Minister during the coming twelve months takes steps to attend to these various matters, the rights of the farmers and the claims of the anglers and the interests of the inland fishermen, he will get their support.  He will not be depending on the Civic Guards and the boards of conservators.  All classes down <Col N="682" /> the country will have confidence that the Minister is anxious to give everybody a share and have everyone represented on the boards and anxious that everyone should get, within reason, a return from the fisheries.  I hope all these matters which, I am sorry to have detained the House so long on, will be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Poaching trawlers have never done more destruction than they have done in the past twelve months along the Donegal coastline, where very rarely have there been any visits from the cruiser.  It has been stated on fairly reasonable authority, on several occasions, that the speed of the cruiser is not at all satisfactory as compared with the more modern trawlers.  I referred to this matter last year, and the Minister stated in reply to my allegation that it was not right or proper that he should let the House or the public know what the speed of the cruiser was. This cruiser is costing about £10,000 to maintain and keep in Saorstát waters.  If the cruiser is not equal to the speed of the modern trawler then the question should be seriously considered by the Ministry of placing another cruiser on duty to whose speed no exception could be taken.</P>
      <P>Fines have been struck at various district courts around County Donegal for the past four or five years against masters of trawlers caught in prohibited waters.  I would like to hear from the Minister if he has got any nearer the collection of these fines than this time last year.  I understand that a huge list of these unrecovered fines is in his Department, and it is very desirable that we should know what steps have been taken by whatever Department is responsible, for the recovery of these fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with a good deal of what has been said from the Fianna Fáil Benches with regard to the development of industries in the Gaeltacht. Unfortunately, in our Gaeltacht, in Donegal, there is a big reserve of unemployed female labour, and <Col N="683" /> unless cottage industries are developed to give employment to these women and girls there is nothing for them but emigration.  I am prepared to wait until the autumn session to hear the proposals with regard to the development of the cottage industries, by the new chief of the Department, Mr. Bradley.  I understand that he went into the Department of Lands and Fisheries with a high record.  It will be up to him to sustain that record in Donegal and in other areas of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of developing cottage industries, I remember reading about the Countess of Aberdeen giving a garden party in the Viceregal Lodge some thirty or thirty-five years ago.  She made it a condition that all her guests would attend that garden party wearing Irish manufactured products.  I think that if something in the same direction were done by the Governor-General and some of the higher officials who hold functions of that description&mdash; if in sending out invitations they made it a condition that Irish made goods would be worn&mdash;it would give a fillip to the Gaeltacht industries and to Irish industry all round.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Derrig's reference to the discussion that took place here last Friday on the adjournment, on the rights of the Inishowen fishermen to use the Lough Foyle Fisheries, there is, of course, the claim of the Foyle and Bann Company as lessees of the Irish Society.  I think, in the interests of the Inishowen fishermen and of the whole of the Saorstát, this question should be taken up seriously by the Minister and his Department.  They should get into communication with the Northern Government and have determined at once what the rights of our Inishowen fishermen are in Lough Foyle.  If the Minister does that he will be doing a real service to the unfortunate people who are endeavouring to make a living from this fishery.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a very serious matter as regards the fishing around the south coast, particularly with reference to the fishing at Youghal, Knockadoon, Ballycotton and Cobh.  The fishermen down there for the last few years have been complaining of the neglect of the Department in regard to foreign trawlers.  These trawlers are coming in week after week and day after day under the noses of the fishermen and taking away the fish on which those men are depending for a livelihood.  I remember a time when that coast abounded with herrings and hake and gave a plentiful supply of fish to the inland towns and rural districts.  At the present time there is not a sprat to be got. All the fish are taken away by these foreign trawlers.  There is a huge amount of money spent on this Department&mdash;£42,897&mdash;and as far as I can see it is mostly spent on officials, while nothing is being done for the unfortunate people who are depending on the fishing for their livelihood. I hope that when the Minister goes on his holidays he will bring down officials from his Department for a couple of months and get first hand information.  At the same time they will spend a most enjoyable holiday.  Let him visit Ballycotton before he goes to any other part and spend his money at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Sheehy will account for himself.  I must say as regards these hatcheries that they have done an amount of good. The stocking of the rivers with trout and salmon fry is most important, and I hope they will spend more money in that way.  It will be an inducement to tourists, and when they come here they will enjoy the fishing and spend money in the country, which is badly needed at the present time.  As regards salmon fishery rights.  I would like to see them vested in the owners of land adjoining the rivers.  In the Black-water <Col N="685" /> valley at the present time the tenants are agitating for the fishing rights, and if these rights are not vested in them I am afraid it will lead to a lot of trouble later.  I hope the Department will take particular notice of that.  At the present time it takes all we can do, in the way of advice, to keep these people within the bounds of the law.  It would be very easy to turn away these people who come from England and Scotland and who have plenty of money to spend in the country.  If the fishing rights were vested in those people owning the land adjoining the rivers there would be no need for half the water-bailiffs we have at present because every one of these farmers would be a protection in himself.  He would look after his own interests and fish would be more plentiful and would become a great boon to the people of the country.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Fisheries will see that the fishing rights around the coast of Ballycotton will be protected; that he will keep these trawlers away and give the unfortunate people down there a chance of earning a living for themselves and their children and of keeping them from the emigrant ship.</P>

      <P>I think the main reason why this Vote should be referred back is because sufficient money is not being voted for the revival of the Irish fishing industry. This Department, it would seem, continues to be the Cinderella of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst perhaps there is a greater field for development here than in many other Irish industries, yet the Government seems to be withholding sufficient money to allow the Department to develop upon any reasonable or fruitful line this vast industry.  It is so seldom that the President gives any good advice that I will take it on this occasion and I will be as brief and as much to the point as possible.  The Minister's speech to-day seemed to be loaded with promises.  He promised us many things, and I hope that the <Col N="686" /> realisation of these promises will come in due time.  I hope we will get some good fruit from them.  But if we examine the results and activities of one Committee that has been at work for some time we perhaps may gauge the activities of the other Committees from that.  For close on twelve months there has been a Committee called the Gaeltacht Reconstruction Committee in being. The name I have given it may not be its correct name, but it contains the idea, and Deputies will know the Committee that I refer to.  This is a Committee which was to suggest what should be done in the Gaeltacht by way of helping fisheries and local industries, to preserve the Irish language for the Irish nation in the Gaeltacht.  Many schemes have been submitted to that Committee. Many considerations have been submitted to it that would do some good towards preserving the Irish language.  But I have not yet heard any Deputy say that as a result of the activities of that Committee any scheme has been put into operation or that any good work has been done in the Gaeltacht.  Many may not agree with my view of the Gaeltacht.  We may, of course, force Irish upon lawyers; we may say that that will save the Irish language. We may say it is in the schools and that that will save it. But I would scrap Irish in the schools, I would scrap Irish in the Galltacht, I would scrap Irish for lawyers, I would scrap Irish in the Constitution and I would scrap the Constitution itself if I could be certain that there would be one hundred or two hundred Irish-speaking families secure in the Gaeltacht.  If that Committee has not been working towards that end that Committee has been failing in the main matter for which it has been set up, that is, to secure that industry in the Gaeltacht will provide sustenance for the people in the Gaeltacht who have the heritage of Irish nationality in its purest form.</P>
    <P>There is a small Gaeltacht in my <Col N="687" /> own county.  I regret to say that it has been driven towards the coast &mdash;probably one mile inland, in some places to a half mile inland, and in some districts it has probably disappeared altogether.  Yet when I submitted a scheme that would cost probably £50 and that would secure that about 1,000 tons of seaweed could be saved and collected for kelp for the people of a small town, the season is allowed to pass and that money is not expended for the purpose of cutting a way through a reef of rock.  I am not making this point against the Minister.  This proposal was submitted long before the opening of the season, and yet the season was allowed to pass without that trifling expenditure.  It was only a trifle of perhaps not more than £50, but the non-expenditure of that £50 has destroyed to a great extent the faith of the people of that district in the activities of the Department of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me to make these remarks here, but I want to point out to the Minister that the non-expenditure of that £50 has destroyed the faith of the people who are active in the work of the Gaeltacht in the Department of Fisheries.  We are promised a co-operative association which will look after boats and tackle and such things.  I would like to know more about that co-operation and that association.  I would like to know how it is going to be formed, what is going to be its constitution and government?  I hope the Minister in his reply will let us have some more information about it.  I gather from the Minister's remarks that re-valuation is more or less shelved, and that we are to have another committee to consider the position in detail.  It is also true that the Minister told us that some schemes have been in operation in the Gaeltacht.  But the acid test, to my mind, of the efficacy of the schemes is this: has emigration from the Gaeltacht dwindled during the last five years, two years, or one year?  Has emigration from the Gaeltacht diminished?  Is it still <Col N="688" /> not going on as it was before these schemes were put into operation? What has been done in the past twelve months to reduce that emigration?  That is what I would like to hear.  I would like to hear how this scheme which the Minister has introduced is going to keep the people at home.</P>
    <P>There is a minor matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the question of inquiries.  In some districts inquiries are being made as regards by-laws.  Some of these by-laws are very vexatious.  I will give the Minister an idea of how absurd these by-laws are.  In the estuary of the Shannon, boats are expected when fishing to keep a certain distance apart, when they are mere playthings of the tide.  They are prosecuted if they are not a certain distance apart.  The fishery inspectors of the Minister's Department, or whoever is responsible, issue prosecutions in these cases.  These things are very vexatious, and representations have been made to me that the Minister should have these things considered, and considered not in the off-hand fashion in which most of these inquiries have been held.</P>
    <P>I have been told that inquiries in the main are more or less farcical and that there is really no active inquiry into the grievances submitted by the fishermen or by the people concerned, that an inspector blows into the place and blows out of it again and that is all that is ever heard of it.  These are statements that have been made to me.  I am not endeavouring to score points off the Ministry.  If my statements are incorrect the Minister will have an opportunity of flatly contradicting them.  I am of the opinion that the Minister's Department is not sufficiently in touch with the activities and aspirations of the people in these districts.  If it were, probably more would have been done. I am anxious to hear something about the iodine factory.  Probably the Minister will give us some information in his reply.  It would be desirable if we could be assured in a more detailed fashion of how boats and gear will be got under the new system proposed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>On this Vote in previous years I referred to the importance of inland fisheries.  I also referred to the good work that can be done by local organisations in connection with the development and protection of inland fisheries, working in co-operation with the Minister's Department.  Deputy Derrig referred to the subsidy given for inland fisheries and he said that he considered there was too much given in that connection.  My complaint is in the very opposite direction.  I have stated repeatedly here that I believe we have a great national asset, a regular gold mine in the country, if inland fisheries were more fully developed. I have gone into the matter at length on previous occasions and I do not intend to-day to deal any further with it.  We can attract tourists here who have money to spend.  By encouraging tourists we can bring very much-needed money into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out before the good work that local organisations can do in protecting the fish which come up the rivers in thousands to spawn. I referred especially to trout, as the salmon in County Westmeath are only in the rivers.  The trout come up the rivers in thousands.  Heretofore they were packed in barrels and salted, but now they can return to the lakes.  In that matter we got very considerable help from the Civic Guards.  I would like to pay a tribute to them for the excellent work they did.  No bailiffs or other people who look after the various rivers up which the trout go in such enormous numbers could have attended to the matter so well as the Guards.  People who have not seen it will scarcely believe the huge numbers of fish that pass up the rivers every year.  If anybody would like to get complete proof of what I say, let him visit the lakes and rivers in the latter end of February and the beginning of March in any year and he will see the fish there in thousands.  In addition to that, the Society hatch every year some 100,000 young trout at practically a nominal cost.  When the ova are hatched out and developed, the young trout are turned into the <Col N="690" /> lakes.  Beyond doubt at the present time the lakes are teeming with trout.</P>
    <P>I notice a letter in to-day's &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; from the Honorary Secretary of the Lough Owel and Lough Ennel Preservation Association. In that letter he states: &ldquo;I am glad to notice that the Boyne Fishery Conservators have adopted a resolution from the Wexford Board of Conservators asking the Minister for Fisheries to bring in legislation to prevent the illegal netting of salmon and trout...&rdquo; I may say that in that connection I am in complete agreement with the writer.  Every possible protection should be afforded to trout.  In another portion of the letter he states that the only effective way to protect a large lake like Lough Ennel is to abolish the right to net coarse fish.  With that statement I am in entire disagreement, because if pike and perch and other fish that feed on trout are not taken out of the lakes then, of course, they will be free to consume large numbers of trout.  I will give proof of that statement.  The coarse fish must be destroyed in order to protect the trout.  I saw very recently a 12 lb. pike taken out of Belvidere, and he had a half-digested 4 lb. trout in his inside.  Thousands of those pike have been netted or shot in that particular lake.  I understand that in other lakes they have been allowed to accumulate, with the result that there is hardly any fishing.</P>
    <P>There is an important reason why I object to the complete stoppage of netting.  It is that a large number of poor fishermen living around the lakes usually go out and net perch or pike.  In addition to removing the danger of those fish consuming trout the men also provide food for themselves and their families.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not pay any attention to the suggestion about abolishing the right of netting coarse fish.  I said that I would give some proof in connection with the damage done by coarse fish.  In Lough Owel, one of the lakes in Westmeath, seven miles long by three miles wide, there are not two dozen trout caught in the year.  The <Col N="691" /> reason is that there is no endeavour made to take out the coarse fish, such as pike or perch.  They are allowed to accumulate, being neither netted nor shot, and the result is that there is hardly any fishing on that lake.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a matter which has caused a good deal of unpleasantness. I refer to a by-law passed on 7th August, 1928, altering the mesh to be used from two to two and a quarter inches.  That renders the use of any mesh two inches or less altogether illegal. This by-law was never published locally.  I do not find fault with the Minister, as the responsible organisation should have let fishermen know that the two-inch mesh was no longer legal.  Very great unpleasantness could have been saved if this by-law were made known. Unless you have the sympathy and co-operation of the fishermen the local organisations will not be able to carry on the good work which they can do.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to point out that in Westmeath we have some of the most beautiful lakes in the country.  Any person desirous of having a nice holiday should visit Derravaragh, Lough Owel or Lough Ennel.  There is no licence needed to fish there.  There is absolutely free fishing and, apart from the superb scenery, there are many other attractions.  I give a cordial invitation to any person who has money to spend, and who wants to get good value for it, to visit County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>I would like if Deputies, instead of following the Minister in what he has stated here in connection with this promised &ldquo;new Bill,&rdquo; would discuss what is before us on this Estimate.  When I came into the chamber the Minister had started speaking, and when I heard him I thought we had gone away from the procedure laid down this morning and that we were discussing a Bill introduced by the Minister for Fisheries to build up the fishing industry.  But when I found out what had happened, I came to the conclusion that the Minister was not the dud I took him to be.  I came to the conclusion that he was indeed a very ikey individual.  It is wise on the part of the Minister to get away from the Estimate, to get away from what he has not done for the past year, to get away from the promises he made here every year, and to discuss instead a Bill that is supposed to be brought in next autumn and to discuss what this Bill may do for the fishing industry.  I would like to remind the Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that over a year ago, when the Minister's Estimates were before us, the Minister made a certain number of promises.  He was very emphatic as regards what he was going to do during the past year.</P>
      <P>The Minister, speaking last year on this Vote on the 9th May, 1928, dealing with the falling off in trade carried on by lace schools and other industrial centres in the Gaeltacht, due chiefly to the English tax on artificial silk, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that particular tax and because of other reasons which have tended towards reducing <Col N="693" /> the efficacy of these industries, we must concentrate on developing, as far as possible, the home market for the products of those industrial schools, and steps are being taken, as I mentioned in the Gaeltacht debate, to organise a central depot in Dublin, and when that is developed it will be necessary, probably towards the end of the year, to come to the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate under that head.</P>
    <P>That was a definite statement by the Minister that before the end of last year he would come before the Dáil for a supplementary Estimate to enable him to do what he has been talking of doing for seven years and what was intended to be done, at least, ten years before that, namely, to have in Dublin a central depôt to assist the industries of the Gaeltacht. A year has passed, but as soon as Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies agreed to pass that Estimate of 1928 on the understanding that a central depôt was to be set up in Dublin, the Minister went back to his slumber room in his Department and was not again heard of until the Sligo-Leitrim election, when he made other promises about the fishing industry. Nothing has been heard of the Supplementary Vote which he was to introduce in 1928.  Further on in his speech during last year's debate he talked about the homespun industry and said, in regard to certain proposals that had been put forward:</P>
    <P>These proposals include the setting up of a carding and dyeing factory in Donegal, and a scheme of State inspection and the stamping of genuine hand-woven homespun cloth.  These have been under the consideration of the Department of Finance for some time, and when they receive the sanction of the Minister for Finance, as I presume they will, it will mean also coming forward for a Supplementary Vote for that particular scheme.</P>
    <P>That is another of the meandering statements of the Minister for Fisheries in 1928.  Not only was he coming forward with one Supplementary Vote, but he was coming forward <Col N="694" /> with a second one for a carding and dyeing factory.  Where is that proposal now?  Where is the carding factory?  The Minister did not tell us about these things in his statement to-day, nor have we heard of them since the Estimate was passed last year.  On the same occasion last year he boasted, in his plausible manner, because he wanted to get on holidays, about the great measure with which the Government was preparing to deal with housing in the Gaeltacht, and he said that they had accepted the recommendations contained in Article 55 of the Commission's report, in which it is stated: &ldquo;That a special system of loans and grants be introduced for housing in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;  Where is that system since the Minister promised it?  What have they done since? Houses have been built, but not for the Irish-speaking families he talks of, not for the Irish speakers whom they pretend they want to help to live in the Gaeltacht.  During the same debate he promised a Bill for the compulsory branding of mackerel before the Recess last year. What has become of that?  As I say, after his mid-night dream last year about all the grand things he was going to do he went back to his slumber room and forgot about them.  He was not serious making these promises then, and how can we take his promises as serious to-day, promises that have raised the hopes of the poorest section in the Gaeltacht, whose hopes are always raised only to be shattered by the Minister. They raised their hopes by setting up the Gaeltacht Commission.  They got a hard-working body of Gaels to go round getting information about the Gaeltacht and the fishing industry there, and what have they done since with the findings they were supposed to accept?</P>
    <P>As regards the re-valuation of boats, the Minister said last year, when winding up the debate, that a Bill for that purpose was with the draftsman.  So we had almost got it in 1928.  Where is it?  Does the Minister think that we are a pack of fools? Surely he will admit that even among Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies <Col N="695" /> there is some little intelligence. Surely they, especially those from the Gaeltacht, will not always stand for that policy of fooling.  There was also another promise about a Supplementary Vote for a second fishery cruiser.  He was speaking about foreign trawlers ruining the Irish fisheries.  First he found fault with the Irish people living along the coast because they bought fish from the foreign trawlers.  Does he want them to die of starvation and to refuse to take fish in exchange for fowl, eggs, or other commodities? The Minister said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our own people are really subsidising and encouraging the trawlers by buying the fish that they very often catch off our coast.  They catch the fish off our coast, land it in England, and it is brought back and eaten here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can the Minister supply them with something else instead of fish in Erris?  After that statement the Minister raised our hopes and made us somewhat happy by saying that he was going to tackle the question of foreign trawlers.  He said: &ldquo; I have considerable hopes that during the year we may be able to come here for a Vote for a second cruiser.&rdquo; Everything was to be done last year and the Minister got his Estimate through on his promises.  Deputy White said to-day: &ldquo;I am content to wait until the autumn.&rdquo;  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies got up last year and said: &ldquo;We are content to wait for these Supplementary Votes.&rdquo; I think that the Minister should not insult the House by sitting on the Front Bench.  Perhaps it is not his fault being there.  The President often talks about getting pound for pound in value.  When we talk about unemployment and relief works the President says: &ldquo;Where are you going to get pound for pound value?&rdquo;  Where can the President, or the Minister since he took up office, say that value has been given when no less than £137,597 has been spent in salaries and allowances, while for the fishing industry, in loans and so forth, only £97,362 has been spent?  I cannot see where pound for pound value has been <Col N="696" /> given and where, therefore, is the economic policy of the President?</P>
    <P>I admit that there is a certain amount given to industries, but putting them altogether, where is the value, pound for pound, out of the Minister's Department which the President said the Government want for every pound expended.  The Department was being run to such great satisfaction, moryah!&mdash; to the satisfaction of the people who are really ruling this country, the shoneens of Dublin and the Chamber of Commerce, that the Land Commission was handed over to the Minister, and now the Minister says that he will not make any promise this year, but that he will bring in a Bill to deal with the whole question.  The Minister may be in earnest about the Bill, but I am not prepared to take his word, knowing what I do about him already.  I do not think any Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy could take his word either, knowing him as they do, and they know him as well as we do, according to the information I have got from some Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  Surely, after five years, they owe even one act to their constituents.  They should not always be satisfied to walk in behind the Minister who they know has not done his work in any branch of his Department.  They are just as dissatisfied with that Department in regard to its neglect of fisheries, the Gaeltacht, the Land Commission, and the branch formerly administered by the old C.D. Board, as I am dissatisfied.  Why do they not, before this Estimate is put through, make their protest against the manner in which the Department has been administered? It is not too much to ask people who represent the West of Ireland to do that.  It is not a question of defeating the Government.  It is making the Government wake up to the facts of the situation as every Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy should desire them to wake up.  We are taking the only effective steps we can to do that by moving to refer back this Vote.  Promises, of course, will be made again and again by the Minister, but I would like if, instead <Col N="697" /> of taking the new Bill which the Minister talks about, we took him on his record as it is and vote on that alone.  We heard different suggestions made here by Deputies who spoke about the fishing industry in regard to the erection of piers and slips.  I am not going to make any suggestions in that way at all because I believe the Minister knows the necessity for piers and slips along the coast of Mayo or along any other coast, as well as I do.  I would ask the House not to make itself so cheap as to suggest anything to the Minister in that way, because he has made no attempt to meet any of the suggestions made previously or any of the recommendations made by the Gaeltacht Commission.  Unless the Minister is driven to do it, he will do nothing in that way.  Drive him to it and he will do it.  He has been masquerading for the past seven years under the bewildering title of Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  When I see the manner in which he introduced the Estimate I must say that I do not think he is the incompetent Minister that I thought him to be.  He is a cheat.  He has cheated the Irish people for the past seven years.  He cheats the Cumann na nGaedheal Party by pretending that he is going to benefit the Gaeltacht out of his salary and the expenses of his Department. The fisheries are to-day much worse off than they were when he took office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we are all familiar with the truth of the saying that &ldquo; A soft answer turneth away wrath.&rdquo;  I believe the Minister must also believe in the truth of it, because in introducing the Estimate and in speaking in regard to the Estimate, as Deputy Clery has pointed out, he has made promises go leor.  I think the net he has endeavoured to spread over Deputies who might be inclined to criticise his Department will not have the desired result, because, as Deputy Clery has said, this is not the first occasion, in speaking in regard to the Estimate, that he has made promises. He has told us what his Department <Col N="698" /> hopes to do during the ensuing twelve months, but it is not promises of what the Department hopes to do that the fishing folk and the people in the Gaeltacht want to hear.  We would have preferred to hear what the Department has accomplished during the past year in regard to the development of fisheries and also in regard to putting into operation the recommendations contained in the White Paper accompanying the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission.</P>
      <P>It is realised by Deputies of all Parties, I think, that the fisheries round our coast are not in a healthy condition.  To my mind, the scheme for the proposed Fisheries Co-operative Society outlined by the Minister could be made a good scheme.  I believe that organisation is necessary amongst fishermen in order to develop fisheries and that if the Minister's Department approach this proposal in the proper way it can be made a success.  He has outlined a scheme for organising the fishermen in divisional areas, who would themselves appoint representatives on the Central Board.  While that suggestion may be a good one, a lot will depend on the manner in which that proposal is put into operation.  It would also be interesting to know whether the Minister or his Department is serious in regard to the proposal.  Some time ago we were told that a sum of £1,100 would be granted to the Fishermen's Association for organising fishermen along the coast.  I think an effort was made, but I understand that certain stipulations were put forward to the Fishermen's Association demanding that the Department of Fisheries should nominate the majority of the members on the committee of the organisation and stating also that it would be necessary for the Department to nominate organisers. If the Minister is going to put forward impossible stipulations in regard to the new scheme such as he previously put forward to the Fishermen's Association, I believe that the scheme he has outlined will not bear the fruit that I would hope to see it bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Deputy Clery has reiterated a long litany of the promises made by the Minister in previous years.  In fact I do not think one would be far out in terming the Minister a sort of breach of promise expert.  It might be laughable in the sense that Deputies can smile at it but it is not so laughable if we remember the viewpoint of fishermen, both whole-time and spare-time, who are in a state of poverty at present.  Reference was made to a statement by the Minister for Fisheries on the 9th May in connection with this Estimate last year in which he said: &ldquo;I will be introducing a Bill for the compulsory branding of mackerel for export. That will possibly come on before the recess.&rdquo;  That was prior to the recess in 1928.  Now we are on the verge of the recess of 1929, but no such Bill has yet come before the Dáil.  Is it any wonder that one views with some suspicion the scheme proposed here to-day which has been outlined very briefly?</P>
    <P>Again, a statement was made, as Deputy Clery pointed out, that a Bill was in the draftsman's hands in regard to the re-valuation of boats. That promise has not been carried out.  That Bill has not come from the draftsman to the House up to the present although a whole year has elapsed.  In the course of the statement the Minister made reference to the kelp industry and said that certain experiments were being carried out in regard to that industry.  I would remind the Minister that, speaking on the Estimates in connection with the kelp industry last year, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; A certain proposition is before the Department of Finance with regard to the iodine factory.  It is something that we need not throw our hats in the air about as something that is extraordinarily great.  It will only provide for about twelve hundred tons of kelp in the year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why the Department of Finance turned it down I am not in a position to say.  It has not been carried out, although it was suggested by <Col N="700" /> the Department of Fisheries that it would be.  We are now told that certain experiments have to be carried out in regard to the kelp industry. Are the people on the coast only to hope that the same results will come out of these experiments as came out of the scheme which the Minister mentioned last year in connection with an iodine factory?</P>

      <P>Reference has also been made to poaching by foreign trawlers within the three-mile limit and to the violation of the extra-territorial by-laws.  As far back as six years ago, on the 18th January, 1923, the Minister for Fisheries at that time stated that he hoped in the new year to get an extra protection vessel.  Later on, when the matter was raised on the adjournment, he mentioned that he hoped to get two additional protection vessels.  Despite that, we have only one protection vessel at present, which is altogether inadequate to keep the foreign trawlers from poaching fish that should give our fishermen a livelihood. It is well known to Donegal Deputies that poaching is extensively carried on around that coast. No adequate steps are taken by the Department to cope with the foreign trawlers which come in at night with their identification numbers covered over.  I suggest to the Minister that a cruiser or patrol boat should be sent to Donegal, which would have its base either in Lough Swilly or Killybegs, in order to cope with these marauders.  Some time ago reference was made to the patrol boat &ldquo;Muirchú,&rdquo; and it was alleged that it had only a speed of ten knots.  If that is true, it is useless to try to cope with these foreign trawlers.  In that connection, I heard a story some time ago in regard to the &ldquo;Muirchú.&rdquo;  Somewhere on the Donegal coast some years ago it sighted a foreign trawler and put on full steam in order to catch it.  The trawler waited until the patrol vessel was within a very short distance of it, and then put up <Col N="701" /> speed.  The story goes that the captain of the trawler put on a gramophone record of &ldquo;The Girl I left Behind Me&rdquo;&mdash;the girl in this case, unfortunately, being the Free State patrol boat.</P>
      <P>Deputies White and Carney, no later than Friday last, referred to certain actions taken by the Foyle and Bann Fisheries Company against fishermen on Lough Foyle. I was very sorry to see the weak stand which the Minister took up in regard to asserting our rights and the rights of the fishermen in the matter.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the decision he arrived at&mdash;if it can be called a decision&mdash;and that he should stand up for our rights as contained in the Constitution, and also for the rights of the fishermen.  As I have said, the fishing industry around the coast is not in a healthy condition.  At the same time, it seems very peculiar that in the year 1924 we imported into this country £307,000 worth of fish; in the year 1925, £293,000 worth, and in the year 1926, £292,000 worth.  As regards the returns in respect to catches issued by the Fishery Department, it should be realised that the herrings which are landed around the coast are largely handled by English and Scotch fishermen.  In fact, it is estimated that between 60 and 70 per cent. of the herrings landed on our coast are handled by non-Saorstát fishermen, so that the returns published are not accurate in that the moneys derived from these catches do not come exclusively to Saorstát fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to direct attention is that the date for the opening of the herring season around Donegal is not controlled by the Department of Fisheries, but to a very large extent by the decisions arrived at by the owners of steam trawlers in Aberdeen and other places.  No later than this year the fishing season in Buncrana was curtailed to a very large extent owing to the action of these particular people in not coming into Lough Foyle earlier than they did. While the Minister is not responsible for the actions of these people, <Col N="702" /> it shows that we are not actually in control of our fisheries as we should be, and that even yet they are being controlled by people in Aberdeen, Fleetwood, Great Yarmouth and other centres.</P>
    <P>While I criticise the Department, at the same time I do not believe that it is being fairly treated by the Department of Finance.  If we are to develop the fisheries around the coast in the way in which we would all like to see them developed, sufficient money is not being expended. As an indication of that, I would refer to the fact that in 1925-6 only £75,000 was voted here for the development of fisheries, whereas in the same year the Government of Denmark voted £372,000. In 1926-27 we only voted £71,000, as against £360,000 in Denmark.  In 1927-28 we only voted £65,000, as against £340,000 in Denmark.  I quote these figures to show that the Department is not being treated in the way it should be by the Department of Finance.  Year after year, when the Estimates are presented, we find that there is a reduction on the previous year.  I suppose that is not altogether the fault of the Department of Fisheries, but rather of the Minister for Finance, who does not place the importance on the fisheries which he should.  I believe that there are big possibilities for the development of our coastal fisheries, and that larger sums should be voted, so that the Department of Fisheries would be able to help the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>So much for the question of fisheries, as dealt with by the Minister and his Department.  But the Minister, in the course of his speech, mentioned that the Committee set up to carry out the recommendations in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission were working with zeal and enthusiasm.  That may be so, but the people in the Gaeltacht do not alone want to see the Committee working with zeal and enthusiasm; they want to know what the performances of the Committee have been, what recommendations have been put into operation, <Col N="703" /> and how much employment has been given in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister mentioned that he hoped to do something in the Gaeltacht for afforestation.  Is the Minister really serious in that statement?  Is he aware that for the last four or five years the Department of Agriculture has been spending thousands of pounds upon afforestation?  Is he aware that they have acquired 50,000 acres of land and that they have planted 20,000 acres of these with millions of trees?  And is he aware that, so far as the Gaeltacht in Tirconaill is concerned, not one acre has been acquired, not one tree has been planted, and that not one penny has been spent on afforestation? They are therefore not carrying out the recommendations made in the Gaeltacht Commission Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to reclamation and to the recommendations in regard to that matter. As far as Tirconaill is concerned, no work has been carried out in the way of reclamation.  Deputy Clery made reference to the fact that recommendations were made to provide landing facilities round about the coast and in the islands round about the coast.  Still, in many of the Irish-speaking islands off the coast of Tirconaill landing slips have not been provided.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter referred to is the question of housing in the Gaeltacht area.  We have been told by the President and by many Deputies sitting on the Government Benches that a great lot has been done for housing in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, but very little has been done, so far as housing is concerned, in the rural areas, and nothing has been done in the Gaeltacht.  We were told that proposals for legislation would shortly be introduced in order to deal with the question of housing and the improvement of dwelling-houses in the Gaeltacht, but although these promises were made a long time ago they have not been carried out.  Whether they were <Col N="704" /> election promises or not I do not know, but they have not been carried out, and it has been most unfair to the inhabitants of the Gaeltacht, many of whom are living in hovels quite unfit for human beings.  The question of homespuns has been dealt with by the Minister in the course of his remarks.  I notice he was very careful not to refer to the question of handspuns. I understand that when the Minister referred to homespuns he referred to what is known round Ardara as the homespuns manufactured in the mills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I distinctly differentiated between cloth made from homespun yarns and that made from mill-spun yarns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, as far as the inspector who went to Ardara is concerned, the Minister states that that inspector is now in the centre of the industry.  In the centre of what industry?  Does the Minister mean that the inspector is in the centre of the homespun industry, because as far as the homespun industry or the handspun industry in the cottages is concerned, it is practically non est.  It simply does not exist.  The inspector who went there instead of endeavouring to develop both those branches of industry at the same time has given all his attention to developing the homespun industry in the factories.  The Minister may think I am exaggerating, but that is not so.  The people in Ardara are anxious to develop these cottage industries because they realise that a large amount of employment could be given if they were developed.  If the Minister's Department was prepared to give Ardara the help and assistance promised and expected by the people, thousands of people would be now working not alone in Ardara but in Glenties, Killybegs, Carrick, and other districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A promise was made shortly before Christmas by the inspector and also by an official from the Department that a carder, a breaker and a dyeing vat would be sent to Ardara to re-establish or to rekindle <Col N="705" /> this industry.  But nothing has been done with regard to that, and nothing has been done to give employment, although it was promised a number of years ago that the Government would do their best to develop the cottage industry.  As far as that industry is concerned no employment has been given, although orders are coming in for hand-spun material.  These orders cannot be executed owing to the fact that the people did not get the assistance promised and expected. The Minister referred to the fact that emigration is draining on the trained workers as far as the homespun industry is concerned.  We all realise that.  But does the Minister or the Executive Council realise that these people only emigrated because of the inactivity of the Minister's Department in connection with these industries?  If these industries had been re-established and if proper and sufficient attention had been paid to them, those skilled workers would not be emigrating in such large numbers as they are emigrating, because they would be able to eke out an existence at home instead of having to go abroad to make a livelihood.</P>
    <P>In that respect I might direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are in the Tirconaill Gaeltacht a few vacant factories, one at Annagry and the other at Crolly Bridge.  I understand at present there are certain individuals negotiating with the Minister's Department to establish industries in these two factories and that suggestions as put up by the certain firms in this connection are at present under the consideration of the Minister for Finance.  I hope the Minister for Fisheries, in view of the criticisms, proper criticisms and fair criticisms, expressed at it will do all he can to bring pressure upon the Minister for Finance to put up the necessary moneys to have those factories established so that some work can be provided for the people.  I am sorry I am not in a position to congratulate the Minister or his Department upon the work they have accomplished. I certainly hope that in the coming <Col N="706" /> year something more will be done than has been done in the past, so that when the next Estimate for the Department of Lands and Fisheries comes up the Minister will be able to throw back his head, expand his chest, and exclaim: &ldquo;See, something has been accomplished; something has been done.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Cassidy and Deputy White referred to the speed of the patrol boat, the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  I do not know what the speed of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; may be, and even if I did I would not tell it, for obvious reasons.  Whatever the speed of the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; I am sure it is greater than the speed at which the various Governments in the past have dealt with the Gaeltacht, and particularly in this matter to which Deputy Cassidy referred, the protection of the fisheries.  If the Minister goes into a certain room in his own Department he will find there a cartoon which was taken from the old &ldquo;Weekly Freeman&rdquo; and which commemorates some remarks I made in another place in 1908, that is to say, in the year in which the youngest of our present voters were born, in which this self-same matter of the insufficiency of the protection of our fisheries was raised.</P>
      <P>In the 21 years that have since elapsed nothing very much seems to have occurred as far as industry is concerned.  On the other hand I think the Minister last year said what seemed to me to be a very reasonable thing, that until we had really got our fisheries upon a proper basis it was not really worth while to put the cart before the horse by asking for the expenditure of money on further protection of what was at that time at any rate not a very fruitful source.  Therefore for my part I am well content to wait at least another year in the matter of the provision of another cruiser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the scheme which the Minister has very briefly outlined in general terms for the conduct of the fishing industry in the future.  I have not had time or opportunity or perhaps the capacity to form a very <Col N="707" /> considered judgment upon it, but from what he said so far as I could understand it appeared to me to offer very great hopes of a really sound and workable reorganisation of the fishing industry.  If I am right in thinking that is so, if the Minister had done nothing else during the whole of last year than to evolve such a scheme with the help of his Committee I would say the time had not been lost.  The Minister ranged over a great many topics, afforestation, reclamation, the home industries of one sort or another, kelp and housing. Deputy Cassidy suggested that nothing had been done in the way of afforestation.  I should like to see a considerable scheme of afforestation carried out in Donegal.  Deputy Cassidy and everyone else must recognise that when you are dealing with afforestation you can only profitably plant when you can get hold of suitable land to plant but not only land suitable for planting but land more suitable for planting than for anything else.  You may have land suitable for planting but for which more urgent needs exist.  As long as land can be used for tillage or for grazing you do not want to put trees in it and therefore the speed you can attain in anything of that sort is entirely dependent on your obtaining suitable land.  I am glad to know that within the past few weeks considerable progress has been made towards the acquisition of a considerable tract in Co. Donegal for the purposes of planting, though I understand the matter is not concluded. There is every reason to suppose when we consider this Estimate next year that we shall not only have a scheme of that kind but that a very considerable amount will actually have been done.  The same thing applies to reclamation.  I do not think Deputy Cassidy was quite fair to the Minister in that either. I have not first hand knowledge but I understand that a very considerable scheme of reclamation is going on at the moment in the Rosses at Donegal on a particular estate.  I also understand that there are three or four other areas where other estates are <Col N="708" /> under consideration and are likely to be proceeded with in the near future.  Then again I disagree entirely with Deputy Cassidy when he suggests that the homespun industry is dead.  It was by no means intended as a misstatement but I think it is a mischievous statement if it goes out and is understood that the homespun industry is dead in Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the hand-spun industry amongst cottage workers, and to the fact that no work at present is given out amongst them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the Deputy was particularly referring to the Ardara district.  It may be true there, but it is not true, as I am well aware, in the Burtonport and Dunlewy areas, where, to my own knowledge, a considerable amount of that work is carried on, where the wool is taken off the backs of the sheep, is carded, dyed, spun, handed to the weaver, and is brought back again to the home and sold. In that area it is by no means dead. I hope the Minister will remember, in that connection, that while Ardara is undoubtedly&mdash;I do not want to indicate jealousy of any district&mdash;the important commercial centre of the industry it is not, and what Deputy Cassidy stated confirms me in that view, the working centre of the industry.  So far as the actual home work is concerned, there is more done in Burtonport and Dunlewy than in Ardara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think as one who, like the Minister, is interested in the teaching of the language and what the Gaeltacht counts for on the cultural side, that this is an industry very well worth guarding on these lines, because the district of which I speak is the real centre of old Gaelic life. Even to-day I am told women, when they gather in the winter evenings for carding and spinning in their houses, still sing the old songs of the country and tell the old tales. There is always, as it were, a perpetual gaelicisation going on.  Therefore the place is really the centre <Col N="709" /> of Gaelic culture as well as of industry, and it is not a question merely of giving employment or of enabling a native industry still alive to be carried on.  I want to pay a tribute to the industry with which the Committee set up by the Minister has acted.  I know it has possibly done its best with relation to that matter.  It is undoubtedly a complicated and difficult matter.  You have to try, on the one hand, to preserve the traditional industry, to keep the old customs going, to keep the character of the Donegal homespun, to keep the markets which exist and also to secure other markets.  Undoubtedly the technical difficulties that arise in a study of a thing of that sort are very great.  I know that the Minister and his officials have gone to an immense amount of trouble and pains during the past twelve months, and I hope it will not be very long before we see the result.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I want to refer to briefly is the matter of housing.  The Minister has told us that he proposes, in the autumn, to make proposals for grants and leases for houses in the special housing scheme of the Gaeltacht.  I am very glad to hear that.  I was not clear from what he said whether he contemplated only grants for new houses or also grants for the improvement of existing houses.  Personally, I attach great importance to the latter.</P>
    <P>In towns your problem is, of course, the problem of providing new houses if possible on fresh, virgin sites.  In the Gaeltacht it is not precisely the case.  Everyone more or less has a house, good or bad. What is really important is helping people to make them better.  A relatively small grant to the individual made available over a considerable number of people will, in my judgment, do considerably more than relatively large sums to a smaller number of individuals. I am impenitent in my belief in the work of the Congested Districts Board, and in particular I am impenitent as to the value of the <Col N="710" /> parish committees.  I hope he will not exclude them altogether from his purview when he comes to deal with this thing in a Bill.  I hope he will make it possible for local knowledge, experience and local responsibility to come to his aid, I suggest, not only in this particular scheme but generally, because I am convinced that one of the disadvantages of the destruction of the Congested Districts Board is that the Gaeltacht is further from the central Government than it was before. It is really a curious fact that at the time when the seat of Government was in London and not in Dublin it was yet true that people in the Gaeltacht had less difficulty in getting in touch with people who were responsible for their lot than they have in these past years, because as long as the Congested Districts Board existed there was practically in every district someone&mdash;he might be a layman or a cleric&mdash;who was known to them not merely as an official but as a friend and neighbour, someone to whom they could come and bring their difficulties and who would understand them.  He would then go and discuss it with other people.  That Board is gone.  It cannot fit into our system of government. I do not ask it to be re-established, but I suggest to the Minister that he might keep his mind open in the matter of the parish committee and that where something of the kind could be done he should get the Gaeltacht once more into direct touch with his Department.  I believe he would find it of great value in his work, that it would do away with a great deal of friction that exists from time to time, and that it would give the people within the Gaeltacht what they want more than anything else in this country, not only in relation to the Minister for Fisheries but generally&mdash;the feeling that the Government is not alien, something hostile, but that it is of ourselves, something that belongs to us, something responsible to us and, not less important, something for which we are, ourselves, responsible.</P>

      <P>After the eloquent speech delivered by Deputy Mícheál O Cléirigh, which practically spilled the beans on everything I was going to say the House need not be afraid that I am going to detain them very long.  A tame poet, a few moments ago, sent me across a little screed which it might be worth while quoting as a sort of introduction to the sermon which is about to be delivered:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From year unto year</P>
      <P>In the ocean's blue rim,</P>
      <P>His beautiful promise</P>
      <P>Showed lovely but dim.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much afraid that apathy describes the Department of Fisheries, this year in particular. The figures that were quoted here in the course of the debate proved conclusively, to me anyhow, that any little hope I had of re-organisation on a proper business footing of the Irish fishing industry does not lie with the present Department of Fisheries.  Any possibility there was for the re-organisation of that industry and for the giving of any hope to the unfortunate fishermen on the seaboard of this country and of dispelling the cloud of despair that seems to hang over them, certainly will not come from this Department as exemplified in the speech delivered here to-day by the Minister for Fisheries.  Last year, when <Col N="712" /> speaking on this Vote, I expressed my sympathy with the Department in that it had not been given enough money to perform its functions. None of the suggestions made on that occasion in good faith seems to call for comment.  The Minister has achieved the distinction of drawing the finest red-herring across the trail of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in spending nearly half an hour in dealing with everything but the Estimate.  As Deputy Mícheál O Cléirigh said, it is time we came down to the facts and came back to the Estimate we are supposed to vote for or against in this House to-day. The facts are these.  In the five years from 1925-26 to 1929-30 the two important items in the Department of Fisheries Estimate have shown a steady and unceasing decrease.  For fishery development in 1925-26 there was a total of £39,225; in 1926-27 it had gone down to £34,000; in 1927-28 it went down to £27,000; in 1928-29 it went down to £22,000, and this year it is £18,330.  The same thing applies to the Estimate for rural industries for the last four years, with the exception of this year, where there is a very slight increase.  It just struck me in examining this Estimate for the Department of Fisheries this year for the whole of the Free State that the sum total of £18,330 for fishery development compares very badly with the £40,000 spent by the old Congested Districts Board in the Gaeltacht counties alone, in the year 1912-13.  It speaks badly for a Department set up by a so-called independent Irish Government, in an Irish independent, so-called, State. If there was any hope from this Department of Fisheries, if the people of the Gaeltacht were to receive any inspiration, I do not think they would find it in the speech delivered by the Minister in introducing this Estimate.  Certainly it was a grand series of promises and an exhibition of a man with Aladdin's wonderful lamp trying to produce all the wonderful miracles Aladdin was alleged to have produced.  The Minister has <Col N="713" /> not referred to the fact that in 1928 the imports of fish into the Irish Free State were £150,283.  In the five months of 1929 the imports were £161,436, whilst the exports for the corresponding five months of this year have decreased.  Last year, in the debate for External Affairs, I think I made a suggestion to the Minister in charge of that Department that steps should be taken by our foreign consular service to open up diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government with a view to providing markets.  I think that suggestion was sneered at.  The Minister said our foreign representatives could not be made commercial travellers to sell fish, but the representatives of a greater and more powerful Government than this consider it a primary question to resume relations with a view to capturing markets.</P>

      <P>I was just leading up to the point that the best market for our fish, as stated in the report of a Committee that was set up and known as the report of the Imperial Economic Committee on the marketing and preparing for market of foodstuffs produced within the Empire&mdash;Fifth Report, Fish&mdash;was the market in Central and Eastern Europe, and that it was the only market which was capable of developing apart from the British nation itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> I was pointing out that the Department of Fisheries at the present moment is responsible for the Gaeltacht areas under its control and it is supposed to have a Minister in this House prepared to answer questions as to conditions, economic and otherwise, in the Gaeltacht.  If the Minister, instead of producing the series of promises which he produced last year, could give us any indication that an effort was about to be made to revive the fast dwindling industry that we have on our seaboard, and to secure even a partial market for the cured herrings which on the admission of foreign importers are amongst the best produced in Europe, it would be much more advisable. If he had given us some indication that steps would be taken to secure those things, there might be some possibility of giving him a little further time and some credence, but I am afraid that is not possible in the circumstances.  He mentioned that further legislation was necessary in connection with territorial waters. Last year the same thing was mentioned and I think in the year preceding the same proposition was put before the House.  When he was introducing the Estimate both last year and this year the Minister mentioned that he would shortly introduce a Bill. A Bill for a good many things has been a long time coming and this item of extra territorial jurisdiction is one which should long ago have engaged the attention of the Department of Fisheries and the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy mentioned that poaching in Donegal has been going on continuously, and particularly during the last twelve or eighteen months.  The same thing applies to West Cork.  The patrol boat, which has been described as a fishery protection cruiser and which has been costing £8,000 per annum for the last six years, could not in the nature of things give satisfaction with a seaboard such as the Free State has. The suggestion was made last year that it might be far more profitable if some of the rum chasers that the American Government employ for <Col N="715" /> the purposes of enforcing prohibition were procured in order to deal with the poachers.  In reply to that suggestion the Minister promised another cruiser, but that promise has not materialised.  I suggest seriously that he should take into consideration the possibility of negotiating with the Army Air Corps and see whether it would not be possible to substitute a few decent seaplanes for the Bristol bombing planes they have and these seaplanes could be utilised for the purpose of protecting Irish fisheries instead of cruisers of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; type.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should give some more information as to the establishment of the Sea Fisheries Co-operative Association.  I was glad when he mentioned that, and I thought it was some indication of returning sanity on the part of his Department, but now I am beginning to see the snag in the proposal. The Minister said that a reduction in the Estimate was accounted for by the elimination of £1,100 estimated last year for the organisation of fishermen.  What is this new Co-operative Association going to cost?  How does the Minister propose to go about its re-establishment? Is it to be a local or purely a national organisation?  Is it to be controlled directly or indirectly by the Department?  What voice will fishermen have in its control and direction?  Some additional information should be given on the statement that boats would be supplied to competent fishermen.  I know some competent fishermen who have been endeavouring to secure boats for a long time but up to the present there is no possibility of securing those boats.  I am afraid that under the present regulations there will not be much possibility either.  I would like to know how that scheme will operate in areas where no security can be found. There are very few areas where security can be got for the provision of boats and gear.</P>
    <P>I would like to know something about the insurance scheme that the <Col N="716" /> Minister mentioned.  Will it be a comprehensive scheme?  Is it going to include the insurance of the crews? How will this scheme of allocation in connection with each catch work out?  How will the shares of each catch be distributed as between the Department of Fisheries and the fisherman-owner of the boat?  Mention was made of a revaluation of boats and gear and the Minister stated that the Committee set up to inquire into the £120,000 arrears of loans due on boats was working actively and was going to take into consideration each individual case.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest that he should take his courage in his hands and come to the Dáil honestly and openly, irrespective of whether it will create a sensation in the House or not, and declare that he is going to stop tinkering with this problem, that he will admit he cannot collect the arrears and that it is physically impossible for the fishermen to pay, and in the circumstances that he is prepared to wipe out the arrears in 98 per cent. of the cases.  I will give the Minister a few cases later on to prove that delay in the consideration of many cases has resulted in a considerable amount of hardship to fishermen, particularly along the west coast.  There is one portion of the Report of the Economic Committee set up by the Imperial Conference which I would like to quote: &ldquo;A vigorous handling of the difficulties of education and marketing, such as we have recently witnessed in the reorganisation of the Free State dairying industry, should enable the Irish Free State, situated as it is in the midst of good fishing grounds, well supplied with harbours and at no great distance from big markets, to take far more nearly its due share of the fishing harvest around its shores than it has so far succeeded in doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should be able to produce some comprehensive scheme for consideration here.  I am not going into the minor points with regard to piers, slips and harbours.  I regret to notice that there is a decrease in the Estimate in respect to <Col N="717" /> those things.  The thing that forces me to the belief that this Vote should be referred back is the conclusion I have come to that the Executive Council are not serious in their desire to assist the fishing industry and are not serious in their desire to put into effect the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission.  It would be far more honest to abolish the Department of Fisheries altogether.  Under the present Government there appears to be little hope of saving the Irish fishing industry, and there appears to be little hope of saving the last stronghold of the Irish language, the Gaeltacht.  It would be much better for the Government to abolish the Department entirely rather than to be tinkering with this problem by way of granting a few thousand pounds each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy Mr. T. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(Cork): I listened to-day with great interest to a number of speeches that were carefully read out to the House by the Opposition Deputies.  I expected that these speeches would contain new programmes or reveal some progress of ideas in connection with deep-sea fishing.  They contained nothing but a severe criticism of the Minister for Fisheries and his Department.  I will not use a stronger term than that.  I would wish to remind this House seriously to-day that we are discussing one of the most important industries associated with our nation. I have some recollections of the fishing industry.  I was myself connected side by side with the father and brother of Deputy Hugo Flinn in the year 1882 in the mackerel fishing in the South of Ireland. At that time there were Irish boats and Irish skilled captains who were able to win the golden harvest from the deep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But Deputies must remember that a vast change has taken place in the last half century.  Those nations that were able to rule themselves and had the full command of the money raised by their own Government developed their fisheries in those years.  They were given grants <Col N="718" /> for improved boats.  Our fishermen, unfortunately, in those far-off days had to work in miserable boats.  No Government cared anything whether they would win or lose.  So bad at that time was the outlook that a great priest, Father Davis, went over to London and appealed to an English lady, the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, to come to the rescue of the unfortunate Cape Clear fishermen in his parish.  It was useless to appeal to the Government that ruled in this country at the time.  But his appeal was listened to by that good lady. The Baroness Burdett-Courts advanced some thousands of pounds without any interest whatever for the purpose of procuring boats for our local fishermen at Cape Clear. That aid heartened and encouraged the fishermen in winning a living from the deep.  Before that they had been looking from their hillsides at the fishermen from the Isle of Man and the fishermen from England and France carrying away from their very doors the golden harvest of the deep while they, with their families, stood by in despair and with bad conditions all round them.</P>
    <P>Through the years the fishery industry struggled, and at a later period the Congested Districts Board came along and helped the fishermen.  In this very House, as a member of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries, I proposed many a resolution asking that more should be done to help the fishermen, but it was all in vain very often.  Those in authority at that time were only concerned with cattle and the development of horse-breeding.  I could scarcely get an audience to listen to me when I was appealing for generous treatment for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>But coming down now to our own day, thank God I am addressing the representatives of the Irish nation. No amount of pessimism and criticism of that kind from the other side will wipe out that fact.  In the words of a very distinguished American that I met to-day as I was coming to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will come back to fishing.  Since I entered the Dáil two years ago I have heard nothing from the Opposition with regard to fisheries and the fishing industry but the most adverse criticism of the Government. The Government have been accused of the omissions and the things that were done wrong, and the results of these in the years before they took over this country from the old régime.  The magic wand of the Minister for Fisheries was to change all that at once.  No doubt whatever, if during the last year or two the Minister had a united House behind him he would have done better work for the fishing industry. If the Deputies on the Opposition side put politics on one side and joined like one man and tried to bring back the fishing industry to the state of prosperity in which that industry once was, it would be much better for the House and for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find here to-day? Where is the programme for the improvement of the fishing industry? Where is the idea put forward to secure steam trawlers that would compete with the English trawlers? Here in Dublin, and I am speaking particularly now to the Government Deputies, you have the good luck to have a plucky energetic company sending a number of trawlers fishing into the deep seas.  They have seven steam trawlers at a cost of £3,000 or £4,000 each.  On these trawlers there is only one Irish captain, and I am glad to say he is from my constituency.  I hope that when the Minister for Fisheries is looking for experts for his Committee that he will put Captain Coughlan on it.  Deputies need not laugh nor smile now because Captain Coughlan has a wide experience of the fishing industry from Iceland to Germany and down to North Africa.  He is the competent captain of one of these steam trawlers.  He is the man who taught the Icelanders for a company in Iceland how to fish some years ago. <Col N="720" /> He is in the prime of life.  He is the captain of the latest boat that has been added to their fishing fleet.  He tells me that there is immense wealth to be earned by the Irish people if the Deputies here made a proper gesture, and if we would provide five more steam trawlers they would be needed to supply the fish for Dublin alone.  We ought to go farther.  Support instead of criticism ought to be given to the Government.  What are they getting? I heard Deputy Cassidy discussing this matter to-day.  That Deputy talked about forestry last week and he voted against the Forestry Estimate.  If that Deputy had his way there would be no men employed in forestry to-day, because there would be no money available to pay them.  Really that is not the way to build up a great national industry.  Let Deputies come here with some constructive policy and some constructive ideas and place them before the House.</P>
    <P>Now, if we had five more steam trawlers we could supply Dublin with fish.  I look to the time when we will have a quarter-million more people here in Dublin.  I will have passed away then, but I have no doubt that in not so many years from now there will be a quarter of a million more people in Dublin, and in that number alone there will be a huge market for the fish caught along our shore.  The Government is not getting the proper encouragement from the Opposition sections here in this House.  It is only from the Independent Deputies that the Government can get the support that is deserved.  I bow to them as decent men.  Since I came here I have seen them loyally sticking to their oaths and supporting and encouraging every practical movement that is brought forward for the betterment of the country.  I am glad to say that for them; I am under no obligation to them, but as honest Irishmen it is a pleasure to us to see them here shouldering the burden side by side with us.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is great hope for our deep-sea fisheries. Down in Cork I see the French with <Col N="721" /> their lobster boats.  They come along with improved boats that are capable of carrying five men each to the sea, and they have very suitable accommodation on board.  What facilities for lobster fishing have the men of Hare Island?  There are only three of them in a little boat, and they have only a sail to protect them when they go to Waterford or Wexford.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Mr. Lynch, the Minister, is setting up this Committee on which there will be experts. The Minister also stated that there will be money behind it.  That is the first great need for the building up of the fisheries.  Money is required and it is not the miserable criticism that we hear here and the tinkering and sneering that is to build up our nation.  Let us put politics aside and let us approach these great economic questions and we will win prosperity for the country.  If we work together we will be all right.  Some Deputies here are so obsessed with politics that they think that because President Cosgrave and his Government is in office that nothing can be right.  Nothing will please some Deputies here.  As far as the Government is concerned, I would ask them to provide plenty of money to get the best experts that the Saorstát can supply in the way of skilled fishermen.</P>
    <P>To encourage that Committee I would make this suggestion now, that during the Recess Mr. Lynch, the Minister for Fisheries, and Deputy Lemass would go on a trip on one of those Dublin steam trawlers and see how the work of the fishermen is being done.  They would come back with some knowledge of fisheries.  They would come back with a practical knowledge of the work; they would in that trip learn a great deal about the business.  It is in that way by taking up this matter in a big way that we are going to make this country great and prosperous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the views of Deputy Sheehy in advocating that a larger sum be given to the Ministry of Fisheries.  Complaints <Col N="722" /> against the Fisheries Department are more or less hardy annuals but there are just a few questions I desire to put to the Minister.  First of all, I would like to know whether there will be any representatives of the fishermen's organisation on the new Committee to be set up in regard to revaluation of boats.  Pending the decisions of that Committee will the Minister postpone the execution of such decrees as he has already got against the fishermen?  In Arklow there are a number of such decrees. The Fisheries Department are urged by the Department of Finance to take proceedings against these men who, through no fault of their own but through stress of weather and other causes, have lost their nets and other gear.  The Department got decrees against them for the full amount and I urge the Minister not to execute them pending the decisions of the new Committee.  If some people are going to be let off by 50 per cent. or the amount they paid in 1914, the men to whom I refer should not be charged a full hundred per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I would like to know whether the recommendation to have a training school in Arklow will be carried out.  I also agree with Deputy Sheehy in saying that until we supply the fishermen with boats and gear similar to those used by the fishermen in Scotland, France and Belgium we will not be able to compete with the foreigners who come within the three mile limit and take our fish.  Perhaps the Committee would also consider the hardship caused to a number of fishermen who had to pay many calls owing to insurance while they got very little in return.  I ask the Minister to take into consideration the excess amount which these men paid through insurance and so forth.  The Minister should also consider the question of improving the transport of fish.  At present the fishermen get very little for their share of the catch, while the dealers and hawkers get practically all the benefit.  The men who often risk their lives to get fish get practically nothing out of it.  There should be a quick and efficient transport <Col N="723" /> to the inland towns, where a taste for fish could be developed. Consumers would then pay lower prices than they are now paying while the fishermen would get better returns.  Again I would press on the Minister's consideration the claims of those who are now unable to purchase nets, as they lost those which they had in former years, and also owing to the fact that persons who acted as sureties for them are now acting for others.  Under the new scheme for loans the men should, as I say, be given better boats, better engines and better gear in every way in order to prevent foreign trawlers from taking our fish within the three mile limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. White Dr. White">
      <NameTxt>Dr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have admiration for the Minister for Fisheries and for the officials who work under him. I believe that the Fianna Fáil Deputies really have a grádh for them in the depths of their hearts.  At all times, when I approached them on any topic or scheme that would be of benefit to the fishing folk in my part of the country, I found them most willing and obliging, and invariably what I asked was done. In Helvic Harbour they erected beacons and also gave facilities for curing operations.  In Ballinagown they supplied the fishermen with boxes and otherwise helped them to get better prices for their fish. Small motor craft have been supplied to many persons in Waterford under the loans system, and I understand that the advances are being well repaid.  If the efforts towards co-operation which are now being made are brought to a conclusion, the Waterford fishermen should represent the nucleus of a good local branch in the general co-operative movement.  In regard to loans to fishermen, unhappily, when they go to fish they are not always successful.  I know several places in Waterford where men have obtained loans from the Fisheries Department, but, owing to the scarcity or complete absence of fish, they find it very hard to meet their liabilities to the Department.  In some of <Col N="724" /> these cases where loans were issued, guarantors came forward.  I think that where it can be proved that the fisherman has worked honestly &mdash;if necessary that could be verified by the Civic Guards&mdash;the Department should deal leniently with him and his guarantor.</P>
      <P>I believe that the cardinal problem that faces the inland fisheries&mdash; I mean fisheries within the three-mile limit&mdash;is the question of effective protection.  I know the &ldquo;Muirchú,&rdquo; the old &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; but I am afraid that she is not able to patrol the entire coast-line.  When you recollect that the coast-line around Cork extends for 300 miles, you can realise the length of the Saorstát coast-line.  I think that it is essential to the whole question of fisheries that additional vessels should be acquired.  About twenty years ago, I remember a Danish training ship coming into Waterford having on board between thirty and forty cadets who were being taught everything about fishing and seamanship. If a couple of vessels of that kind were acquired for the Saorstát, I think that not only would these pupils learn their duties as fishermen, but they would form the nucleus of what I hope to see one day, namely, an Irish mercantile marine.  Recently in the Dáil we had a debate in reference to the Port of Dublin and foreign coasting vessels.  Year by year Irish-owned vessels are falling into foreign hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a plain Irishman I think myself that until we begin to carry our own goods from abroad, and to carry goods we export from Ireland to other parts, this little nation can never go ahead as it should.  Therefore, by instituting these guardships, if you like to call them that, you would do several things.  You would help to avoid unemployment; you would provide sailors and fishermen for the nation, and you would protect your fisheries.  I think it is rather a practical proposition that will have to be looked into very speedily.  I believe that beneath the waves that surround our coast there lies as rich a harvest as <Col N="725" /> there is beneath the soil of Ireland. It is not a question for any individual in the Government.  It is a Governmental question, and, as I said, until some solution like that is brought about, we will not go ahead as a nation.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the people of Ireland, per head, eat less fish than the people of any other nation.  I think that if the virtues of fish as a food were explained to our people, and if an intensive campaign to explain the value of fish as a food were entered upon it would stimulate the public interest and, I hope, the appetite for fish.  I realise that, perhaps, everything is not done that could be done to engender such a desire.  I would suggest with great respect that when this fishing campaign is being launched&mdash;I am sure it will be very carefully thought out&mdash;first of all, the fishermen should be approached, under the co-operative scheme, and that in co-operation with the transport departments, the Great Southern and other railways, you would have established what are called fish trains.  One thing to be remembered in regard to fish is that you must have it fresh.  With, perhaps, the exception of milk, you are dealing with the most perishable food you could deal with.  Therefore, you must have rapidity in transport both on the sea and up to the quayside, and from the quayside to the train, by means of motor lorries or other fast vehicles.  The railways should be compelled, if necessary, to have suitable refrigerators or to have ice wagons, or whatever is necessary to bring fresh fish to the doors of the people in Dublin, Waterford and every city and town in Ireland. I believe if we are going to make this co-operative scheme a success there must be a certain amount of drive in it, a certain amount of intensity.</P>
    <P>I have always looked upon the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fisheries as twin Departments. I am not an agriculturist myself, but I take a very deep interest in fishing, and I feel very <Col N="726" /> jealous when I find that you have something like £408,000 odd devoted to agriculture, and only £42,000 handed over to the Minister for Fisheries.  I think somebody said here to-night that he regarded the fishery industry as the second most important industry in the State.  I agree with that, and I think that all reasonable men must agree that you cannot do a lot of practical good on £42,000 a year.  It is no use blaming the Minister for Fisheries.  This is a national question, and one man cannot do very much.  I am firmly of opinion that the great necessity at the present moment is adequate protection for the fisheries within the three mile limit of the Irish coastline.  Unless you have that you are throwing your hat at it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned Russia. The most valuable fish in Ireland, with the exception of salmon, is, I think, herring.  Russia, I understand, used to buy a good deal of our salted herring.  Russia has been in a disturbed condition, though I do not know what state it is in now.  I would certainly suggest the opening up of trade relations with Russia.  If she is generous, and does not want us to give our produce to her and remain for too long out of the money&mdash;in other words, if it is not too much on the Kathleen Mavourneen style&mdash;I certainly would advocate the re-opening of trade relations with Russia.  Of course, there are other countries, too, in the Frigid Zone&mdash;Poland, Finland, Germany, etc., which are very keen on fatty fish, such as herring.  I would, with all respects, suggest to the Minister that trade relations be opened with these countries and that the curing, the branding and the grading of herrings be looked to at once. Of course, if there is no adequate protection for fishermen within the three-mile limit, everything comes to nought.  As I said, I admire the Minister and his officials for the work they have done and are doing for the country.  I am delighted to hear the Minister mentioning that he is going to go ahead with the co-operative movement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am half ashamed to admit that I listened very attentively to the Minister's opening statement, because I have listened before to the Minister, and I read his speeches, and, even since the last time, I have read his speeches throughout the country and I cannot find that any of his promises have been carried out.  It is not a bit surprising that Deputies who spoke on this side of the House have laid stress on the point that the Minister was a wonderful man for making promises and for not keeping them. On 28th February, 1927, the day before the Fishery Conference, he stated publicly that he had placed a scheme for the revaluation of boats before the Minister for Finance and that he was glad to say he had sanctioned it.  On the Estimates last year, he said that the Bill was drafted.  This is 1929, and we have not heard anything since about the revaluation of the boats.  Great surprise has been evinced by Deputies as to why the Minister should not have proceeded with this scheme for the revaluation of boats.  I pointed out to the Minister last year on the Estimates that his scheme for revaluation was useless.  Boats valued at £600 and £800, taken from Arran and transferred to Galway and sold for 15/- are not worth revaluation. The remainder of the craft there, which he had to pay a caretaker 1/6 a week to mind, should be let rot, and the whole scheme for revaluation should have been dropped.  Revaluation should have been dropped years ago.  Four or five years ago it might have had some effect in Arran and Cleggan, and these places, but the revaluation promised in 1927 and last year was of no use to the fishermen who did own the boats at one time.  That was the principal and only reason that, I suppose, the Minister did not carry out that scheme of revaluation. What I blame him for is that he did not know the boats had gone rotten and that the nets and fishing gear and the boats themselves were being sold for such ridiculous prices. A boat that cost £400 or £500 being <Col N="728" /> sold for 12/6 or 15/-, and the highest price paid being £10, shows there was gross carelessness, that the Minister did not know his job, and that he did not look into it when he promised that he would get these boats revalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day the Minister made a statement about rural industries which, with other statements he made, goes to show that the Minister is not sincere when making promises that everything will be all right if we only pass the Estimate.  He said to-day that the rural industry schemes in the West of Ireland were a burden on the public funds.  Later he said that by starting a central depot for the sale of the articles produced here and relieving the manageresses of the onus of sales he could increase the wages and make them a paying proposition.  Last year the central depot was discussed on the Gaeltacht White Paper, and it was definitely promised that there would be a central depot set up for the sale of cardigans and knitted work of all descriptions made in these schools.  The central depot has not been set up since.  What has happened?  Only two or three weeks ago the Minister sent down an inspector and reduced the wages for knitting garments from 10d. to 6d. per garment.  A girl working 14 hours per day will knit 30 cardigans per week and thus earn about 15/-.  Those who do the measuring and seaming and pressing, etc., are paid much less: 1/3 for 16 cardigans for measuring, 9d. for seaming 8 cardigans; 9d. for button-holing and putting on buttons on 8 cardigans.  If they came up here and did some button-holing I suppose they would make more money.  That is a very mean way of dealing with the rural industries&mdash;to promise last year to start a central depot which he never started.  He said that these industries are a burden on the State. These cardigans are sold for 6/9. The material and the labour employed costs 4/3.  The knitter makes thirty cardigans a week and the profit on each cardigan is half-a-crown. How then can the Minister say that these rural industries in <Col N="729" /> Connemara are a failure and a burden upon the State?  If they are, it is due to officialism and nothing else.  We are going ahead with them all the same.  When the Minister starts a central depot he is going to increase the wages to what they were before.  I only speak for a small area of ten miles square in my own district where there were six factories working under the old Congested Districts Board.  Last year since the Minister promised a central depot three were closed down and the wages were reduced from one pound to fifteen shillings for a fourteen hours day.  I do not think that that shows efficiency in the Department of the Ministry for Lands and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has control of the housing as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  I have spoken on various occasions here on that subject and the Minister for Local Government has invariably put me off by the statement that the scheme is now to be dealt with by the Minister for Fisheries.  Last year I put down a question and asked the Minister what he intended to do with the housing question in the Gaeltacht. Any Deputy who knows the housing conditions in the Gaeltacht knows that the question is as pressing there as in Dublin or Cork.  He told me at that time that the heads of his Department were conferring with a view to coming to some decision as to future policy.  That conference was to be over after the Christmas recess.  I asked again in February the same question and I was to have an answer before Easter&mdash;they were still sitting.  I asked did they keep on sitting regularly. They are now at least nine or ten months deciding as to what attitude the Government is to take in regard to housing, and we only hear the same bald statement that they have sat.  We do not know what they are going to do or what decision they have come to.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to rural industries, I do not believe the Minister is in earnest.  I think I have proved he is not.  As regards housing, I cannot believe he is in <Col N="730" /> earnest; as regards fishing, and as regards the revaluation of boats, it is evident that he is not in earnest. As regards the whole Gaeltacht problem, how can we have any hope that anything is going to be done in the Gaeltacht when the three principal items that the Minister has to deal with&mdash;housing, rural industries, and fishing&mdash;are neglected and are regarded as a burden on the State.  How can we, in these circumstances, expect anything from the Minister or his Department for the Gaeltacht?</P>

      <P>I want to repudiate the statement made here to-day that there has been anything done for the development of the inland fisheries by the Department of Fisheries.  Since the inception of the Saorstát nothing has been done to clear the mouths of the rivers going into the lakes, with the result that trout cannot get up to the spawning beds.  Men who make their living at these lakes will tell you that.  Nothing has been done to improve conditions there to allow the trout to make their way up to the spawning beds.  What has been done on the following lakes, Derravagh, Glore, Lane and Sheehan? Something may have been done on the Pike Pond at Mullingar, but that does not indicate that in the main locks anything has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that serious consideration has been given to the reduction in the Estimates for the Minister's Department since 1925 and 1926, largely because of the fact that we have a reduction also in the population along the coast in the Gaeltacht districts throughout the country.  It is no wonder when we have no money at the disposal of the Fisheries Department or when the fishery industry is not developed that we should have serious depopulation along the coast.  The Gaeltacht Commission was established in 1925 and as a result of that inquiry many recommendations have been placed before the Department of Fisheries for its consideration and its <Col N="733" /> adoption, and foremost amongst them was one for the revaluation of the boats the fishermen had at the time and which were valued at the inflated prices that ruled in 1921 and 1922.  Before the Commission there was placed what was called recommendation 30.  Since that period we have been continually promised that this recommendation would get consideration like many of the others that were placed before the Fisheries Department.  He quoted from what the Department themselves have to say about the matter.  I will read the paragraph.  The Fisheries Report for 1923-1925 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position of these large loans and the accumulation of heavy arrears has become one of the most serious problems confronting the Department of Fisheries which is consulting with the Department of Finance in order to find a way out.  It is evident that the position of hopeless indebtedness under which many of our fishermen are labouring does not create a condition favourable to the rapid development of the industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that they have been since finding a way out, and, like Moses, I am afraid they are in the dark yet, because it is quite evident that nothing has come from all the recommendations and promises we have got from the Department since 1923.  In his opening statement the Minister mentioned communications with islanders.  Some time ago on the West Mayo coast extreme difficulties were experienced by some islanders who had been isolated owing to the continuous storms along the coast.  The people were actually starving, and things had become so bad that the Government were commissioned to send down the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; to bring some relief to the place.  That took three or four weeks.  The result was that people were in a most pitiable plight on those islands.  I put a question a year ago or more about that particular difficulty and the Minister stated that the matter was getting consideration. <Col N="734" /> It is like the other deferred questions which have been getting consideration for some years past It is very serious, and I trust even now that it will get attention, and that the coming winter will see that the people on the islands off our coast will be able to get some relief if such difficulties occur as have occurred during the past two years.</P>
    <P>I notice that in many places around the coast the salmon fishermen are anxious to have the season for salmon opened earlier.  Requests have been made to promote legislation to that end, and so far no result in the Department has been brought about.  I would like to impress on the Minister that is really deserving of consideration, because salmon appear apparently much earlier than they did when the fishery laws were instituted, perhaps centuries ago.  It is very important that the fishermen should be given permission to start salmon fishing earlier along the coast.</P>
    <P>On the Afforestation Vote the other day, the Minister for Agriculture, when I put the point to him about planting in West Mayo, said that there was very little land in Mayo fit for afforestation.  I would like to refer the Minister for Finance to the fact that all over the coast we can point out the tree stumps of ancient forests which we had in Mayo.  I think that should be an encouragement for him to try and replace those old trees which existed in former days.  Their existence in the past, I think, is evidence that there is a possibility of the same occurring in the future if only an attempt were made to replace them.  I think they would thrive, and it is worth a chance.  We were promised also by the Minister, in his opening speech to-day, that the people in the Gaeltacht would get encouragement for the building of houses.  I hope his promise, unlike past promises, will be given effect to.  I am anxious to know how soon we are going to have funds made available for that purpose, because, up to the present, the House has not been approached for a Vote on that particular issue.  I do not see how <Col N="735" /> anything can be done in the fall of the coming year or the winter, in that respect.  If anything is to be done in the near future, it is time that the House should be approached and that a Vote should be requested for this particular Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehy referred to our programme.  It is not for us to formulate a programme for the Department of Fisheries.  After all, that is their particular job.  It is ours to see and criticise the working of that Department. Deputy Sheehy, I think, must be under some delusion if he suggests that it is our place to formulate a programme for the Minister. As I say, it is his business, and he should see to it and give us some results in the near future instead of promises.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. White expressed admiration for the Minister and the work he has done in his Department.  If Deputy Dr. White was speaking of some performance that the Minister was about to do, I would say that Deputy Dr. White was a super-optimist; but looking at the work that has not been done by the Minister in the past, and having been on a couple of deputations to the Minister's Department, I will borrow a motto from Dante, and will nail it up on the door of the Department of Fisheries: &ldquo;Abandon hope all ye who enter here.&rdquo;  For the last five or six years&mdash;not alone has the Minister not done anything to help fisheries, but he has left them in a very much worse position than they were when he started.  We had put up questions in the House, and every time they were brought up they were met by the Minister in a manner that would lead ordinary outside people to believe that as far as fisheries were concerned, the Minister was in the kindergarten class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day we were talking about territorial waters.  The Minister stated that if they are territorial waters they belong to us. Another time I had a question put. I asked the Minister why he did not collect the fines that were imposed <Col N="736" /> on foreign trawlers, and the Minister made the answer in this wise: &ldquo;I have no jurisdiction outside the Saorstát,&rdquo; said the Minister. Foolish Charlie knows that the Minister has no jurisdiction outside the Saorstát.  He need not have come here to tell us that.  What I want to know is, has the Minister any jurisdiction inside the Saorstát, and that if there were trawlers encroaching inside the three-mile limit, and if they were fined, why these fines were not collected.  &ldquo;I have no jurisdiction outside the Saorstát,&rdquo; says the Minister.  But if the trawlers got within the three-mile limit, and if they were fined £100, and if that money was never collected, what I want to know is&mdash; has the Minister any jurisdiction inside the Free State?  He talked about looking for extra territorial waters.  We do not want them.  We can dispense with them.  What we want is our own.  If there are territorial waters that belong to us, if there is a trawler arrested for poaching within the three-mile limit, I take it it is inside the territorial waters, and as I said, I take it it is not entitled to fish inside that limit. Why then is not the trawler detained until the fine is obtained?  If it happened in any other country in the world it would be detained, they would fine the skipper, and if, he did not pay they would simply sell his boat and gear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably he is not. I bow to your ruling.  At the same time the Minister is responsible for the patrol boat that is supposed to protect the fishermen around the coast of the Saorstát.  We have had repeated complaints from Donegal that foreign trawlers are coming in there and poaching with their registration numbers camouflaged with <Col N="737" /> canvas.  A schoolboy, if he had a rifle, could arrest a boat and take her into port.  This glorified sardine tin that we have patrolling the coast of the Saorstát &mdash; the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know what it is doing, although we are spending upwards of £8,000 a year on it.  Any child could at any time off the coast of Fanit Head have arrested any of these trawlers for illegal fishing.  After all, a helmsman is not armour-plated.  If you sent a schoolboy out with a rifle a helmsman on a trawler has to cave in whether he likes it or not, unless they are going to erect a special steel casing for him.  We have this beautiful boat, the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo;; we are spending £8,000 a year on it.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Mullins that if they got a few fast motor launches and gave power to the local fishery inspectors, in co-operation with the Civic Guards, to be armed, they could do all that is necessary, and you would not require this patrol boat at all because it is only a white elephant as far as we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the question of the several fisheries that we debated last Friday, the question as a whole is one which should receive the attention of the Minister.  It is not to the credit of any country that a few people, with very doubtful vested interests, should control hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of fisheries both in the inland and tidal waters of the Saorstát.  It means that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred people who are deriving a huge income from the several fisheries of the Saorstát are spending it outside this country.  I quoted the instance of one company, only one member of which resided in Ireland, the rest of the company being domiciled in England.  As a matter of fact, the manager of the company did not even know the members of the company.  The one member of the company who resides in Ireland resides in the Six Counties.  They are making an annual income of something like £9,000, and that money is being spent in England. <Col N="738" /> Monte Carlo, or somewhere else. The fishermen who are depending on the fisheries for a livelihood and who would spend the money accrued from the fisheries on themselves and their families in this country are denied the right of earning their livelihood.  Hence the big emigration. Over six thousand in a few years went from Donegal.  If the Minister wants to give an opportunity to the fishermen along the seaboard he should tackle this question of the several fisheries with all the resources he has at his command. Do not leave it to the individual fisherman to do what the Government should be doing.  It was always the way with Government Departments, and particularly with the Department of Fisheries, to shove a job on somebody else.  The poor fishermen are not in a position to fight big, expensive lawsuits.  They could not do it and it is up to the Ministry to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us an analogy the other day.  It was about the most silly performance that I have ever listened to in my life.  He said that if a man is using implements on a farm which he claims to be his. but which are not his, and the real owner or the man who thinks he is the real owner comes along, his obvious remedy is to go to the police. Very good.  I will take the Minister up on that.  It hinges on this very question.  What we were discussing at the particular time was the question of the fishery in the Foyle.  I put up a contention that even granted that the Foyle and Bann Company were the legal owners of the several fisheries of the Foyle, that they still were not entitled to bring armed men there from another State to seize gear belonging to fishermen from the peninsula of Inishowen.  Taking the Minister up on his own analogy, would not it have been a proper thing for the Foyle and Bann Company to have come along to the fishery inspector in Moville and to the Civic Guards and said: &ldquo;Here are people fishing illegally on a several fishery which is our property, and which we hold according to charter&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Granted that any proprietors of a several fishery are entitled to use force for the seizure of gear which is being used illegally on what they term their own possessions, at the same time they are not entitled to import armed forces from another State.  That is the crux of the whole thing.  We have had a series of promises from the Minister since we came in here&mdash;for almost two years&mdash;and I have yet to see any of those promises carried out.  A very important thing&mdash;it has been referred to several times in the debate here to-day&mdash;was the revaluation of boats and gear.  The Minister promised us eighteen months ago that the question of revaluation would be dealt with practically immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not longer ago than about two months I had here the case of a man who was unable to pay up his instalments. The Department was coming down on him with a very heavy hand indeed.  These boats and gear were issued at a time when boats cost perhaps three times what they would cost now.  The same applies to the gear.  There were numbers of the fishermen who had actually paid half the cost of the boats and gear.  The boats and gear were seized from them because they could <Col N="740" /> not pay up the instalments.  They found themselves in this position: that the break came and they could not pay their instalments.  The prices of fish went down, and the fishing was bad four to seven years ago.  These men had got their gear and boats during the time of the war.  After that time fish were scarce and prices were bad, and the fishermen discovered that they were not able to keep up the instalments. In a number of cases the Ministry of Fisheries came down on these men like a ton of bricks.  They did not give them a dog's chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one.  I gave the Minister one twelve months ago.  That was the case of the brothers Hegarty, who got a boat valued at £3,000.  They paid up £1,500 of that money and then the Department took back the boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And I told the Deputy at the time that the Hegartys had asked that the boat be taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that any justification? They were manly enough. These men got a boat valued at £3,000.  They were hardy fishermen, and they paid £1,500 of the £3,000. They were manly enough to ask the Minister to take up the boat when the prices fell and when fishing was bad all over the country.  But was that any justification for what the Minister did?  If these men had paid that money on furniture in a shop they would have got some consideration. They would have been left with some part of that furniture for which they had paid £1,500.  What did they get from the Minister?  Up to the present they have got nothing. That is one instance.  If the Minister wants any more instances I can give them, but I do not want to dwell on this too long.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another thing that comes under the Department of Fisheries and, of course, it is the usual round of promises. <Col N="741" /> Eighteen months ago there was an inspector appointed for the purpose of giving a filip to the homespun industry in Donegal.  At that time we were told this inspector had all the qualifications necessary to help the industry there.  According to the the Minister, there was a Central bureau to be started somewhere in Ardara.  When all these cloths of different patterns were made under the auspices of the Department and under the supervision of this inspector, and when that stuff would arrive, it would be stamped with the Government stamp.  Precautions would be taken by the Government to market the product in the best possible way.  In October last the Minister told us that all these things would be under way in about four months' time.  I am still waiting to hear what has happened in the case of that inspector.  I have had no trace whatsoever of any activity on his part.  I have had communications from people in Ardara, from people who are intimately connected with this particular industry, people who have taken a keen interest in it and people who have its future at heart, and they have failed to hear of anything that has been done by the inspector.  Ardara was to have been his headquarters, his principal centre, and still the people there know absolutely nothing about his activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might tell us that the inspector who was appointed produced a certain class of cloth of different patterns and that they were put into a room down here in the Department of Fisheries.  I say to the Minister that that is all bunkum. What we want in Donegal is not a few samples in a room in the Department of Fisheries, but something real and tangible as a result of the appointment of that inspector. The Committee in Ardara offered to put up £600 by way of helping the Government in installing certain machinery.  As a matter of fact, in their electrical plant run by waterpower they made special provision for its adaptation to the factory for the purpose of carding, breaking and dyeing the wool.  But what has <Col N="742" /> the Minister done?  Those people offered to put up portion of the money.  Has the Minister done anything up to the present?  The Minister said: &ldquo;Send your wool to the Convoy Woollen Mills and get it treated there.&rdquo;  The people wrote to him from Ardara and told him that they had already sent the wool to the Convoy Woollen Mills and that it had been returned untouched. The people there asked the Minister: &ldquo;Give us some help and we will do the rest towards establishing the factory for the purpose of treating wool here in Ardara.&rdquo;  But what has the result been?  The Department said: &ldquo;There is a Scotch firm negotiating about a place in Ardara, or somewhere near Ardara, to set up a factory for this purpose.&rdquo;&ldquo;Come all you Scotchmen, Englishmen, Germans, anybody; come all you and do the work, and we in the Ministry of Fisheries will do nothing. Scotchmen, come along and do what we should have been doing for the last five years.&rdquo;  Does anybody in this House mean to tell me that we are looking for the best results for the country when we expect, and wish and hope that some Scotchman or some German or somebody else will come along and do what we are supposed to be doing here ourselves? The people of Ardara, the old spinners of Donegal, want to know what the Minister is doing about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not make any elaborate promises in the future, because the people have had so many promises from him that they take them all now with a grain of salt. This inspector went to the houses two years ago; he interviewed all the old spinners, and he came to the conclusion, evidently, that spinning as an industry was practically dead in Donegal.  Well, it is not dead, but if no help is forthcoming from the Department it will be dead very soon. The new clip of wool could not be dealt with.  They were holding it over, expecting from day to day that the Minister would wake up and do something, tangible for the industry, but now they have come to the conclusion that the new clip of wool will take the place of the old, that <Col N="743" /> is, the old clip that was returned from the Convoy woollen mills untouched. The consequence will be that the whole industry will collapse. Of course the Minister had some bouquets thrown at him to-day from his own benches, but the Minister had some pungent criticisms from these benches, and they were deserved very much.  If the Minister does not wake up and do something really worth while, I for one will be the first to vote, if such a vote were proposed, for the extermination of the whole Department of Fisheries.  As far as we can gather, looking at the results for the last five years, this Department is only a white elephant.  Not alone should the Vote be reduced, but the Vote for this Department should be wiped out altogether.</P>

      <P>On the 21st November, 1928, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he received a copy of a resolution passed by the Galway Urban District Council requesting the establishment of a fishing school in the Galway urban area for the Claddagh fishermen, and, if so, what action it is intended to take in the matter.&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;I have received a copy of the resolution referred to.  Proposals for the establishment of a small number of preparatory schools along the lines of paragraph 229 of the Report of the Commission on Technical Education, for providing suitable education and training for boys likely to be engaged in the fishing industry, and for the appointment, as suggested in paragraph 231 of the same Report, of itinerant instructors to conduct short courses of instruction for part-time fishermen, are at present being examined by my Department and the Department of Education.  In this connection the claims of the district referred to in the question have not been overlooked.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way I desire to put it is that the Twenty-six Counties, not to mind <Col N="744" /> Galway, heard nothing at all about fishing until the 20th May, 1929.  In the morning's papers on the 20th of last May we were told that the Minister for Fisheries mentioned in the Sligo-Leitrim election that he was going to make this isle a paradise for fishermen.  It took from November, 1928, to the Sligo-Leitrim election to bring relief to the fishermen. A promise was made them and the bait went down.  It obtained the result that they asked for.  The paper said: &ldquo;Return General Seán McKeon and the fishermen of Ireland are safe.&rdquo;  He is returned now, and up to the present he has not contributed much to the Fisheries Vote. We request the Minister to put his promises into operation.  If I were in Deputy McKeon's place I would demand that the Minister would carry out his promise, because it would save my face for being sent here on the pretence that it was going to be done.  That was the 20th May.</P>
    <P>By a remarkable coincidence, in the week from the 1st to the 7th July in Connemara, where something should be done by the Fisheries Department in face of the promises made last November and during the Sligo-Leitrim election, a letter was sent from the Department to Canon McAlpine closing down the only industry in the district.  The Congested Districts Board had a school there known as the lace school.  The building in which the classes were conducted was given rent free to the Fisheries Department. The Department wrote down as follows: &ldquo;After full consideration the Minister is forced to the conclusion that the cost to the State of maintaining this centre does not justify its retention, and I am accordingly to inform you that it has been decided to close it down.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House, because I think sufficient criticism has been meted out if it has any effect.  I suppose it will not have effect this year any more than any other year.  I would like the Minister to state definitely when he is going to put his promise of the 21st November into effect, as regards the establishment <Col N="745" /> of a small number of preparatory schools for fishery training for boys.  Is there such a scheme in the great programme that we were promised on May 20th or is it in the big programme with which he opened up this Vote?  I also want to know from him is it his intention to adhere to this letter and to throw forty or fifty young girls in the Gaeltacht out of employment and tell them to go to America if they want to?</P>

      <P>I will quote my authority. The first part of the report I have deals with the Cleggan fishery. It states that some two or three years ago as much as three train-loads of fish per week used to leave for Galway.  There were innumerable carts carting fish, and Cleggan was one of the best fishing centres in western Ireland.  To-day the people cannot get a living.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>You are the Minister for Fisheries.  I am not saying that you are responsible for the mackerel not coming there, but you ought to be responsible for the way the fisher-folk in that area are treated.  There are French trawlers coming there. To my knowledge a French trawler was detained in Galway Bay and the Department was telegraphed from Galway by the Superintendent of the Civic Guards.  An answer went back to release the trawler.  That was during the election in June, 1927.</P>

      <P>The letter referring to the lace school says: &ldquo;This industry gave employment to between 15 and 20 girls, who work from patterns submitted by the instructress; they work on them in their own homes.&rdquo;  The Minister spoke about giving employment only to two girls.  I would like to know if the Department insists on the closing down of this industry. Is that the way they are going to put into effect the suggestions of the Gaeltacht Commission, to secure employment for the people?  Are they going to throw a score of girls out of employment, and tell them that they can go with the thousands of others who have left Galway to seek a living through the emigrant ship?</P>

      <P>In discussing this Estimate we feel we are rushed, because we want to have some little time for the discussion of the Appropriation Bill afterwards.  I certainly think that if there is one Estimate that should have been considered to the full it is this Estimate of the Department of Fisheries.  We do not grumble at all at voting £77,500 to the Department of Fisheries.  We would not grumble if this money were going to be well spent, but we have no belief that this money will be well spent.  Certainly, from the action of the Department in the past, and from the action of the Government generally in relation to fisheries, we have no hope that this £77,500 is going to be any good to the fishing population of Ireland.  There are one or two matters of detail that I want to <Col N="747" /> bring to the Minister's attention. The Minister says that he is going to bring in a Bill here to revalue the boats that were given out some years ago.</P>
      <P>I have a letter here that was sent out from the Minister's Department on the 4th July to people in Clogher Head, threatening them that if they did not immediately pay their arrears of loans the Minister was going to institute proceedings for recovery without further notice. That was sent both to the owners and the guarantors.  It is not much help to people to have letters of that kind coming along disturbing them, particularly as the Minister's Department is to a large extent responsible for some of the arrears.  These people were to have got a boat in April, but it was delivered three months afterwards, when the fishing season was practically over.  There is another great cause for complaint, and I think that the Minister should either give way to the fisherman or get his experts to go into the matter and issue some sort of notice to the fishermen again.  I refer to the question of opening the fishing season earlier.  A lot of fishermen along the Boyne urge that they should be allowed to fish a month earlier and that the season should be closed a month earlier.  They say that it would do no harm to the fishing, but would be a great boon to them.  Fishermen all over the country have, I understand, the same complaint to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we are not objecting so much to paying £77,500 for this Department, but we would have no objection to paying ten times that amount if we thought that it would be properly spent.  We do not, however, believe that it is going to be properly spent.  We fear that in the next census returns it will be shown that the Irish population has again been cut down by half, as it was cut down by half during the two previous census periods.  The Government, on the whole, have done nothing for the Gaeltacht areas or for the fishing population.  If they were a real national Government, <Col N="748" /> one of the first steps they would take would be to keep the fishing population from emigrating.  In every country where there is a good national Government, the section of the community that they look after first is the fishing folk.  They are a great asset to any nation and they would be a great asset to Ireland if they were encouraged.  One reason why I would like to see this Government kicked out is that they have failed to deal with the situation in the Gaeltacht and with fishing generally. I hope it will not be long until they are kicked out and until some Government comes in that will appoint a proper Minister for Fisheries and give him a proper sum to deal with the whole subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised by Deputy de Valera was with reference to the External Loan, and as to what steps have been taken in that regard.  No steps have been taken, because the receivers or liquidators appointed by the courts to deal with the sums in America, which were the subject of litigation there, have not finished their work. It will not be possible for us to make arrangements about paying the remainder of the loan until these officials have completed their <Col N="750" /> task, and until the books and records are available for us.  I have said before that we regard the whole debt as a liability on the State, and our attitude is not affected by the decision of the American Courts in any way in regard to it.  Deputy de Valera asked about the question of the return of token coinage, and mentioned that the token coinage was part of the national debt of the United Kingdom, and that therefore all responsibility in connection with that coinage fell to be a liability of the British Government.  One of the difficulties in dealing with this whole question of token coinage is that it is not redeemable legally. There is no legal obligation on the Mint to take token coinage back. There is no legal obligation on anybody to receive more than £2 in silver, so that the whole thing ought to be dealt with, not on the question of legal, but of moral responsibility.</P>
      <P>There was undoubtedly as between the banks or private individuals here holding token coinage and the British Government, a very clear moral responsibility on the part of the British Government.  If, for instance, the coinage were to become useless here and cease to be legal tender here for any amount, and to become worthless in the hands of the holders here, then they would have a clear moral claim against the British Government, as undoubtedly that coinage had been paid for in butter, cattle, eggs and other products by the people of this country.  As between the Government of the Saorstát and the British Government the matter was to some extent complicated by other considerations, considerations which really did not apply in the cases of South Africa and Australia. At the time of the issue of the coinage there had been a joint Exchequer, and it could be argued that this country had got already its share of the benefits from the issue of the coinage.  I need not really attempt to retrace all the arguments that were used on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was that in South Africa and in Australia, <Col N="751" /> where, if anything, there was a stronger case for the repatriation by the British Government of the coinage, the arrangement made was that it should be repatriated over a number of years. Of course those countries had not the type of financial dealings that we have with the British Government, the payment of certain sums in respect of pensions and other matters.  There was perhaps less reason in their case for dealing with the whole matter at once.  It was perhaps more reasonable in their case that the payment should be spread over a period of years than in our case, where sums were being paid from one Government to the other for a substantial amount.  Nevertheless there was the fact that repatriation had been accomplished over a period of years.  Consequently it could not be held that the British Government had repudiated their liability, their liability being, as I said, not a legal liability but a moral liability.  It could not be said that the British Government repudiated that liability.  If they dealt with the matter more generously they might have effected repatriation at once, but there are certainly no grounds for saying that they dealt with the matter in the spirit of dishonouring a cheque.</P>
    <P>If they did deal with the matter in the spirit of dishonouring a cheque, there would have been measures available to us which would not be justified when the course that was taken by the British Government was actually taken.  If they had entirely repudiated liability there were certain remedies which I had in mind, but I could not feel any justification in resorting to those remedies after the demands of the Saorstát were met on lines parallel to the stronger demand that had been made by countries like South Africa and Australia.  There is no point, when debating matters like this, in Deputies talking about this Government being bluffed by the British Government and all the things done by them.  It is very easy for Deputy de Valera to talk in that <Col N="752" /> way when he took good care that he would have no responsibility.</P>

In any case, clearly it was not a policy that was forced on the Deputy by the Dáil.  It is irrelevant now, but it is as irrelevant as all the Deputy's talk about people being bluffed and about failing to do the work of the country properly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very good struggle, and it had to be done. Several Deputies raised the question of the Dáil Loan.  I said a good deal about the Dáil Loan in general a couple of nights ago in answer to a question raised by Deputy Carty.  I do not think that there is really anything more I can add, but I would just like to say, whatever delays take place, that there seems to be a tendency to exaggerate them.  Deputy Hogan <Col N="753" /> talked about whole stretches of the country where the Loan was not being repaid, and, in general, indicated that there were extraordinarily unjustifiable delays.  The Deputy, about a year ago, raised the matter in a somewhat similar spirit. He told us about a case regarding which he wrote a letter on the 29th June, 1928, in reference to a certain individual named Martin Kelly.  He said in that letter: &ldquo;This man sent his official receipt in respect of his Dáil Loan subscription to the Finance Department twelve months ago, and since then he has made repeated applications for his Savings Certificate.  He has received no acknowledgment but the usual stereotyped reply on buff-coloured post cards.  Can your Department discover by any chance whether consideration was given to this case, or whether the receipt is in your Department?  It is time that some consideration was given to this case as well as to a number of others. I am collecting them, and if nothing is done within a reasonable time I will take steps to have all the cases dealt with where buff-coloured post cards and forms will be of very little use.&rdquo;  Then, when Deputy Hogan was asked for information about the case he gave a little information, but the suggestion that he would submit forms and buff-coloured post cards was ignored by him.  A further letter to him asking for the forms and the buff-coloured post cards was ignored, so that Deputy Hogan, in that case, allowed his zeal to run away with him and made assertions that had no foundation, because, in fact, this particular individual, whose case he said had been so long delayed, and whose application, he said, had been made a year before, had, in fact, only made application 22 days, three weeks, before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): I want to say definitely that this case is unworthy of the Minister.  It is the one case in which proof was not forthcoming.  I said, and I repeat, that there are whole stretches in Clare where no repayment of the <Col N="754" /> loan has been made.  The statement the Minister has made is unworthy of one occupying the responsible position which he holds.  There are whole stretches of country in West Clare, around Kilmihil, and in North Clare, around Ennistymon, in which people have not been repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not typical, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is typical of a good many complaints.  A great many people send in their applications and they never think of them again until a certain point is reached.  Then when they have time to think about it and while in a busy mood they apply to some Deputy.  The Deputy then immediately takes the view that there has been extraordinary neglect in these cases and talks about the whole matter in that spirit. There may quite well be parishes or substantial areas where, for some reason or another, no repayments have been made.  But where repayments have not been made, it is because of the difficulties of dealing with the cases.  I can say nothing in connection with this matter except what I have already said, that the closing down of applications gives every promise of making it possible for us to deal more quickly with the difficult points that still remain to be settled in many cases.  When we know that for a particular area there are going to be no more applications we may perhaps take a more rough-and-ready way of deciding which of the number of applications in are correct applications in which payment may be made, and, accordingly, to strike out those that seem to us to be less well supported.  I think Deputy Briscoe mentioned a case where, as a matter of fact, there had been very little delay&mdash;the case of Mr. Hugh O'Rourke.  The primary register does not contain any record of the amount referred to in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated no such name in this House&mdash;I gave no name <Col N="755" /> whatever.  That particular case was not in my mind at all.  As the Minister has now referred to it, I should like to say that the reason that claim was not pressed by me on behalf of Mr. O'Rourke was because the person who collected that money is now deceased and it was never handed in by him to the Department.  The gentleman who gave the subscription took that in good faith, rather than create any odour around the name of the deceased gentleman. I think it is just as unworthy of the Minister to bring up that case, which he has got from his office and which he did not get in this House, as it was in the case of Deputy Hogan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Deputy Shaw made certain remarks about repayments in Westmeath cases.  A great deal of progress has been made with the repayments there, and, with a very few exceptions, all applications received prior to 30th April last which are on the primary register have been paid.  There have been a great number of applications from County Westmeath from persons who allege they subscribed to the Dáil Eireann Loan, but who in fact subscribed to other funds.  The repayment of subscriptions of that kind is not covered by the provisions of the Dáil Eireann Loan and Funds Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked if there was any question of only paying out a certain sum per annum.  There is no such idea in the Department of Finance.  There is no idea at all of limiting the total amount that will be paid out in any year.  That has never come into question.  As a matter of fact we are most desirous of having the whole amount paid off and of getting rid of the difficulties and the worry of Parliamentary questions, and all that, involved in the fact that a considerable number of cases are still outstanding.</P>

So far as the cases to which the Deputy refers are concerned, if we have a certificate from the collector, and if there is evidence that the sums collected were transmitted, or if there are to credit, as having been received from that particular district, sums equal to the amount which is shown to have been collected, <Col N="757" /> then these cases can be dealt with quickly.  I could not tell what particular cases the Deputy is referring to, but there have been cases where we have not evidence that sums were received in the district.  We must have that.  Two things are necessary: we must have evidence that individuals paid to the collectors, and then we must know that the sums were actually received from the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Of course if the amount corresponds exactly there should not be any difficulty in dealing with the matter.  If there is more claimed for than has actually been received there is a difficulty.  If less is claimed for than has been received, the matter is not hard to deal with.  I do not think I can go any further, in the absence of some inquiries, about a particular number of accounts in a particular area.  I can only repeat the assurance which I gave to Deputy Carty, that the matter is being dealt with, as well as the fact that three-fourths of the loan has already been paid, and that there is every prospect now of being able more rapidly to deal with the cases that contain elements of difficulty than they could be dealt with at the time when fresh applications were still pouring in every day.</P>

      <P>There were two types of cases; one was where receipts were signed beforehand and given out when the money was paid in, and where there does not seem to be any record of the money so paid in; and, secondly, where collections <Col N="758" /> were made for the fund at public meetings.</P>

      <P>These receipts would be of somewhat less value than the receipts which a person who gave them would stand over in the same way as if he had actually handed out the receipts himself when he received the money.  But there would be evidence to some extent.  With reference to the position generally in Waterford City and County, all the applications that we received before the expiration of the prescribed time which contained particulars corresponding with those recorded in the primary register, have been dealt with, and payment has been made.  In respect to Waterford City, the particular matter which the Deputy referred to is engaging attention just at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still hope, in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are awaiting a reply to a communication which has just gone out in respect to that. With reference to the Civil Service questions that were raised, I shall refer first to the question of pay. There was a comparison of the rates of pay here with the rates of pay in Northern Ireland.  As a matter of fact, there is a peculiar feature in the position.  The Northern Ireland rates of pay are the same as the British rates.  The rates paid in Dublin, even before the change of Government, were not equal to the British rates.  They were always some 5 per cent. less than the rates paid in London.  But our rates of pay, I think, are something like 10 per cent. under the British rates of pay.  Some Deputies speaking about this matter did not really compare comparable rates, because we have a differential scale which does not exist in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have one rate of pay for women and unmarried men; we have another rate of pay for married men, and then, in addition to the actual salary paid to every married officer since the new scales were adopted, there is a children allowance <Col N="759" /> which, in the case of a clerical officer, may run up to a maximum of £60.  It is possible, therefore, for certain clerical officers under our scale to have actually £260 per annum where, under the British régime, the rate would be only £237 10s. per annum.  So that while the rate of pay is lower, on the whole it can be actually higher, in certain cases, and those, cases where the individuals receiving the salary have the greatest responsibility.</P>
    <P>This question of rates of pay is one that it is impossible to get agreement about, but you have, at any rate, to pay some attention to commercial standards.  Somebody said that the proper rate of pay was the rate of pay that would attract people of the proper class and retain them in some reasonable state of content.  I think one needs to emphasise &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; there, because you will not get absolute content in any public service.  You will always have a desire and a hope for higher remuneration.  People who enter upon any walk of life at any particular rate of pay, even if they think that the rate of pay is reasonably good when they enter upon the employment, begin, after a time, to wish it was somewhat higher.  You never will have absolute content; it never will be possible to say that any grade of your Civil Service thinks that the rate of pay is ample and that no further increase should be made.  Looking at it in that way, you have to have some regard to the opportunities for alternative employments in the country.  Rates of pay, I think, have to be somewhat higher in a country where there are a great many other opportunities.  It is not just right to say that you will only pay a rate that will get people to take the positions.  But at the same time I do not think you could attempt to fix a theoretical standard which has no relation to the competition that a particular rate of salary will obtain.</P>
    <P>For our clerical and junior executive positions the competition has certainly been very keen.  In the <Col N="760" /> last examination for clerical officers there were available 207 fully qualified candidates, though the number of positions offered was only 30.  In the last examination for junior executive officers there were 102 fully qualified candidates for seven places, so that for every entry there is ample competition and the people who are obtained are very well qualified and very good material for the work they have to undertake. One does not find that people who have entered leave the Service in the early days when they might leave it because it is obvious there are not more attractive positions available outside, at any rate to the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>With reference to promotion, the difficulty there is: taking the clerical class, there have been great numbers of people promoted from the clerical class since the change of Government, and if promotion has been shut down since 1926 we have got to remember that the best people fit for promotion had very good opportunities, and that the people who have come in since 1926 are certainly not ripe for promotion yet; so I do not think, broadly speaking, there is any hardship upon actual individuals so far as promotion is concerned just for the present.  We acknowledge that there must be promotion. One of the ways by which the people in any class should be obtained is promotion.  As a matter of fact the number of promotees at present is very high.  Take the Junior Executive Class at present. It numbers 460.  Of this number 220 were already in the class at the change of Government.  Of the remaining 240, 198 have been promoted from the clerical class, and only 46 are officers who entered through what should be the normal method of open competitive examination. I do not take the view of Deputy Davin, who argued that all above the very lowest ranks should be recruited by promotion.  Experience is undoubtedly useful, and it is a desirable and a necessary thing to encourage zeal, and all that sort of thing, and to recruit a considerable number of the Junior Executive <Col N="761" /> class from the clerical class through promotion; but it is also a desirable thing to get well-educated young people into that class, fresh from school.  Many of those people without the experience will be in a few months very much more useful and alert than any promotees except those who are really of the very best type.  I would not at all accept the point of view that was suggested by Deputy Davin.  The idea is that for the future the Junior Executive class should consist in part of promotees and in part of people who entered directly by examination.  As the class stands at the moment, at least the part of it which was created since the change of Government, a very small proportion consists of people who entered by competition.</P>
    <P>Again, the clerical class in the Free State for a variety of reasons is a weak class; a great number of the best in it have been promoted. There are very few who entered that class by competitive examination. The clerical class at the moment numbers 2,200, and about 1,000 of these were temporary clerks who entered as a result of a limited examination. Of others in the class some entered by means of a limited examination during the British time. They were called, I think, Lytton entrants.  I think there were limited examinations whereby ex-members of the National Army were admitted. In addition to that, there were a good number of people who were promoted in the British time from the ranks of assistant clerk, the lowest permanent rank in the British Civil Service, to the clerical class. You had others promoted&mdash;sorting clerks and telegraphists.  I think out of the whole 2,200 there is a very small proportion, some 13 per cent. who have passed the competitive examination of the kind which will be the normal means of entering the clerical class.  I think myself that this temporary ban on promotion which has taken place involves no hardship and certainly no injustice on the clerical class.  Promotions will, after a time, have to be resumed, and I hope they will be resumed even on a small scale at a <Col N="762" /> fairly early date, because I do recognise that there are people who will not work with all the zeal that one might look for if there is not some prospect of advancing in the service before them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said that at present a writing assistant cannot become a clerical officer.  There have not actually been promotions in the writing assistant class.  The writing assistant class is a new class, only a few years in existence.  It is doubtful, even if there were no ban on promotion, that any one of the writing assistants would be promoted. Certainly there is none of them due for promotion except a very small group who entered the first years we took in writing assistants.  I should think the ban on promotion would be first raised, and can be raised quite soon as far as writing assistants are concerned.  I think when promotions are resumed from class to class that the first people who will benefit will be the writing assistants. While promotions from writing assistants to clerical officers, and from clerical officers to junior executive officers are not taking place, it is not a fact that there are no promotions. The minor staff to which reference was made do provide avenues to promotion, and if the person appointed does not go to as high a maximum as he would go if he got appointed as junior executive, at any rate he generally gets a substantial lift on being appointed to the junior staff post, because the maximum goes within £50 of the maximum of the junior executive.</P>
    <P>I would not like to agree with the Deputies who say that the representative council which is at present in existence has done no good.  In point of fact a number of matters have been arranged, and a number of requests have been acceded to, as a result of discussion at the Council, but it cannot be accepted that in the present financial conditions of the country any sort of machinery that could be devised is going to give substantial benefits to the staffs.  The real position at the moment is that the staff cannot look for improved pay or conditions because <Col N="763" /> of conditions in the country, and all that can take place must be in the nature of very minor adjustments of one sort or another.  I think the annoyance of some members of the staff with the representative council arises from the fact that they expect results that cannot be got and that they would be just as discontented and as annoyed with any sort of body which might be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a big percentage of officials are not represented on the council at the present time owing to the fact that they think it is futile to be represented there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If they take up that attitude there is nothing to be done. I am not sure that many of those people would not be just as discontented with any body.  They would regard anything as futile that would not bring them big concessions year after year, and I have no hesitation in saying that no body would be set up that would bring the big concessions they look for, and consequently if a different body were substituted we would have the same sort of discontent arising after a little time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of representations, I have been looking into certain points in connection with the council, with a view to seeing if I could meet the staff in any way, because I would prefer that they should be all represented on the council.  The efficacy of the council now and in the future would be increased if all classes of the staff which are not represented now would join the council.  To that extent, I am anxious to meet them. On the other hand, if they will not avail of the council, the council will manage to get along without them. Even if it did not get along I suppose the business of the State would be done.  This council has a full opportunity of having matters which <Col N="764" /> affect them raised and discussed with responsible heads of Departments and brought to the notice of the Minister.  As far as practicable we have arranged that no change affecting the staff will be carried into effect.  There have been one or two breaches, through accident, but we desire that no change of any importance affecting the staff will be carried through until the council has had an opportunity of discussing it and until the views of the staff in connection with it are fully gone into.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee raised the case of a reinstated civil servant who was reinstated for the purpose of enabling him to draw a pension.  I do not think it would be possible to do anything more in connection with that case than has been done.  If a person who was discharged and who was out of the service for a period were to be paid a pension for the period he was out, a great many other claims would be urged which could not be accepted.  Men would claim pay for the period they were out, and so on.  I do not think anything could be done.  While the Executive Council decided, as it were, to mitigate the penalty in this case, the Executive Council does not for a moment take the view that they could have done anything less at the time than dismiss the civil servant. What they really did feel is that the penalty of dismissal, involving the loss of pension rights for the years during which he had actually served, was a very severe penalty, and that it was reasonable to mitigate the severity of that penalty.  He was simply restored for the purpose of enabling the pension actually earned during his years of service to be paid.  To go further than that would open up many questions, and I do not think any consideration of it could be promised.  I do not think there is any other point that I wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the inland fisheries.  I referred to them the other day when speaking on the Land Bill.  I would again call the attention of the Minister to the fact that it is really of very little use to develop the inland fisheries, because at the moment, instead of developing these fisheries for the benefit of the State, they are only being developed for the benefit of the landlords and such individuals.  We are, in developing them, only benefiting individuals who possess rights that should be challenged.  It is a mistake to devote too much attention to inland fisheries.  Until we are in a position to have these fisheries in such a position that the people of the State will benefit from their development, and the benefit will not go to a few individuals, we should not spend money on the development of inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>With reference to the question raised by Deputy White regarding the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company in seizing the nets of Donegal fishermen, I notice that the Minister said that he did not think that it was a matter that should be brought before his Department, but that it was a matter for the Court. In his reply I want the Minister to state what Courts he refers to.  I presume that he must be referring <Col N="768" /> to the Six County Courts.  A fishery case was decided some time ago in the Free State Court.  The agent of the Foyle and Bann Company prosecuted Donegal fishermen for fishing in the Foyle.  The case came before District Justice Walsh, and he dismissed the case on the grounds that a question of title was involved. He stated that he had not any jurisdiction. When giving that decision he remarked that he would like if this case were appealed.  Since then no appeal was taken, and I think it is a question for the Executive Council to fight the issue with the Northern Parliament and not to throw the onus on the fishermen of Donegal.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state how many trawlers have been prosecuted during the past twelve months, and could he give the House any idea of the penalties that were inflicted?  Is the Minister aware that a number of people have been put to considerable trouble in the matter of claims for instalments on boats in cases where they have already paid?  Deputy Kilroy raised the question on a previous occasion. The Minister must be satisfied in that particular case that the party sued had paid already.  I have had experience of cases down in the Belmullet area.  I advised the people that the proper thing to do was to say nothing but to go into court and to fight the cases.  As the Minister is aware, I have myself collected costs from his Department in the past month where cases were dismissed. These people were put to considerable trouble.  The people had to go to the Post Offices and collect the counterfoils of the money orders they sent.  Some poor people sent on instalments in notes, and in these cases the payments cannot be traced, and no possible defence can be put up.  There is no doubt about it cases of this kind have happened and are happening through the country.</P>

      <P>There is one point on which I would like to address the Minister, and it is about the protection of fishermen in pursuit of their <Col N="769" /> calling.  I have a case in mind where a man was fishing.  He had his nets half a mile from the shore in Valentia Harbour.  A French trawler came along and ran through and tore the nets, and pulled the boat 400 or 500 yards.  This man followed the French boat and got the captain arrested.  He was detained until the following day, when the Superintendent of the Gárda released him, stating that he had no power to detain him any longer.  The man who owned the boat was Mahony.  He got no satisfaction at all.  I wrote to the Department of Fisheries on his behalf, and the reply I got reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant relative to the loss of nets by Jeremiah Mahony, and to say that your previous letter on the same subject was referred to the Department of Justice, and it is having their attention.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This happened on 16th November, and this is the 10th July.  Mahony has got no satisfaction since.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that a foreign boat can come along like that and endanger the lives of fishermen who are in the legitimate pursuit of their daily occupation.  These boats tear through the nets of men like Mahony, whose nets were value for about £19 10s., and in addition they caused the loss of two nights' fishing.  I also drew the attention of the Department of Fisheries to the necessity of putting a railing at the heads of piers down in Kerry.  With regard to that, I already mentioned the case of a man who lost his life down in Kerry because of the absence of a railing from the head of the pier.  Nothing has been done to remedy that.</P>

There is an expenditure of something <Col N="770" /> like £28,000 on a service which is about £40,000 altogether, and I want to ask the Minister whether there is a need for all these secretaries and secretaries to secretaries that we have here in the list on this Estimate?  We have a Minister, a private secretary to the Minister, a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, a private secretary to the Parliamentary Secretary, a short-hand-typist to the Parliamentary Secretary, a secretary, a private secretary to the secretary, and many other Departmental officials.

      <P>I have very little time in which to answer all the questions put to me.  I will deal with what Deputy de Valera has said.  Surely the Deputy is not so innocent as not to realise that when one is dealing with estimates for public departments the very estimates are almost entirely composed of provisions for administration?  The estimates in nearly all cases are almost entirely for salaries and allowances.  There are very few estimates where there is anything at all set aside for development. Take the estimate for the Department of Education, the estimate for the Gárda Síochána, or the estimate for the Department of Agriculture as an example.  If one tries to make the comparison that the Deputy is making it will be <Col N="771" /> found that the amounts practically entirely represent salaries.  That is what estimates are for.</P>

      <P>I would take an extremely long time to deal with the functions of a Government Department. Two years ago on my estimate I went into the matter of the functions of the Department very fully. It deals with fishery law, and a great many matters in the way of loans, and so on.  It would take at least three-quarters of an hour to explain the functions of the Department.  If the Deputy went to the trouble of reading debates on estimates that were considered before he came here he could easily find out what is being done.  He mentions the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am sure the Deputy knows very well that, although this is on the Fisheries Vote, the Parliamentary Secretary's duties are mostly confined to the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He is doing what Parliamentary Secretaries usually do. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance takes charge of the Board of Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary in my Department takes charge of the Land Commission on my behalf.  Very many questions have been raised and it will be possible for me to deal with only a few.  One of the points most canvassed is the revaluation of boats and it has been declared that nothing was done in spite of promises. A certain scheme of revaluation had been agreed to.  As I said last year, a Bill was actually drafted embodying that scheme.  It was an extremely rigid scheme and, after further consideration, even though the Bill was drafted, we decided it was better to have the thing <Col N="772" /> reconsidered from the point of view of individuals rather than parties. The scheme was that any loans given between 1916 and 1923 were written down in a certain percentage according to the year under-review. We found, on looking into the thing, that very many individual cases were just excluded either through being before the period or after the period.  Therefore, we came to the conclusion that it was better to consider each case on its merits.</P>
      <P>The question of the earlier opening of seasons was raised.  The position with regard to that is that where there is any demand from any given place for earlier opening of a season we grant a public inquiry. Full notice is given in all the papers; notice is posted up in the Gárda Síochána barracks and on school gates, indicating that the inquiry is being held and every person is given an opportunity of appearing before the inspector. Evidence is taken and the inspector makes a certain report.  That report is acted upon.  It may be in favour of the demand that the season be opened earlier or it may be the contrary. If the inspector reports in favour of a change of season I normally act on the report and make a by-law to that effect.</P>
      <P>A lot of discussion has centred around the position with regard to several fisheries in the country. Several fisheries are like any other private property.  As long as they are there and their title is established I certainly have no authority to abolish that title.  The only way to proceed would be to adopt the same procedure as in the case of land.  It might be possible to do it in that way.  If the country were prepared the spend the money we could have a Fisheries Purchase Bill the same as we had a Land Purchase Bill.  But merely by a stroke of the pen to initiate a policy of abolishing all private property might lead to considerable trouble with regard to property as a whole.  Deputy Tubridy referred to certain steps with regard to industries in his particular area.</P>

I presume that as you put the question some time after 10 o'clock it is the second part of the guillotine Resolution which applies, and that the only Question which can be put from the Chair is the Estimate and not Deputy Derrig's amendment.</P>

      <P>The terms of the Resolution come to by the House to-day in regard to the transaction of this particular business stated that the proceedings on the Estimates, &ldquo;if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, July 10th, 1929, by putting from the Chair forthwith <Col N="774" /> and successively the Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.&rdquo;  The Resolution goes on to state: &ldquo;Provided that after the said hour on the said day a Question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment, nor upon any motion other than a motion necessary to bring the proceedings forthwith to a conclusion, and then only when moved by the Government.&rdquo; The President's point is that the Question moved by Deputy Derrig was not moved by the Government and cannot be put.  I think that under the terms of the Resolution it was a Question which was necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.  It fell to be put at 10 o'clock, and the proviso applies to such other questions as may fall to be put subsequent to 10 o'clock.</P>

      <P>The resolution closures the debate as far as 10th July is concerned.  It states:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that after the said hour on the said day a question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment nor upon any motion other than a motion necessary to bring the proceedings forthwith to a conclusion, and then only when moved by the Government.&rdquo;  These regulations have now come to an end, it being past the 10th July, and the ordinary procedure with regard to discussion of Bills in this House is open to any Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the proviso deals with questions which shall not be put from the Chair and with nothing else.  The resolution <Col N="804" /> deals with certain business which it states &ldquo;shall be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, 10th July, 1929, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.&rdquo;  We have now reached a point of time which is after 10 p.m. on Wednesday, 10th July, 1929.  The proviso the Deputy mentioned is concerned solely with the prohibition addressed to the Chair to the effect that the Chair shall not put certain questions after a certain hour.  The Deputy's point, I understand, is that the Chair is not in order in putting a particular question now.</P>
