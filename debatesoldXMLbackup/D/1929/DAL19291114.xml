      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a number of taxpayers in West Cork who had appealed from assessments of income tax received notices from the Inspector of Taxes that their appeals would be heard at Skibbereen on 7th November, 1929, and if on attendance in obedience to these notices they found that their appeals were not listed for hearing before the Special Commissioner for hearing income tax appeals; if as the result they were put to much inconvenience and expense, and what steps it is proposed to take to compensate them for the inconvenience and expense to which they have been put.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the pensions officer for the Dunfanaghy, Termon, Creeslough and Falcarragh districts, County Donegal, has not a knowledge of the Irish language; that many applicants for the old age pension from these districts who are Irish speakers are unable to understand properly the queries put to them by this officer in the English language when he is investigating their claims, with the result <Col N="1256" /> that they very often make statements against themselves; and whether it is intended to appoint and officer with a knowledge of Irish for this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware (a) that on May 25th, 1928, complete lists of Dáil Loan, 1920, subscribers, covering the Cordal and Scartaglin parishes, Castleisland, County Kerry (total number of subscribers 121, and total amount subscribed from the former parish £179, and 115 subscribers and subscriptions amounting to £270 from the latter parish) were handed in at his <Col N="1257" /> Department; (b) that receipts acknowledging above lists were received; (c) that individual applications in all cases have been made in the manner specified by his Department; (d) that no original receipts from the old (1920) Dáil Loan Office were sent to the subscribers of this area&mdash;the British Military having confiscated, in Dublin, the receipts covering this money subscribed; (e) that statements from Very Rev. Father Brennan, P.P., Castlemaine, Kerry, were handed in to the Finance Department on May 25th, 1928, acknowledging that he received the amounts stated above, which were subscribed by the subscribers mentioned in the lists referred to; (f) and if the Minister will now state when his Department intend making an effort to refund this money to the subscribers whose names appear on the lists in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The lists referred to in the Deputy's question were received in my Department on the 25th May, 1928.  Upon examination of the primary Register of subscribers it was found that the particulars contained in the lists had not been furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance during the period in which the Loan was raised.  An examination of the individual applications for repayment which have been received reveals several discrepancies between the particulars contained in these applications and those contained in the lists and, in addition, a number of applications have been received from persons in the Scartaglin and Cordal districts whose names are not entered in the lists. The statement by the Very Rev. Father Brennan which was handed in with the lists does not specify the actual amounts received by him for the districts referred to.  I understand that the moneys received by Father Brennan were forwarded by him to another clergyman for transmission to the Dáil Department of Finance.  Bulk amounts were received from the latter clergyman but there is at present no evidence which <Col N="1258" /> would enable my Department to identify the sums subscribed in the Cordal and Seartaglin parishes.  I think that the clergyman in question whose name I will give the Deputy if he so desires, would be in a position to help in this matter if the Deputy could persuade him to reply to communications which have been sent to him.  I am having further enquiries made but I am not in a position to state when it will be found possible to authorise repayment in respect of the subscriptions in question.</P>

Discussions are at present taking place between the Saorstát Government and the Belgian Government with a view to securing that goods manufactured in the Saorstát on importation into Belgium will not be subjected to higher or other duties than those that shall be applied to similar goods imported into Belgium from any other most-favoured-nation country.</P>

Reserve pay has been issued in every case in which the reservist has duly reported.</P>

      <P>The estate referred to was sold by the owner direct to the tenants under the Irish Land Acts, 1903-9, in accordance with purchase agreements entered into by the parties, which were lodged with the Estates Commissioners.  There is no reference in any of the agreements to a right of quarrying limestone on the quarry situated on Mrs. Catherine O'Sullivan's farm at Cordal East.  During the proceedings before the Commission the purchasers alleged that one of the conditions of the sale was that the limestone quarry on this holding was to be reserved for their use, but on inquiry <Col N="1262" /> the owner's solicitors stated that such was not the case, and that the vendor could not have made such an agreement, as the minerals on the holding of Mrs. Catherine O'Sullivan were not his property, but belonged to the trustees of Lord Powis, deceased, from whom he held the lands under a fee-farm grant.  The agreement signed by Jeremiah (now Catherine) O'Sullivan provided for the reservation of minerals to the trustees of Lord Powis, deceased, and the holding was vested in accordance with the purchase agreement. The Land Commission have no power to take any action as regards the quarry referred to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether there is any scheme on foot for the relief of the inhabitants of the village of Stradina, Ballinagleara, County Leitrim, who were impoverished by the floods last year, and (b) whether there is any scheme on foot to prevent the recurrence of these floods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have had under consideration the manner in which the problem presented by the position of the houses of the tenant purchasers in Stradina could best be dealt with, whether by migrating the purchasers to other lands or by giving them assistance to rebuild in other positions on their holdings.  In view of the difficulties that would be encountered in carrying out migrations they have come to the conclusion that the latter course is the better one, and have approached the Department of Finance with a view to obtaining approval of a grant to the purchasers to enable them to rebuild on different sites.  With regard to the prevention of floods, as I informed the Deputy on a former occasion, no action that the Land Commission could take would, having regard to the nature of the river, prevent sudden flooding of the land.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will probably remember that this matter was raised a year ago, and the Department indicated that inspectors had been instructed to investigate the position, which, I understand, they have done.  Surely at the end of twelve months it would be only reasonable to expect that the Department should be able to give an indication as to when they will be able to put into effect the recommendations of their inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion the question raised referred to the sudden flooding of the river and the damage done to the land adjoining, but since then that damage has been repaired.  This is a different question altogether.  It is a question of migrating a number of people whose houses were damaged by that flooding to different positions on their holdings, and the position is complicated by the fact that these holdings are intermixed or in rundale. The difficulty is to select sites that will be removed from the possibility of damage from flooding on any future occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is quite correct in saying the matter was discussed on a wider basis a year ago. The whole matter, or I should say the whole situation, was investigated and discussed here at that time with a view to seeing how these people could be removed or migrated, or to see what should be done in order to prevent a recurrence of the flooding, and also to make provision for housing so as to remove the existing danger.  All these things were discussed here, and I think it is not fair now, after the lapse of twelve months, that we should be told that an inquiry has taken place and to suggest that certain suppositions may be put into effect.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give a definite idea of when that should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated last night, our attitude on the rate of wages is that if anybody is asked to work and is given a certain amount of relief, the time he should be supposed to work should not be more than the time that would be necessary in order that the current rate of wages that he would earn would <Col N="1270" /> equal the amount of relief that was given.  As far as I can see, the proposer of this amendment agreed to that.  But I am afraid, so far as I can read it, that the amendment is much wider.  It suggests work &ldquo;that but for the provisions of this section, would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade.&rdquo;  Is it intended by this amendment to prevent a local authority, for instance, organising the building of houses; organising bricklayers and tradesmen, and employing them on that work for such time as would be the time, if they were employed at the current rate of wages in which they would earn the amount given in relief?</P>

We hold as strongly as the Labour Deputies that if work is going to be given for relief the rate of wages and the hours at which the person should be employed should not be lower nor longer than the current rate of wages.  That is to say, that the time which the person should work to earn relief should not be more than under the current rate of wages.

      <P>Take the wording of the amendment: &ldquo;work that, but for the provisions of this section, would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade.&rdquo;  Now suppose a local authority started getting house-building organised, and bricklayers to whom they were giving relief organised, and other workmen that <Col N="1272" /> would be engaged in that particular work organised, and set out to supply some of the houses that we are short of.  Would they not be doing something there that might be done in the ordinary course of business and trade?

      <P>The Labour members would appear to be more interested in indulging in matters of this kind than in getting the real matter at issue settled.  If they are really interested in this question it would be well to have from them what is meant by the amendment.  I am anxious to safeguard the principle that is set out in the amendment, but at the same time I do not want to have any local authority prevented from organising the workmen to whom relief will be given so that they may do useful work.  As I read the amendment, it would seem to indicate that the workmen would be forbidden to do anything of the sort that I have set out.  In the last analysis we would not be satisfied with the wording of the amendment, and, if the Deputy does not withdraw it in order to clarify it at a later stage, it is our intention to put in an amendment on the Report Stage so as to clarify the matter.</P>

Something like that is what we require.  That is the sort of thing that I want.  I do not want to see something which is so wide that it would prevent the local authority from organising necessary work.  I say these things merely to clarify the situation.  If the Labour Party will not withdraw that amendment, deliberately to prevent misunderstanding, we will vote for the amendment, it being clearly understood, if this amendment is passed now, and if the Minister himself does not do it, that we will be responsible for bringing in an amendment at a later stage in order to make it quite definite what it is we are aiming at. I do not think there is any necessity for me to say any more just now.</P>

He said, in effect, that because there are hundreds unemployed, thousands unemployed, you can force down the standard of living; because there are scores of thousands unemployed you can force down the subsistence level.  To what extent is Deputy Flinn or those for whom he speaks concerned with &ldquo;The pallid pimp of the bread line;&rdquo; how far is he concerned with the houseless or the hungry so long as his sacred doctrine <Col N="1274" /> of rob the poor because they are poor is upheld?</P>
      <P>Because there are forty outside the factory, the wages of the twenty inside should be divided by two so that the law of supply and demand shall be maintained.  Because a hungry man will work for twenty shillings instead of twenty-five shillings, why pay a man twenty-five shillings? Because you can force the workingman's child to subsist on half a pint of milk a day instead of a pint of milk, why give that child a pint of milk?  That illustrates the brutality of the doctrine preached here last night from the Fianna Fáil Benches by Deputy Flinn.  It is the doctrine of the jungle, the doctrine of the tooth and the talon.  If Deputy Flinn stands for that doctrine it should be clearly understood that the doctrine of the jungle should be enforced for people who pay super tax just as well as for those who seek home assistance or relief work.  Deputy Flinn is one of those philosophic philanthropists, or philanthropic philosophers, who generally dry their tears over the sufferings of the unemployed with share scrip or deposit receipts. The law of supply and demand is, of course, one that should be upheld. The human element should never be brought into account.  You are to force down the standard of life of the trade unionists so that capital may have its price.  Deputy Flinn speaks of a pool.  What pool?  We want to know what is left out of the pool of resources just as much as we want to know what is put into it. We want to know on what authority certain people glut themselves on what is kept out of the pool, whilst they sentence others, who have to depend on the pool for a living, to a life of misery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was a very poor editor of Deputy Flinn's speech, a very poor editor indeed.  Deputy de Valera edited it much better.  He spoke more humanly and uttered more humane philosophy, much more humane philosophy.  I want to tell those people who are interested in this matter, and those who stand <Col N="1275" /> for that philosophy, that Deputy de Valera spoke more the mind of the people who support Fianna Fáil than did that high priest of capitalism, Deputy Flinn.  There should be no doubt about this matter.  It is very hard to speak calmly and dispassionately after hearing the jungle talk and after the adumbration of the tooth-and-talon law that we heard yesterday.  If the law of supply and demand is to operate in this case, and if there is to be nothing for the human element, no consideration for the value that the human unit is to the nation, then those people who stand for that doctrine will have to face it when it is applied to themselves.</P>

It would seem as if we are now merely wasting time trying to get political kudos out of the situation that confronts us.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, after Deputy Hogan's speech, to bring the House back to the subject matter of this debate.  We are dealing with the amendment that stands in the name of Deputy Morrissey: &ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 5, after the word `work' to insert the words `which is not work that, but for the provisions of this section, would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade, and&rdquo;'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what I think we are really concerned about is what is the exact meaning of that amendment and <Col N="1276" /> what is the purpose and intention of it&mdash;&ldquo;which is not work that, but for the provisions of this section, would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade.&rdquo;  I would ask Deputy Morrissey to indicate to the Dáil what sort of work would be permitted if his amendment were to be accepted by the House.  Deputy Corish, I think, gave us to understand last night that he did not think that the amendment would exclude the clearing of derelict sites. But surely that is work which would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade.  I would like Deputy Corish to reconcile his statement with Deputy Morrissey's amendment if he can, to show me how Deputy Morrissey's amendment would not prevent the employment of persons on a relief scheme merely to clear derelict sites.  They would be doing work which obviously would be done for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade. The persons to whom relief was given might even be set to work to sort rags.  I do not suggest that that would be fit or adequate work for them, but I am suggesting the most ridiculous example I can think of to show that there is not a single thing which would have any element of utility in it that could be performed by these persons if Deputy Morrissey's amendment were adopted. Therefore, Deputy Lemass was quite justified in saying that if this amendment were adopted the only thing these men could be employed on would be the building of follies.  We are supposed to have a Labour Party in this House with a very up-to-date and a very advanced outlook, but here we find them in this amendment deliberately going back to the basic principles of the Famine laws.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that there are certain points of agreement between some members of Fianna Fáil and some members of Cumann na nGaedheal, but I regard the proceedings so far to-day on the part of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken as more or less in the nature of a saving of faces and a washing of hands after what has been described as the tooth-and-claw speech of Deputy Flinn yesterday. Deputy Flinn said, in effect, that he understood the problem of unemployment, and that there were thousands and tens of thousands of people who were prepared to accept work on the Shannon scheme at 32s. per week.  He also said, amongst other things, that there were thousands of persons now wanting houses who could not get these houses built because of the building trade union.  There appeared to be unanimity of opinion also between certain members of Fianna Fáil and certain members of Cumann na nGaedheal that these trades unions should be abolished and that coolie labour conditions should obtain in this Free State.</P>

I said yesterday when Deputy Briscoe rose that we were in fact discussing Section 4, amendment 6 and amendment 8 together, but that we had got into a very much wider range of topics, and that we could not continue on that line indefinitely.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but I suggest, as far as reference has been made to wages and conditions on the Shannon scheme by Deputy Flinn, that I am entitled to refer to some of the things he said in relation to them.  I want to say this&mdash;and I think it will be generally agreed, at any rate, throughout the Free State &mdash;that for the working-class people of this country the 32/- Free State or the 32/- Republic has no attraction. I challenge any person in this House or outside it who has visited the Shannon scheme and inquired into the conditions of living there, apart altogether from the question of wages, to deny that these workers were employed and engaged under the most dehumanising and demoralising conditions in this part of the world, or in any part of Europe, for that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can.  That that work has been carried on without <Col N="1279" /> a semblance of recognition for Factory Acts or any other class of humane legislation in force in this country is undeniable, and is manifested by the high rate of mortality due to accidents, not to speak of the large number of minor accidents.  It is undoubtedly a fact that in the present state of capitalist society&mdash; so well represented by Deputy Flinn and certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;so long as that condition of things is permitted to operate, we will have a larger number of persons than work can be provided for, as indicated week after week and month after month by the thousands of persons who must leave our shores to seek employment elsewhere. These conditions, I submit, will continue to operate so long as the present state of capitalist society exists, and it is for the Fianna Fáil Party, who proclaim themselves such great friends of the workers and of the down-and-out unemployed, to make an approach to dealing with this matter in a somewhat better way than that advocated by Deputy Flinn yesterday&mdash;the law of tooth and fang.</P>
      <P>I want to reassure Deputy Flinn, Deputy Lemass, and the other members of that Party who think as they do, if they have any doubts or misgivings on the matter, that the working-class people of this country do not now and will not at any future date recognise the 32/- a week scheme which they apparently accept as the be-all and end-all of labour activity in this country.  At the same time, I am glad to know that there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party who do not think as Deputy Flinn and Deputy Lemass do on this question, and I want to reassure them also that the trade union movement in this country is a stronger movement than Fianna Fáil, is stronger even than Cumann na nGaedheal, and that not even the two forces combined can again drive the workers back to the level they had to submit to in 1913.  Now, to come to the matters dealt with by Deputy Good on this amendment&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Morrissey wants to ensure that that object will be realised he will be, I think, forced to agree that some alteration in the wording of his amendment is necessary. <Col N="1284" /> The Minister for Local Government made a suggestion yesterday which, although not adequate, did go some way to meet the difficulty. He suggested that we should insert in amendment No. 8 the words &ldquo;undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment,&rdquo; after sub-section (a).  That amendment would not appear to be a safeguard against all the dangers that might arise, but the idea is, I think, the idea that what we want to have provided for, that these persons should be engaged upon additional work which would not be undertaken if they were not available. But it should be work of a useful nature, work which in some other circumstance might be done for wages by persons in the ordinary course of industry or trade.  But so long as these destitute unemployed in receipt of relief are not used to disemploy persons who would be certain of engagements otherwise there could be no objection to the manner in which they are engaged. The idea that we want to provide for is the idea of additional work. If the Minister or Deputy Morrissey, or the Minister and Deputy Morrissey in consultation, or Deputy Morrissey and Deputy de Valera in consultation, could get an amendment which would ensure that that idea would be given effect to in the Bill, I think that all this hubbub that has arisen could easily be disposed of.</P>

      <P>There has been talk this afternoon about there being agreement about the main thing, but my interpretation of what is the main thing would not be the interpretation that has apparently been put on it by other people.  The only main thing on which there has been general agreement is, if it is possible to provide work that would not ordinarily be done, and to employ on that work persons who are seeking relief, that that work ought to be provided.  Deputy Derrig suggests that relief work is no use.  In fact, that is the conclusion that a very large number of people engaged in the work of relief have had <Col N="1285" /> to come to because of the difficulty of finding work upon which persons might be employed and of the uneconomic nature of most of the work that has been tackled in that particular way.  There has been general reaction from time to time against relief being carried out by those responsible for the relief of the poor.  Nevertheless, I take it that while having that as an opinion, and to a certain extent I sympathise with that opinion because, as I have said, our difficulty is to know upon what work any of these poor law authorities will employ men if they want to employ them.  While having that opinion, I take it that even Deputy Derrig would join the general opinion here that if it is possible to provide work that work should be provided for those men.  Now it is proposed here that certain action should be taken that will compel the Minister to be clear about something or another, and the general ideas are served out, conflicting with the various points and the Minister has to clarify everything, and make everything word-perfect from the legislative point of view, so that everything being word-perfect from the legislative point of view, everything outside will be right for those who want to administer it.  After the discussion heard here, I have no hope that any words that can be put into this measure are going to reconcile either the differences that have been disclosed here between Deputies or are really going to help anyone to administer relief in the most satisfactory way.</P>

    <P>Deputy Morrissey, speaking yesterday, suggested that the Balrothery Board of Guardians might come along and build labourers' cottages with this particular class of relief.  He fears that Deputy de Valera thinks that it would be an excellent idea if local bodies throughout the country, having housing schemes that were not being gone on with, would take the type of labour that is looking for relief, would organise carpenters and labourers, saying to them.  &ldquo;We are prepared to relieve you.&rdquo;  In the <Col N="1286" /> case, say, of a man with a wife, I take it the relief would be 7/6, because this is the basis upon which it is administered in Dublin at present. A man is given 7/6, with 2/6 for his wife and 2/6 for every child. Take a man with a wife and two children, he would get 15/-.  Deputy de Valera sees local authorities organising their house - building schemes by taking that particular type of persons, organising them into gangs and treating them according to their trade union rates of wages and saying, &ldquo;Ordinarily you get 15/- on relief; therefore we will now give you eight, nine or eleven hours' work to do and require that of you for relief work.&rdquo; He seems to think that magnificently organised and splendid economic schemes of housing can be conducted in that particular way.  The general experience of engineers and others who have to deal with relief labour has been that the capacity of the man they get is about 50 or 60 per cent. the capacity of the type of man that would be got by an ordinary ganger or foreman organising his gang for general trade purposes.  I would like to hear that denied if anyone with experience can deny it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, it is a general experience and what I say cannot be done is that on relief work you cannot afford to pay wages that ignore the capacity of the man that is carrying out the work.  Deputy Morrissey, passing from the fear of what might happen about house building up at Balrothery, more or less suggested that it actually happened, or something on all fours with it had happened, and that I had said that 30/- a week was a sufficient wage for men who were employed on the actual work of developing land for housing purposes.  What actually happened was that before Christmas the work was begun. Because of the opposition of certain persons, who tried to get the men not to work, the project was left aside, having worked a few days, <Col N="1287" /> and begun again in January on an area that would probably take 250 houses.  The Commissioners started relief work in the clearing and developing of that area.  On that site for the last nine months or more they have got about 65 men engaged who would otherwise be in the receipt of relief.  They pay them 30/- a week, and when the matter was raised here before I said that the work had been costed and that if there was any saving on that work based on the difference between what the actual costing of the work would be in the ordinary circumstances and the actual carrying out of the work with relief labour at 30/- a week, the difference would be paid to the men in a bonus.  About four weeks or so ago the question arose with the Commissioners that at the rate the work was going on they could not see their way to afford to carry on the work at a cost of 30/- per week per man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the critical atmosphere brought about by the development of the decision of the Commissioners to shut down the work there was a discussion on the matter, and an offer was made and an increased output was given following that offer.  Since that offer was made on the work which was actually performed the Commissioners have paid a bonus of 5/- a week extra, so that the men on that work have been drawing 35/- a week since then, but the demand, if we understand the words here, is that men who are engaged in that particular work should be paid 58/8 per week, perhaps not as high as that, because the men are working, say, 36 hours a week as against the 44 which the 58/8 would warrant. Persons responsible for administering poor law cannot accept the position that men who are put on relief work of the type they get looking for relief can, economically even, if you take into consideration the fact that they would otherwise be drawing relief, be paid the rates of wages some Deputies here would demand. At the present, as I say, these men with increased output are being paid 35/- a week for a 36 hours' week. <Col N="1288" /> The average agricultural wages paid in the district in which they are working is about 33/3.  I am sure Deputy Cassidy would suggest that it is not even as high as that.  The road workers, for a 44 hours week, are paid 43/- in the same area.  That has actually been done, and that is the kind of work that I personally would like to see done.  That is the standard that I would like to see maintained by the Commissioners and by people carrying out work of this particular class.  There is no use in the suggestion the Labour Deputies made that trade union wages must be paid for this particular class of work, or in the suggestion that Deputy de Valera made, that an equivalent to the trades union wages of work should be done in respect of the relief that is proposed to be given.  It has been asked what exactly we do propose by inserting here &ldquo;the powers.&rdquo;  I said before, it is difficult to see where any body administering this Act can find even a little amount of work to give as either test work to persons whose bona fides in the searching of relief is doubted, or to persons for whom work would be desirable if they are to be kept in proper morale.  Deputy Morrissey has not helped us in any way.  As has been clearly said, the amendment prevents work of any kind being got.</P>

      <P>I am quite clear that this section and the amendment that is there empower a board of guardians to pay for the carrying out of work by relief labour.  What my amendment proposes is that the guardians can contract with either an ordinary local authority, such as the Dublin County Council, or the Dublin City Commissioners, replacing the borough council, to carry out some piece of public utility work. It provides power that if any public utility society or any philanthropic body want to develop, say, a site for houses, that the guardians can contract with these people to do the type of work such as has been suggested here by Deputy Corish.  The empowering amendment gives them a machinery by which they can get work done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase to 35/- a week followed an increased output.  It followed an offer of increased output, and the increase of 5/- at the present moment is dependent upon the maintenance of that increased output, which has been given and is being paid for.  When <Col N="1290" /> we speak of wages generally we are referred by some Deputies here to the road workers.  I want to say first, in reply to Deputy Cassidy who raised the matter yesterday, that all we are preventing the county council in Donegal from doing is from paying a higher rate of wages out of money provided by the State than they are prepared to pay out of money raised by the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister in regard to that?  I think he is altogether misinformed, inasmuch as at the present time the Local Government Department only allow the county council to pay the starvation rate of wages of 26/- a week.  Some of the local authorities in County Donegal are paying 30/- a week out of the rates.  As far as the Donegal County Council is concerned, they employ no direct labour on the by-roads.  Consequently, the Minister is not right in the statement he has made.  The Minister is deliberately standing for 26/- a week in Donegal, although a number of the local authorities, notably the Bundoran and Buncrana Urban Councils, are paying a higher rate of wages.</P>

It does not, as the Deputy will agree, compare with the rate of wages that would be paid if the ordinary labourers' wages in Dublin were paid on this particular class of work, as we are asked by the Deputy to do.  I cannot accept Deputy Morrissey's amendment because, as far as I know, it would prevent any work of any useful kind being done, as has been said.  I cannot see any hope, even by combining my brains with those of some of the other Deputies, that I can suggest anything more useful as an addition to my amendment here than what has been already proposed, and that is to extend the term &ldquo;any work of public utility&rdquo; to &ldquo;any work of public utility undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.&rdquo;  That provides the power to get done any work of that particular class that the bodies dealing with relief in the city and county of Dublin can possibly find, and I know that their search will be a hard one.  The question has also been asked whether persons employed <Col N="1292" /> on this particular relief work are going to be paid in money or in kind?  Persons employed on work will be paid in money.  Persons who are being relieved will, as far as possible, be relieved in kind, but, as far as the necessities of any particular case are concerned, will be relieved in kind and in money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered to a certain extent the question which I put yesterday.  I understand the Ministry has already come to a definite decision with regard to the administration of this relief and I should like the Minister to state to what extent relief is going to be given in kind and in money.  It is all very well giving a man who has a wife and child a food ticket amounting to fifteen shillings, but how is that man going to clothe himself and get a shelter for himself? I should like the Minister to give us something definite as to how it is going to be administered.  The rates are going to be increased for the purpose of relieving the unemployed &mdash;the people who have no food.  The Bill is classifying these people as destitute, and we are not told how the relief is going to be administered. There is great objection to the manner in which relief is at present administered&mdash;some people will get it and others will not.  There is one thing which I should like to point out, which was borne out by a lady who is very active in Dublin in connection with the destitute poor.  If a man applies to a relieving officer to come and inquire into his case, and if the relieving officer decides to give him a food ticket for himself and his family, if that man dares to take on a day's job to augment the food ticket by a few shillings towards his rent or to clothe himself, he is debarred from further relief. I want the Minister to tell the House clearly and explicitly what the restrictions are going to be, if any, and are some of the restrictions already existing in connection with the administration of relief going to be removed?  I am not concerned with the labour policy or with Deputy Morrissey's amendment, but <Col N="1293" /> what I am concerned with is that the urgency of the situation in Dublin has brought about this solution from the Minister.  That is what we are considering and what the Bill covers.  As representing Dublin, I want to know how is it going to be administered and what the restrictions are going to be, and then we will be getting nearer to what I am concerned with.  I believe most people are concerned with the poorer people in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this Bill in this way, that I see, with the continual rise of unemployment, that in the rural areas we will have to consider the application of some relief like this.  On this amendment, one thing strikes me which I am not clear about, and which I put to Deputy Morrissey.  A municipality or county council in the ordinary way carry out what we call normal schemes of road work, sanitation, etc.  If they decide on giving relief to unemployed labour on the improvement, say, of by-roads, on water supplies and extra sanitary schemes, will the adoption of Deputy Morrissey's amendment prevent the council employing the destitute on such schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be perfectly clear on what we stand for on this.  I contend that it is better, say, if you are giving £1 per week in relief to take a batch of men on for two or three days at this work, and another batch for two or three days more, rather than to leave them drawing a kind of dole.  I think it is better for the community as a whole.  As regards the Minister's contention about their not being capable of giving the work of normal men, that is principally due to malnutrition.  I contend that after a while they will give as satisfactory work as a normal man.  Of course that is no solution for the problem at all.  It is the duty of the State to provide work for everyone out of work, and they will find that the passing of this Bill will not solve the problem.  Eventually the problem will have to be faced of dealing with all the unemployed, and if Deputy Morrissey's amendment is carried. <Col N="1295" /> and it is through the machinery of local government that relief schemes will come and will have to be found to solve the unemployment problem, will the adoption of his amendment prevent destitute people from being employed on abnormal schemes and nobody but people with a trades union card being employed?</P>

      <P>When I spoke last night I put it to the House as a problem. I put it with complete consciousness of the fact that in speaking in that spirit I was taking a risk of what has happened happening&mdash;that what was said sincerely, quite clearly, without premeditation, without guarding words of any sort or kind, would be selected and used for the purposes of political propaganda. That risk, unfortunately, I had to take.  I may have hoped that misuse would not have been made of that contribution, but I had no right, founded on experience, to hope anything of the kind.  I personally have not been able to get hold of a copy of my own speech of last night, and I presume, therefore, that no one else has, and I have not been able to go through that speech and find if there was any word which should be changed or any expression which <Col N="1296" /> should be altered; nor have I been able to go through it to find the particular words or expression upon which there has been based the suggestion that I have enunciated the doctrine of tooth and claw.</P>
      <P>As far as I understand the position, what is complained of is the statement made by me that if any man would come forward and employ in this country the whole of the unemployed at the rate which was paid on the Shannon scheme, that man would be a benefactor of the highest possible order.  That seems to me to be the gravamen of the complaint. I repeat that statement, and stand over it and I will maintain it. If we take the figure, given by the Labour Party, of unemployment in this country, it is supposed to run to 90,000 people.</P>

The figures given by the Labour Party of unemployment in this country were given to cover somewhere about 90,000 persons. At 32/- a week for fifty weeks in the year, the employment of these people would represent a wage of £7,000,000.  I say deliberately that any man who would come forward, in the present condition of economic affairs in Ireland and the present degree of poverty and unemployment, and add to the fund of wages £7,000,000 of money by taking the whole of these 90,000 people out of unemployment into employment, is a great benefactor to this country and one to whom I, at any rate, am prepared to pay a tribute of respect for his services.  These 90,000 men to-day lie in wait upon existing production of every kind, and if any man will come forward and tell us some way by which at mere &ldquo;line ball&rdquo; he will restore to the community £7,000,000 worth of food and clothing and shelter which he is prepared to distribute to these unemployed men, then he will be a man who has solved a problem which no man in this House, at the present moment, is capable of solving and which the so-called Labour Party&mdash; (interruptions)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, their strength has been shown in this House as 110 to 5, as 113 to 12&mdash;that is the strength of the Labour Party.  That is what they get when they go to the electorate, the vast majority of whom are labouring people.  They come back with four or five per cent. of the representation in this whole Dáil. Have they the right to speak for Labour?  They whom Labour repudiate and will not send back to this House, will not allow this, that, and the other.  They have not as much power as the Farmers' Party, because the Farmers' Party do happen, for the moment, to hold the balance of power, and they do not. Again, I repeat deliberately, and will stand over it, that the man who will come forward and find productive work which will pay seven millions of money to the unemployed in this country at this moment will perform a very real service.  He will lift off the cost of production the whole of those who to-day are idle and have to be maintained out of the existing production.  They will begin the upward curve, they will give us some reserve and some opportunity to build up on conditions which to-day are stagnant.  I have nothing to withdraw, nothing to extenuate, and nothing to apologise for.</P>

      <P>It has been said already that this debate has wandered into many strange paths.  It is <Col N="1299" /> true also, I think, that we have learned very much in the course of the debate that quite a number of us expected for a very considerable time.  The question has been frequently asked what this amendment aims at.  There appears to be a very strange reluctance even to attempt to realise what the amendment aims at.  I have refrained from taking practically any part up to the present in the discussions on this Bill.  I have not studied the amendments or the Bill in the manner that I should have if I were to be prepared to take an intelligent part in the debate, but from a very cursory examination of the amendment I can see quite a number of things that it is aimed to prevent.  I have not heard one word as to the attitude of certain members who have made memorable contributions to this debate on points of this kind.  This amendment, for instance, will prevent any local authority from organising an army of scabs to do work at their bid and call under pressure conditions.  It is going to prevent an organised army of strike-breakers being put at the disposal either of private individuals or of any local authority under the control of the Minister.  I am not at all sure that the Minister would not be anxious to have facilities for using an army of that kind.  I think that his speeches on this question were characterised by the same outlook that we saw revealed on other questions of a similar kind that came before the House on previous occasions.  I think it is nothing short of a tragedy that a Minister with the outlook of the present Minister for Local Government should be presiding over the Department that he happens to be in charge of at the moment.  If there is one Department in this State where a humane outlook and a wide knowledge and appreciation of the difficulties of the people of the country should prevail in, it is in the Department of Local Government.  But I can see clearly, not alone on this question, but on other questions such as that affecting pensions for widows <Col N="1300" /> as well as numerous other questions, the same strong hand and cast-iron outlook that we had running through the speech of the Minister here this evening.</P>

      <P>What I want to tell the Minister definitely is this, that until very recently he insisted that the Cork County Council should not pay more than 29/- a week, and that he was simply relying on a technicality&mdash;on a recent change in the policy of his Department&mdash;when he contradicted Deputy Cassidy on that point to-day.  In view of things that we have seen in this House already, it is not surprising at the moment to find Deputy Flinn able to gloat over the magnificent total of 109 votes that we had here on one side of the House yesterday against what the Deputy and his friends have been pleased to describe as the miserable minority.  We have had examples of this kind already. Within the last six or seven months we have had on half-a-dozen notable occasions this huge block on one side and the miserable minority on the other.  That has always arisen out of the same circumstances; it has always arisen here in connection with questions of wages and of living conditions.</P>

I regret extremely that the speech of Deputy de Valera, which I am quite willing to admit was a humane speech, was spoiled by a certain remark that he made.  I hope I am doing the Deputy no injustice when I repeat his statement that Deputy Lemass was quite justified in the line which he took up yesterday evening.

      <P>I confess I was somewhat surprised that Deputy Lemass took that line.  On the other hand, I was not in the least surprised at Deputy Flinn's outburst.  There are Deputies in this House from West Cork who know that Deputy Flinn was born into that tradition.  There are Deputies in this House who know there are certain people whom Deputy Flinn knows about who were always able to get 1/11 for their 1/-, and if Deputy Flinn wants any proof of that fact he will find many persons in West Cork who will give it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask himself.  He has certainly not improved the situation by the apology that we have heard to-day.  I suggest that in future when speeches are to be made in this country about the Fascisti and the new Mussolinis, that Deputy Flinn should advocate that doctrine.  His strong policy and his extremely strong voice suit him eminently for that purpose. When it comes to wiping out these abominable trade union restrictions, and when it comes to rooting out the ruthless capitalists Deputy Flinn speaks for in this House, and the people who stand for the imposition of out-of-date trade union restrictions, Deputy Flinn will be able to do an immense service to his own class, indeed.  I notice that Comrade <Col N="1304" /> Cooney is strangely silent in this debate.  He was slobbering here last week about the unemployed people in Dublin.  He came in here with a catch in his voice and he asked that a deputation would be received.  Deputy Cooney refused to vote yesterday for giving relief to people except they were two years living in Dublin.  The one Deputy who continually slobbers over the brotherhood of man in the world and the International workers of the world, has not a word to say when Deputy Flinn makes a statement that I hope will become historic in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn is entitled to get any comfort he likes out of the fact that up to the present the workers have been foolish enough to vote for people like him.  I am quite sure that a number of the unfortunate workers in Cork were responsible for sending him here.  I hope they enjoyed his views on this question when they read them in the newspapers this morning.  He need not fear that this game is going to continue much longer.  There are signs all over the country that people like Deputy Flinn are being found out, and the reaction that is going to come will come a great deal more quickly because we have got this question out in the open, and because we have the admission that relief work can be offered at any price, and that Kaffir conditions can be advocated not alone in the public boards or elsewhere, but in the Parliament of the country, that men can be got at any price.  Why not employ people at 30/- a week, with others trying to get in at 20/- a week?  Why give them anything at all, but only offer them food, and you will have prosperity in the State?  Deputy de Valera pays lip service, and I am quite prepared to admit honest service, to the right to work on fair living conditions, but there is a falling away and we have got the brutal truth, and we can thank God that we have got it so soon.</P>

      <P>Before the amendment is put I wish to say a word or two.  I do not want to follow <Col N="1305" /> this debate into the various bypaths into which it has travelled in the last 24 hours, but I want to say that there is no Party in the House, including Deputy Murphy's Party, that on its record as a Party has done more for the workers or given more help to them than the Party with which I am associated here. Not all the members in the Party, great or small, on the Labour Benches have done more as a Party than we have done or hope to do; or than they hope to do, for the workers, whether they are destitute or whether they are in constant employment. Deputy Murphy referred to Deputy Lemass as being opposed to the principle of trade unions. The words quoted by Deputy Murphy do not, to my mind, put Deputy Lemass against trade unionism in any way, in any shape or form.  It is worthy of note&mdash;and Labour members ought to bear this in mind&mdash;that when there were in Dublin some good Labour men, even with national records, put up for election, the workers of Dublin City, North and South, voted for the Fianna Fáil candidates against the candidates put up by the Labour Party.</P>

It is strange that the mover of the amendment made no attempt to explain its terms.  In fact, he threw cold water on his own amendment, and went so far as to suggest that if the Minister would agree to bring in an amendment which he would draft for Deputy Morrissey that Deputy Morrissey would withdraw his amendment, showing that he had no confidence in his own amendment, whoever drafted it for him.</P>

      <P>I accept the effort we made to put an interpretation on it as expressed by Deputy <Col N="1307" /> de Valera, and we will try and unravel the incoherent phraseology of the Labour Party and put in words what, at any rate, is in our mind when the Report Stage comes on. We were anxious to safeguard trade union principles in so far as they could be safeguarded in this Bill. We were not anxious&mdash;I do not know whether the gentlemen opposite were anxious&mdash;as Deputy Murphy suggested, to use the money available under this Bill for the purpose of introducing slave conditions, Hottentot conditions or coolie labour in this country.  I believe that nobody in this country would allow them to do it.  They would not be allowed to do it even if they wanted. That is not our intention.  Our intention is to stand for trade union principles.  We were anxious to vote for an amendment which would safeguard those principles, and for that reason we said that we would wait until we heard Deputy Morrissey indicate what the amendment meant.  It was not clear from the words.  He did not give us any help, but, having put our own interpretation on the words, we will vote for the amendment, hoping to clarify it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish was, I think, the only Deputy of the Labour Party who gave one illustration of the class of work that could be done by boards of guardians.  He said that he would take it on himself to say that the clearing of sites for houses might be done, and Deputy Morrissey, I think rather reluctantly, agreed that that type of work could be done, but no other suggestion was made.  Deputy Morrissey has been pressed to give an indication in a general way as to the class of work that could be done, but he failed to do so.  No other member of the Labour Party helped the House in that respect.  That is not fair to the House if they want the House to bind themselves by passing this amendment. It is not the first time that we have had to help the Labour Party out of difficulties, and I suppose it will not be the last.  We will <Col N="1308" /> try to draft an amendment which will safeguard trade union principles, for which the workers have suffered so much, and introduce it on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask Deputy Morrissey whether it is his purpose, in putting down the amendment, to secure that when work is required in exchange for relief the man who is taken into employment will not displace another man who normally would be employed by doing work which would ordinarily be done within a certain period.  I am putting that question definitely.</P>

      <P>Then I suggest that the amendment should have been worded in this way: &ldquo;which is not work that, but for the provisions of this section, would ordinarily be done by persons within the two or three years&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever period the Deputy likes&mdash;&ldquo;immediately subsequent to the date upon which such relief work is started.&rdquo;  I believe if the amendment had been put down in that form, and if there were any other reservations which Deputy Morrissey might have wished to put on the conditions on which relief work was being offered, there would not have been half the bother about it.  If it is more or less with a view to securing the principle I have stated, that the relief work will not displace men who are now employed, and that the idea is that relief work will to a certain extent be in anticipation of work which normally would not be done for three or four years, I see no objection in voting for the amendment, and I shall vote for it with the idea of having it clarified, in some other form of words, on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment believe that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are puzzled <Col N="1309" /> as much as they pretend to be over the amendment.  The object of the amendment is quite simple and I shall try to put it as briefly as I can. I want to make sure that work which, if this Bill were not passed, would be performed by workers recruited in the ordinary way, at the standard rate of wages and under standard conditions, will not be performed, as could happen under this Bill, perhaps, at half the wages and half the conditions.  Let me put it briefly again.  We want to ensure that work which would be performed, if this Bill were not passed, by workmen recruited in the ordinary way at trade union rate of wages, standard rates and conditions, will not, consequent on the passing of this Bill, be performed at half or any figure under the standard rate of wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete all words after the word &ldquo;person,&rdquo; line 6, to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stipulated under Section 4 of the Act that work may be required from persons receiving outdoor relief. At the same time a stipulation is made that &ldquo;the assignment of such task to a person receiving relief shall not be deemed to establish the relationship of master and servant or any contract of service between the Board and such persons.&rdquo;  Further on it is stipulated that the Minister will have power to acquire land and machinery for the purpose of putting these people in receipt of outdoor relief to work.  I am moving my amendment with the intention of clarifying the section in regard to unemployment benefit, national health insurance, workmen's compensation, and compensation under the Factories Acts in relation to people who may be in receipt of outdoor relief and who may be engaged on certain work under this particular Bill.  It might be held by some that there is some ground for excluding those people from health insurance or unemployment benefit.  I hold that there is no ground for their exclusion from either one or the other.  If such a claim could be put forward in regard to national health insurance or unemployment benefit, it certainly could not be put forward in regard to workmen's compensation or compensation under the Factories Acts.  If a person put upon work in connection with this relief scheme met with a fatal accident, and if he were excluded from compensation under the Workmen's <Col N="1313" /> Compensation Acts, his dependants would not be entitled to any benefit. Similarly, if a person were excluded from the operation of the Factories Acts and met with an accident, there would be no compensation.  Deputies are aware that certain precautions have to be taken to guard against accidents in connection with certain classes of work.  Take the building trade as an example.  If a building is more than thirty feet high, a scaffolding of certain dimensions has to be erected.  I see no reason, if men are put on to that work under this relief scheme, why they should be debarred from the protection afforded under those Acts.  The Minister should agree to allow those people to obtain benefit, not alone under the Factories Acts and the Workmen's Compensation Acts, but also under the Unemployment and National Health Insurance Acts.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purpose of the provision of work under this section, a board of guardians may&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment does not seem to me to deal with the same matter at all.  This is a question of contracting with any person or body of persons for the performance by the board for or on behalf of such person or body of persons of any work of public utility.  I cannot be certain that I see the full implication of that particular clause, and I would like to have an explanation from the Minister as to the meaning of (2) (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with amendments 6 and 8 together, I explained that this amendment will give power to poor relief authorities in either the city or the county of Dublin to contract with the County Council in Dublin or the City Commissioners&mdash;that is, the Commissioners who replaced the borough council&mdash;to carry out any work of public utility undertaken for the purpose of providing additional work.  It is, I think, more satisfactory than the sub-section as it stands, because it provides machinery to enable them to contract with a body.  In the, perhaps, not very likely, but still possible, situation of a public utility society requiring to develop or clear any land they may have acquired, or for that matter, any charitable institution or any society, for the provision of houses for the very poor, or any charitably-disposed person who might be able to think of what Deputies here have not been able to think of, a particular class of work upon which this <Col N="1315" /> particular type of labour could be employed, this amendment gives the Commissioners necessary powers.  In the very unlikely circumstances of their being able to get an offer to provide work of this kind from any person or any body like that, they will have requisite powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the wording of the amendment is much wider than anything the Minister has explained. The amendment sets out &ldquo;may contract with any person or body of persons.&rdquo;  This particular sub-section could be abused, because it could be utilised for purposes not indicated by the Minister.  Would it not be possible to get words so as to narrow the meaning to exactly what the Minister has in mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in the amendment &ldquo;any work of public utility,&rdquo; and I have undertaken to put in &ldquo;undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.&rdquo; Even putting in that will not find the work, but as far as words can go the Deputy has the whole English dictionary at his disposal to put in more suitable words. What I do want is to have powers in the Bill that will enable the Union Commissioners or the Board of Guardians in Rathdown or Balrothery to take advantage of any work that may appear on the scene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with that, but we do not want to see that power abused.  The words here would leave it open to abuse.  As far as I can see, it would be quite possible to contract with builders or with a building contractor and do work for them.  Take, as an example, that certain workers are on strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers here are much too general and there are several elements that have to be considered.  There is the question of time and whether the relief work will be of an unusual character.  I think it should be specified that the work should be of an unusual character or should be work which <Col N="1316" /> would not ordinarily be undertaken for three, four or five years.  There should be some limitation upon these powers.  The Minister ought to consider putting down an amendment for the Report Stage which will provide him with the fullest powers necessary, but will also provide safeguards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally would not be prepared to do that.  I think it is the business of the Minister, if he wants to get this particular section passed, to get the kind of expression that he wants, and he should not look to the House here to pass something that he may wish to interpret in his own way but other people may interpret in another way.  It is the business of the Minister to get the words that he needs. Until he does that I am not going to vote for the amendment in that form.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Blue Lagoon would be a work of public utility, but I can imagine it easily would.  However, we are legislating to give persons charged with the administration of poor relief to have at their disposal powers, so that any work that could reasonably be regarded as a work that should be done under this Act could be done.  When I say reasonably I mean the kind of work that Deputy Morrissey, in spite of the wording of his amendment, would be prepared to see done, or the kind of work that Deputy Corish and the Deputies opposite would be prepared to see done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To give them powers to get that work done if a private person, a contractor, a public utility society, or a public body can point out where that work is. All I can say is that we are not legislating for simpletons or for people of irresponsible minds.  We are legislating for a public body like the guardians of Rathdown Union, a public body like the guardians of the Balrothery Union, or a public body that is composed of the three Union Commissioners.  And I want to give them the widest possible powers. Because it is not wide powers we have to be afraid of.  It is want of this class of work that we have to be afraid of, and that nothing would stand in the way of the relief authorities getting this work carried out.  It is work that would be suitable if it were available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what we should be most afraid of is the interpretation of the words &ldquo;public utility.&rdquo;  We all know what is meant by public utility in an economic sense.  I want to make this suggestion to the Minister, that if he defines what would be the nature of those public utilities we would then have a clearer idea of what is meant by this section.  If he defined that under the headings, a, b and c, it would make it clear.  For instance, a public bath is a public utility.  That is accepted as a public utility in the economic and general sense.  Now a public bath is a work that might be undertaken by a board of guardians and that board of guardians, under this Bill, would have power to employ persons and engage machinery, etc. Here again you might be up against it.  Deputy Good might be a contractor and paying the recognised trade union rate of wages, and here he would be brought into competition with the board of guardians acting under this Bill and doing a work of public utility but yet paying a scale of wages not recognised by trade union rules and a rate lower than that paid by the contractors in Dublin.  I do not often make a speech on behalf of vested <Col N="1318" /> interests, but an injustice might be created to a contractor under this Bill and I would like to avoid that. I would like the Minister to make it clear and to define what he means by &ldquo;public utility.&rdquo;  I would ask him to define it, say, under the heads of a, b and c.  Then we would be clear as to its meaning.</P>

      <P>I simply want to point out again to the Minister that when giving wide powers it is clear that he is giving powers that may be abused.  The principle that is involved here is one that a large number of Deputies want to take care will not be abused.  The Minister spoke about the English dictionary. The Minister had the English dictionary, and I submit it is not fair to the House on the Third Reading to take a form of words that will include the particular thing that we want specifically to avoid.  We ought not to be so lazy as to avoid going to the trouble of specifying the things that we will permit and the things we want to exclude. We want certain things excluded here, and if the Minister wants the Bill in its present form, then he is not going to get our support.</P>

      <P>Deputies can, if they like, shut their eyes to the class of labour and the type of persons that we are legislating for. They need not ask me to do it.  Deputy Anthony need not ask me to provide in this legislation that none of the public bodies in the city or county of Dublin shall not build public baths by means of relief work.  If they did an injustice would, I agree, be done.  It would be an injustice to the ratepayers, who would have to pay for the work. If Deputies want a definition for the purpose of a discussion like this, it is, I say, not doing anything to provide work.  If they want it for purposes like this, if they want to know how I would define &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; for this particular section, it would be work that would differ from <Col N="1319" /> simply taking a stone and rolling it up and down the hill for the purpose of providing work.</P>

      <P>Personally I would very strongly object to any moneys that may have, under the terms of this Bill, to be provided by the ratepayers for the purpose of giving contractors profits out of schemes of this kind.  I do not think that contractors should be given an opportunity of making a profit at the expense of the ratepayers in the peculiar <Col N="1320" /> circumstances under which the ratepayers have to provide this money.  The Minister talks of giving very wide powers to the boards of guardians that he refers to.  But we know that the hidden hand of the Minister lies behind those powers, and it may be possible under the wording of the section to lay down conditions which may make it possible to have works of public utility &mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;carried out under scab conditions.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, with your permission, to deal with certain misrepresentations of the speech delivered by me yesterday in a speech on an amendment to this section by Deputy Murphy.  Deputies will recollect that I expressed a view that in State schemes of work, undertaken for the purpose of relieving unemployment, it would not be possible to observe general trade union regulations, and stated that such regulations could not be permitted to prevent such work being undertaken. Deputy Murphy first misquoted what I said, and then proceeded to misrepresent it as a general attack on trade unions.  In case, however, he may think it wise to continue such misrepresentations in future, either here or outside, I would like to inform him that the view expressed by me has already been published by prominent members of the Labour Party.  I would refer him to the issue of &ldquo;The Irishman,&rdquo; which, I understand, is the official organ of that Party, of November 26th, 1927, in which there was an article entitled &ldquo;The Right to Work and National Co-operation.&rdquo; by Mr.&mdash; now Senator&mdash;Thomas Johnson.  Mr. Johnson quotes a statement which was made by Mr. de Valera in the debate on unemployment in this House during the previous week, to the effect that &ldquo;It is the duty of a modern State under modern conditions to see that work is available for those willing to work.&rdquo;  Commenting on that, the article says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When a party with that principle governing its economic policy enters into the seats of power, a vitally important event for the workers will have occurred.  Its importance will depend upon the earnestness with which the Government seeks to give effect to the principle.</P>
      <P>It goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>What effect will the prospect of this change of State policy have upon the Labour movement?  How is the Labour Party affected? How are the trade unions affected?</P>
      <P>Trade unions will appreciate the effect upon wages and conditions that would follow the opening of avenues of employment for their unemployed members, even though such employment were not at their regular trade or occupation.</P>
      <P>When we speak of guaranteeing work to unemployed workers, we do not imagine that it is practicable to employ every man at his own trade, or that when a bricklayer or engineer is disemployed the State will ensure him a job at skilled workman's wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I suggest to Deputy Murphy that these quotations which I have read are identical in substance with <Col N="1323" /> my remarks yesterday, and if he thinks these remarks are open to attack he should realise that I will be standing in very good company.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>(1)  For the purposes of this section the Dublin Union shall be divided into two portions (in this section referred to as &ldquo;districts&rdquo;) as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the area consisting of the County Borough of Dublin, the Urban District of Rathmines and Rathgar and the Urban District of Pembroke shall form one such district, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the remainder of the Dublin Union shall form the other such district.</P>
      <P>(2)  The whole of the expenses incurred by the Board of Guardians of the Dublin Union under this Act in or in relation to the granting of relief under this Act to destitute poor persons in either district shall be raised equally over such district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where any expenses are incurred by the Board of Guardians of the Dublin Union in or in relation to the granting of relief under this Act to destitute poor persons in the said Union generally or to destitute poor persons in an area including the whole or <Col N="1324" /> portion of one district and also the whole or portion of the other district, such expenses shall, subject to such regulations, if any, as may be made by the Minister in that behalf, be apportioned by the Board of Guardians between the two districts in such proportion as shall seem to the Board just and proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 5 the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where relief under this Act is granted by a board of guardians to any person and such person is not required as a condition of the granting of such relief to perform a task of work under the foregoing section, such relief or the cost thereof shall be deemed to be given by way of loan and shall be recoverable as a debt due to the board from the person to whom such relief shall have been granted or considered as granted under the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts, 1838 to 1914.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put this amendment before the House with two things in mind. There is a desirable class of person whom we wish to help who will hesitate to touch relief because of the injury to their self-respect that the receipt of relief brings about. The insertion of this amendment would, I think, help that class to look for relief, with the agreement that, under circumstances that depend upon their financial position, they will repay that amount.  There is no question of pursuing them harshly in any way; it is simply a question of facilitating them to come forward and look for relief, with the idea that they will refund it when their circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another and a much smaller class that the amendment is also intended to cover, the persons who will come forward to take money that, in their opinion, can be got for nothing while they themselves have undisclosed means.  The principle of relief as a loan has existed in the Poor Law Acts since 1838, and I suggest that in this particular <Col N="1325" /> class of relief it is advisable to put in this amendment for the purpose particularly of helping a desirable class that otherwise would not search for relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister has taken a very shortsighted view of what is involved in the amendment, or at any rate in the explanation of it that he has given. Let him try to imagine the position of a person who has taken this relief by way of a loan and who afterwards finds himself trying to repay it.  To have hanging over a person a debt like that, which he feels it impossible to repay, is, we know, a very great source of annoyance.  I think it would be a crime to have such a thing hanging over a man's head when he finds himself in difficult circumstances.  If we have to give relief, let us give it, but let us not have it hanging over a man afterwards.  People who are likely to look for this relief are not likely to be readily in a position to repay it.  I think that this proposal is most unfair and that in the long run it will not work out properly.  If a man feels any loss of self-respect in seeking relief in the first place he is likely to feel double that loss of self-respect when he finds that he cannot repay his debt.  I see no reason why we should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I put it before the House to get an expression of opinion on it.  I would like to hear the views of other Deputies about it. It has been represented to me by persons who are closely associated with charitable work in the city that, in their opinion, there would be strong reasons for making this relief a loan; that, where the circumstances of the persons subsequently permit, it would be to the increase of their self-respect if it was a loan and if they were able to repay it.  If their circumstances do not enable them to repay it, I do not know that the question of the debt will hang over them very much.  However, as I say, I feel that it would be an addition to the Bill, and I am anxious to hear what Deputies think about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the amendment quite fulfils the Minister's wish, because there is the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; at the end of the fourth line, and it is absolutely mandatory in every case where relief is given.  I think the Minister's intention is that in certain cases where a man resents the fact that he has been given relief&mdash;a man of independent character&mdash;and knows that in a very short time he will obtain regular employment, he should be able to get out of the odium of having received Poor Law relief, and that the money should be regarded as a loan, but in that case the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should surely be inserted instead of &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I think it is putting the Minister's principle too far to say that in every case where relief is given it shall be regarded as a loan, because we know that at least 75 per cent. of the people who are asking for relief will not be in a position to repay it.  I suggest that the Minister should reserve it until the Report Stage to see if he can alter the drafting to attain that end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;this,&rdquo; line 15, to the end of the section and insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Act the County of Dublin and the County Borough of Dublin shall be one area of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> (2)  The whole of the expenses incurred by the Boards of Guardians of the Balrothery, Dublin and Rathdown Unions under this Act in or in relation to the granting of relief under this Act to destitute poor persons in the County of Dublin or in the County Borough of Dublin shall be raised equally over the said area of charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the area of charge and proposes to amend it as set out in the Bill.  It is rather extraordinary in connection with this Bill that for the purposes of a board of health the area of charge is the Dublin area, that is, it includes the city, the two townships, and the surrounding areas which come within the jurisdiction of the Dublin Union.  For the purposes of the maintenance of the Union that is the area of charge, and all who receive indoor relief in the Union will be a charge on that area.  That is as it stands at the moment, and at the moment I might say in addition, those who are receiving outdoor relief are charged over the area of the Dublin Union. Now this Bill provides under clause 2 that relief is to be given to persons other than those receiving relief already.  In clause 2 you will see the two classes of people.  Then we come to another extraordinary feature in this Bill, these additional classes which were to get relief are not to be a charge on the Dublin Union area, but they are to be a charge on a restricted area.  For the purposes of this Act the Dublin Union is divided into two areas.  Section 5 deals with it.  One area will be the city of Dublin, the urban district of Rathmines, and the urban district of Pembroke.  That particular area is to carry the burdens referred to in clause 2.  Those not included in that will be borne by the other area, I would like to know exactly what they are or who they are.  So that for the purpose of outdoor relief at the moment those receiving outdoor and indoor relief are chargeable to <Col N="1328" /> the area of the Dublin Union.</P>
    <P>These additional people who will be given relief under this Bill will be chargeable to quite a different area.  They will be chargeable to the city of Dublin and to the townships of Rathmines and Pembroke. I would be anxious to know why that division is made, on whose suggestion it was made, and whether the urban councils of Pembroke and Rathmines were consulted when a change was made in the area of charge for the purposes of this Bill? My amendment is that the area of charge should be the whole county. Let there be no misunderstanding about that.  Bearing that in mind, let me read for the Deputies exactly the classes, and where they come from, that are to be relieved under this particular Bill.  &ldquo;A person who has been resident for a continuous period,&rdquo; that is the two classes of persons.  They have to be resident for a continuous period of not less than two years.  Now, here is the important part: &ldquo;two years either in the county of Dublin or in the county borough of Dublin or in the city, county and county borough.&rdquo;  Now, a person may come who has been resident in any part of the county of Dublin for a period of two years and be a charge on the city of Dublin for the purposes of outdoor relief.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this fact, that we in the city of Dublin have to bear the liability of outdoor maintenance for any man and his dependants who have been for two years resident in any part of the county of Dublin.  I talked yesterday about injustice to Dublin.  Could any greater injustice be put on the county of Dublin than the injustice mentioned in this particular clause that the area of charge for the support of any people who may seek relief living in any part of the county or city of Dublin is to fall upon the city of Dublin in addition to the urban districts of Rathmines and Pembroke?  It is a gross injustice.  It is an absurdity on the face of it.  If you are going to take destitute people from any part of the county of Dublin and give them relief surely it is only fair that the <Col N="1329" /> burden should be spread over the whole area from which they come. That is what my amendment proposes, and I hope it will be accepted in fairness by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Deputy O'Kelly on the convert he has made.  Deputy O'Kelly, speaking on the Second Reading, said, after putting forward one alternative suggestion to the Government's Bill: &ldquo;I will say that the whole of the county of Dublin ought to bear equally the burden which is now being placed on the ratepayers.&rdquo;  He then mended his hand slightly and said: &ldquo;Or if not the urban areas.&rdquo;  Later we were informed by Deputy Lemass or Deputy de Valera that that was the policy of their party.  Deputy Good goes the whole hog.  Deputy O'Kelly's words found shelter in his heart and he promptly adopted the whole of Deputy O'Kelly's first and most courageous plan.  It rather reminds me of a reference of Benjamin Disraeli to the fact that Sir Robert Peel, in one of his sensational changes, found the Whigs bathing and appropriated their clothes. Deputy Good found Deputy O'Kelly bathing and carried off his clothes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not fit him.  Not even all the council of the Chamber of Commerce would be able to get Deputy O'Kelly's buttons to meet on Deputy Good.  Deputy Good will have to shelter his figurative nakedness with Deputy O'Kelly's umbrella and so decency can be saved.  I can understand Deputy O'Kelly making that suggestion or any Deputy representing the city making that suggestion, because they are rightly considering their constituents and trying to free them as a whole from what will be a very serious burden.  In a speech on the Second Reading Deputy Good defined that burden and said it was an unfair burden that would close struggling industries and would prevent the erection of factories. What is Deputy Good's remedy?  In this amendment to relieve <Col N="1330" /> the evils from which 45 per cent. of his constituents will suffer, he proposes to extend this unfair burden to the remaining 55 per cent. I could understand that proposal coming from a city Deputy.  I find it hard to understand it coming from a county Deputy.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Good's proposal is inequitable. It makes reference to the large number of people from the county who come into the city.  We do not have figures in the Census to show the very large number of people from the county who come into the city, but I know that the figure for people born outside the city of Dublin and now resident in Dublin is something like 28 per cent. and the figure for the number of people born outside the county Dublin and now resident in it, in the latest Census was 46 per cent.  So that if there is any influx it is not into the city but into the county.  I cannot get the figures for Pembroke and Rathmines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly, but these are the only figures we have. I say the proposal is inequitable.  I do not want to repeat what I said on the Second Reading at any length.  I then had the pleasure of partly convincing Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass, and of finding myself in partial agreement with them.  That was a very pleasant experience, which I hope may be repeated, possibly on this amendment. Why County Dublin is not a scientifically planned area or how it came by these boundaries I do not know. I am inclined to think it is probably a relic of the ancient Danish Kingdom of Dublin, because it straggles along the coast in such a way as to suggest that it was convenient to the Danes when they were coming in.  It has a large number of harbours. Certainly there is no advantage to the dwellers in the North part of the County Dublin, to whom Deputy Good proposes to extend the charge. They get no advantage from their proximity to the city that is not <Col N="1331" /> shared by dwellers in the counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Leixlip, Dunshaughlin, Bray and Greystones are quite as near the city as the north part of County Dublin&mdash; Skerries and Balbriggan&mdash;to which Deputy Good is extending this burden. They get no more benefit, in fact less benefit, out of their proximity to Dublin than Bray or Greystones, and because Bray and Greystones are in Wicklow they are not to be included, but because Skerries happens to be in the county of Dublin this unfair burden is to be imposed on it.  The proposal is not only unfair, it is uneconomical. What does Deputy Good suggest? He suggests, in the first place, that there should be a common area of charge, paying all the money collected into a common central fund. Of course the words &ldquo;central fund&rdquo; have a technical meaning in these debates.  We had better call it a central pool.  The money is to be levied by an equal rate over the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is Deputy Good's intention that it is not to be spent by a central body.  It is to be spent by three bodies.  It is to be spent, first of all, by the Commissioners of the Dublin Union, and also by the boards of guardians of Balrothery and Rathdown.  What would be the result?  The valuation of the city and county of Dublin is £2,146,907. Of that valuation, the city, Rathmines and Pembroke pay just a little less than three-quarters.  That will all go into a central pool, together with the shares taken from the other parts of the county, North Dublin rural, Rathdown and Balrothery. The rateable valuation of Rathdown is £244,928.  That is about 11½ per cent. of the whole. The valuation of Balrothery is only £107,998, about 5 per cent.  These three bodies will be drawing from the central pool.  While Rathdown will be only contributing 11½ per cent. to the central pool, there will be an incentive to the board of guardians of Rathdown&mdash;because they, like other boards of guardians, are popularly elected and anxious to please their constituents <Col N="1332" />&mdash;to spend largely on outdoor relief, when they know that they will have only to pay approximately a little more than one-tenth of the amount expended, that 70 per cent. of the remainder will be met by the ratepayers in the city of Dublin.  I think they would be a little less than human if they did not say: &ldquo;We can be generous in regard to outdoor relief as we do not pay the whole amount; it comes out of the central pool.&rdquo;  The same thing applies equally more to Balrothery, which only pays one-twentieth of the whole amount to the central pool.  It is not an economical proposition. I do not think it has ever been considered in that light.  It may make a very small saving with respect to the city, Pembroke and Rathmines, but I believe that the temptation to extravagance which will be created in the other two Unions will be such as practically to neutralise any saving that may be made in Pembroke and Rathmines. I see no way of getting Pembroke and Rathmines out of the city.  I should like to, but I see no prospect of doing it, partly because they are already in the Dublin Union and it would be difficult to take them out of it, and partly because they are destined shortly to become part of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good asked one question: Why is the Dublin Union divided? It is divided into two portions, one urban and one rural.  There are districts that are being left out, like Lucan, Swords and Finglas, of an agricultural character; they are almost entirely agricultural.</P>

Deputy Good surely knows that Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire will have to meet their own unemployment, which is considerable.  They will have to meet unemployment in the Rathdown Union.  They are not going to get off scot-free.  But when it is proposed to create a coastal borough.  I think it is sufficient reason for saying that they should not be tied up to a workhouse in another county borough.  As I say, the parts that are left out of the Dublin union are rural villages, mainly occupied by agriculturists, and agriculturists all over County Dublin are very hardly hit by rates at present.  If their rates are increased in the way that Deputy Good suggests, they will not be able to carry on.  As I have said, I think Deputy Good's proposal is both inequitable and uneconomical, and I hope the Dáil will not accept it.</P>

      <P>Under the 1923 Act the county was made the area of charge for poor relief.  That did not happen in the county and city of Dublin.  The House is expecting to have placed before it very shortly legislation dealing with the definition of the boundaries of Dublin City, and the result of that legislation will be to bring in the area of County Dublin which will be left into harmony with the rest of the country as far as the area of charge for poor law purposes goes.  It will mean where, as will be the case, Dublin City, with some small additions to it&mdash;Rathmines and Pembroke&mdash; has been made the county borough of Dublin, the remainder of the county will become one area of charge for poor law purposes, and, in the absence of a joint and agreed scheme between the county and Dublin City, the county and the new city will be individually responsible for their own poor relief.  As far as the Executive Council is concerned, decisions have been taken with regard <Col N="1334" /> to the division.  As I said, there may be minor alterations, but the big fact does remain that it is intended that the county of Dublin will very shortly be one area of charge for poor relief.</P>
      <P>It is in the light of that we come to discuss the present Bill, which gives permission for the giving of outdoor relief to the able-bodied.  As Deputies know, a Bill came from the Seanad which proposed that the present guardians in Rathdown, the present guardians in Balrothery, and the present Commissioners of the Dublin Union should give outdoor relief to the able-bodied inside their own area, with the area of the guardians' district as the area of charge.  It is perfectly reasonable, I submit, that the guardians in Balrothery, who have up to the present been distributing relief under former Acts inside their area, with their area as the area of charge, should now be given authority to give this particular class of relief with the same area as the area of charge.  I submit the same with regard to Rathdown.</P>
      <P>Under the Seanad Bill, the city of Dublin, Pembroke, Rathmines, North Dublin Rural District, South Dublin Rural District, and Celbridge Rural District would be the area of charge for this particular class of relief. Residents in the rural area of Dublin Union, and their representatives on the County Council, made representations that it would be unfair that the burden of this particular class of relief, which would largely come from the urban area, would fall in part on the rural areas&mdash;that is, the rural area of North Dublin, South Dublin and Celbridge.  They made the case that the present relief leans heavily upon them, simply because they were connected with the city, and they urged, and made very strong representations, that this additional relief, which they felt might be considerable, should not rest upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances that arose I called together the representatives of the bodies who could form a joint scheme.  If a joint scheme between the city and county of Dublin were <Col N="1335" /> prepared under the 1923 Act, it would not be necessary to pass legislation to give this particular class of relief.  I called together the bodies who would be responsible for forming a joint scheme.  They were the guardians of Rathdown, the guardians of Balrothery, the Dublin Union Commissioners, the County Council, and the Dublin City Commissioners. Deputy Good asked whether representatives of the urban districts of Rathmines and Pembroke were invited. No, they had nothing to do with the formation of the scheme.  As part of the county of Dublin, those areas had their representatives on the County Council, and the County Council was the proper body to express an opinion on the formation of a county scheme.  The county scheme was not agreed to, and therefore legislation was necessary.</P>
    <P>In facing the fact that legislation would be necessary if they did not agree to a county scheme, they made certain proposals with regard to the amendments that, in fairness to some of the rural districts in the county, they thought should be made in the Bill which came from the Seanad. These recommendations were: that the city, Rathmines, Pembroke and Howth should be separated from the rural part of the Dublin Union and made a separate area of charge.  The present Bill proposes to meet that recommendation to this extent: that we make Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke a separate area of charge for this particular class of relief, but we do not join in Howth.  We leave Howth in the area in which it is&mdash; the North Dublin rural district&mdash;the North Dublin rural district being left with the South Dublin rural district and Celbridge in one rural area.  So that we take Balrothery as one area; Dublin City, Rathmines and Pembroke as another area; and the rural part of the present Dublin Union as the third area which comes in here.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation was that we should divide the Rathdown area for the purposes of the area of charge in this matter into an urban area, consisting of the townships, <Col N="1336" /> and a rural area, being the non-township portion of the Rathdown Union. I could not agree to that because, as I say, the proposal foreshadowed, in so far as the Executive Council has taken decisions, is that the townships shall remain in the county. Therefore, the townships will remain with the county as the unit area of charge for relief in future.  I could not agree that, whereas the townships are with the rural portion of Rathdown at present for the purpose of ordinary relief, they should be divided for this particular class of relief.</P>
    <P>I make the point that in future, Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke must bear their own burden of all classes of relief.  In this temporary measure, covering the period between this and the time that the new city boundaries will be set up, the area is as I say.  I think it is only absolutely fair to the rural areas.  I have been persuaded, and I think anyone who goes into the matter will be persuaded, that the rural area around Dublin does suffer from being associated with Dublin in connection with relief.  The area of Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke has a population approximately of 400,000. In smaller areas, such as Cork and Limerick, we have desired that there should be joint schemes, as the facilities that arise in connection with the joint use of institutions would level the burden as between the city and county areas.  The city of Cork is joined in with the South Cork Board of Assistance as a unit area for poor law purposes.  I suggest that Cork is a city that in size presents a different problem from Dublin, and that Dublin in this matter should stand on its own legs, particularly in the light of the decisions that, as I say, have been already taken with regard to the proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us some information on the point in Section 2 about anybody who has two years' residence in the county Dublin being a charge on the city of Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that relief under this whole measure <Col N="1337" /> is permissive.  As far as the present Dublin Union area is concerned, there is one body administering relief there.  Under this Bill, for the purposes of this particular class of relief, that area will be divided into two&mdash;let us call them the rural area and the urban area.  A person who has been resident in the rural area for two years can get this particular class of relief, subject to the discretion of the Commissioners, and it will be charged against the rural area.  A person who has been two years in the city can get this particular class of relief, and it will be charged against the city.  If a person has spent some of his time in the rural area and some of it in the city, power is given under the Bill to the Commissioners to apportion the cost of the relief between the rural area and the city urban area, so that, in so far as a fair division of cost can be made, that fair division will be made.  The Bill, however, gives power to the Rathdown Guardians or the Balrothery Guardians, or the Dublin Union Commissioners to relieve a person who has been two years in the city and the county, so that the Commissioners may be called upon to relieve a person who has spent nine months in Balrothery Union, three months in the rural portion of Dublin Union, and somewhat more than twelve months in the city. There is no power in the Bill to apportion the costs between the Dublin Union, the Balrothery Union, and the Rathdown Union.  That would bring in the difficulty of removal and settlement that we discussed yesterday.  But in a glaring case&mdash;if someone, say, in Balrothery Union, having been resident there for more than two years, applies to the City Commissioners for relief, it is within the Dublin Union Commissioners' discretion to deny that relief and to tell that particular person to apply to the Balrothery Union.</P>

      <P>Under the permissive nature of the Bill.  The <Col N="1338" /> giving of relief is entirely within the discrimination of the authorities dealing with it.  The Deputy might as well say that if a person who had been living three years in the city went out to Balrothery, and on the first day of going out there applied for relief under this section from the Balrothery Union, that they would give that relief, as to say that the Dublin Union Commissioners would do the same thing if someone in the Balrothery Union and living there three years came into the city and on the first day asked for relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the tailoring effect would not be very good, to say the least of it.  Therefore I will not waste the time of the Committee in going into our reasons for objecting to Deputy Good's amendment.  It was made clear on the Second Reading of the Bill, both by myself and other Deputies speaking from these benches, that we wish that the area of charge should be the urbanised parts of the county.  We do not think it right or proper that the heavy charge that will be put upon the rates as a result of this relief should be put upon the purely rural areas in the county.  That is our position still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point.  I have been informed that it is not the intention under the regulations that <Col N="1339" /> have already been drafted that adults&mdash;a man and a woman, with one child&mdash;shall get outdoor relief. I wonder could the Minister tell us whether that is so or not.  If it is so, it appears to me it would be a hardship upon a small family like that. There are many young families, people not long married, with one child and possibly one child not far off, to whom it would be a great hardship to have to break up their home and go into the institution for relief.  If we are going to give outdoor relief to adults, we might as well do it decently and make a decent job of it, and do our duty and not be putting that duty upon the shoulders of benevolent organisations as is done at present.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, since the problem has grown so grave, there has been, along with the money paid out by the ratepayers for relief of this kind, a very heavy drain on benevolent people that the citizens ought to have met.  Now that an additional heavy charge is being put upon the ratepayers, I think it would be better that the whole problem should be faced up to and that small families like that should be allowed, if possible, to remain, in what they call their home&mdash;those one-roomed dwellings or cellars that so many of them live in&mdash;and not be asked to break up the little household, such as it is, and go into the Union buildings.  If they have to, they lose the opportunity of getting work; it breaks down their morale, and it has bad effects that anybody acquainted with social work is well aware of.  If there is any truth in the statement made to me, that it is not the intention of the Commissioners, at any rate in the Dublin Union, to give relief to families of the kind I indicated, I think the Minister would be well advised to induce the Commissioners to alter that regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy O'Kelly's statement with regard to a regulation such as he mentioned.  There are to my knowledge, no such regulations, and <Col N="1340" /> I cannot imagine any such rigid regulations being set up.  The whole spirit of the giving of this particular relief is to prevent homes being broken up in such circumstances. That is the spirit of the whole extension of this particular class of relief throughout the country.  Every case, as Deputies will understand, must be examined upon its merits and treated upon its merits, and I certainly am confident that the Act will be administered in the most sympathetic way.  I would like to take an opportunity on this particular section to say a word on the question of the cost.  I said yesterday that for the year 1929 the cost of this particular class of relief in Limerick was 36 per cent. of the total cost of relief in the area. Taking the total cost of this particular class of relief and the total cost of all classes of relief in Limerick, the percentage of relief given as relief to the able-bodied was 34.5 per cent.  I said yesterday that local bodies did not keep these figures separate, and that I had difficulty in getting them.  I have to-day got the Cork figures.  As Cork city is in with South Cork Board of Assistance area, it is therefore joined in with a pretty extensive rural area.  During the last four years the percentage of the total expenditure on outdoor relief, which was outdoor relief in respect to the able-bodied, was only 17.5 per cent.  I mention these figures again in support of my contention that I do not believe that the total expenditure on this particular class of relief in Dublin is going to be £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of protesting against the tone of the remarks begun here and echoed elsewhere that I have been repudiating Commissioner Dr. Dwyer on the matter of his estimate.  I asked Deputy Davin yesterday if he would estimate a particular thing&mdash;that is, the extent to which there might be increased expenditure under this particular Bill if there was no residence clause.  Dr. Dwyer, speaking on this particular matter, does not speak for himself.  He speaks <Col N="1341" /> for the Commissioners, and the Commissioners did attempt to estimate that particular kind of intangible expenditure that Deputy Davin and other Deputies yesterday would not face.  When I say that by a comparison of expenditure in other districts, by taking in an absolute way the expenditure on other relief in the city, I do not believe the expenditure is going to be anything like £200,000 on this, I differ with the Dublin Union Commissioners on their estimate.  But, as I say, it is very objectionable and very undesirable that the tone of the remarks made here, and made more objectionably outside, that a difference of opinion in the matter of an estimate should be spoken of as a repudiation of a very competent and a very useful group of officials&mdash;of people who are really more than officials, who are administrators of a semi-public as well as of a semiofficial character.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. S.T. O'Kelly Mr. S.T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the statement which has just now been made by the Minister, I think it is a rather belated defence by him of an official of his Department, nominated by him to run the Dublin Union, the proper representatives having been thrown out.  An estimate was given by the Commissioner. The figure of £250,000 was quoted as an estimate of the cost.  Therefore, the Commissioner did take the risk of making an estimate.  He may have been wide of the mark.  The Minister says that he is.  The Minister told us yesterday, if I am not mistaken, that £93,000 would be nearer the figure.  It was definitely put up to the Minister by at least one speaker on this side whether he repudiated the estimate made by the Commissioner and he remained silent.  That was the time for him to stand up and say whether he defended his officials or not, and not after thinking over it for the period that he has had, and getting a reminder of his duty in the matter.  If the Minister thinks that he has a duty he ought to have done it when the point was put to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I just want to say, in reply to Deputy O'Kelly, that my attitude with regard to the estimate and my attitude as to the possibility of making an estimate that would be of use here was clearly expressed here yesterday.  I do not take challenges given in the particular kind of way in which they were given yesterday from the opposite benches with all the seriousness that they are expected to be taken.  But, when I see reflected in the Press, as I did this morning in a particular way, the difference of opinion that, as far as I am concerned, was perfectly clearly expressed on my part yesterday, and when I see statements made here emphasised in a very objectionable way as a repudiation rather than as a plain and straight difference of opinion, and on a matter on which there was absolute room for a difference of opinion, I object to that.</P>

I would be very sorry that anything should be said here that would prevent the ratepayers from having every information in the future.  It is only right to say on behalf of Dr. Dwyer that at the moment he is administering the poor law affairs of the Dublin Union area, and to state, also, that Dr. Dwyer has been in close touch with the Dublin Union for some ten years past.  He was an official of the Dublin Union for a great many years before he became a Commissioner. I say that in order to show that this is a subject on which he can speak with authority.</P>

On the question of public officials speaking their minds, I have no use for officials who in important matters on which they are required to express their opinions, express opinions which they do not hold. Officials are no use except they express what they think according to their experience.  It is rather the type of thing that I object to that is going to prevent officials expressing their minds, than the fact that what they say is not accepted by people who feel that they have reason for not accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The application which was considered by the Tariff Commission was for a duty of twenty per cent. upon quilts containing down or an admixture of down and was subsequently extended to include quilts containing mixed down and feathers or feathers only.  We note from the report that the application was referred to the Commission on February 26th, 1927; the detailed case was lodged on 17th October, 1927, the fee was paid on November 30th, 1927; the public announcement of the application was made on the 16th December, 1927; and the statement of the opponents to the application was lodged on December 16th, 1928.  In other words, all the preliminary steps in relation to this unimportant application were completed by the first month of last year, but the Tariff Commission were not in a position to submit their report and recommendations until last week. If there had been anything of a complicated nature in the application it might be possible to understand the delay, but the fact that the only complex thing in relation to the application is the actual report of the Commission seems to us to show that the delay was altogether unreasonable. We have, however, got the recommendations and we find that instead of dealing with the application which was submitted to them they recommend a duty of twenty per cent., subject to imperial preference rates, upon down quilts covered with silk or artificial silk, and they recommend further that <Col N="1349" /> that duty should only apply for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>When I was reading this report I tried very hard to get at the mentality of the Tariff Commission behind it but I did not succeed.  If we ask ourselves the question why this tariff should be granted at all, we will surely answer that the purpose of it should be to increase the production of down quilts in the Twenty-Six Counties and, consequently, to increase the amount of employment given in their manufacture. I cannot see what other reason should be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not the tariff should be imposed, but if that is the consideration which is to be taken into account it is quite obvious that the tariff should apply to all quilts manufactured from down or any admixture of down and feathers, irrespective of the class of material used to cover them.  It is possible that the Tariff Commission, and the Executive Council who acted on their recommendation, had some consideration in mind other than the increased production of those articles and the increased employment given in their manufacture. There is particular stress laid in the report upon the fact that a duty on articles manufactured from silk or artificial silk exists in Britain and that that interfered with the export trade of the Cork factory in those articles.</P>
      <P>The impression is conveyed, although there is no definite statement to support it, that this tariff is imposed as some form of retaliation for the difficulties placed in the way of this factory in exporting their goods to Britain.  The Commission state that the difficulties of the factory were due to the British duty, but they do not seem to indicate how these difficulties are going to be removed by the adoption of their recommendation.  The British duties, presumably, will still remain in operation and the giving of a monopoly to the factory for silk-covered quilts in the Free State area will not recompense them, I think, for the loss of their export trade nor provide a market in the Free</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> State sufficiently large to keep the factory going if the tariff is to be confined exclusively to the manufacture of quilts of that class.  The Commission made reference to the fact that the decline in the productivity of the Cork factory was largely due to the action of the firm in transferring part of their business to a new factory which they established in England, but they admit that their decision to do that may have been prudent from a business point of view.  Surely the object of the Tariff Commission should have been to make it equally prudent for the firm, from a business point of view, to transfer back to their Cork factory part, at any rate, of the business which was sent to England.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the report that contracts for the supply of silk-covered quilts to Dublin firms were executed at the English factory.  If the Tariff Commission were logical in their argument, it would seem to me that that fact alone is an argument against imposing a duty on silk-covered quilts in so far as they refuse to impose a duty on quilts covered with other materials because of the action of the firm in transferring the manufacture of these quilts to England.  If the argument applies in one case it applies in the other.  The report also states that at present the Cork factory is engaged almost exclusively in manufacturing quilts from materials other than silk.  That fact also makes it much more difficult to understand the motives that inspired the Commission to make the recommendation contained in this report.  As I have said, it is impossible to follow their reasons.  The action of the firm in making silk quilts in Britain for the Irish market could be quoted against the recommendation to impose a tariff on silk quilts.  If their action in making quilts of other materials in the British factory for the Irish market can be quoted against the imposition of a tariff on quilts of other materials it seems to me that the whole application should have been granted or rejected.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Commission <Col N="1351" /> were torn between their acknowledgment of the obvious strength of the application for the tariff and their own free trade instincts and prejudices.  This is a compromise which settles no difficulty and which, I suggest, leaves the position more confused than it was before they took up the consideration of the application.  The firm of Charles Nolan and Sons, which opposed the application, feared that the imposition of the tariff might damage their trade for down in England and they claimed that they, in fact, give more employment in their factory than the applicant firm give.  If there is any possibility&mdash;personally, I do not think that there is very great possibility&mdash;that the imposition of this duty would damage the trade of this firm, Charles Nolan and Sons, it is a most unsatisfactory position to have their trade damaged because of the imposition of a duty which is going to be of very little value to the applicant firm.  If they succeeded in securing the full duty for which they asked it would undoubtedly have benefited their position very considerably, but the partial duty awarded to them cannot, in my opinion, be of great benefit to them and cannot result in any considerable amount of increased employment in their factory, whereas it may have all the effect of damaging the trade of Messrs. Nolan which the full duty would have had.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commission, in this matter as in a number of other matters, have merely succeeded in making things more difficult than they were.  I do not know whether it is due to lack of courage or lack of ability to arrive at decisions or what it is, but they never seem to be able to arrive at any clear-cut solution of any problems that are presented to them.  They certainly have not done so in this case.  Although it is not our intention to oppose the resolution, because it is a step in the right direction, we would like to express our strong dissatisfaction with the half measures which the Tariff Commission recommend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what Deputy Lemass has said but probably I look at it from quite a different standpoint.  The imposition of these tariffs should, in the first place, be very carefully considered. They are a cause of expense to the State and a cause of irritation to those engaged in business.  Before we put expense on the State and cause any more irritation or delay in business, we should be satisfied that the State is going to receive some benefits on the other side from the imposition of tariffs.  Having read this report, I certainly came to the conclusion that there was very grave doubt in the minds of those who drew up the report as to whether they should recommend a tariff in this case at all.  I do not want to go into any details, but the total number of employees in this particular factory is given on page 8 of the report as 58.  Thirty of the 58, 30 females, were engaged in the manufacture of down quilts, 6 females in the preparation of feathers and 4 males were engaged in general work.  The remaining 18 workers were employed exclusively in the production of other articles. The total number of persons affected in this particular industry would be 36 females.</P>
      <P>In view of the other facts in the report, dealing more or less with what one might call inefficiency in the ordinary way, I was not at all satisfied that the factory was an efficient one and that this was a case in which it was desirable to give assistance through protection.  I would have liked to have a much better case when we propose to add this to our list of tariffs.  I would also like where a tariff is recommended, that it should deal with a larger number of employees than are affected in this particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side, while the Commission dealt very fully with the case made by the applicants for the tariff, they give us no information at all as to the details of the evidence of those who opposed the tariff.  The report struck me from that particular point of view as being rather <Col N="1353" /> extraordinary.  They say that Messrs. Nolan and Sons opposed the imposition of a tariff on down quilts mainly on the ground that it would have an adverse effect on their trade.  Then they proceed to make the extraordinary statement to which I take exception: &ldquo;We do not think it advisable to set out in detail their contention which, in our opinion, is not likely to be borne out to the extent anticipated by Messrs. Nolan.  We have, however, given full consideration to the objections which they have offered to the proposed tariff, and have had due regard to the fact that they employ a greater number of persons in the preparation and export of down and feathers than the Cork factory of Messrs. Booth and Fox employs in the preparation of down and manufacture of quilts.&rdquo;  We should have been given both sides of the case, and I hope that in any future report we may have from the Commission we will have both sides of the case fairly set out, so that the House can judge as to whether the imposition of a tariff is a fair and equitable proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>For once I have certainly great sympathy with Deputy Good in his opposition to a tariff. We have heard about Nero fiddling while Rome was burning, but I think if somebody could put into a short phrase the attitude of the Tariff Commission in bringing in, after many years, a tariff on rosary beads, on margarine, and then on down quilts, affecting the work, at most, of a few dozen people, while half a million of our people are going off to the United States, and practically another one hundred thousand are idle, that would surpass Nero. Deputy Good said he had grave doubts as to whether the Tariff Commission should report in favour of the tariff.  I think lots of other people who are in favour of tariffs, as well as people who are against them, will have grave doubts and grave suspicion of the policy of the Government in regard to tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it bears out the statement made on many occasions that the <Col N="1354" /> policy of the Government has been to damn tariffs by bringing forward the most ineffective tariffs they could after long delays.  For the last two or three years they have brought in a tariff on rosary beads, affecting only a few dozen people. Certainly this tariff on down quilts, not on all down quilts, but on silk down quilts, that we are told will raise the number of employed by ten persons, caps the lot.  Deputy Good has certainly every right, from his point of view, to question the whole thing.  I think if the Minister set out deliberately to give Deputy Good, and those who stand with him, an argument against tariffs he has done the correct thing in bringing forward such a tariff as this.  We cannot, of course, oppose the motion, because the tariff does give employment to ten people, but if we could only have a motion to abolish the Ministry and the Tariff Commission, owing to their delay in bringing forward tariffs that are necessary, we would vote against them, and sweep them out if we could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Lemass I regret that the Tariff Commission have not seen fit to extend this tariff to materials other than silk and artificial silk.  In paragraph 22 of the Tariff Commission Report it is stated that the applicants supplied confidential figures showing the number and value of the quilts produced in Cork in the years 1920, 1923, 1925 and 1927. These figures indicated a decline in the last year as compared with the other three years of 64 per cent., etc.  I understand that at the Tariff Commission, in answer to one of the questions put them, the applicants, Messrs.  Booth and Fox, Ltd., had to go over the four years that I have already indicated and give the total number of quilts made in Cork during these years.  They had then to divide them into twelve groups, according to prices, and the cloth from which they were made. Messrs. Booth and Fox ascertained that for the year 1927 the percentage of cotton-covered quilts made and supplied to their customers was <Col N="1355" /> 65.7.  The feeling is that this tax of 20 per cent. on imported quilts, which is recommended by the Tariff Commission and which we all accept as a contribution along certain lines of economic policy, will affect only 34.3 of the total imports of quilts.  I suggest that the Minister should go a little further and see if we cannot capture that 34.3 in addition to what we would be able to capture under the tariff of 20 per cent.  If this tariff on quilts is to serve the purpose for which it is intended, it should be made apply to cotton-covered quilts as well as to quilts covered with silk or artificial silk. The report of the Tariff Commission is quite clear on the matter, especially in the last sentence in paragraph 22, where it is stated that the figures indicated a decline in 1927 over the figures for previous years that were available.  We should not take a matter of this kind in a halfhearted way; half measures are not of much use.  We welcome the tariff of 20 per cent., but we suggest that the Minister should go further and apply the tariff to cotton-covered quilts as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have received a letter from Messrs.  Booth and Fox, which Deputy Anthony has made into a speech.  I think that the case which is made out, that we should have protected the whole of these goods as distinct from making our legislation on the subject of imported silk, is a good case and it is well made out.  I am glad personally for small mercies.  I am getting grey-haired and I have lost a good many of the illusions of my youth. I do not expect much, and I certainly do not expect much from the Tariff Commission.  But, after all, we are glad for the crumbs from the rich man's table.  Lazarus was glad to get them.  Even if it is only the labour of thirty-six women that is protected and that Deputy Good regarded as so inadequate, well, at any rate, it is protected.  I suggest that Deputy Good should carry his commiseration of the littleness of this effort into practical effect.  He <Col N="1356" /> should not be merely complaining that this has only to do with thirty-six women; he ought to try to do something to make it concern considerably more than thirty-six women, and possibly some men.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Good did mean that speech of his to be the adumbration of an approach to the possibility of the conception of his conversion towards being a protectionist.  Perhaps it is a case of straws in the wind or shadows coming before.  I have very little hope of a good many things and a good many people, and for that reason I tend to exaggerate any claim of a possibility of hope in relation to Deputy Good.  The mountain was in labour and produced a mouse.  The Tariff Commission has been in a state of gestation for years, and it has produced a rosary beads and a silk coverlet.  Naturally when it was not doing much it wanted to do really nice things, so it produced a silk coverlet.  It left coachbuilding and paper and tanning to the Greek Kalends.  Flour is thrown on the dust-heap.  But the Tariff Commission has given us protection to the extent of 20 per cent. in the manufacture of an article in connection with which thirty-six women are engaged.  After all, it has not lived in vain.  There is something to be put upon its tombstone, and the sooner that tombstone is put up in order to have it put on, the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have indicated that it is useless or very nearly useless to impose a tariff merely on silk-covered quilts, but the applicants indicated that the need for a tariff arose out of the silk duty which was imposed in Great Britain. In the course of their original statement to the Tariff Commission they said: &ldquo;It is submitted that our application does not arise in consequence of any inefficiency on our part.  If our export trade was not stopped to us, and had we not been compelled to open up a new factory in England and limit the volume of our Irish production, we should not trouble the Commission with this application.  With a free British <Col N="1357" /> market we did and could compete with all or any of our competitors.&rdquo; It seems to me on reading the Report that what happened was that this Company was suddenly deprived of an outside market by a tariff imposed by another country.  The deprivation of this outside market increased the cost of production; the overheads were relatively higher. It was a firm which was long established and which was well able to do the whole manufacturing processes that were involved.  It was a firm that was able to sell all classes of these quilts abroad.  It seems to me that all that was necessary was to give it some substitute for the export market, to give it some lift in order to help it over the difficulties which it got into as a result of this English tariff.</P>

Now we are asked to put on a tariff to protect a factory in Cork out of which the machinery has been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Report.  It is believed that the imposition of this tariff will give the Saorstát market in silk-covered quilts to this firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This tariff will give extra work, which will enable the firm again to operate on a competitive basis.  So far as the cotton-covered and other quilts are concerned, it has suffered nothing in regard to the market for those articles.  It can sell the cotton-covered quilts in England just as it could sell them in former years.  It seems to be a firm which was always able to compete until the silk tariff came along.  It seems to be doing <Col N="1358" /> something that is uncalled for, although, of course, a firm which is applying for a tariff would like always to get all the tariff it could. Messrs. Booth and Fox will no doubt write to Deputies and urge them to use all the influence they can to have the tariff extended to every class of quilt.  Nevertheless, looking at the matter as it is presented in this Report, it seems that there are no obvious grounds given for giving protection so far as cotton-covered quilts are concerned.  But their market in silk-covered quilts in England has been cut off.  That cutting-off has upset the balance of the firm's economy.  It is proposed by this tariff to restore the position by giving them the Saorstát market in silk-covered quilts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery for manufacturing them has gone to the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the machinery for manufacturing them can be brought back.  The manufacture of silk-covered quilts apparently has been dropped, because they had only in competition a fraction of the Saorstát markets and that fraction was not sufficient to justify the continuance of manufacturing silk-covered quilts here.  If the Saorstát market, which is quite substantial, is restored to them, then presumably any machinery that may be necessary will be either brought back or new machinery will be got.  If the firm is not willing either to bring back the machinery that has been taken over, or to procure any new equipment that is necessary for the manufacturing of the article that is protected, it does not, I think, deserve the reputation for efficiency which it apparently has and which the Tariff Commission believes it justly has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this one other point in connection with cotton-covered quilts. If there is any possibility and any danger that the tariff will bring about increased charges to the public in this particular commodity, it is as well that we should not have those increased charges imposed on the people who can least afford to pay. <Col N="1359" /> It seems to me if there is any increase in charges here as a result of this tariff, it will be a charge on those who will be least hit by it.  So far as the other quilts are concerned they will be sold as cheaply as before. If Booth and Fox were able to make them against all competition before they should be able to make them to sell against all competition in future.  This tariff will mean that they will sell silk-covered quilts all over the Saorstát.  I do not pretend to know the exact condition of the market but it seems to me probable that the fact that they will be supplying silk-covered quilts all over the Saorstát will be some advantage to them in marketing even their cotton-covered quilts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely appreciates that this firm has a factory in England and presumably some representatives from that factory will be calling on the drapery buyers and selling cotton-covered quilts not made in England as well as silk-covered quilts made in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate the danger was that the factory would shut down.  If the factory is maintained for the manufacture of silk quilts here, if they can, as the Tariff Commission is convinced, manufacture those other articles, all things considered, as cheaply and as economically in Cork as they can manufacture them in Great Britain, this firm will have every incentive to pass at least as many orders to Cork as will keep the factory running on the most economical lines.</P>

I put that to the Minister in view of the fact that it has happened that persons who are drawing very decent superannuation allowances have used their position in other countries to traduce the country that is feeding them.</P>

      <P>I move that the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, 1929, be read a second time.  I think all the laws which are being continued this year appeared in last year's Act.  I had hoped that it would not be necessary to insert the Betting Act, but while I hope to be able to introduce a Bill when the Dáil reassembles, there is no likelihood of its being passed before the end of the year, so that it has been decided to insert the Betting Act with the other measures.</P>

      <P>One of the Acts which is expiring is the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919.  Some time ago we raised this question.  The position of the law at present is very unsatisfactory.  There are aliens in this country actually getting all the benefits of citizens, even the advantage of being on the register of voters.  There seems to have been no principle of distinction between citizens and aliens, and I would be glad to know when we may expect a Bill dealing with the matter.  I think it is only fair that the House should know the position when it is being asked to continue this Act, in order that we would have some indication as to when it is proposed to deal with these anomalies.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, I think we should have some statement from the Minister indicating what precautions are exercised to prevent abuse under that Act.  It is a very common complaint amongst merchants and other ratepayers that this Act is used by Local Government officials to get goods for their own private purposes at contract prices.  If there be foundation for that complaint&mdash;and I know there has been some foundation for it&mdash;it is a very serious injustice.  We all know that the Act is entirely unfair, that it deprives local traders who are big ratepayers of a certain amount of business.  If that is done in the interests of economy, of course, the ratepayers benefit to some extent, as they have, at least, something in return, but I certainly think it is a blatant injustice if local officials are able to make use of that Act to buy goods, that represent a fairly big outlay, from the Contracts Department, instead of buying them from the local shopkeepers who are paying their salaries.  That complaint is very general throughout the country and, as I say, I happen to know there have been some rather bad instances of it.  Apart from that altogether, there are complaints, and the Minister must know that the Act is not generally popular.  It will certainly not be more popular if that sort of thing continues.  I would like some assurance from the Minister as to whether every possible precaution is taken in that respect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Harbours Bill, as Deputy Murphy has raised the question as to when the Road Traffic Bill will come along, I think we might be told when the report of the Harbours Tribunal may be expected. It has been talked about for at least a year, but we have not yet had any information as to when it will be presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two questions that I would like to get information upon from the Minister. One of these concerns the Motor Car Act of 1903.  I think that Act, as it stands, is very largely out of date. It will be generally agreed that many of its provisions did not foresee the great changes in traffic problems that would arise, and that have arisen within the last twenty years.  In the memorandum that has been issued in connection with this Bill it is stated &ldquo;A Departmental Committee on traffic control has furnished its report and the introduction of proposals for permanent legislation is under consideration.&rdquo; They are under consideration for a long time.  Some of us would be glad to know when the process of consideration will come to an end, and when legislation may be introduced.  Another item on the memorandum deals with the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This Act enables certain Statutory Undertakings (tramways, light railways, etc.) to apply for leave to increase their charges above the amount authorised by Statute, where the undertaking has been adversely affected by war conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such legislation was probably necessary at that time, but things have changed considerably since then, and this kind of legislation ought not to go on for ever.  There ought to be some finality, and some definite time when the Department would make up its mind to bring in permanent legislation to deal with a matter of this kind.  Part II. of the memorandum deals with the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  There is an appendix to the memorandum explaining the reason for extending that Act, and in that connection I would like to know when the long and frequently promised legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission will be introduced.  This question of having laws, some of them important <Col N="1364" /> and some of them relatively unimportant, carried on from year to year, as has been the case, is not good business.  The Departments concerned may be working on these Bills, but some of them have been working on them for a rather extended period.  We would be glad if the Minister would tell us when the long-promised Bills dealing with the control of motor traffic, and the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission, will be introduced. The law relating to poor law is in a very unsatisfactory condition at present.  Some of it is out-of-date and more of it has been changed in recent years in a temporary way, and promises have been made that a Bill would be introduced to put the law in order, to co-ordinate it, and to give some idea of permanence to the poor law position.  At present things are frequently mixed up. Those of us who have been giving attention to the poor law question would be glad to know in particular when the recommendations of that Commission will be given legislative effect to.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise what has already been said by others as to the necessity for legislation with regard to the control of road traffic.  I need not go over what I said on previous occasions, but complaints are reaching me from day to day as to the necessity for a change in the law with regard to this matter.  I know that there are two Ministers involved in this, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice, and that whenever there is divided control in a matter of this kind it is always hard to get two to agree; but there is no greater need for anything at the present time than there is for a new Traffic Bill.</P>

      <P>In connection with motor traffic regulations, I would ask the Minister if the Executive Council have considered, since the Recess, the question of compulsory third-party insurance and the bringing of it into the motor traffic regulations? We were promised that it <Col N="1365" /> would be considered, and I would like to hear if there is anything new about the matter.  I would also like to refer to the matter of nationalisation, raised by Deputy Little.  I know that under existing conditions we have no power to deal with this matter, but the Minister for Justice made some reference to it, and intimated that it might be possible to bring about some understanding by which this country could naturalise aliens living in the country.  Is it in our power to pass legislation which would give us that right? Another matter to which I want to refer also deals with motors.  It was raised by the late Deputy Holt, and a promise was given that motor vehicles over a certain age would be dealt with for the purpose of road motor tax at a reduced rate.  Can the Minister tell us anything about that?  Has it ever been contemplated, or is it to be contemplated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the matter of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act.  The manner in which that Act has been administered would not, I think, justify the House in continuing it. As a member of a local body, I have noticed that every second month there have been complaints that the material supplied is not up to the standard, and in nine cases out of every ten we have the Trade Department telling us that we must accept the article, although it is not up to the required standard.  I think that the time has arrived when something definite should be done with regard to this.  We should either get rid of the Combined Purchasing Act altogether or else the contractors who are put on the list should be made to supply goods up to the standard required.  It is nonsensical to invite tenders for a certain article and then, when a definite tender has been accepted, to have to take from that contractor material which is not up to the required standard.  That is what has been happening in nine out of every ten cases within the last few years, and it is not fair to the other people who have tendered.  I would like to hear <Col N="1366" /> some definite pronouncement on that.  If the Minister wants cases, I can bring him a dozen or twenty, and his own Department can supply him with at least a hundred from Cork alone.  It is not fair to the others who tendered, and it is not fair to the local manufacturers who put in at higher prices, but who found themselves cut out in order to make room for shoddy, because that is what it amounts to.  I would like to hear something from the Minister on that, and, if necessary, we will try to deal with it on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I do not know if the Minister for Finance is the proper authority to give us some justification for the Act to which Deputy Corry has referred, but I do know that some Minister ought to give us some justification for it. There is a large volume of opinion opposed to the administration of that Act.  Not alone is the principle wrong, but the administration of it is wrong.  Everyone who has any experience of public bodies will know that the article supplied is, in a great many cases, not up to the quality of the sample submitted.  In the matter of administration alone the Act needs a good deal of overhauling. I do not know whether the Minister for Finance can give us any idea of the cost, but I do know that different bodies find themselves in the position of having to accept inferior stuff.  Apart from the principle that the local trader is cut out altogether because he cannot supply all the Saorstát, the whole machinery of the Act requires overhauling and justification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these matters must be dealt with by other Ministers on the Committee Stage, and I think it is on the Committee Stage that they can be most effectively dealt with.  Deputy Little and Deputy Briscoe raised the question of citizenship.  I could not state exactly how the matter stands.  The late Minister for Justice had given the matter a great deal of consideration. He had discussed it with <Col N="1367" /> other Ministers, and was about to have his Department formulate proposals for a Citizenship Bill.  The matter was then entirely dropped for some time; it simply slipped out of mind and out of sight.  It has lately been the subject of consideration in the Department of Justice, and they have been dealing with the Department of External Affairs about it, but I could not say how far it has gone.  It has been recognised, certainly for two or three years, that it would be necessary to prepare a Citizenship Bill to provide means for admitting people to citizenship, and to regulate various subsidiary matters connected with that.  Possibly, on another stage I will be able to give some more information, or the Deputy might get it by putting down a question</P>
      <P>With reference to motor traffic, various aspects of which have been touched upon by Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy Briscoe, the Executive Council agreed some two or three months ago to the heads of a Bill which was submitted by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The preparation of the Bill has since gone along the lines approved by the Executive Council, and I understand that it is very nearly ready.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not be sure of that.  What the Executive Council decided were seven or eight general principles, and perhaps when the Bill has advanced further in preparation there may be some points that will require further discussion. I could not say just how soon it will be introduced, but I know that if it is not introduced before Christmas it should be very soon in the new year.  I am not able to tell the Deputy anything definite about the time that the Harbours Tribunal will report.  I know it has been preparing its report for some time, that the investigations have been brought to <Col N="1368" /> an end, and that it is simply a matter of preparing a report. I presume that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will deal with the points that have been raised in regard to the administration of the Combined Purchasing Act on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I always understood that one of the advantages it was hoped to obtain from the combined purchasing system was not merely that goods would be supplied at cheaper rates in a great many cases, but that they would be supplied of better quality and that there would be better means of securing that contractors would supply the quality they tendered to supply.  If that is not so, as Deputies suggest, then, of course, there certainly is ground for a close examination of the whole matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> In page 9, before Section 18, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commissioners or a local authority may, with the consent of the owner of a national monument which is of historical interest and, in the case of a local authority, is situate within their functional area, place or cause to be placed on such national monument a tablet, plate, inscription, or other notice stating the facts in relation to such national monument which give rise to the historical interest thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is being inserted as a result of representations made on the Second Reading and Committee Stage that throughout the country there are several monuments of historical interest which are in tablet, and it would not be very easy for the Commissioners or local authorities to acquire ownership.

      <P>I would like to know why the Parliamentary Secretary has chosen 300 years.  Is there any particular reason for it?  I am thinking in particular of old books. For instance, I have a certain number of books which were printed very early in the history of printing. They were printed in the year 1480 or thereabouts.  I could not possibly prove when these were brought into Ireland.  I imagine they were brought in about 300 years ago, but I could not prove it.  I do not think a book is included as an archaeological object in the Bill.  I should like to know the kind of proof, and also why 300 years has been definitely chosen.  Archaeology is generally supposed to be distinctly more than 300 years.  When you are dealing with archaeology you are dealing with 1,300 years or even further back&mdash;1,900 years.  To say 300 years ago, say 1629, was the dark ages seems to say that Hugh O'Donnell and Turlough O'Neill are back very far in history.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us a little enlightenment on the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any reason that I can give for fixing 300 years rather than 400 years.  What we want to do is to secure that so far as possible objects of purely artistic or cultural interest shall not be included in the Bill.  For instance, furniture and pictures.  The principal period for importing furniture, valuable pictures, and all that, into this country was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  We do not want to go back so far as to exclude objects that might be of real historical value to the country.  It is a question for the Dáil whether we fix three hundred or four hundred years, but I think that it would be too far to go back to 1400 to save Deputy Cooper's manuscripts or books.  Really you have to fix some period.  This is a new section; there is nothing like it in any Acts of Great Britain or Ireland.  We thought that 300 years would be a reasonable period to fix for things of real value.  The period in which most of the furniture and pictures came here was the time of Grattan's Parliament, and we want as far as possible not to include these.  If there is any wish for a longer period, we would probably extend it.</P>

      <P>I thought the period of 300 years was rather significant, going back beyond 1641.  I would rather see 100 years than 300 years. I do not see why articles of historic interest should be permitted to be exported at all.  If the section were limited to heirlooms, there might be something to be said for it.  There are, as we know, certain families clearing out of this country, unfortunately perhaps, and many historic documents may disappear with them.  I do not think that should be permitted.  I would like to see it limited to, say, 100 years, and also limited to heirlooms, and to give the Minister power to give permission to people to take these things away rather than to give a general permission. To empower the board to permit the exportation of heirlooms would be much better than to leave it as wide as it is now.</P>

      <P>I am of Deputy Fahy's way of thinking.  I would not have a time limit at all.  I think objects of great historical interest to this country would be 300 or 100 years old.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the subject of pictures.  There is an example of a very famous picture, the best picture of Oliver Goldsmith, by Joshua Reynolds, that would be excluded under this clause, and that picture has been exported out of the country not so long ago.  There are other things not 100 years old that are of great historic interest, not strictly archæological but of intense historic interest, that are less than 100 years old.  I do not like this section at all, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider it.</P>

I believe that is done in most other countries.  I agree, to a certain extent, that there are sentimental reasons why heirlooms may be permitted.  Otherwise, I would prefer to see the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I would like to avoid misunderstanding.  The books that I am referring to are not in any sense of any archaeological value so far as this country is concerned. I do not think there was any printing in Ireland 300 years ago.  These books were printed in Germany or in Venice, in the very early days of printing, but they cannot be regarded as of any value in respect of the history of this country.  I cannot understand what Deputy Fahy said about heirlooms. Most of my possessions, unfortunately, are heirlooms, and I cannot sell them at all.  I might take them out of the country, but I could not possibly sell them.  If I choose to make myself liable to a prosecution I may sell them.  I have only been prosecuted once, and I did not enjoy it.  The same magistrate who tried <Col N="1374" /> me tried Deputy de Valera on a later occasion, but he was more merciful to me.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary's clause has met the point which I raised on the Committee Stage.  I would suggest that you cannot lay down a hard and fast rule as regards years.  I am in agreement with the Deputies who spoke on that point.  I suggest, as the Seanad is likely to discuss this Bill at some length, including the question of heirlooms, possibly an amendment might be put forward there in the light of this discussion.</P>

      <P>I think a distinction ought to be drawn between things that are of artistic value that are essentially Irish, and things that have been imported into this country that are the private property of people resident in this country.  I mean things, say, china, that are of great historic interest and things of that sort that are not Irish; also family portraits by Zoffany and Romney or things of that kind that are of international interest, but are not by Irish artists. I can understand portraits by an Irish artist like Hugh Hamilton being prevented from leaving the country, but I think it would be a very great hardship that portraits by Romney or things of that kind should be prevented from being sold. It might be a very serious matter to their owners when they have got death duties to pay.  I think things that are essentially Irish, such matters as Irish china, Waterford glass and things of that kind, should be dealt with on a different basis.  I think it would be drawing the matter too tight altogether to insist on such articles as I have mentioned being compulsorily retained in the country and would mean a great hardship to the successors of people who are now in existence when they come to pay duties to the Government later on.</P>

      <P>I have very great sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Wolfe.  The difficulty is to try to give legal expression to the views he has expressed.  If you once limit this section to things of particular <Col N="1375" /> Irish historical value you do not know where it is going to end.</P>
      <P>You may have a Raphael picture, or a valuable carving from Italy, and the fact that you have that in your possession and that it came in at a particular period, say at the end of the eighteenth century, which was in many respects a period of very high culture in Dublin, in itself associates it in a particular way with Ireland, even though the picture happened to be painted in a foreign country or the carving or statue produced elsewhere, so that it is difficult to draw a definite line.  You cannot merely state that because it was the work of another country it had no associations with Ireland. There might be a portrait by Romney of an Irish person, or some person with relations in Ireland, or who had some connection with Ireland&mdash; for instance there might be a portrait of Cromwell, who was in Ireland at a particular time.  If we try to deal with the difficulty in that way there will be no end of trouble. In order to meet the situation, I have proposed this amendment suggesting three hundred years.  It is not an amendment on which I am very keen if there is no desire in the House for it.  I thought it was better to put in that, and to save objects back to a particular period during which a great many very valuable things came into the country, rather than to have no limitation. If there is no desire in the House for it, I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  This Act shall come into operation on the 1st day of May, 1930.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that this Bill was brought in last summer, and that there was some possibility then of it being passed into law before the summer recess.  That, however, was found impossible and the Bill had to stand over till this session.  The House will probably agree that it would not be a good thing to bring the Bill into force in the middle of the shooting season.  If the Bill came into force in January, say, it would be rather awkward for shooting people to have this Bill suddenly come upon them in the middle of the season.  May 1st is chosen because the shooting season will have ended and the Bill, I hope, will be in order for the next shooting season.  It would be rather unfair to bring it into force in the middle of the season.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 17, to delete the word &ldquo;plover&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;lapwing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have amended this considerably since the Committee Stage.  On the last occasion the discussion centred around the lapwing.  It is generally supposed that lapwing have been useful for the prevention of fluke. That is only a theory and has not been proved by anybody.  In order to meet the Minister I am prepared to concede lapwing, provided he will delete the word &ldquo;plover.&rdquo;  These birds are bred in other countries and are migratory.  Not even ten per cent. of the lapwing are bred in Ireland. In Northern Ireland these birds are not classed as game.  I am more than surprised that the Minister did not frame this Bill on the lines of the old British Acts, and <Col N="1377" /> leave out plover and other species of wild birds.  For the last two days we have been discussing the question of unemployment on the Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill.  Only last week we had a demonstration by the unemployed which only provided a bird's eye view of what the real problem is.  By including plover in the definition of game birds, a couple of thousand people will be deprived of employment.  They are people who do very little harm and who are trying to make a living in this way and rear their families.  I contend that this will be a greater hardship on them.  We have been very considerate in providing pensions or gratuities for people who lost their employment through Acts passed by this House, and if the Minister does not accede to this amendment, I hope he will consider the question of compensating the people who will lose their employment as a consequence of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a definition from somebody as to what is a lapwing and what is a plover, and to have it proved that lapwing or plover, or plover or lapwing, whichever the case may be, are migratory birds.  I do not disagree with the mover of the amendment, but I want to have this matter explained to me.  I have known lapwing and plover since I was the size of a plover, and I have yet to know the difference between them.  I should like to have the difference explained to me, because where I come from the lapwing is called a plover and the plover is called a lapwing. I have never known them to be migratory birds, because, like the poor, they are always with us.  If we are going to have any definition of this I should like somebody who knows more about natural history than I do to explain the difference between them, because I want to make up my mind on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this that may not have been considered.  I have not gone in for very high living in my time, but I understand that in some of the high-class restaurants in London <Col N="1378" /> plovers' eggs are sold at 1/- each. If you are going to have any wholesale slaughter of plovers, you are going to deprive the people of a market for plovers' eggs.  I do not know whether or not that has been taken into consideration.  The netting of plover has never been carried on where I come from, but the sending of plovers' eggs to the London market has been carried on for a considerable time.  I therefore disagree with what the Deputy who has spoken last said, inasmuch as he said that only ten per cent. of plover or lapwing breed in this country.  I disagree with him, because from the earliest days that I have collected birds' eggs I have collected plovers' eggs, and plover do breed in this country in the North.  Of course I do not know whether they breed in the South, but I expect that they would be more prolific in the South, as all things seem to be more prolific in the South than in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some knowledge upon this subject and I think if I said that ten per cent. of plover breed in this country and 90 per cent. come from other parts I would be right.  That is green plover. The really valuable bird, the golden plover, comes here in large quantities in September and October and is entirely migratory.  None of them stay here.  I agree with Deputy Carney that plovers' eggs are a very valuable asset, and if people would endeavour to collect the eggs of the plover in the season and export them they would get a far higher price than they would by trying to destroy the birds by netting them.</P>

I used to see them in great numbers, but I have not seen them for a long time.  I do not think that netting lapwing is likely to give anyone a living at present, but if something is not done to preserve these birds no lapwing or golden plover will be left in the country.  At least, for two years they seem to have disappeared entirely from my district.  I agree with what Deputy Shaw has said and I hope that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  I think plover are very valuable birds, and I hope that every effort will be made to preserve them for the good of the farmers' stock.</P>

On that occasion we took a free vote of the House, and as Deputies will recollect, those in favour of the netting of plover were in the minority.  I think the Deputy is full of courage to ask the House to reverse now what it did on that occasion.  As far as Deputy Carney's question goes as to what is the difference between lapwing and plover, I think it is very easy to answer it in a way. The answer is that all lapwing are plover but all plover are not lapwing.</P>

      <P>I beg pardon; there is a later amendment. Now the main object of this Bill is to make Ireland a place in which there will be a great deal of valuable shooting and to develop a potential asset in this country.  I grant that grey and golden plover are not what I might call the most valuable type of game birds, but at the same time they are birds that give a great deal of very interesting shooting indeed. Most Deputies in the Dáil have done a certain amount of shooting in their time, and I suppose most Deputies would agree with me that plover are a very interesting bird indeed.</P>
      <P>The statement that there are a thousand persons in the country engaged in trapping them is, I think, a very great over-statement of the case.  We had a free vote of the Dáil before on this question, and if the Deputy wishes to chance his luck again he can do so.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that as a matter of fact people down the country believe that the Minister is in the hands of a number of people here in the city of Dublin concerning this particular bird.  There was a big meeting in the Mansion House of the Game Preservation people, and a person asked me if they were all Germans or Jews because their names sounded so foreign.  People had the right under an alien Government to net these birds.  Why cannot this House give them the same right?  The people who were at it now are old, and in a few years they will be finished with, and there is therefore no necessity for this.  As regards lapwing of all sorts, Deputy Carney said he knew all about plover, but I found that he did not know what plover were at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, after the word &ldquo;duck&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;brent goose, barnacle goose and other species of wild goose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment goes with amendment 6.  The object of the amendment is to put the wild goose on the same level, as far as this Bill is concerned, as the wild duck.  There is, however, a difference in view of the fact that only a very small portion of the wild geese which visit this country breed here.  I have not put down an amendment to the Schedule to create a close season for wild geese.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill Deputy Brennan, I think, introduced an amendment somewhat similar to amendment 6, with reference to the night shooting of wild geese.  He withdrew the amendment on the matter being explained by the Minister that wild geese were not to be included in the Bill.  I have, therefore, put in amendments 3 and 6 in order to cover both contingencies. I have only mentioned two species of wild geese in the amendment.  As a matter of fact, there are other species of wild geese. Wild geese are very plentiful in Co. Wexford.  The brent goose is to be found in Wexford Harbour. The ordinary type of goose to be found in the midlands of Ireland is known, I think, as the white brent goose.  It is not found in tidal waters.  There are various reasons why wild geese should be protected and recognised as game in this Bill.  They are found in various parts of Ireland.  Certain properties have been sold or leased because of the shooting of duck and geese to be had on them.  If the wild goose is not included in this Bill, considerable damage will be caused to the owners of these shooting properties. I see no reason why the Minister should not accept these two amendments.  If he accepts them, I do not see that it will cause any hardship on anybody.  The wild goose is a very distinctive bird in this country.  It has national associations, and apart from that, I venture to say that it has even a theological association.  I understand that in the Kingdom of Kerry the barnacle goose is a bird which, according to ecclesiastical law, it is permitted to eat on Fridays in that diocese.  I think that is the only case in the whole world where a bird is permitted to be eaten on Fridays according to the laws of the denomination to which the great majority of Irish people belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From an aeronautical point of view the wild goose, I understand, is a very interesting bird.  It can fly at the rate of eighty miles an hour. I also think that it is the only bird in Ireland, though there may be others, which flies in formation. For various reasons it is very desirable that this bird should be included in the Bill.  For instance, it has been suggested to me that possibly a new sport might be developed in this country, particularly in view of the very plentiful supply of wild geese that have been coming in in recent years, a sport which should appeal to many people not only in this but in other countries where there are light aeroplanes available, and that is the shooting of wild geese from the air.  It is very difficult to get near these birds, which are very wary of human beings, particularly if they have been shot at on one or two occasions. It strikes me that in the future a very substantial income might be derived by the State from the development of an aerial wild goose chase.  These birds fly faster than most birds.  They fly, roughly, at the same cruising speed as a modern light aeroplane.  I see no reason why the Minister should not accept the two amendments.  There can be no objection to making a close season.  With the exception of one small limited type of wild geese, the wild geese that come to this country do not breed here.  I do not see what harm would be done by the <Col N="1385" /> Minister accepting the amendment, and I do not think any Deputy would have any grievous objection to doing so.</P>

      <P>Whatever hope the Deputy had of getting his amendment accepted by the Minister was, I think, wiped out when he said that these birds fly in formation, as we know that the Minister has a holy horror of formations.  I really do not know what is at the bottom of the amendments.  The Deputy has kept his real reason for bringing them forward very dark.  Wild geese are migratory birds, and as a general rule they do not breed in this country.  The Deputy referred to the speed at which wild geese fly and compared it to the speed of an aeroplane.  I do not know if the reason why he wants no shooting of these birds is because he is afraid that some pellets might strike the Moths when in flight. I do not see why the Deputy introduced this amendment except that he is afraid that some wild fowl will pot him when he is up aloft.  I think he gave away the game when he told us about the resemblance between the flight of a goose and that of an aeroplane. That showed his real anxiety for the preservation of the bird.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment for the reasons stated by the Deputy, including the historic reasons and others which I will not detain the House by mentioning.  The absence of a certain pestilence in this country is said to be attributed to the presence of wild geese.  There are certain parasites, and the geese devour the hosts in which these parasites breed.  For that reason I think that the Minister should give the matter very careful consideration, and, in my opinion, it would be well worth while to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is any reason why the amendment should be accepted.  I think that Deputy Esmonde himself <Col N="1386" /> realises that.  As a matter of fact, he expressed that opinion when he stated that they were birds which are very hard to get at.  That is so. I often tried to get at them, but seldom succeeded.  Neither Deputy Esmonde nor Deputy Dr. Hennessy has shown that there is any abuse in catching wild geese.  The mortality of wild geese must be very small. They are migratory birds.  They are very wary, very wild, and they are well able to protect themselves. I think that they can be exempt from the Bill.  Except for the reasons which Deputy Esmonde put forward, namely, the nautical reasons, I do not see why they should not be left as they are.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Brennan has stated in regard to the wild goose is equally true of any game bird outside the close season. There is not a game bird which frequents this country that is not quite as capable as the wild goose of looking after itself in the open season. The argument used by Deputy Brennan is an argument for the abolition of game laws and the attempts to preserve game.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment, which is put forward in all seriousness.  I happen to know some parts of Ireland, notably in County Wexford, where wild geese started to come in the second year of the war.  About fifty came first, and some hundreds the next year, while their numbers recently have reached thousands.  While not exactly with the same rapidity as the geese increased, but in much the same proportion, the visitors to that part of the country have increased.  I know little hotels where it was almost unknown for tourists or visitors to come, particularly in winter, but now accommodation has to be booked in advance in these places during the shooting season.  If these birds are not to get the same protection as is extended to other classes of game I think it would be a hardship on people who live by visitors in these areas.  From the sporting point of view, the wild goose provides somewhat better sport than most of the <Col N="1387" /> game to which we are accustomed in this country.  If we are to develop the sporting instincts of the people and an interest in game and game rights, as we hope to do, we would be flying against the whole intentions of the Bill if we did not include the wild goose.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to understand the object of the amendment.  I have been listening to Deputies and I find it difficult to know whether the object of the amendment is to save wild geese or to allow them to be shot.  As far as I can read the amendment, it is: in page 3, to insert after the word &ldquo;duck&rdquo; and inside the bracket the words &ldquo;brent goose, barnacic goose, and other species of wild geese.&rdquo;  If that is inserted, it seems to me that it gives permission to shoot these birds because the section says &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person at any time of the year to kill or take any game (other than mallard, teal, widgeon and other species of wild duck) between the hours between one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise.&rdquo; Therefore, it is lawful to take these mentioned in the brackets and you want to include geese amongst them.</P>

      <P>My objection to this amendment is on entirely different grounds.  In the district I represent, in Connemara, we were allowed to <Col N="1388" /> shoot when the shooting belonged to the people.  Nowadays the shooting is handed over by the Land Commission to three or four Englishmen. That has occurred over a wide and extensive area in Connemara.  For that reason, because the Land Commission have taken the shooting rights from the people and handed them over to three or four Englishmen at a very nominal rent per annum, I want to limit their rights and to hold the rights we have.  I therefore object to making wild geese game.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any real objection to the amendment. We know that a wild goose, of course, is a bird shot for sporting purposes and I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that people do come over to parts of the country where there are large slob-land areas for the purpose of shooting geese.  Therefore, geese should receive the same protection as other wild birds receive under this Bill.  It appears to me not an unreasonable thing to suggest.  I think I can answer Deputy de Valera's point in this way that under this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is necessitated by an alteration in the close season for hares which was made on the last day.

      <P>This is a matter which I undertook at the suggestion of Deputies Gorey and Anthony to have introduced. While the close season for hares ends on the 1st March, this allows the holding of authorised coursing meetings up to the 18th March.

    <P>(1)  The Minister may be order declare any society, association or <Col N="1396" /> club formed for the promotion of the preservation of game or for the promotion or improvement of the breeding or training of dogs used in the pursuit of game to be a recognised association for the purposes of this section, and may at any time at his absolute discretion revoke any such order previously made by him.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where any lands have with the consent of the occupier thereof, been reserved by a recognised association for the purpose of killing, taking, or preserving game thereon, and notice of such reservation has been published on two separate occasions in a newspaper circulating in the district in which such lands are situate, then and in every such case any prosecution in the District Court in respect of trespass on such lands for the purpose of, or in the course of the pursuit of game, may be instituted at the suit and in the name of the secretary of such recognised association, and it shall not be a defence to any such prosecution (whether instituted in the name of such secretary or in the name of some other person) or to any prosecution for an offence under this part of this Act in relation to the killing or taking of game on such lands for the defendant to prove that he was authorised by the occupier of such lands to kill or take game thereon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not want to oppose this amendment moved by the Minister, I want to say that it is <Col N="1397" /> at the same time a very poor tribute to a large number of clubs established for the preservation of game, clubs composed of people who have given very substantial evidence of their interest in that direction by what they have done in the re-stocking of lands with game birds.  The Munster Clay Target and Game Protection Association consists of a very large number of sportsmen who have shown a very keen and practical interest in the preservation of game. The members have put their hands in their pockets and have subscribed handsomely to the funds for the stocking of game.  I do not know of any dog club with the exception of greyhound clubs that has done anything to increase the amount of game in the country.  This club has done an immense amount in that direction. Deputy Bennett has been able to secure the support of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in getting this amendment accepted.  The fact that it has been accepted by him is not due to any interest that the Minister has in these particular dog clubs.  I do know and I can state with certainty that those game dog clubs have done nothing to increase the game in the country or to bring them into the country.  There is only one set of sportsmen who have done anything about game and these are the gun clubs and the coursing clubs. It may be suggested that private persons in Limerick have done something in the way of preserving their lands, but I would want to see a more constructive effort than that. We in Cork have put a lot of game into the country including partridges, pheasants, and so on.  This amendment is giving undue importance to the gun dog clubs, an importance which they do not deserve.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy quite understands the amendment.  As the amendment was put forward first, an association in order to be recognised should be in affiliation with the Irish Kennel Clubs.  I refused to accept that, but I accepted the amendment which allows a prosecution to be brought in the name of the secretary of the <Col N="1398" /> club.  That is the only privilege and the only recognition that the association will get and that is a very trifling privilege.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will see that the Cork Game Preservation Society and every other society of the same sort can, if they wish to do so, get registered. I cannot see that it is any slight on them; as a matter of fact it is rather in the hope that more associations like the Cork and other game preservation societies will be formed and registered.  We are anxious that as many associations as possible will come in.  Nobody is keener on the formation of game preservation associations than I am. I have stated here before that unless these associations are established and unless they work actively, this Bill will be of very little use.</P>

      <P>This is a most valuable amendment, and I am glad that the Minister has accepted it.  By his acceptance of it, it will follow that clubs will be formed all over the country.  Ministerial recognition such as we have had now will mean that this measure in operation will be useful.  To adopt a game protection measure where there is very little game is of little use.  When these clubs are formed all over the country their principal work will be to annihilate such vermin as scald crows, hawks and magpies, and this will prevent the robbing of game birds' nests and the killing of the young birds.  These clubs, I am sure, will be prepared to give a reward for bringing in the heads of the vermin I have mentioned.  By doing that they will gradually remove what are responsible for the practical extinction of game in this country.  When I go home I intend to start a game preservation society in County Westmeath.  I hope Deputies from other constituencies will do likewise.</P>

    <P>I put in this amendment because, having gone out to shoot pheasants on 1st October, I found several coveys running into the furze.  They were unable to rise because they were purely immature chickens.  In my opinion, there is not much of the element of sport in going out to shoot birds on that date.  My amendment aims at extending the date to the 1st of November.</P>

      <P>The experience of Deputy Shaw is pretty much the experience of all of us.  We have all met with cases, especially in the last few years, of immature birds getting their wings coming up to 1st October. It is pure slaughter to allow the shooting of immature birds like that.  Half of the pheasant stock in the country are immature at that time of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that immature birds should not be killed, but nevertheless I persist that the amendment should be left as it stands and the date should be 30th November.  The only way in which we can preserve pheasants is by not shooting them at all.  I put that to the Minister on the Committee Stage and I am sorry he did not agree with my view.  As far as I can see, this Bill is framed merely to preserve the game in this country for the few.  I, for one, will insist on the amendment as it stands.

      <P>I do not agree with the reasons given by Deputy Shaw for his amendment.  We have all had experience of meeting immature birds immediately before or on the date set down for the shooting of that class of birds.  It is quite possible, even if the amendment is carried, that we may meet immature birds on 30th November.</P>

      <P>I do not think so either, and that is the reason I think there is no necessity for changing the date.  The date of 1st October was arrived at after due consideration. I do not think that the seasons have changed or that the habits of the birds have changed very much.  It is no sound reason to alter the date merely because one meets with an odd covey of immature birds.  There is no need to shoot them and the Deputy, I am sure, would be the last man to do so.  You would be able to find other birds of full maturity on the date that has been fixed and that has been in operation for so long.  I would not be inclined to alter the date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment and, like Deputy Corry, I would not mind going a little bit further.  The fact of the matter is that pheasants are practically extinct.  It is the one class of game that needs preservation most. We should do everything in our power to encourage pheasants and their preservation should be our chief aim.  I do not think it will be any great hardship on any sportsman to limit the shooting of pheasants to a couple of months.  A sportsman will find lots of opportunities for killing the few pheasants that remain in a very short space of time.  Most of the big shoots organised by private people can easily be deferred until the month <Col N="1403" /> of December.  I am in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very drastic and far-reaching amendment. It would alter the shooting season for a very important class of game, a class of bird that stands on a different footing from any other class of bird.  You must recollect that the pheasant as a purely wild bird does not really exist in these countries at all.  Wherever you have a pheasant shoot they are all hand-reared pheasants, and all hand-reared pheasants will be mature on the 1st of October.  You will find wild pheasants that are not mature on that date, just as Deputy Redmond pointed out you will find grouse on the 12th of August which are not mature.  Anybody who has shot grouse over dogs finds that a certain number of immature grouse get up and squeal as they go away, which properly feathered grouse do not do.  Just as strong a case as can be put up against the shooting of pheasants on the 1st of October because they are immature can be made against grouse, in fact a stronger case, I think, and as I pointed out, the grouse is a wild bird while the pheasant is artificially reared.  If a person rears a great number of pheasants, if they are ready for shooting at a particular date and that happens to be the time when he is at liberty to shoot, he might not be at liberty later on, and I think it would be a hardship on him if he were not allowed to shoot his hand-reared pheasants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry's point is that pheasants ought to be altogether protected.  Well, pheasants can be protected.  If there is a case made out for a particular area that pheasants should be preserved, that no pheasants should be shot at all for a certain period, there is power in Section 5 to make such an order. That, of course, is temporary, until we get the required number of pheasants back into the country. But if you make the shooting of pheasants begin on the 1st of <Col N="1404" /> November, or on the 1st of December, remember that that will be a provision for all time, not a mere temporary provision.  I think that that is too large and too drastic an alteration, and on the evidence on which the House is asked to act&mdash; that is to say, that a few small, immature birds have been seen&mdash;I do not think that that is sufficient ground to change what is a well-recognised date and one which I never heard attacked as being too early until this amendment was put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>Pheasants that are reared are never shot on the 1st of October, nor on the 1st of November either.  They are rarely shot until December and January, so that they are entirely different from the ordinary birds that we are able to shoot.  I do not want to press the amendment, but my opinion is that the date is entirely too early.  I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have the reason from Deputy Shaw for this amendment.  It took a long time to get out the exact reason.  The exact reason is that an odd bird manages to escape out of these preserves, and Deputy Shaw is afraid that even that odd bird will be picked up by the mere commoner who owns a gun and pays his £2 licence.  I was very anxious to get out the reason why this amendment was put down and I think we have it now.  That is the exact reason&mdash;that those few birds would escape from the English gentlemen, that the full number will not be there when they come&mdash;one bird less for every acre.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12 to insert the words &ldquo;Snipe, woodcock and&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;Plover&rdquo; in the first column of the First Schedule and to delete the words &ldquo;Snipe and woodcock&rdquo; in the first column at the end of the Schedule and also to delete the words &ldquo;From the 1st day of March to the 30th day of <Col N="1405" /> September, both days inclusive&rdquo; in the second column at the end of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not as dangerous as it looks.  The period for snipe and woodcock has already been changed, to my mind perhaps changed inadvertently, and as we have a number of amendments to remedy things that were allowed to slip in on the Committee Stage, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment, which would really put the thing on a better footing.  I do not think that there is a greater authority in the Dáil on game than the Minister; certainly none has stated the case better than he has on many things.  I notice that on the Committee Stage he gave us the different classes of snipe.  The home snipe is here in August, as he is reared in the country, and he goes to Egypt, presumably.  The Scotch snipe comes here in September and goes off at the end of September, and the foreign snipe comes here in October.  As the Bill stands we are not allowed to shoot anything but the foreign snipe.  We are to rear the home snipe for other people to shoot elsewhere; we are to allow the Scotch snipe to pass through, and we are to get a crack only at the foreign snipe on 1st October.  There is another point that occurs to me and it is this: the more uniform we keep these dates so that they do not clash with one another the better, because we will confuse the minds of everyone in the country by having different dates for different classes of birds.  The normal date for most birds is the 12th August.  Everyone associates that date with the beginning of the shooting season.  By having all these others in a month, six weeks or two months, you will be bound to confuse the minds of everybody, and the first man who is brought to court for an offence will say: &ldquo;It is impossible to remember all the different dates for the different birds.&rdquo;  Of course, pheasants are in a different category; no one would dream of shooting them on the 12th of August.  Another reason that appeals to a great many of us who live in the northern part of the <Col N="1406" /> country is that on one side of the road we will be shooting snipe on the 13th of August, and on the other side we will have to wait until the 1st of October.</P>

      <P>I only mention that because there does not seem to be any reason why such a difference should exist in the same country. We will be protecting the homebred snipe for no earthly reason that I can see except to let them go out of the country.  Practically no one goes to shoot snipe in the months of August or September, but towards the end of September, when people are coming home from other shootings, if a snipe gets up it is a great temptation to them to shoot it, and I think a man who is out shooting ought to be allowed to shoot it.  If it is in season there is no use in protecting it at that time.  It is either a Scotch snipe or a home snipe which goes out of the country, and we get no benefit.  We will never get a shot at the very birds we are protecting. I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>As this Bill was originally introduced the date was the 12th of August, and the 12th of August was changed by the Dáil to the 1st of October.  Personally I think that the 1st of October is too late.  The next amendment, in the name of Deputy Law, proposes the 1st of September, and I would suggest that, as a compromise between the 12th of August and the 1st of October views, the 1st of September view might be acceptable to the House.  I think that the 1st of September is a useful date, for the reason that really the home snipe are hardly worth shooting on the earlier date, and it will be a question only of eighteen days between the 12th of August and the 1st of September. On the other hand, after the 1st of September you will get all the snipe that are worth shooting. If you put it back as far as the 1st of October I think that you would not get a great number of snipe that could be shot and that are really <Col N="1407" /> physically in season.  I know that in my own native county, where I have done practically all my shooting for many years past, the date has been the 1st of October, but I have seen the foreign snipe arrive, and big wisps of snipe, a week or possibly even a fortnight before the 1st of October, so that I entirely agree that the 1st of October is too late.  Also I believe that in the eastern counties the snipe arrive earlier than they do on the western seaboard.  So that as far as my own view is concerned I would be perfectly satisfied with the 1st of September. I recognise that the Dáil has already altered the date from the 12th of August, and the Dáil might not wish to put it back, but I suggest the acceptance of Deputy Law's amendment as a compromise.</P>

      <P>My amendment was put down as a kind of second barrel.  I think that there is a good deal of substance in what has been said by Deputy Myles, that it is desirable to have the same date, as far as it can reasonably be done, for the different kinds of birds, and for that reason I would prefer the date which originally appeared in the Bill.  If the House were to think that, on the whole, it made a mistake in that connection on the Committee Stage, I do not see why it should not, with perfect propriety and without any shame, revert to the original date.  I am glad that the Minister takes this view.  It is quite certain that the date, as it now stands, is quite absurdly late.  It would really mean that over considerable tracts of country there would be no shooting at all in September, or that if there was shooting, you would be protecting snipe, which did not very much need protection, which could look after themselves, really at the expense of the grouse, because by the time you have shot over 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 acres, by the time you come to the early part of September, you have shot all the grouse that ought to be shot, and if you are a reasonable sportsman, you will put some No. 8 shot into your gun and <Col N="1408" /> go after snipe.  If you are precluded entirely from shooting snipe during the latter part of August and September, I am afraid that the temptation to pick up all the grouse possible in order not to go home with an entirely empty bag, will be too much for a great many people.  On the whole, I should prefer to leave the date as it originally stood in the Bill, but if the House thinks that it ought not to go back, if my amendment to make the date the 31st of August were accepted, I would be perfectly satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">

      <P>So far the House seems to have said nothing on the matter except for what has been said by the Minister, the mover of the amendment, and the mover of the second amendment, who seems now rather to prefer the amendment moved by Deputy Myles.  Personally I am strongly in favour of reverting to the original date, and I think it was, as Deputy Myles said, somewhat through inadvertence that the House altered the date.  I do not know what Deputy moved the amendment &mdash;I think it was Deputy Boland&mdash;but at the time possibly he did not know as much as he does now in regard to the habits of snipe in this country. If it is a matter only of eighteen days, as the Minister has said, I do not see why the eighteen days should not be given instead of the other side of September.  It would be better to have it on the August side and to have the original date. There is a great deal to be said for the point of view put forward by Deputy Myles with regard to the confusion over the different dates. Also, as the Minister himself has said, the foreign snipe come sooner into the eastern counties, and the home snipe go away earlier.  There used to be an old phrase&mdash;&ldquo;Spoiling the Egyptians&rdquo;&mdash;but certainly as the clause now stands it would seem to be &ldquo;Save the Egyptians,&rdquo; or save the snipe for the Egyptians.  If we are going to alter it, let us alter it back to the original date&mdash;the 12th of August.  The Minister seems to be personally in favour of that; Deputy Myles certainly is, and now we <Col N="1409" /> have Deputy Law saying that he would prefer that to his own amendment. I would ask the House to consider whether it would not be advisable to revert to the original date.</P>

      <P>It was not through inadvertence, as Deputy Redmond suggests, that this amendment was carried in Committee; it was a result of experience.  For years past, in half-a-dozen counties in the Saorstát, Sligo being one of them, the close season for snipe and woodcock has been up to the 1st of October, and we have experienced no very great inconvenience from it. There were occasional complaints. Deputy Law had it in his power to remove grievances, at any rate to try to remove grievances, for a period of something like twenty years, when he was in the House of Commons; Deputy Redmond had the same power for about twelve years, but I do not think they ever addressed themselves to the grievances of Sligo and other counties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper was a member of the House of Commons for precisely eleven months, and during most of that time it was adjourned for the Constitutional Conference.  I think I might have been given eleven months to find my feet.  If I had been a member of it a little longer I might have done something.  But, as a matter of fact, I do not think I would have, because there is really no grievance.  Deputy Law's idea <Col N="1410" /> that we are going to kill an enormous number of grouse in September, because we will have nothing else to kill, is really not based on fact.  I do not want to go back to the 1st of August.  We in Sligo hold that the woodcock which are there in August go away on the 1st of September and come back about the 12th of December.  I know, as the Minister says, that they do not do that in Mayo, but I cannot conceive that any intelligent woodcock&mdash;and woodcock are very intelligent birds&mdash;would wish to return to county Mayo if he once got out of it.</P>
      <P>The amendment on the paper seems to me to be a fair compromise. There ought to be plenty of grouse to shoot, if this Bill protects them at all, in the month of August.  I would not object to the 31st of August as the date, but I do not think it desirable to start the shooting, particularly of woodcock, and even of snipe, as early as the 1st of August.  I am prepared to allow shooting in September to obviate the massacre of grouse that Deputy Law indicated.  Anybody who tries to massacre grouse in September, when they are thoroughly wild, will have to walk very long and very far, and will have to be an extremely good shot at long range.</P>
      <P>In order that Deputy Law's fears of finding a St. Bartholomew amongst the grouse may not be realised I should certainly say the 31st August.</P>

As far as I am concerned I would be quite satisfied to see us going back to the original date&mdash;the 12th August.  There is one thing and that is, the more we hit on a common date for the preservation of game the better.  If you have a different date for every bird you will have a difficult position all round because when a man is out with a gun he is apt to forget the date.</P>

I have no interest in snipe any more than in other game birds, but I realise that on the pretext of shooting snipe other birds have been shot. Therefore, the amendment is not only a protection for snipe but for other birds as well and is very useful in the Bill.  When I put down the amendment I was satisfied that it was necessary, but other snipers are of opinion that we have gone back too far.  I am prepared to accept the compromise amendment by Deputy Hugh Law.</P>

    <P>As the Bill stands there is no close season for quail and landrail.  As we made quail and landrail game birds under the Bill it seems logical that there should be a close season for them.  The season for them is the same as the close season for grouse. Landrail is, to some extent, in this country.  I do not suppose that anybody ever bothered shooting landrail. To a large extent, quail is extinct, but possibly it may, under better conditions, return and re-inhabit the country.  I believe there were quail here eighty or a hundred years ago.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to the manner in which the proceedings of the Dáil have been conducted during the past three weeks.  Deputies have been brought up from the country for two days in the week and their travelling expenses alone cost between £300 and £400 for those two days.  If the President practised the economy which he talks so much about in this Dáil it would be better for everybody. If the Departments are not able to keep up to the business, or are unable to prepare the Bills fast enough, which seems to be the reason for these two days in the week sittings, why should we not sit four days in one week and not sit at all the next week, and save £300 or £400 in travelling expenses?  When we appeal for money for any purpose, for instance, for the dependants of those killed during the Black-and-Tan period, we are told that there is no money available, and yet £300 or £400 is wasted by bringing Deputies <Col N="1416" /> here for one sitting.  I think the President should look at it in that light.  I for one have a great objection to these two-day-in-the-week sittings.  I consider that they are a waste of public funds and it is time that the President and those associated with him should look into this waste of public funds.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Poaching Trawlers off Donegal Coast.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I put a question to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries in connection with the evacuation of the island of Inistrahull on the coast of Donegal. In that question I embodied a certain thing that I hold, and that the people concerned hold, was responsible for their having to leave the island, and that is the poaching by trawlers inside prohibited waters. It was such an important question that I felt compelled to raise the matter on the adjournment to-night. It does not alone apply to the people of Inistrahull but to the people of the whole seaboard.  For the information of those Deputies who have remained for this debate, I should like to say that Inistrahull Island is situated six miles to the north-east of Malin Head.  It is 114 acres in extent and it is one of the few places in this country where the population actually increased by almost 100 per cent. from 1881 to 1901.  The people there earned their livelihood from the fishing industry.  They had a school and they had a graveyard. Some weeks ago the people were compelled to evacuate the island <i>en bloc;</i> the school-house and the homes were deserted and the island was left practically derelict, except for a lightkeeper.  I will give the Dáil a simile: It was Ireland on a small scale, though, as a matter of fact, it was in a far better position than the mainland, because the population had actually increased from 49 inhabitants to 65, while, owing to the famine, the population of Ireland <Col N="1417" /> had decreased by over fifty per cent.  The people of the island were dependent for their livelihood on the fishing industry.  They had very small boats for inshore fishing; they could line fish; and fish with nets during the herring season.  Then the foreign trawlers came along.  I am including in foreign trawlers Scotch and English trawlers and French fishing smacks.  On the grounds where these people formerly could catch such fish as plaice, cod, herring, ling, halibut, turbot, salmon and lobster, in their different seasons, they now find it absolutely impossible to eke out the livelihood which they had been able to earn before the poaching by the trawlers came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to show how prolific were the spawning beds off the coast of Donegal I shall quote from a fishery commission report of the year 1837, which will also show the deterioration that has since taken place.  In that year there were 6,613 fishermen recorded on the coast of Donegal operating in 1,272 boats.  A Lieutenant Hamilton, in his evidence before the Commission, stated that a good row boat at that time, in the five or six weeks of the herring fishing season, could make from £30 to £50, which works out at from £6 to £10 per week per boat.  That is 92 years ago, and at the present time there are not 6,613 men on the coast of Donegal, showing that we have not progressed.  It has been retrogression all along the line.  According to the Gaeltacht Commission's Report there are 12,000 fishermen along the whole sea-board of the Twenty-six Counties. There were half that number in Donegal alone 92 years ago.  At the time that Lieutenant Hamilton gave his evidence before the Commission in 1837, herrings were sold at from 5/- to 10/- per thousand.  There are better prices prevailing now, but there is not a fishing or a row boat in the Twenty-six Counties capable at present, even with increased prices, of earning from £6 to £10 per week per boat.  Why?  When the trawlers started illegal fishing all the beds inside the territorial waters <Col N="1418" /> of the Free State were swept to this extent, that in evidence given in a prosecution in Donegal it was stated &mdash;and this is authentic&mdash;that a trawl belonging to a foreign trawler&mdash;I am classing the British as foreign trawlers&mdash;sweeping inside the three-mile limit, or inside our territorial waters, lifted a dinner plate on which was the stamp of the Anchor Line Company.  That dinner plate had evidently fallen overboard from an Anchor Line boat, and was actually lifted off the bottom of the sea by this trawler.  I have seen myself a jack-knife lifted off the bottom by a trawl.  These boats, which are capable of lifting a dinner plate or a jackknife off the bottom of the sea, are also capable of sweeping the spawning beds until the beds are made absolutely worthless.</P>
    <P>The people of Inistrahull Island could shoot lines from a row boat When prices were low they could make a decent living.  As Lieutenant Hamilton said, they could make from £6 to £10 per week at herring fishing &mdash;they could make a decent living shooting lines.  But at the present time it takes a steamboat to go twenty miles off the coast of Donegal in halibut fishing to make a living, and the native fishermen cannot hope to do that.  They have not got the facilities.  No doubt the Minister for Fisheries is faced with a big job and there should be no impediments in his way.  But there is an impediment, and a big one, and I want to point it out to the House.  Eighteen months ago, and down to last week, questions have been asked of the Minister in regard to illegal fishing, and the Minister answered that he had no knowledge of illegal fishing: that he had had no complaints.  I beg to differ.  I have put it up to him. and I understand that even the inspectors of fisheries along the coast have put it up to him, that there was illegal trawling going on; and to bear out my statement I simply ask the Minister to obtain the log-book of the Helga and read the record of the captures that have been made by the Helga.  Furthermore, I ask the Minister to produce the day book of <Col N="1419" /> the Civic Guard in Killybegs to prove that there have been certain foreign trawlers arrested for illegal fishing inside our territorial waters, and that there were fines imposed upon them but never collected.  As an example, I give an instance that happened the third week in September off Malin Head.</P>
    <P>A local fisherman had set his lobster-pots when there came along French smacks lobster fishing.  The Minister may or may not know what these French smacks are doing.  They have a certain draft and in the keels they have a grill and they have fresh sea water washing into a tank. They set their lobster pots inside our waters for lobster, crab and cray fish.  When they get the fish they put them into the tank and feed them and they are able to keep on fishing for a week or a fortnight or three weeks, and when they return to France they bring these shell-fish with them in an absolutely perfect condition for the French market.  Not alone that, but when they get immature shell-fish they bring them to the French coast and plant them there for future use.  Not only are they robbing us at present but they are making provision for their own future.  What have they done?  Owing to certain circumstances they have got so bold that at Malinbeg, in the third week of September, they actually lifted lobster-pots belonging to an Irish fisherman and replaced them with their own pots and when the local fishermen went to remonstrate a French fisherman presented a gun at them and warned them off.</P>
    <P>We spend upon the Civic Guard the sum of £1,558,582 per year.  On the Army we spend £1,967,934 per year, and on the patrol boat £8,000 per year, bringing the whole up to the grand total of £3,534,516, and we cannot stop a Frenchman from presenting a rifle at the head of our native fishermen.  We cannot do a thing.  If the Minister considers that after spending three-and-a-half millions on the defence forces those forces are not capable of defending <Col N="1420" /> our own native fishermen and preventing their unemployment and preventing them going to America to obtain a livelihood, then I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Hand over sufficient arms and ammunition to other people to do it and they will stop it and stop it damn quick.&rdquo;  If the Minister does not do it soon somebody else will do it and then, if you have any international status, you are going to have international complications continuously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question and my whole complaint are based on illegal fishing.  I made that provision.  I am perhaps as wise as the next man. It is alleged that the Free State Government and the Minister concerned have no power to help either the people of Inistrahull or the people along the seaboard of Donegal by collecting fines imposed for poaching.  It is alleged, and I say definitely, and with malice aforethought, that there has been an agreement arrived at or that we have sold or bartered away our rights to the territorial waters, and that fines imposed cannot be collected for the simple reason that neither the Minister nor the Government have a right to collect them, and unless this is disproved it will be held to be true.  There is nobody going to convince the fishermen that the Minister has any power when a fine of £100 was imposed upon a trawler that was arrested by the Helga and <Col N="1421" /> brought to Killybegs, but was never collected.  Nobody is going to convince the fishermen that the Minister has any power to collect it.  The skipper was fined £100, but the simply laughed at it.  He made £700 in the night, and, as I say, the £100 fine was never collected, and I say definitely that the Free State has no power to collect it.  Let us be honest about it.  If the Minister is in a quandary we will help him out, but why be dishonest about it, and pretend that he has powers when he really has no power at all?</P>
      <P>If the Minister says here honestly that we have not got the power then the whole weight of our party will be thrown on his side, because if we can help it there is no country in the world going to make a laughing stock of this country.  From Lerwick in the Shetlands to Yarmouth and from Yarmouth to the coast of France, we are a laughing stock. Our institutions are looked upon as comic opera and our middle name is mud.  The sooner that ends the better.  If we have the power to collect the fines let us collect them. I believe that we can stop foreign trawling and stop our fishermen from being penalised, and that we can also stop emigration along the seaboard.  But if we have not got the power I say to the Minister, be honest and tell us that we have not got it and we will help you all we can.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carney, in the course of his remarks, has pointed to the extent that foreign trawlers operate around the Donegal coast.  He has also pointed to the havoc wrought amongst the fish and to the adverse effect that has on the fishermen in endeavouring to secure a livelihood.  The Deputy pointed out that more protection is needed around the coast.  I endorse every word that he has said.  I should like to quote a few extracts from speeches made by the Minister for Fisheries on this subject.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 18th January, 1923, the Minister said: &ldquo;I wish to make it clear that even under the <Col N="1422" /> best conditions one fishery cruiser, having an all-Ireland beat of something like 2,000 miles, could not possibly cope effectively with this menace of illegal trawling.&rdquo;  Later the same day the Minister said: &ldquo;I will come to the Dáil with a proposal for the provision of one or two additional cruisers.&rdquo;  It is more than six years since the Minister for Fisheries made that statement in the Dáil, but the Dáil has never been asked for a supplementary estimate to make the provision that the Minister then stated was necessary. On the 31st October, 1923, the Minister made a promise in the Dáil that additional patrol boats would be available in the near future.  On the 13th June, 1924, the Minister for Fisheries made this statement in the Dáil: &ldquo;I am quite satisfied one patrol boat is not sufficient.&rdquo;  Again on the 2nd July, 1924, the Minister stated: &ldquo;We have not a sufficient number of patrol boats around the coast.&rdquo;  He also stated on the same date: &ldquo;I agree that no effective patrol of the coast can be done unless we get at least one more patrol boat.&rdquo;  Later the same day the Minister said: &ldquo;I am absolutely in agreement that the coast cannot be patrolled, and that fishing beds will be marauded as long as we have not at least one more fishing cruiser.&rdquo;  On the 30th April, 1925, the Minister said: &ldquo;Last year I approached the Minister for Finance to secure sanction for a second cruiser....  I am disappointed to find that the Minister for Finance has not yet been satisfied as to the need for a second ship, and that he has consequently not made provision for it in the Estimates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask why the Minister for Finance, as well as the Minister for Fisheries, is not here to answer to the House for what is going on around the Donegal coast. I believe that the Minister for Finance is sheltering himself behind the back of the Minister for Fisheries.  I hold that he should be in the House with the Minister for Fisheries to answer the charges made <Col N="1423" /> here by Deputy Carney and myself. In the debates on the Estimates for 1926-27, the Minister for Fisheries stated here that he hoped to come before the House with an estimate for another protection vessel.  On the 9th May, 1928, the Minister made this statement: &ldquo;One cruiser is completely inadequate,&rdquo; and again on the same day he said: &ldquo;I have very considerable hopes that during the year we may be asking for a vote for a second cruiser.&rdquo;  A few weeks ago, when I raised this question again, I was told that it was still under consideration. Does the Minister think that he can continue to fool this House, as well as members of it and the fishermen around the coast of Donegal, in the way that he has been doing?  He stated in this House more than six years ago that another protection vessel was needed. After all the promises that the Minister has made during that time nothing has yet been done to remedy the situation which exists.  We now find that the inhabitants of one of the islands off the coast of Donegal have been obliged to leave it owing to the operations of these foreign trawlers, and to the fact that they are taking away what, if the necessary protection were afforded, would be a means of livelihood on the island for these people and their children.</P>

      <P>During the past six years the Minister has been holding out promises to this House which have not been fulfilled.  In the meantime, the fishermen around the coast of Donegal have been reduced to a state of the greatest poverty.  I say that is due to the fact that the Department has failed to carry out its duty.  I hold that until such time as the Department is forced to carry out its duties in a proper manner you will have poverty existing in that area.  I believe that when dealing with a question like this the <Col N="1424" /> Minister for Finance, as well as the Minister for Fisheries, should be in his place in this House, and that he should not be sheltering himself behind the Minister for Fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is not doing that, and I object to that kind of statement, just as I object to the statement that the Deputy made earlier that these people have left the island for the reason he stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may object, but according to the statements made by the Minister himself these people know very well that he asked for these cruisers, and that the Minister for Finance who is prepared to squander thousands and thousands of pounds in other ways will not give him a sufficient amount of money to enable him to provide the cruisers required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was anything that would make me not ask for a cruiser again it would be some of the statements made here this evening. I am in the unhappy position that apparently the Deputies who have spoken are in, that I do not know why these people left the island.  I never got any information about their leaving the island.  I had no complaints before they left the island, and I had no requisition for boats or gear or, in fact, any complaint that would lead me to believe that they were leaving the island for any particular reason. One can assume, if one likes, that they left because of the fact that illegal trawling had deprived the beds neighbouring Inistrahull of the fish that were available in days gone by.  That may or may not be the case.  I have a certain amount of reason to doubt that it is the case.  In fact, just around that particular part of the coast at the moment, in the beds where they would normally be fishing, there is a considerable amount of fishing for the Glenagad fishermen and I understand that they are doing fairly well in the long line fishing to which Deputy Carney referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> The people of Inistrahull have not, apparently, attempted to benefit by the fishing that is there at the moment and they cannot say that it is because they are not equipped. If they are not equipped, the position is that they have not taken the steps that fishermen normally take in order to get that equipment.  They have not applied to the Department for loans or gear or otherwise to enable them to follow that fishing. If one liked to be interested in the people of Inistrahull, one could remind the Dáil of things that occurred here four or five years ago, when the question of illegal trawling was a fairly ripe question in that area, when it was alleged that the people of Inistrahull were getting a handover from the poachers and that signals were being given to the foreign trawlers&mdash;British trawlers&mdash;that the Helga or the Muirchu was in the vicinity.  I may say that I never found that these allegations were entirely true, but such reports used to be commonly going about. The position anyhow is this, that the people of Inistrahull have left the island.  I am not satisfied that they left the island entirely because of illegal trawling.  In fact I am absolutely certain that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>There never was a complaint to the Department before they left the island.  They had reached the mainland and were on the mainland for some weeks before we heard about it. There has been no application for gear, and one does not really know what to do in a case like that.  I have tried to gather as much information as I can in connection with them.  I have received various reports. I received one report which was so fantastic, and in a sense one might say showed such hostility&mdash;or at least was inclined to ridicule the islanders&mdash;that I would not consider it.  I have another report which is so uninformative that it is rather useless.  I am trying to get some real information as to whether or not they have left the island for good, what is the position there with regard to the arable land in the island. <Col N="1426" /> whether they made use of it, whether there are any crops that could be taken off, whether it is a matter that could be dealt with by the Land Commission, and whether any inshore fishing they may do would help to solve the problem and take these people off the local rates.  If they are destitute the obvious thing for them is to approach the home assistance officer.</P>
    <P>I would like to feel that everything was being done to keep them from being a permanent charge on home assistance.  I have, as I have said, received reports but I am not publishing them.  I am trying to look for a true report of the position as far as these people are concerned. Deputy Carney and Deputy Cassidy raised the general question of illegal trawling.  There was given, I think, an answer to the question, just as it was given in an answer by myself the week before, that this question is under examination.  That may look like shelving the thing, but this is not such a very simple matter as may appear from the mere asking of questions here.  You are dealing first of all with different areas.  If I wished to shelve responsibility for collecting fines, in the sense that once my Department through the Fishery Board has caught a particular trawler offending, brought it before a court and has a fine imposed, there the responsibility of the Department ends.  I do not want to shelve it in that way because things are not so easy as it may appear when there is a question of a boat fishing in the three mile limit and in the by-law limit, which is extra territorial in most cases.  These things will eventually involve international agreement.  Legal people are notoriously slow about coming to an agreement on these matters. They are so ticklish that one is not surprised there should be hesitation in coming to an agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Minister, apart from the question of extra territorial waters, has power to collect fines for illegal fishing within territorial waters?  If he would say yea or nay I have nothing further to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question of which I would like to have notice. There are some distinctions as between territorial waters as applied to the British at the moment and applied to foreigners. You can arrest, say, a foreign lobster or cray fish fishing boat in territorial waters.  I am not quite sure whether that would apply to a British boat because the converse occurs.  You cannot apply extra territorial by-laws to the French boat but you can to the British boat.  In the past the by-laws of the British could not apply to persons who were not their nationals.  They could only apply to the British and Irish boats.  The by-laws apply extra territorially to British citizens, if you like.  These by-laws apply to these same persons nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we then to consider ourselves still British citizens, and that the same laws must apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into that. You cannot have it both ways.  If the extra territorial by-laws apply to the British then there are certain places where the British are free <Col N="1428" /> even within the three mile limit. We are trying to have the old things apply as far as the fishery laws are concerned, for that would save our fishing ground from British trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not inside territorial waters though extra territorial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Some by-laws apply well within the three mile limit and some up to twelve or fifteen miles, like the one off Dungarvan Harbour. As far as Inistrahull is concerned. I am in the same position as Deputy Carney and Deputy Cassidy.  They do not know why the people in Inistrahull left the island, and I am not in the position to know why they did, but I am satisfied that it is not because of illegal trawling, for if it was due to something of that kind we should have heard of it in my Department.  As I have said, we had no complaint before they left and no demand for anything in the nature of gear which would normally come from people who wanted help to enable them to fish.</P>
