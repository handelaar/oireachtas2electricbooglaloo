      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received any proposals for financing a de-rating scheme for agricultural land from the General Council of County Councils; if he considered these proposals feasible, and, if so, whether he will state when he intends putting them into operation, and, if not, whether he has prepared any alternative proposals, and when he intends putting these proposals before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>A deputation from the General Council of County Councils submitted to me in February last, in connection with the general question of relieving agricultural land from liability for local rates, certain proposals under which it was claimed that the necessary revenue could be raised, but I did not consider these proposals acceptable.  With regard to the last paragraph of the question I would refer the Deputy to my Budget statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that James Gilooly, of Ballygarvea, Rathowen, Co. Westmeath, applied twelve months ago for a revision of his old age pension on the question of means, and has not yet received a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed as to the facts.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gilooly made a claim to old age pension twelve months ago, and by decision of the Local Pension Committee, dated 10th August, 1928, he was granted a pension at the 7s. rate with effect as from 13th July, 1928, i.e., the date on which he attained the statutory age.  He did not appeal against this decision.</P>
      <P>On 26th February, 1929, he applied for an increase in the rate of his pension.  The question was investigated by the Pension Officer on 20th March and the papers were forwarded on 8th April to the Pension Committee.  The Pension Officer has not yet received notification of their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have rejected the petition presented to them under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the Ballaghsallagh Burn proposed Drainage District inasmuch as the estimated cost of the necessary works is less than £1,000 and the scheme is, therefore, too small to be economically carried out under the Act of 1925.  It is open to the occupiers, if they so desire, to present a fresh petition under the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Act, <Col N="1919" /> 1928, to have the works carried out by the County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás O Conaill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the school at Parteen, Limerick, is being carried on since July, 1927, in a temporary hut in unsuitable and insanitary surroundings detrimental alike to the health of pupils and teachers; if he will state what steps his Department has taken to see that the school house and teachers' residence demolished in the course of the Shannon Scheme operations is replaced by a suitable permanent structure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parteen school is at present conducted in a temporary building consisting of two rooms, which afford standard accommodation for 145 children.  The average attendance of pupils is between 80 and 90 units.  The rooms are well lighted and ventilated, and there is a heating stove in each room.</P>
      <P>From the information at my disposal the surroundings cannot be said to be unsuitable or insanitary. The building, which is on a raised foundation of concrete, stands in a field on ground of a higher level than the surrounding land, and there is a raised pathway from the public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sites for new schools are provided by the applicants for grants for building.  My Department has been in communication with the manager in this case with regard to proposals made by him for the choice of a plot for the erection of a school, but so far a suitable site has not been procured. <Col N="1921" /> This issue is still engaging attention.</P>
    <P>The teachers, who had occupied residential quarters in the old school building, the removal of which was necessitated by the Shannon Scheme works, have, I am advised, been offered compensation for disturbance.</P>
    <P>The provision of a new residence is a matter for the local parties.  It is not open to my Department in existing conditions to grant aid towards the cost of erecting teachers' residences, and I am not at the moment in a position to hold out any hope that a special grant may be made for the purpose in this instance.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware that it is only temporary, but, as the Deputy knows, there is a difficulty about a site.  A few sites were offered for our inspection, but none was quite suitable.  We are in communication with the manager and shall write to him again to see whether he is now in a position to offer a more suitable site.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is a fact that the schoolhouse and teachers' residence at Parteen, Limerick, were demolished in 1927, in the course of the Shannon Construction Works; that the principal teacher of the boys' school, who had up to that time a free residence as part of his emoluments, has had to take furnished rooms in Limerick City, three miles away, at the rate of £52 per annum; whether the Minister will state what compensation has been offered to this teacher for the great inconvenience <Col N="1923" /> and heavy expense he has been put to as a result of the operation of the Shannon Scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Dolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The boys' and girls' schoolhouse and the teachers' residences at Parteen, comprising one block of buildings, were acquired on 22nd June, 1927, under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, and temporary schoolhouse premises were erected in place of them.  I was advised that the free residence enjoyed by the male and female teachers was in no sense part of their emoluments and that the teachers had no interest in it which could strictly be treated as a matter for compensation under the Act. Nevertheless, for the disturbance caused in securing for themselves accommodation elsewhere, an offer was made to each of them of the sum of one hundred pounds, which was accepted by one of the two teachers concerned.  I am not now prepared to re-open the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Teachers have a right to a residence, but I am advised it is only an accidental perquisite to a teacher to have a house.  All the teachers are not entitled to it and legally they have no such right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to discuss the question of what all teachers are entitled to legally. However, the fact is that this teacher had a free residence as part of his emoluments since 1914 until the Shannon Scheme destroyed his house.

    <P>The Deputy is aware that rates levied for the service of a particular financial year are collectable within that year.  Leitrim has been the most backward county in the country in the collection of rates.  Collectors have been slack and dilatory with the result that nearly 40 per cent. of last year's rates remains outstanding. The general matter has been under prolonged review and discussion with the County Council, and the County Council has now been directed to dismiss any collector who had not fully accounted for his warrant by the 30th June, 1929.</P>
    <P>Full consideration has been given to the matter raised in the last part of the Deputy's question.  Rates represent but a relatively small proportion of a farmer's necessary outgoings. There is no evidence to show that extreme hardship is imposed on Leitrim farmers by causing them to pay their rates.  I am satisfied that where rates are not duly collected hardship is caused to many hardworking persons who, having paid their rates at the proper time, are, in addition, burdened with the cost of interest on avoidable overdrafts due to the defaulters. Furthermore, where through lack of energy on the part of rate collectors and their own improvidence, persons are allowed to fall into arrears with their rates they find it difficult later to meet payments that must inevitably be made.  When a local authority has struck the rate which it considers necessary for the carrying on of its administration it is, in my opinion, not only a matter of public importance, but also a matter of personal importance to all ratepayers that the machinery established for the collection of that rate should operate punctually and effectively.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that reply, I should like to know if in fixing the period, the 30th June, the Minister consulted the county council as to the advisability of issuing an order for the collection of all arrears within that period?</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy means by consulting the county council.  The matter has been the subject of prolonged discussion between my Department and the county council, and already, I think, either two or three rate collectors have been dismissed.  If I could get the county council to view the matter from my point of view or from the point of view of my Department, a certain number of people at present rate collectors would be dismissed now.  The matter has been discussed and, while I am not in a position to say that the county council has agreed to dispense with all rate collectors who do not close their warrants by 30th June next, I have discussed the matter with the chairman of the county council, and I am satisfied that the interests of the ratepayers in Leitrim will not be served except the rate collectors who do not close their warrants by 30th June are dismissed, and it is my intention to see, as far as I can, that rate collectors who do not close their warrants by that date will be dismissed.</P>

      <P>Such opinion as the chairman of the county council has in this matter no doubt he will express himself in the proper place, but I want the Deputy to understand that I did personally discuss the matter with the chairman, and my decision has been taken in the light of everything the chairman has had to say, and in the light of knowledge of the discussions at the county council.  The action has <Col N="1928" /> been very fully considered and has been under review for a very long time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that as a result of the recent order issued by the British Ministry of Agriculture, under which British and Northern Ireland eggs are unstamped, imported eggs (including Saorstát eggs) must be stamped; whether as a result of this order eggs are being sold on the Saorstát side of the Border at about threepence per dozen less than on <Col N="1932" /> the Northern side; further, whether he is aware that this discrepancy in price means a serious loss to Saorstát farmers, and whether the Minister will state what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. It was anticipated that the immediate effect of the Order in question would be to depress the price of all stamped eggs in British and Northern Ireland markets, but I am informed that, although somewhat higher prices have been given for first quality non-stamped eggs in Northern Ireland as compared with the general run of prices paid for stamped Free State eggs, there are no grounds for believing that non-stamped eggs are generally realising to the extent indicated in the question a price in excess of that obtaining for Free State eggs.</P>
      <P>Even if Free State eggs are not securing on British markets prices quite as high as those given for unstamped eggs, they command a higher price than any other stamped eggs. I am satisfied that as time goes on, and the quality of stamped Free State eggs comes to be appreciated, the margin of price between these eggs and unstamped eggs will decrease, and that the margin between Free State eggs and other stamped eggs will increase.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances no present action seems called for, but undoubtedly the introduction of the British Order renders more imperative than ever the necessity for strict observance by exporters of the requirements of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act and the Regulations made under it.  I may add that I have had for some time under consideration the necessity of asking for additional legislative powers with a view to further raising the standard of eggs exported from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Resolution was before the House I endeavoured to extract from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government certain information relative to the Road Fund and road expenditure, in order to enable us to make up our minds whether or not this Resolution should receive our support.  We did not succeed in getting that information.  I have read very carefully the speeches which were made by the Minister for Finance in proposing the Resolution, and by the Minister for Local Government in replying to it, and I have been unable to discover any case whatever advanced by either of them for this additional tax.  It is possible, in fact it is probable, that there is a good case for the tax, but if there is we have not heard it.  I <Col N="1943" /> do not know if other Deputies are interested, in the matter and have taken the trouble of reading the Ministers' speeches; but, if they have, I am sure they are in the same position as I am.  We have received no indication whatever as to the arguments which induced the Government to propose this additional impost on omnibuses.  The Minister for Finance stated that up to the present buses have paid something like 4.6 per cent. of the revenue of the Road Fund.  It is very difficult to form a conclusion as to what should be a fair contribution. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I feel certain that 4.6 or 5 per cent. is far too little.&rdquo;  He did not, however, give us the data which made him feel so certain that 4.6 per cent. or 5 per cent. was far too little.  Later on, he stated that having regard to the fact that the road has to be made and maintained at a particular standard largely for the buses, and that a bus containing twenty seats or thereabouts is not paying too much when it pays £100 per year for the use of the roads, for making a profit, as its contribution towards the maintenance of the roads. Again, Deputies will notice that the Minister for Finance was merely stating his own impression, without producing any facts or any information to substantiate it.  The Minister for Local Government, in his speech, was no more informative. The kernel of it is contained in the one sentence, that it is quite clear that the buses ought to pay more than they are paying at present.  If it is quite clear, I suggest that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for Local Government has done anything to make it clear. We will, no doubt, be discussing this question in relation to the whole question of financial policy on the Finance Bill; but, before it falls to us to do that, we would like very much to hear from some responsible Minister the reasons which induced the Executive Council to propose this Resolution to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They must have had some reason. It is to be presumed that no responsible <Col N="1944" /> Government would come to the Dáil with the proposal to increase a particular tax by 150 per cent. without having some reason for doing it. But if they have a reason, they are keeping it very secret.  They have done nothing to pass on information concerning that reason to the House. The Minister for Finance dealt briefly with the position of the Road Fund.  He said: &ldquo;We&rdquo;&mdash;presumably referring to the Government&mdash;&ldquo;are satisfied that the roads cannot be maintained at the standard at which they should be maintained, especially having regard to the increased number of vehicles and the present revenue of the Road Fund.&rdquo; We would judge from these remarks that it is the view of the Minister that the present revenue of the Road Fund is inadequate to provide the annual cost of road maintenance and construction.  Is it the view of the Government that this additional tax on omnibuses will increase the revenue of the Road Fund sufficiently to make it adequate for that purpose? If the additional £45,000 which it is hoped to secure from omnibuses will not make the Road Fund revenue adequate for that purpose, then the Minister for Finance is open to censure in so far as he brought only the one proposal before the House.  If, to his knowledge, that Fund is inadequate to maintain the roads in a proper state, and if it is his opinion that the additional revenue which this tax will produce will not be sufficient to make it adequate, then I think he is open to the charge of neglecting his duty in not making better provision to increase the Road Fund revenue.  If it is a fact that the money at the disposal of the road-making authorities is not such as to maintain the roads which have been constructed at great cost, then the money expended on the roads will very largely be wasted.</P>
    <P>We are keenly concerned that whatever benefit has been derived from the expenditure of large sums on road construction should not now be lost by reason of the fact that the sum sufficient to maintain them is inadequate. The Minister for Finance gave the House the impression that <Col N="1945" /> the tax upon vehicles utilising the roads should be so graded as to provide that each class of vehicle would pay its share of the cost of road maintenance and road construction in proportion to the damage that it did to the roads.  The Minister for Local Government appears to take an entirely different view.  He said: &ldquo;I do not agree with the argument that the contribution which the bus traffic should make to the Road Fund should be based entirely on the extent of the damage, or even in great part upon the consideration of the extent of the damage.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister for Local Government to amplify that remark.  Is it intended that road vehicles should be taxed so as to produce a larger revenue than the Road Fund actually requires?  Is it intended that there should be every year in the Road Fund a surplus not required for road maintenance and construction which would be used for some other purpose, possibly for the relief of general taxation?  Is it intended that taxation upon the pleasure car should be relieved at the expense of the public service vehicle?  When the Minister for Local Government tells us that the taxation upon the omnibus should bear no relation, or very little relation, to the damage the vehicle does to the roads, we want to be quite clear as to what he means.  If it is to bear no relation to the damage it does to the roads, what is it to bear relation to?  It would be a most undesirable precedent to tax a public service vehicle for the benefit of the pleasure car.  It would also, I think, be a most undesirable precedent to tax road transport for the purpose of relieving taxation.  If it is not the intention of the Government to take either of these courses, we would like to know what the Minister meant when he made that remark.</P>
    <P>The whole question of road maintenance and construction, and the cost of it, appears to be very largely one of speculation.  The Minister for Local Government told us that neither he nor his financial advisers found themselves in a position to state explicitly the amount of <Col N="1946" /> damage buses do to the roads.  Apparently, however, they have sufficient information to make a guess, even if it is a wild guess, to the effect that they have been doing 150 per cent. more than they have been paying for.  Is that a wild guess or merely a shot in the dark?  Is it based on any information available for the technical advisers of the Minister? If so, what is that information?  So far it has not been placed before us.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on the general Resolutions, I asked the Minister for Finance if the proposed increased tax on buses was intended in any way to be a solution of what is called the transport problem, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The Minister for Local Government appeared to imply that this tax upon buses has a very definite relation to the railway position.  He referred to the fact that the railway company have to maintain a permanent way and pay rates in respect of their undertakings.  He said: &ldquo;We cannot leave out the analogy completely that we have a very important transport system all over the country between the bus traffic and the railways and tramways in respect of the roads over which they run.&rdquo;  If this tax is imposed on buses, not because their present payments to the Road Fund bear no relation to the damage they do, but in order to increase the difficulties of the buses in competing with the railways, then we must take it that it is, in part at any rate, some attempt to solve the transport problem.  If the Minister for Local Government intended us to understand, as I think he did, that this additional impost is made in order to force the buses to increase fares and then reduce their effectiveness in competition with the railways, we are opposed to it.  If it is the Government solution of the transport problem as such, it is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>We have undoubtedly a very serious position.  We have the two forms of transport in competition, damaging each other and doing very little which could not be otherwise attained.  We recognise the buses offer a very useful public service&mdash;a service which we do not <Col N="1947" /> wish to see the country deprived of. If the effect of this tax is intended to bring about a lessening of the bus facilities for the benefit of the railway shareholders, then we are against it.  But if it is merely intended, as the Minister for Finance implied, to increase the bus contribution to the Road Fund in order to bring it more into line with the damage buses do to the roads, then we are for it.  The Minister for Local Government said that was not the purpose of the tax.  There appears to be a direct contradiction between the two Ministers in this matter.  We want to get the whole position clarified.  It has not been clarified as yet for us, although both Ministers spoke for some time when this Resolution was before us.  It does seem that the additional tax to be imposed is merely a shot in the dark.  The Government find themselves faced with an intricate transport problem, and, unable to solve it, they put this impost on in the hope that in some mysterious manner it will simplify the problem so as to enable them to get through with it.  We think if that is so that it is a most undesirable way of doing business.  I must say that it is my opinion, although I have no information with which to back it up, that the buses have not in the past contributed to the Road Fund the amount that they should contribute. I want to make it clear that that is merely a guess on my part.  If I have that information that the buses are not contributing their fair proportion to the Road Fund, then I intend to support this Resolution. That is to say, if I have the information that this tax is primarily for the purpose of increasing the revenue of the Road Fund, I will support the Resolution.</P>
    <P>If we receive from either of the Ministers an indication that the Resolution is not primarily intended for that, but that there is some other intention, then we must have that information if for no other reason than to force the Government to face up to their responsibilities in this matter of transport.  I would like to <Col N="1948" /> suggest to the Minister for Finance some modification of the tax which would ease the burdens upon omnibus proprietors without decreasing the revenue of the Road Fund.  I suggest that the tax could be paid monthly instead of quarterly, as at present, and modified in such a way as to prevent any diminution in the Road Fund revenue.  That can easily be done.  The Minister said that the additional rates of duty increased the tax by 150 per cent.  In fact it increased it much more, because the omnibus companies register their vehicles for only three months, and when they do that they have to pay an additional 20 per cent. duty. These companies receive their revenue from day to day in the amounts received for fares.  The fact that they receive their revenue in that form makes it difficult for them to pay large sums at extended periods.  It would be much easier for them to pay a small sum monthly.  If that sum was so fixed as to prevent any loss to the Road Fund it would be a great benefit to them without conferring any hardship upon the road-making authorities.</P>
    <P>These buses frequently break down and it takes practically a month to get them into running order again. If this tax were payable monthly instead of quarterly it would enable the proprietor of a broken-down bus to exempt himself from paying the duty for a month, while the bus would be lying in his garage and doing no damage to the roads.  When the bus is lying in the proprietor's garage it does not do any damage to the roads, and the fact, therefore, that no duty was being paid upon it for that period would make no difference to the road authorities.  Other companies running buses generally keep one or two spare buses for maintenance of their service when one of the buses on the road breaks down.  If the duty were payable monthly it would enable them to license one of these buses for a period during which the broken-down bus was being repaired, and cease paying the duty when it was possible for them to take that bus off the road again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> I do not think that the imposition of a monthly instead of a quarterly tax would involve very much increased cost in administration.  It would involve the printing of different coloured discs in order to enable the Gárda Síochána to know whether the licence was paid or not.  Notice would have to be sent to the Gárda Síochána.  It would involve but very little extra clerical work, and the increased cost in administration service would be so small as to be practically negligible.  I do not know if any representation has been made to the Minister for Finance by the Bus Owners' Association in this matter.  If so the Minister has had an opportunity of considering it, and an opportunity of making up his mind on the matter.  If the Bus Owners have not already made representations in the matter, I would like if the Minister would consider it between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.  I think that certainly by doing this you would be conferring some benefit upon bus owners and at the same time do no damage to the Road Fund.  I would not put forward the suggestion if it would result in any diminution to the revenue of the Road Fund.  We are anxious to see that enough money will be made available to maintain the roads that have been constructed.  Otherwise, if enough money were not available, it would be a waste.  If the amount paid monthly were graded so as to ensure that it would be equal to the quarterly payment plus whatever interest would accrue to the Road Fund from these quarterly payments, then there would be no loss to the Road Fund. I would like the Minister to consider that.  I would like him also to say why this Resolution was introduced and the information upon which the Government introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to carry one step further the request which has been made by Deputy Lemass for information as to the policy behind this Resolution.  This tax has rather a curious history.  It is a tax in substitution for a tax which was announced at a party meeting by the <Col N="1950" /> Minister for Finance.  That was a tax which was to have been introduced a considerable time ago, and in advance of the Budget.  The particular tax which was then announced has apparently gone by the board.  Certainly the suggestion in that particular case was that there was some basis of calculation behind the actual figures of the tax that it was proposed to impose.  But more curiously, and a matter of more importance in my opinion, the Minister said something of another nature. He said that this tax which was then suggested was part of a policy, and he alluded to the fact that the buses were to some extent interfering with the financial position of the country towns.  He examined that proposition, and he said that it was not introduced primarily for that purpose. That is what I want to stress: that here there was a tax announced before the Budget, and announced as part of a policy, and the policy in relation to that was not and has not been disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we knew what the policy was we would be in a position to consider this tax in an entirely different way.  We might disapprove of the policy and disapprove of the tax, or any substitute for it, on account of the fact that we disapprove of the policy.  Or we might approve of the policy and be anxious to meet the Minister as far as possible in relation to the tax, which possibly might not be imposed in the way that we might think best.  It is perfectly obvious that unless and until the Minister does disclose his hand in this matter we are not in a position to examine usefully this or any other tax which the Minister may attempt to impose.  What is perfectly obvious at the present moment is that there is not in the possession of the Minister any reliable information on which he is prepared to stand as a basis of taxation.  I may be wrong.  I am not speaking now in any critical sense. If the Minister has had investigations made, and has had a solid basis of scientific examination upon which to create this tax, let him give it to us. There is a very large amount of information <Col N="1951" /> in relation to this question which has been collected in France, Germany, Sweden and America. There is some very elaborate and valuable information in the possession of the American Bureau, and also in the technical department of Germany and Sweden.  Has that information been co-ordinated by the Minister's Department, and was the original estimate of one penny per mile based on that information or was it a pure guess?  We are entitled to know.  I understand that technically qualified men in Ireland have volunteered, if given facilities by the Minister for Local Government, to co-ordinate this information and to make experiments in their own time. Has the Minister taken advantage of that offer, or has any substituted activity by his own Department been put in its place?</P>
    <P>Personally I have the highest opinion of the Road Board Branch of his Department.  It is, I think, in the hands of people who desire to construct good roads.  I had, however, the privilege of hearing a discussion at the Engineers' Society in Dublin on this question in which the representative of the Ministry dealing with roads gave such information as apparently was in his possession as to how that estimate was formed. I have some knowledge of the subject. I certainly have been interested in it, and I say that that information was not sufficient upon which to base this tax.  What is the policy of the Government of which this tax is a part?  We are entitled to know that.  It looks to me as if the policy is that adumbrated by Deputy Lemass&mdash;a policy of pro-railway as against road transport.  It seems to me to be an attempt to produce an artificial condition preferential to the railways as compared with the buses until the competition, which is non-railway competition on the roads, has been eliminated.  If that is the policy, let the Minister declare it. Let him have the courage which the Minister for Industry and Commerce had when he declared that it was his policy to make the Great Southern Railway shares a valuable security <Col N="1952" /> again in this country.  If that is his policy let him declare it, but certainly we are not entitled to have that sort of thing done without its being exposed to the House.  Since the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Cork in relation to this matter, a very excellent and able speech, which was delivered to a University in the spirit in which in my opinion a speech to a University should be delivered, these three things have happened: (1) £75,000 for rates has been taken off the railway companies and transferred to the ordinary community; (2) the Minister for Local Government has intervened to prevent local councils from appealing against that particular manoeuvre; and (3) this tax has been put on which gives a preference to the railway companies as distinct from the buses.  That policy may be entirely right.  It may be entirely wrong; but what is unquestionable is that a policy of that kind, which is undeclared, is indefensible.  We must know what they are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I believe that the buses are performing a very valuable service. I see the real and serious danger in this country of breaking down isolations which have been largely our protection, the isolations under which the little country towns have been able to continue to exist, and in the absence of which it is probable that these towns will cease to exist before we have an opportunity of putting in substitution for them something which will be as valuable as themselves.  When the Minister plays around with bus taxation he is playing round with a very serious problem.  He is disturbing a very important pool.  His actions may have reactions of a great and vital character, and before the Minister is allowed to impose this, or any other, tax as part of such policy, that policy should be clearly declared to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I was somewhat surprised at the speech of Deputy Flinn in regard to the taxation of buses, more especially when he referred to the question of preferential <Col N="1953" /> treatment of railways.  As Deputy Lemass mentioned, I do not believe that the Minister intended that that particular tax should go towards the solution of the transport problem.  I do not believe that it will solve it.  I would not like it to go out from this House that the impression is that the particular tax on buses is going to give preferential treatment to railways.  The position is that in every county through which a railway runs it has to pay a certain amount of taxation, part of which goes towards the upkeep of the roads.  The railways do not use the roads.  They have to pay for the upkeep of their permanent way and railway stations, and for the upkeep of roads over which their greatest competitors, the bus companies, run their buses in opposition to the railways.  Deputy Flinn also referred to the fact that some time ago there was a re-valuation of railway property&mdash;in my opinion that was quite proper&mdash;and that re-valuation meant a reduction to a certain extent of the amount of money to be spent on roads.  It meant that in future the amount of money to be expended on roads would be less than previously.  In addition, if we are to keep up the roads we should pay a living rate of wages to the workers on those roads.  In my constituency I know they are not paying it.  I believe that the buses should be called upon to pay bigger taxation than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for some bus owners to say that they are not in a position to pay the tax.  Let us examine the position.  Go outside the Saorstát and examine it.  Some time ago, in the Six Counties, on the borders of Donegal, we had a firm, the Catherwood Bus Company, which also operates in Dublin, taking over the buses from the Corporation of Derry and undertaking for a number of years to pay 50 per cent. of their net profits.  I put it to the House, and to Deputy Flinn especially, that if the buses are in such a position that they are unable to bear this tax, and if, as Deputy Lemass suggested, the buses are going to be crushed out of existence, how is it <Col N="1954" /> that one bus company in one city can afford to pay 50 per cent. of their net profits to the Corporation?  Deputy Flinn also mentioned the fact that the buses give valuable service to the community.  I agree, but I would again point out that the buses are working at an advantage compared with the railways.  In the City of Dublin you have employees of bus companies working for 20/- for a 56- hour week.</P>
    <P>Another fact with which the Co. Councils in the Border area have to contend is that in Donegal, for instance, there are buses coming from the Six County area into the Saorstát which are not contributing their quota to the Road Fund.  That is one thing which I would like the Minister to take into consideration. When the Minister is replying I would like to hear from him whether he proposes to take any action in the case of the particular firm, Catherwood and Co., who have taken over the buses in Derry, and who are probably going to make Derry a jumping-off ground to compete in the Saorstát against the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and the Donegal Railway Company. Probably with these buses they will operate in Co. Donegal and throw a lot of railway employees out of employment.  Is that firm going to be made to pay its proper contribution as far as the Co. Council and the Road Fund are concerned?  I would like to hear from the Minister if he has given any consideration to the problem of buses coming from the Six County area into the Saorstát, buses coming from Belfast to Dublin or from Derry to Donegal.  My own impression is that the buses are getting off very lightly with this tax, and that the bus owners themselves will agree that they are getting off lightly.  I thought that the Minister was going to be more severe in his taxation.  I was glad to gather from what he said to Deputy Lemass that he does not look upon this tax as a solution of the transport problem.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe it is only tinkering with the problem, and I hope that the Minister, in conjunction with the Executive Council, will <Col N="1955" /> give that consideration to the transport problem that it deserves.  At present a chaotic condition of affairs exists.  I quite agree that buses are very valuable to act as feeders to the railway companies in villages in which the railway companies have no stations.  Another factor which has to be considered is that the bus traffic in the Border counties inflicts a serious hardship on shopkeepers in villages and in outlying areas.  In places like Buncrana you have the people who formerly shopped there travelling by bus to Derry, with the result that they are spending their money outside the Saorstát.  The buses are not paying for the great damage they cause to the roads, and I believe they should be made pay for it.  Another matter to which the Minister should have given consideration is that lorries with solid tyres cause heavy damage to the roads.  I think the Minister should have imposed a higher taxation on them in addition to the proposed taxation on buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three parties to my mind concerned in this matter &mdash;the proprietors of the railways, the proprietors of motor buses, and the general public, in other words, the rate-paying public.  I have to compliment the Minister on taking this step, which is a step in the right direction, and a step which, to my mind, should have been taken long since.  As everybody is aware, a considerable amount of money has been expended on the construction of our roads.  We had not heard of motor buses until these roads were constructed. The motor buses immediately afterwards came on the scene. Unlike the railways, the buses have only to pay to a very slight extent for the roads which they use, though I might again say that this is a matter of one band of shareholders playing against another band&mdash;the shareholders of the railway companies on the one side and those of the motor bus companies on the other. The rate-paying public stand in between these two interests, who are out to make the best they can out of <Col N="1956" /> the bargain and make the rate-paying public bear the burden.  The position of the railway companies, however, is different to that of the proprietors of the motor buses.  When a railway company wishes to build a railway it has to seek special legislation, to acquire land and pay a price for it, and then it has to construct the railway and bear the cost of that. That is a very important consideration, to my mind, as contrasted with the position of the proprietors of buses, who came on the scene, not to construct roads, but at a time when these roads were already constructed at the expense of the general public. When the general public has to bear that expense, I think it is only quite reasonable and businesslike, and that it does not at all inflict an injustice on the bus companies, that the Minister should come forward and say: &ldquo;If you are using these roads, which have been constructed at the expense of the rates, it is only fair that you should contribute something reasonable to the upkeep of the roads.&rdquo;  I think that that is a businesslike and reasonable proposition.  I cannot imagine that Deputy Flinn was quite serious in the suggestion that it is not a business proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the people who have to contribute these rates are amongst the poorest section of the community. Of course, other people who can afford to pay are also amongst the contributors, but in the congested counties, such as Mayo, which I represent, where I suppose the average valuation of the holdings would be about £5, poor people form the bulk of those who have to pay the rates.  When one considers the mileage of roads to be maintained by the people in a county such as Mayo or Galway, is it unreasonable to say that buses, which come in to use roads upon which upwards of £2,000,000 has been expended, ought to contribute towards the maintenance of these roads?  I admit that buses afford a convenience and a certain accommodation to the public, but at the same time they are sometimes a great danger to the public, as is proved by the number of fatal accidents that occur from time to <Col N="1957" /> time.  That is a question that will have to be considered at a later date. Notwithstanding the great convenience that the buses afford the public, there is one section of the public which still requires to be accommodated. The Minister has had complaints from day to day from people living in backward districts who have to contribute to the maintenance of roads and who have not yet received the consideration to which they are entitled.  These people live in mountainous districts where the roads have not been made.  They are several miles removed from the roads over which motor buses travel, but, notwithstanding that, they have to contribute to the maintenance of these roads.  I think it is only reasonable that the position of such people should be taken into account.  It is not as public benefactors that the proprietors of these buses have come into these counties.  I admit that we have not very many public benefactors in this country, but these companies certainly cannot claim to be public benefactors.  Their idea is to make the best use of their opportunities and turn the services placed at their disposal to the best account. They give a certain accommodation to the general public, no doubt, but it was not for the benefit of the public that they extended their services to these areas.  It was for the benefit of themselves and their shareholders. The position is that you have the shareholders of the railway company on one side and the shareholders of the buses on the other. The general public has to pay for the upkeep of the roads, both the rural roads and the main roads.  The general public are paying for the maintenance of the roads used by the buses while, up to the present, the buses have contributed practically nothing.  There are people in mountainous districts who are twenty, thirty or forty miles away from the roads used by the buses and who derive no benefit from them.  These people, however, have to pay for the maintenance of the roads. Judging from what I see from day to day in the different counties through which I pass, <Col N="1958" /> it will be utterly impossible for the ratepayers to maintain their position if the buses do not contribute a reasonable share for the maintenance of the roads.</P>
    <P>Personally I would prefer that a tax should have been put on petrol. To my mind that would have been the most equitable way of dealing with the matter, and would provide the real solution of the problem.  If you put a tax on petrol, every motor user will have to contribute his fair share for the maintenance of the roads for the use made of them.  If a man has a car lying up for six days of the week he will only use so many gallons of petrol, but will pay for the use he makes of the roads. On the other hand, the man who has his car running on the seven days of the week will also have to pay his fair share for the use he is making of the roads.  To my mind that would be a practical way of making every individual using the roads contribute his fair share to the maintenance. This tax is all right in its own way, but I should like to hear from the Minister something definite as to how it is going to be allocated. I understand it is to be paid into the Road Fund, but I should like to know what is in the Minister's mind as to how it will be allocated.  I think it was Deputy Flinn insinuated that there was some other method in the Minister's mind with regard to a mileage tax.  A mileage tax, to my mind, would be very fair, inasmuch as every bus would have to account for the mileage which it travelled in certain counties, and the tax on that mileage would be placed to the credit of the counties concerned and be utilised for the maintenance of the roads within those counties.  That would be a practical and fair way of using the tax, either that or a tax on petrol.  I do not know why the Minister is so shy about tackling this question of a tax on petrol as a solution of the problem.  There may be some difficulty about a tax on petrol that I am not capable of understanding, or that other Deputies may not understand, but personally I fail to see any reason why a tax on petrol would not be a fair and <Col N="1959" /> equitable way of compelling road users to contribute their fair share for the maintenance of the roads.  I realise that the buses are a great convenience to the public, but they are also a source of great expense in the way of taxation for road maintenance, as the ratepayers have to maintain the roads.  That is a consideration that I am sure the Minister will keep before his mind, and I expect that he will do his best to protect the interests of the public in this matter.  We must not forget that railways are also a great convenience to the public.  The buses undoubtedly have had one good effect in bringing down railway rates, and that has been a great boon to the public.  If the buses did nothing but that, I would say that that is something accomplished. But if the two services can be maintained, and each is made to do its duty to the public in a fair and equitable way, then the public will have no reason to grumble; but we must try and get the best value we can out of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to make some differentiation between the buses that run parallel with the railway line and compete directly with the railways and those buses serving outside districts where there is no railway.  The latter buses are of far greater benefit to the public.  I should, therefore, like to know if it would be possible to let these buses off more lightly than the others.  It may not be easy to do that, but I consider that the buses serving the outlying districts are deserving of more consideration than the others.  With reference to the point made by Deputy Cassidy, that solid-tyred vehicles do more damage than pneumatic-tyred ones, I think some effort should be made to levy the tax in proportion to the damage done.  Vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres, particularly buses, principally use the tarred roads. The other vehicles do a lot of travelling on the second and third-class roads which are made of waterbound macadam.  I have seen such <Col N="1960" /> roads practically destroyed in a few weeks as a result of these vehicles passing over them constantly.  Whatever tax is put on them will be no compensation for the damage done. If they were confined to the tarred roads it would not be so bad, but it is impossible to keep the waterbound macadam roads over which they run.  Some effort should be made to discriminate against that class of vehicle.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of speed.  The damage done by a vehicle is in proportion to the speed at which it travels.  We all know that buses which are supposed not to exceed twenty miles per hour constantly exceed that limit, and occasionally do up to forty miles per hour.  The damage that can be done by a heavily-laden bus travelling at thirty miles an hour over any road is considerable and, therefore, some effort should be made to prevent speeding.  Not alone is it bad for the roads, but it is very dangerous for the public&mdash;not only for the pedestrians, but for the passengers.  If the buses were limited to twenty miles per hour, I know it would interfere with them very much, as they would not be able to compete with the railways, but, until such time as we get special roads for them, I think every effort should be made to curtail the speed.</P>

      <P>I intended to support this Resolution.  I do not think the Minister has gone far enough in taxing the buses.  All county councils throughout the country will tell you that they do not believe that buses are paying enough towards the maintenance of the roads.  The county councils have been at a loss in rates through reduction of rates on railway property varying from £1,500 to £3,000 or £4,000 in each county. Are the county councils to be at a loss both through the railways and the buses?  I say no.  I think the Minister was very wise in bringing in this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county councils are continually asking for grants from the Road Fund to meet the cost of maintenance. I ask Deputies how can they get any grants when there is no <Col N="1961" /> money in the Fund.  Therefore I intend to support this Resolution and I hope that when next year comes round there will be further and higher taxes put upon the buses.  Of course, we know the buses are of great benefit to the country districts. That is one thing.  But another thing we know is that they are a great source of loss.  Deputy Cassidy gave us an instance of the loss of trade due to buses from the Six Counties trading in the Saorstát. The same applies to traders in the country towns in Ireland.  They are at a loss through the convenience which the bus affords in bringing their customers to Dublin.  I am not going to say too much in their favour but I think the equity of this side of the question should be considered. I hope this Resolution will receive the support of all Deputies in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, believe that buses should be taxed.  The county councils are grumbling at the large amount the ratepayers have to pay as a consequence of the buses travelling over the roads.  Buses do a lot of damage to the small towns, in bringing customers from them into the cities.  After all, the small towns and the rural districts must be catered for as well as the cities.  I do not agree with Deputy Davis that the tax should be put upon petrol. Petrol is used for a great many services as well as road service.  Petrol is used for agricultural purposes, supplying motive power for engines pumping water and it is used for aeroplanes and a number of other services.  It would be inequitable, in my view, to tax petrol instead of buses.  Let us face up to the issue and find the prisoner guilty.  The buses are really the cause of the heavy road taxes.  We shall be told, of course, that they are a great convenience to the poor who desire to travel.  So they are, but sometimes they are an awful danger.  I should like to see the speed of the buses curtailed a bit although, sometimes, one thinks they are not travelling half fast enough if one wants to catch a train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not know, until recently, <Col N="1962" /> how hard it is for any Government or any Minister, carrying on the government of the country, to please everybody.  Some people like myself will want to tax buses because they are the real culprits as far as the roads are concerned.  Others want to tax petrol.  I believe it is our duty on this occasion to stand by the Minister for Finance and to vote for the taxation as prescribed by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to vote against this proposal for the reason that I think, after listening to the Minister, that what he has done in putting this tax on buses is a sort of experiment and that the question will be dealt with in a larger way later on.  I did not gather from him, as some Deputies suggested, that it was out of spite towards the buses that this tax was put on.  Motor traffic has come to stay, and the bus has come to stay, and one might as well try to stem the incoming tide as to prevent them going on.  The only thing that can be done is to see that the traffic on the roads contributes an equitable share to the upkeep of the roads.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Davis that a tax on petrol is a fairer way of dealing with the question than a tax on buses.  It would help the motor trade and it would be a more equitable tax.  The argument is used very often: Why should a person who is only using his car, for instance, once or twice a week pay the same tax as a person whose car is on the road every day?  We would arrive, I think, at a more equitable conclusion if the tax were put on petrol in some proportion so that the more that lorries or buses or motors are on the road the more tax they will pay.  Deputy Daly pointed out that there would be a difficulty in regard to agriculture if there was a tax on petrol.  I do not see any difficulty whatever.  It is a road tax and it would be only collectable from persons using the roads.  There is a precedent, because in war time there was a rebate given on petrol used for agricultural purposes.  There is no difficulty whatever in that matter <Col N="1963" /> except that there would be a little cost for collection.</P>
      <P>Another thing militates against the farming community in this respect: There may be some farmers at present who find it a great convenience to have a Ford car.  Cars rapidly wear out and become unfit for passenger work.  I know many farmers who would find it very convenient if they were able to put a lorry body upon the Ford chassis when the car wore out. They are prevented from doing that now, because if they got another car they would have to pay two taxes, whereas if the tax was on petrol they would pay only in proportion as they used the roads.  I think it is a matter for future consideration as to how this tax should be adjusted.  Even if other countries have not put the tax exclusively on petrol, it is not beyond the power of the Minister in this country to see that those who wear the roads most should pay the most for their use.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies probably want to find what is the policy in putting on this tax, and in looking for policy in the matter they seem to want to emphasise certain differences here and there as between the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than to make any attempt to see, in a broad way, what our policy is in the matter. Naturally, there is more than one aspect of road taxation to be taken into consideration, and, as far as I am concerned, my policy in this matter, and what I am particularly keeping in mind, is in the first place to see that money is available to provide us with roads, and in the second place to see that the responsibility for providing that money is fixed, as far as we can fix it, on the proper shoulders.  There is not necessarily any difference as regards my policy, because I will expound it in these particular terms.  There is not necessarily any difference when the Minister for Finance looks at it from <Col N="1964" /> another point of view and states certain aspects of it from his point of view, or when the Minister for Industry and Commerce looks at it with the railways in mind.  The position, as far as it shows itself up to me, is this.  In the year 1913-14 there was spent on the roads £670,960 from rates; there was spent some money more than that, in terms of loans and other matters like that for roads, but there was spent in the upkeep and maintenance of roads £670,000.  In the twelve years there was £637,000 spent from the Road Fund for the whole of the 32 counties, so that less than £50,000 a year would have been spent on roads together with what came from the rates at that particular time.  That was only fifteen years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During last year there was £940,000 spent from rates alone, and it is proposed to spend this year from rates £1,040,000.  That represents an increase of 58 per cent. of the expenditure from the rates over the moneys that came in in the year 1913-14.  Last year there was only 42 per cent., or £940,000, spent from rates on the roads, so that it is anticipated that during the year that we are now in there will be more money spent on roads from rates, the comparison with 1913-14 being 42 per cent. increase last year and 58 per cent. increase this year. The reason for the increase this year is whereas the Executive Council laid down as a policy a few years ago, with regard to the share of the responsibility for maintaining roads that might be expected reasonably to remain on the taxpayer, that 50 per cent. increase might be expected to remain as the responsibility of the local ratepayer there were a certain number of counties which, during the last couple of years, evaded that responsibility.  Some of them brought down their expenditure on roads to, say, 20 per cent., or perhaps a little less for 1913-14.  That, in our opinion, was unjust to the road situation and did not fit in with our views as to the responsibility that the ratepayers should shoulder. There has been pressure exerted through my Department on local <Col N="1965" /> bodies to see that the amount of money that will be spent by them will be nearer the 50 per cent. increase over 1913-14 than some of them have been spending.</P>
    <P>As I say, when the whole of the county councils are taken into consideration they will spend this year 58 per cent. more than they spent in 1913-14.  Cork has been spoken of here, and Mayo and Waterford have been spoken of here.  Cork has proposed to spend 66 per cent., Mayo has proposed to spend 63 per cent., and Waterford has proposed to spend 95 per cent., whereas in some counties, like Galway, 126 per cent. more than 1913-14 is necessary in order to deal with the road situation. I have said that, in my opinion, it will be necessary to assist certain local bodies, at any rate to a greater extent than they are being assisted from the Road Fund, and I am satisfied that, while we cannot go very much below the 50 per cent. all round, in certain counties where the road situation is such at present that they are spending nearly 100 per cent. over 1913-14 that that can perhaps not continue very long, so that it is of importance to us to see that the road income is increased.</P>

      <P>No; that the Road Fund is increased so that there will be additional moneys there to relieve the existing burden that is falling on the ratepayers, in certain areas at any rate.  When we compare the condition of our roads to-day with the condition in 1913-14, and when, with a view in our minds as to the way in which motor traffic is developing here, we have some idea as to the extent to which roads must further be improved here, we must realise that the expenditure on our roads cannot be allowed to fall very much below what the average expenditure has been, say, for the last five or six years, for some time to come at any rate.  During the year ended March, 1929, the total amount of money spent on roads was £2,129,000.  During the current year expenditure is expected to be £1,979,000, and whereas we are <Col N="1966" /> getting from the rates during the current year, say, £1,040,000, we anticipate to get from the Road Fund, including the tax which is referred to here, £750,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes the proposed bus tax.  Now as to the money that is going to come elsewhere than from ratepayers, our policy is that it shall come from the road user, and when we are asked why has the bus owner and the user of the bus to pay the increased amount that is here we are asked to give a very detailed analysis of the grounds on which that is based. When the road tax was first put on motor owners there was a certain amount put on them that it was expected they could pay.  I do not know that any Deputy will argue that the amount that was put on the motor owner at the beginning was expected to bear any relation to the damage he was going to do to the roads, or to the amount of improvement that was going to be done to the roads in order that he might use them.  It was simply a rough kind of way of seeing how much he could be expected to pay.  There was an idea of forming a road fund, the fund to be applied to the improvement of the roads, and the private motor owner has from the time the Road Fund was formed paid a certain amount into it. Deputies, in an attempt to speak against buses, have asked why public utility services should be taxed in a very high way in order to relieve the pleasure motorist from having to pay more.  We could not differentiate.  I do not know if any estimate could be made of the number of motors that are used purely for pleasure.</P>

      <P>I do not see how the consumption by A compared with the consumption by B is going to show whether A is a pleasure-seeker or whether B is a worker.  I consider that the contributions from buses should bear a definite relation, as far as we can possibly get it, to the use of the roads, because in the first place, in spite of what the Deputy wants to argue from my last statement on this matter, there is the damage factor, but, in the main, there is the fact that they are using the roads in a way in which the private owner is not using them.  They are using them for profit and, in the next place, they are an increasing service, they are a factor among our road users that dictates what shall be the perfection to which the roads must be brought.  From nearly every county we get representations from county surveyors and others that buses should not be allowed to use particular roads, roads that are good enough for the ordinary private cars and that the ordinary private cars will not do damage to but that buses are going to plough up.  The buses then dictate in respect of our unimproved roads, the standard to which the roads have to be brought.  There are many reasons in my mind why the contribution that the buses should pay should bear a direct relation to the extent to which they use the roads.  That matter was fully formulated in the reference of the Minister for Finance pre-December, 1928.  For one reason or another, it has not been feasible to introduce a tax on those lines.  I would submit to Deputies as far as the tax which it is proposed should be paid by bus owners is related to the tax that the ordinary private person pays, that it will be found that there is a fair relationship between the amount the bus owners are going to be asked to pay and the amount the private car owner is being asked to pay.  Take the ordinary private car.  Take it that the average car is a five-seater. The average tax payable in respect of a five-seater car is £13 10s.  If we eliminate the question of depreciation <Col N="1968" /> and say that £100 is the total outgoings, including petrol, tax, insurance and all that, we find that the amount that will be paid in tax is 13.5 per cent. of the total outgoings, excluding depreciation.  If we turn to the bus and we take it that the average bus is a twenty-five seater, it is equivalent to five times the motor car.  If we want to relate, even in a direct way like that, the bus to the private car the bus is equivalent to five five-seater cars. The stated total income of the bus companies for last year was £616,733.</P>
      <P>Assume there are 700 buses, that each of these cost £1,000 and that they last say for four years.  We have to put aside for depreciation £175,000.  I doubt if the bus companies are putting aside for depreciation amounts to the extent of £175,000, but we find that the gross payment from the public, if we exclude that depreciation, is £441,733, and 13.5 per cent. of that would be approximately £53,000.  We are going to ask the bus companies to provide approximately £73,000.  I submit to the House that there is not such a very great difference between what is to be paid for the buses and the private cars, without taking into account in any way that they are profit-making concerns and that they are making use of the roads in an abnormal way.  So that the buses, in my opinion, are not being called upon to pay new taxation appreciably more than what the ordinary private owners are being called upon to pay. There is, in my own personal opinion, at any rate, a further call to be made on buses towards the road services that are being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flinn mentioned the question of the small towns and the injurious effects of the bus traffic on them.  He suggested that he would like to put a staying hand on the bus traffic until such time as the disturbances in the small towns could be brought into equilibrium with whatever remedial development is going to take place to offset such damage to the small towns.  Without going outside the outlook of the Department of Local Government, I would <Col N="1969" /> consider if there were a railway company providing very necessary transport facilities for the country, and if the development of bus traffic was such as to injure that transport, that there ought to be put a staying hand on the development of bus traffic, so as to bring the railway situation to proper equilibrium.  I do not think any serious exception could be taken to that, but there is not in this proposal anything in fact but a proposal to get an additional amount of money from the buses and an amount, in my opinion, that is lower than what we might expect in time to get from them.  The whole question of the roads is kept very much under review.  We have been left here with a certain system of roads. In some places we are much more roaded than they are, say, in the North of Ireland or in Scotland, to make a comparison with comparable areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davis speaks of the necessity of having further roads made. I would like to direct the attention of the Deputies generally to the fact that we are over-roaded as compared with other places and that our standard of maintenance is much lower and has been much lower than the standard of maintenance elsewhere. The amount spent normally on road maintenance in Great Britain per mile of road is ten times what is spent here.  Not only that, not only have we to extend further the roads in the country that are capable of bearing bus traffic, which at present are about 4,000 miles, but we have further to increase the excellence of our maintenance.  Reference has been made to the experience of other countries.  While being more engrossed with the experience in our own country, and while being able to learn a lot more from this experience than from countries outside, the Department and the county surveyors, in co-operation with the Engineering Staff of the Department of Local Government, are keeping themselves in touch with what is happening outside this country in the matter of roads.  Some of the county surveyors have contributed <Col N="1970" /> thought-stimulating papers at various congresses and engineering institutes in connection with road maintenance, and conferences have been held between the county surveyors and the Department here.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that the Deputies can get the last word in road theory or the last word in road experience laid before them.  That should not suggest to them that they cannot see the policy of the Government simply because they cannot be told what is the exact fraction of damage that a particular type of bus wheel does when it passes over a mile of road.  These really are questions of very great interest, but they are not questions, at any rate, from the point of view of the Ministers or a Deputy here that we can get very much profit by discussing.  The proposal that is put before you now, examined in relation alone to what the private car is paying, will show Deputies that we are not now proposing to put a charge on buses very different from the standard upon which we are charging the private car.  While putting that before them, I want to say that a desirable thing is to get a taxation of the buses which will bear relation to the extent to which they use the roads, and as far as the Department is concerned, it will therefore pursue examination along that particular line.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has taken great pains to give a very detailed explanation in support of the tax which is being imposed in this particular part of the Financial Resolutions.  I dare say this particular explanation is given for the purpose of trying to satisfy the members of the Bus Owners' Association that they are not being unfairly dealt with in this proposal. I know, and I know that they know perfectly well themselves, that they have escaped very lightly by the imposition of this particular tax.  I think I referred before to the statement made by the Minister for Finance on this matter last December. In that statement the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, <Col N="1971" /> indicated that the Government expected to receive as a result of the proposed increase in taxation of buses a sum of £100,000.  I wonder has the alteration in the original proposal of the Ministry, and the consequential reduction in the amount derived from the modified proposal now before us, anything to do with the increase which the ratepayers are called upon to bear in the matter of road maintenance?</P>

      <P>Well, the report of the Mallow speech in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; gave the figure at £100,000 and I am relying on the report of the speech in the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo;  I take it now that the Minister's original intention was that a sum of £65,000 in revenue should be derived from the proposed tax, and that that sum is now modified to a proposal whereby £35,000 is to be derived. The Minister for Local Government stated that the increase in the amount of money raised from rates for maintenance purposes last year was 42 per cent. over 1913.  We have therefore as a result of the alteration in the policy of the Government the fact that the farmer ratepayer is now being called upon to pay 16 per cent. additional increase of rates for road maintenance purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the alteration in the method of applying the tax has been caused as a result of the threats made by the Bus Owners' Association or not I am not quite sure.  The whole question&mdash;and that should be considered now&mdash;is will the farmer ratepayers get now more freedom on the roads which they have themselves constructed, compared with what they got in 1913?  No Deputy here can say that the farmer ratepayer driving his horses, cattle or sheep along the roads to-day is getting the <Col N="1972" /> same freedom which he got in 1913. Yet he is being called upon to pay an increase of 58 per cent. compared with 1913 notwithstanding the fact that there is greater danger to himself and to his live stock that he drives along the road than there was in 1913.  I do not, therefore, see the fairness of the proposal nor any good grounds upon which this proposal is based.  What is the position in England?  In England, as everybody knows, there is a far greater number of motor cars per head of the population than in this country. Notwithstanding this fact we find that in the present financial, year in so far as it affects the ratepayer in England, 60 per cent. of the amount of money raised for road maintenance has to be paid by the motor users including the omnibus owner too.  That means that forty per cent. of the sum raised in England has to be raised from the rates as compared with 58 per cent. here for road maintenance.  Here there is far less motor traffic per head of the population than there is in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from figures purporting to have been used by Mr. Churchill, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and if Deputy Moore will disprove anything in these figures and show that they are wrong I will express regret for having quoted them.  The Minister for Finance said that he had heard the case of the motor bus owners.  I presume he heard the deputation of the Motor Bus Association.  I received a circular from that association. I presume the Minister for Finance has received a copy of it. That circular put forward a statement of the motor bus people protesting against the taxation originally proposed by the Minister for Finance in his speech in Mallow on behalf of the Government.  That statement gave twelve points.  I will not read the whole of them but I will read three of them.  These are the points by which they hope to influence the minds of the Deputies in the hope <Col N="1973" /> in turn that the Deputies would enter an effective protest against the Minister's proposals.  I will read three of these points as to what the bus pioneer has done for the country and the people of the country.</P>
      <P>The 3rd point says: &ldquo;He has provided well-paid employment for thousands of drivers, conductors, mechanics, body-builders, garage assistants, clerks and others who would otherwise be out of work.&rdquo;  Is the number employed to-day by the motor bus owners greater than the number thrown out of employment by the railway companies as a result of this unfair competition?  I challenge the words &ldquo;well-paid employment.&rdquo; It is the worst form of employment and is only acceptable to those who wish to keep themselves on the borderline of starvation and existence.  One pound a week for a 76 hours' week is what they term well-paid employment.  Is that well-paid employment?  Or is it a right sort of employment when you consider the number of hours during which they have to work.  The fourth point given in this memorandum is: &ldquo;He has increased railway traffic by bringing thousands of passengers from remote districts to and from railway stations.&rdquo;  I wonder was the Minister for Finance influenced by that obviously ridiculous statement?  He was influenced to some extent, because in his Budget speech he admitted it.  I am surprised to know his leg was pulled by that kind of plausible statement. As far as I am aware, the bus owners are taking passengers anywhere but to or from railway stations.  We have, for instance, buses running to and from Limerick parallel with the railway lines.  I believe the Great Southern Railway directors are foolish enough to subsidise one of the companies.  Some day or other the directors will learn a lesson.  If they do not I hope that the shareholders will bring them to their senses.</P>

      <P>Here is another point from the statement of the Bus Owners' Protection Association: &ldquo;He has raised the value of agricultural land in many districts, and so saved hundreds of farmers from bankruptcy.&rdquo;  I am sure Deputy Flinn will be interested in this.  Is there any farmer Deputy here who would venture a statement in support of that ridiculous contention? I am sure no farmer would pretend to argue that there was even a possibility of such a thing.  I think we are merely thrashing a dead horse by prolonging this discussion.  I believe there can be no sound, serious thinking on this matter as long as you have three Ministers responsible for transport in the country.  There is undoubtedly confused thinking. If one wants evidence of confusion of thought, one needs merely to read the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the speech of the Minister for Finance when he was outlining the Budget proposals, and compare both with the speech we have now heard from the Minister for Local Government. There could be no greater argument in favour of the setting up of one State Department to deal with the whole transport problem and not the road problem alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have heard uttered by the Minister for Local Government I think he has been giving a good deal of serious consideration to this matter.  But I contend that he looks at it purely from the point of view of roads alone and how the cost of road maintenance is to be raised, on the one hand from the ratepayer and on the other hand from the motor omnibus owner.  He puts his proposal then before the Minister for Industry and Commerce who looks at it purely from the point of view of how these proposals may affect railway transport, for which he feels he has a particular responsibility.  The Minister for Finance gets statements from the <Col N="1975" /> two other Ministers whom I have mentioned and he in turn thinks only of how the proposal will be met from the point of view of taxation &mdash;how he will find money in order to meet the proposed expenditure. He looks at it purely from the point of view of a Minister for Finance. If he thinks that it is not good policy, because of the agitation got up by the bus owners, to proceed to raise £65,000 by means of a tax on buses, for sound political reasons he decides to reduce the sum proposed originally to be levied to £35,000.</P>
    <P>I believe you should have one State Department dealing with the entire question of road transport.  It is a very serious question and it should not be treated as a political question.  If it were not treated as a political question I think there would be less confusion in the minds of Ministers.  It is unnecessary for me to emphasise that this is an important national matter.  The Minister for Local Government talks about the percentage the motor user pays per year in respect of motor taxation as distinct from the general cost of the running of his motor car.  I think the Minister mentioned 13 or 13.5 per cent.  I would like to point out that the roads were constructed long before this motor bus traffic came along.  The Minister should realise when he is talking of the cost of maintenance of roads, and when he is endeavouring to get in his point of view with regard to motor buses, that not 90 per cent. of the motor buses at present using the roads have paid anything towards the construction of the roads.  The Minister is not speaking fairly when he makes a comparison between the railways and the motor buses.  Two years ago there were 100 buses on the road; now we have 681.  The roads which are now being used largely by the motor buses were constructed long before buses were even heard of.  In the circumstances the motor bus people have not paid one farthing towards the cost of construction.</P>
    <P>I know that in this matter I will <Col N="1976" /> be accused of prejudice, but the fact is that I am not prejudiced.  I believe there is plenty of room in this country for motor bus traffic.  There is a great opening for this traffic and I know that the motor bus has come to stay.  I have often said that the man who planned the railways must have been a one-eyed engineer. They may have some usefulness from the point of view of the defence of the country, but from the public point of view their use can be questioned.  There was no reason at all for the running of the railways so far away from the principal towns.  If the railways were constructed by engineers with common-sense and reasonable foresight they would not have been situated so far away from the principal towns.  That is the principal difficulty with the railways to-day&mdash;the cost of transport between the railway terminal and the town which the railway serves.  That cost is altogether out of proportion to what it should be if these lines were properly constructed and run through or much nearer to the towns.</P>

      <P>There is no use in thrashing a dead horse, and someday or other, when Deputy Flinn is Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government, there will be established one State Department which will deal with the whole question of transport.  It is only then that really serious consideration will be given to the matter, and it is only then the farmer ratepayer and the ordinary ratepayer will be called upon to pay what is a proper and fair proportion towards the upkeep of roads as distinct from the amount to be contributed by the motor user.  That is not being done to-day.  It is unfair to insist on raising 58 per cent. of road maintenance cost from the rates, leaving the other people who paid nothing for the construction of the roads to pay the balance.  Their contribution should be much more, and I would like to emphasise that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in favour of the buses.  In spite of what Deputy Davin has said, the buses have been a great asset to the country.  He admitted that those who originally constructed the railways did it in a very slipshod fashion, and did it more from the point of view of defence than anything else.  It is evident that they were not constructed to open up this country, whereas the advent of the buses has opened up the rural parts of Ireland.  The buses are the poor man's mode of locomotion.  Take a particular country district in the Midlands, where in order to get to Dublin you paid 26/- for a car to the station and back and 19/- on the railway.  The advent of the buses has made it possible to get from a town or village in that district to Dublin and back for 7/6.  The buses have also brought the railway companies to their senses, and were it not for the buses the railway fares would not have been reduced as they have been recently.  The point I want to make is, that the bus owners when they contend that they are feeding the railways are fairly right. It is a fact that in towns like Mullingar and Longford there are bus services to the smaller outlying towns, and passengers can get to a town like Mullingar from places like Ballymahon, where there are no railways, for a couple of shillings. I contend that these passengers are travelling on the railways since the reduction of railway fares.  It is evident, indeed it is admitted by the railway directors, that there is increased traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not passenger traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent admitted that at the annual meeting of the Great Southern Company.  I contend that the short-journey buses are contributing to that.  There should, in my opinion, be a reduction in taxation as regards those buses which are opening up the rural parts of the country and which, though not providing a direct service to Dublin, run services between the smaller towns and the county towns.  Their total <Col N="1978" /> income is only a fraction of that of the bigger buses which provide a Dublin service.  I think that there should be a reduction in the tax as regards the small type of bus.  In order to compensate for what you would lose in that respect you could tax the lorries.  I do not mean the ordinary steam lorries.  There is a new sort of motor lorry which carries merchandise of all sorts from small parcels to large commodities. I do not want to mention the name of the firm that runs that service, but it is a fact that these lorries are on the road and that they are heavier on the road surfaces than the buses. You could transfer the tax from the small buses to these heavy lorries. Deputy Davin referred to road maintenance and to the question of contribution. All I say about that is that when the Minister for Local Government gets a certain amount of revenue from a particular county from motor licences he should, at least, send that amount back to the county for the purpose of road-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if this will not be the final debate on road taxation or on the system of transport, judging from the different opinions expressed in different quarters, and I am afraid that for some time what Deputy Davin describes as confused thinking is likely to prevail.  The Minister for Local Government expanded a little to-day and gave us a little of the information which we have been begging him to give for a long time.  He told us a little about the road position and about the activities of the Road Department, and so on, but he did not give us anything like sufficient information to enable us to judge the position.  He did not even give us the primary information which is necessary if we are to judge whether this tax is sufficient or is too high.  I think that the Minister will admit that there is no document in the Oireachtas Library that would enable us to estimate the position, either in regard to trunk roads, main roads, link roads, or what are called country roads.  If we are to form a judgment on the question of road. <Col N="1979" /> taxation it would be necessary to have some information on that matter before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard, for instance, to the 4,000 miles of trunk roads, we would like to know how many miles have been reconstructed on what one might call a permanent basis.  How many miles have been reconstructed so that only maintenance charges will be necessary for the next nine or ten years?  What is the mileage that has been reconstructed on a sort of temporary basis, namely, a water-maeadam basis, and which will inevitably arise for reconstruction very soon again?  Moreover, with regard to main roads as distinct from trunk and link roads, we have no idea of the position.  We have no idea of the charges.  It may be that the Minister is not in a position to give the information.  It may be that the whole problem has not been long enough before us to enable the Department to give that information. Certainly there is no information before the House that would enlighten us upon it.  Without that information it is very difficult to judge whether the tax is just or not.  The comparisons that have been made between road traffic and railway traffic, between the expense to bus owners and that to railway companies, are not helpful in any way. There are few Deputies who have sufficiently examined the economics of road transport as compared with those of railway transport to be able to form a final judgment.  I think that every statement which I have ever heard on the subject has been prejudiced.  We are told that to put the road and railway services in opposition is ludicrous, as the roads are essential to the railways. You have people using the roads for many miles around the railway stations.  Again, motor traffic contributes substantially to railway traffic.  The bulk of motor accessories, such as tyres, etc., is sent by rail over long distances.  I do not believe that Deputy Davin, or anyone else, has ever attempted to draw up a balance sheet on that matter, or to estimate whether the railways <Col N="1980" /> are really in unfair competition with the roads.  It has, however, been done in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>Would the Deputy produce his balance sheet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that I ever attempted to produce one.  I admit that I could not attempt it, although I have probably given the matter as much attention as anybody.  It has, however, been done in England and Deputy Davin would find it very hard to combat the statement produced there by the motor interests. There is another aspect of the matter of which Deputy Davin lost sight, namely, that in going out against the bus interests he is really going out against the railway interests because the largest bus owners are the railway companies.  It appears that the tax which we are discussing will mean an increase of £15,000 to a company that is in some sort of relationship with the Great Southern Railways.  To the Great Northern Railway Company it will mean an increase of about £12,000, and to the Dublin United Tramways Company it will mean an increase of £10,000. Deputy Davin champions all these railway companies against what he calls the bus interests, and yet he is apparently urging a higher taxation on buses.  It is a rather extraordinary position to be in.  Again Deputy Davin, in his race after the bus companies, has forgotten the bus passenger. The bus passenger is a rather important person at the present moment judging from a report in to-day's &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  It appears from the latest returns that there has been an increase of 3,200,000 in the number of passengers carried by buses in the Dublin area over the number in the corresponding period last year.  The latest figure for the three months ending March this year was 7,851,780.  I submit that that number of people who are using buses are entitled to some consideration and if we are to tax the buses off the road, these people ought to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that the buses should be taxed off the roads.  I said quite the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1981" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that the Deputy really suggested taxing them off the roads, but I think Deputy Davin's speeches on this subject usually are in favour of very high taxation.  It might be remarked too that the mileage run has increased during the three months I have mentioned compared with last year, from 3,041,094 to 5,448,807 and the gross receipts have increased from £108,415 to £165,823.  That looks as if the interests of bus passengers will have to be taken much more seriously from this forward than they have been heretofore.  I submit that we are only touching the fringe of the question.  I submit there is room for a very full inquiry into the whole economics of road transport, particularly with regard to buses, which have been so frequently mentioned in the House.  I think it is quite possible that great economy to the country could accrue from an organised system as distinct from the chaotic system that prevails at present.  I do not think that any Minister believes in the present system by which to-morrow 10,000 individuals, if they liked, could purchase vehicles, and could put them on any road they liked in competition with existing interests. One need only exaggerate it to show the absurdity of the present position. Take the line from Dublin to Bray.  To-morrow anybody who wishes can put 200 or 300 vehicles on that road to ply for hire without committing any illegality.  That is obviously a thing that should not be allowed to continue.  Some action will have to be taken in regard to that question and I submit the time has arrived for taking such action. I do not think it is helpful to have a state of things prevailing at present as a result of which a company that has given good service to a remote district, where there was no railway previously and where the people welcomed gladly any means of linking them up with Dublin or some other city, should be in the position that some &ldquo;chancer,&rdquo; some person who manages to get any sort of vehicle at all, can come along and challenge them on that line and perhaps <Col N="1982" /> drive them out of existence before he himself goes out of existence, as that of course is inevitably the fate of such people.  It is utterly unreasonable, and it was found so unreasonable in the Six County area that new vehicles are only licensed now when the authorities are satisfied that such vehicles are required. In addition to that, I believe that if we had a unified system of road transport, it would be found that considerable economies could be effected with regard to the running of vehicles, purchasing supplies, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. When Deputy Davin speaks so harshly of the motor buses it does not seem appropriate, considering that he sits on the Labour Benches. He is a defender of railway interests, and yet we have the authority of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, curiously enough, on this day twelvemonths, I think, said: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, the greatest harm to the railway had been done by the private motor car and not by the buses.&rdquo;  I have not heard Deputy Davin make any protest against the low taxation of the private motor car, notwithstanding that the bus, which is the poor man's private car, comes in for such a lot of criticism. The Minister proceeded:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Regulations in regard to privately owned, passenger carrying motor vehicles would be difficult, because the private car or a man's own lorry could not be excluded from the highways, and this was the really formidable competition. To suggest interfering with them would be ludicrous.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on the Minister said, with regard to the suggestion that buses had not been called upon to pay enough for the damage done to the roads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not believe that anyone has sufficient information on these matters to see what might be estimated <Col N="1983" /> for one type of vehicle as against another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently there has been some progress made in that respect, because the Minister for Local Government seems satisfied to-day in his comparison between buses and motor cars that buses should pay more.  I think it is inevitable that a substantial amount of the charges imposed on the ratepayers for the upkeep of roads should be taken away.  The roads are not sufficiently valuable to the ratepayers of the country at present to justify the huge expenditure that they are being called upon to find this year, and in order to relieve the ratepayers somebody else will have to bear the tax.  I hope, before any further increase in the bus tax, or in connection with the motor tax, is proposed, there will be a very full inquiry into the whole question of transport, that the subject will be examined with a view to ascertaining whether the service could not be run on national lines with much greater advantage to passengers and to those who are to provide the means for the roads.  I believe that such an inquiry, even at present, would result in very definite recommendations, and that it would be a valuable step for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I should like to support the statements made by Deputy Davin.  I have not an interest either in railways or buses, but speaking as one who has some interest in the rates of the county from which I come, I must say that the bus traffic is causing more damage on the county roads than the amount of taxation which they are paying would cover.  I think anybody who travels our country roads to-day will have to admit that these roads are not in any way suitable for those who have to foot the bill&mdash;namely, the ratepayers.  A farmer cannot drive a horse and cart on any of our main roads unless he risks breaking his neck.  I have here a list of bus services between Cork and Cobh.  A large amount of money <Col N="1984" /> was spent on that road recently by the county council and also out of grants received.  The cost of laying down the road was, I think, £2,500 per mile.  That road is not twelve months laid down, and it is now practically all torn up again.  There are 16 buses travelling each way between Cork and Cobh, making 32 buses per day.  It is practically impossible for a farmer to take a horse and cart on that road.  A farmer has not alone to pay increased rates for the making of these roads for the motor users, but, in addition, he has to pay transport charges which he would not have to pay if he could put his horse on the road.  A farmer cannot take his farm produce to the city over the roads, unless he gets his horse &ldquo;frosted&rdquo; beforehand. Transport charges are, therefore, increasing on the farmer.  There has been a lot of sympathy expressed for the transport companies.  The valuation of the railways has been reduced, but there has been no reduction of the farmers' valuation.</P>

      <P>Yes, the taxation of buses.  The Minister made a very flowery speech in Mallow recently, and said he was going to get an extra £100,000 per year from the buses.  On the strength of that, Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies came to the county council the following week and told us they had great news for the farmers, that the Minister for Finance was preparing a de-rating scheme on the strength of what he was going to get out of the buses.

One of these Deputies told us that he was a member of the Committee on the de-rating proposals which the Government were considering. They have not appeared yet.  I am in favour of buses running on roads which are not touched by railways, but where there is a good railway service, such as from Cork to Cobh, running every hour and a half, it is ridiculous to have 32 buses per day travelling on that road, and to have the ratepayers paying for its upkeep.  It is not conducive to lightening the burden on the farmers.  The Minister said in Mallow that he was going to get £100,000 extra from the buses per year, and now he comes along with a proposal which is to produce £35,000 only.  I think we should have a Minister for Transport, and where it is clearly proved that the present transport service to any district is sufficient for the needs of the district, an extra tax should be put upon buses running to that district, such as in the case I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether any steps have been taken to give effect to paragraph 98 of the Interim Report of the Sub-Committee of the Roads Advisory Committee on the Taxation of Road Vehicles, which states:</P>
      <P>As it has been the desire and intention of the Minister that the Sub-Committee should not restrict themselves to methods of raising revenue by the taxation of road vehicles only but should further examine and report on the general question of road finance and on the system under which the revenue obtained should be expended, and the general policy of road administration in the Free State, the Sub-Committee think it desirable to present the result of the first part of their deliberation in the form of an interim report, and to present later a second report dealing with these further problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report was made in February, 1925, and I should like to know whether the further report mentioned <Col N="1986" /> has been prepared and submitted to the Minister.</P>

This matter was in train so far back as February, 1925, and even if the Local Government Department and the Ministry of Finance, from their nature, do move slowly, they ought to have been able to come to some definite conclusion on the matter since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I need not take up the time of the House by arguing that the proposals contained in the Resolution do not impose too heavy a burden upon the bus owners.  Consequently, I will not trouble to defend the Resolution in the way that I might be called upon to defend it in other circumstances.  I shall refer to one or two points raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy Lemass asked that the buses should be allowed to pay the tax monthly and to pay it, practically, at the yearly rate with perhaps the addition of a small fraction for interest.  I do not think we can agree with that proposition because there has been an agitation in favour of allowing monthly payments of all the road duty.  If we sanctioned monthly payments&mdash;of course I am speaking all the time on the basis suggested by Deputy Lemass&mdash;upon that basis in the case of buses I do not think we could refuse them in the case of other vehicles.  If we allowed monthly licence payments as a general rule, we would probably lose a great deal more revenue than would be gained by the increase in this taxation.  I have a paper before me that estimates the possible loss at £65,000 to the Road Fund if monthly payments were allowed generally. Consequently, I do not think it could be permitted in the case of the bus owners.  In any case these proposals do not impose a burden that is clearly too heavy, or even a burden that is probably too heavy, upon bus owners.  I do not think there is any case for the suggestion.  Deputy Flinn suggested that as part of a policy to favour the railways the railway valuation had been reduced this year and that the local authorities had been forbidden to appeal. As a matter of fact we were satisfied, if matters were allowed to take their ordinary course, that railway valuations would have been substantially further reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out to representatives of the railway companies that if their valuations were reduced as much as seemed likely, new legislation dealing with railway valuation would immediately become urgent, and would <Col N="1988" /> probably have to be put through the House as a matter of urgency, and that legislation, so framed, and so passed, probably would not be of the most satisfactory character.  And it was arranged between the railway companies and the Valuation Office and the Department of Finance that the railway valuation would be fixed at a certain figure which was higher than it would have been fixed at if the railways had insisted upon their legal rights, and that it should remain at that for a year or so, and that the question of further legislation in regard to valuation of the railways should be at once taken up and some plan devised.  If the local authorities had not been forbidden to appeal against the new valuations and if they had appealed the result would only have been that the valuations would have been further reduced. In what has taken place with regard to railway valuations, there was no indication of a policy of favouring the railways at the expense of the road traffic.</P>
    <P>With regard to solid-tyre lorries, I am agreed with the Deputies who mentioned them that the tax on solid-tyre lorries must be further increased. It was very sharply increased a year or two ago and it was thought it was only fair to people who might have purchased vehicles which could not at any reasonable cost be fitted with pneumatic tyres that some little further period should be allowed to elapse before an increase on solid tyre vehicles was brought into force.  Several Deputies advocated a petrol tax instead of this increase, and, in fact, instead of the present system of taxation of motor vehicles.  The matter has been discussed in the House several times, and the arguments against it that have been put to the House I think have outweighed the arguments in favour of a system of petrol tax only. First of all, the present system of taxation penalises to some extent the user of the mere pleasure car, the luxury car.  The man who keeps a car for the week-ends, and finds the best roads to run it on, pays something more than he would have to pay if we had a petrol tax.  I think <Col N="1989" /> it is fair that he should pay, and I think that is a definite argument in favour of it.  If we are to have a petrol tax instead of the present one, it would be certainly a shilling, and I think more than a shilling, but I have not the exact figure by me at the moment.  But assuming it was only a shilling, first it would be difficult not to have exemption, in the case of petrol used for other than road vehicles.  Exemption and rebates are difficult to work and costly to administer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the tax were as high as a shilling, the question of substitution would arise.  I have had more than one report from the State chemist on this matter.  If the tax is high enough to make evasion profitable, it would be very difficult to prevent spirit being brought in of a grade which would enable it to pass as paraffin, and then by the addition of a certain quantity of high-grade motor spirit to make it serviceable as petrol.  We were driven to the conclusion that if we had a tax as high as a shilling it would be necessary to tax not only petrol but paraffin also in order to prevent evasion on a large scale. Generally, I am satisfied, after a good deal of examination of the matter, that to substitute a petrol tax that would give anything like the present revenue to the Road Fund would be impracticable.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the suggestion made by Deputy Goulding for differentiation in favour of buses running on roads away from railways would be practicable.  It certainly would be an entire departure from the present code.  It would lead to a great deal of difficulty in administration and would bring in anomalies and new sources of dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the fact that new buses were allowed to be put upon the road when any person cared to put them on and the people who got in first were not allowed a monopoly.  It seems to me that a great many of the demands for a Minister for Transport and all sorts of changes of that nature, and for what is called &ldquo;co-ordination of the traffic,&rdquo; come from people who, <Col N="1990" /> having buses on the roads or on particular routes, want a monopoly.  I see no reason why those people should be given a monopoly, and I do not know that any competition that is taking place between buses so far has been harmful.  I do not know if routes have been abandoned &mdash;there may be some, but they must be very few&mdash;because there has been excessive bus traffic on them.  If there are not routes abandoned that needed motor buses for the convenience of the public, then the public interest has not suffered in the least as a result of competition.</P>
    <P>The weight of the arguments is in favour of allowing the unrestricted growth of bus traffic for a period, taking care simply to charge them some reasonable sum for the use of the roads as a contribution towards the maintenance of the roads and to refrain, to that extent, from subsidising them at the expense, shall we say, of the railways.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore asked whether the tax would be passed on.  It probably would be passed on.  It would be passed on by any extra charge that is put on the buses, but, at any rate, if there is free competition in the matter of bus traffic it is likely that less will be passed on than would be passed on if we had some system of monopoly.  It may be possible to regulate a monopoly so as to get the most satisfactory results from it, when there is sufficient experience of the business <Col N="1991" /> that is being monopolised and when it is possible, therefore, to regulate it on a somewhat scientific basis.</P>

      <P>I admit there is a good deal of force in the criticism the Deputy suggests but, in any case, the bus owners who are subject to certain restrictions are a firm which were previously forbidden to run buses.  It was given specially by legislation the privilege of initiating a bus service.  That firm moreover is concerned in another traffic and it was suspected of being liable to drive out existing bus services with the intention of dropping its own bus services then.  It might not have done that, but there were special reasons for some restrictions in the case of that particular company. Those are the only points I wish to refer to.</P>

      <P>Before entering into a detailed statement on the finances of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I would like to appeal in the first instance to Deputies to approach this particular Vote in a somewhat different spirit from that in which Votes are usually approached here, for this reason&mdash; that the particular Department in question is to be regarded as more in the nature of a business proposition than any other Department which is discussed in this House. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs renders a definite service to the public in this country in return for payment for that service.  It is not altogether self-supporting, but we endeavour to bring it as near being self-supporting as we can, taking account of the circumstances which control it including the fact that it is subject to the democratic control of the Parliament of this <Col N="1993" /> country.  The general acceptance of the work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs centres round the idea that it deals mainly with postal activities.  Perhaps it might be well to remind Deputies before proceeding to further examination that the work carried on by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has become very complex.  I want to mention, in short, some&mdash;not all&mdash;of the activities of that Department.  In addition to the ordinary activities connected with the postal services the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is responsible for&mdash;telegraphs, telephones, money orders (home and foreign), postal orders, savings bank, payment of old age pensions, military pensions, savings certificates.  It collects dog licences and sells stamps for national health and unemployment insurance also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a preface to my statement, having outlined the general activities of the Department.  I will now deal with the finances of the Department. The estimated expenditure of the Department for 1929-30, as shown in the Estimates, is £2,233 435.  The estimated expenditure for the past year, 1928-29, was £2,425,555.  These figures show a decrease in estimated expenditure for the coming financial year of £192,120.  It will be remembered, however, that after the issue of the Book of Estimates a saving of £40,000, which it was anticipated would be made in rural postal services, was abandoned, and from the decrease in estimated expenditure this £40,000 must be taken, showing an estimated reduction in expenditure as compared with last year of £152,120.  The revenue for this financial year is estimated at £1,771,000.  Taking that from the estimated expenditure already mentioned, £2,233,435, we get a nominal deficit of £462,435.  To this must be added again the £40,000 estimated saving already mentioned, showing an actual nominal deficit of £502,435 as compared with a deficit of £669,995 last year and with a deficit of £730,935 for 1927-28.  I want to point out that the deficit shown in these figures is really only nominal, because the appropriation accounts <Col N="1994" /> and the finance accounts are really only cash accounts; they only purport to show the actual cash payments to be made and the actual receipts in cash.  Before I go on to deal with the real deficit shown in the commercial accounts, which are the more complete accounts of this department, I might account for the various decreases and, in some cases, increases which have taken place in the Estimates as compared with last year.  I will only deal with the larger amounts.  I am not going to enter into any great detail, as the full figures are available, and can be shown to any Deputy at any time he asks for them.  The decreases and increases do not take into account the bonus figures, and therefore, will not agree with the amounts shown in the Vote; they will in most cases be less.</P>
    <P>There is a decrease in expenditure of £2,252 under the head of metropolitan offices.  That is due to retrenchment in telegraph staff, which is offset, to a certain extent, by the incremental increases in salaries. There is a decrease of £2,435 under Sub-head D&mdash;Purchase of Sites. There is a decrease of £29,000 under Sub-head E. (1). conveyance of mail by rail; that is due to a revision of the subsidies formerly paid to the railway company for the conveyance of letter mails.  There is a decrease of £4,000 under Sub-head E.&mdash; Packet Services.  That is due to a re-assessment of subsidies in connection with the conveyance of mails between Ireland and England.  There is a decrease of £3,250 under Sub-head G. (1)&mdash;General Stores.  That is due to a smaller payment to Great Britain for the use of cross-Channel mail bags.  There is an increase in the provision of mechanical transport.  There is a decrease in regard to uniform and clothing of £2,510, and there is a decrease of £7 214 under the heading of salaries. In the Engineering Department there is a decrease under the heading of Engineering Materials (Sub-head K.) of £26 665, and there is a decrease of £13,360 under the heading of Contract Work.  There is a decrease of £8,000 under the heading <Col N="1995" /> Annual Compensation Allowances under Article X of the Treaty.  These are the figures dealing with the important decreases under the various items in this Vote.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increases, there is an increase of £13,380 under the heading M. 2&mdash;Telephone Development (Annuities).  This is due to provision for repayment of annuities which are cumulative according as borrowings from the Exchequer accrue.  In regard to superannuation allowances, there is an increase of £21,000, under Sub-head N. 3&mdash; Additional Allowances under Article X.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the foregoing statements reveals that economies effected by general retrenchment of services, re-organisation, re-assessment of mail subsidies, and in the purchase of stores, amount to, approximately, £179,000.</P>
    <P>Against this gross saving must, however, be put the increased expenditure consequent on telephone development, and the anticipated release of all applicants for retirement under Article X. of the Treaty and other miscellaneous items amounting to £13,000 and £30,000 respectively.  Ignoring bonus, there is, therefore, a net reduction of £136,000.  As I said previously, the appropriation accounts and the finance accounts do not, and are not intended, to represent the true financial position of the Post Office.  They are simply cash statements.  No account is taken of services rendered to other departments, or of adjustments in regard to depreciation, interest on capital, etc.  The commercial accounts published periodically show the correct financial position.  The deficit of £1,108,260 will, it is hoped, be reduced to round £200,000 at the end of 1929-30.</P>
    <P>I intend to give here, for the benefit of Deputies, a statement showing the various deficits from year to year as shown by the commercial account from the year 1922-23 to the present year.  In the year 1922-23 it was, as already stated, £1,108,260; in 1923-24, £773,749; in 1924-25, <Col N="1996" /> £471,974; in 1925-26, £413,967; in 1926-27, £379,756; in 1927-28, £262,774, and in 1928-29, £194,290.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this particular item, I want to emphasise and to call the attention of the Dáil to the saving which has been made in the financial position of the Post Office since it was taken over by the Free State Government in 1922.  A very considerable saving was effected, a saving of roughly speaking, £900,000, has been effected. The accounts of the Post Office Department might be regarded to a certain extent as approximating to the accounts of a business concern. If Deputies approach the matter from the point of view of the shareholders of a joint stock company examining the accounts of that company, it must be regarded as satisfactory that a deficit of that amount has, in a short period of seven years, been reduced by £900,000.  When Deputies are criticising this, as undoubtedly they will criticise this Vote, I ask that they be reasonable enough to give credit where credit is due, and to acknowledge that the thanks of the Dáil are due to the officials of the Department on whose behalf I speak, for the wonderful work that has been done in reducing the loss, for which the State is responsible with regard to this Department.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, the activities of the Post Office largely consist and include three main services&mdash;the postal service, the telegraph service, and the telephones.  The postal service being the original service and the service from which the work of the whole Post Office has sprung, is still by far the most important.  I will deal with that side of the service first.  In 1923 the loss on this service was £656,200 and that was reduced in 1927-28 to £71,307.  It is estimated that the loss will be reduced to £27,000 in 1928-29.  It has been the custom in the past when dealing with the Post Office Vote in this House to give at this stage an analysis of the losses and gains in the postal service.  That is to say, the various items in the postal service are segregated.  Letters, newspapers, <Col N="1997" /> parcels, money orders, etc., which come under the heading of postal service are segregated.  Then there are registered letters.  The sections of the service which are paying are shown with the amount which accrues to them as against the losses on the other sections.</P>
    <P>This year I do not propose to give those figures, because those particular figures are the subject of examination at the moment by a departmental committee, and we are not perfectly satisfied that the figures as generally shown are apportioned and segregated in a way which indicates clearly the loss or gains on the various sections of the postal service.  It is also customary to give statistics dealing with the number of letters and other matters that were posted.  I have available for the Deputies, if they care to see them, or if they now wish me to go through them, the statistics showing the number of letters, printed papers, postcards, parcels, newspapers, etc., posted and delivered in 1928-29 as compared with 1927-28.  As these figures show comparatively slight changes I do think it is unnecessary to read them.  They indicate in general a slight increase in the amount of matter that is dealt with by the Post Office.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one set of figures which I intend to give and which I consider of special interest. The total of the various postal packets, etc., posted for the year 1928-29 was 176,200,000.  The total of similar items delivered for the same period was 208,000,000.  There is a certain deduction to be drawn from these figures, and that is this, that we deliver a considerably larger amount of postal matter than is actually posted in the country. Leaving out parcels, the Post Office delivered 31,000,000 more postal packets in this State than were actually posted.  That in itself is responsible to a certain extent for portion of the loss which the Post Office here has to bear.  We are responsible for the delivery of a considerable amount of postal matter for which we receive no payment.  Deputies, <Col N="1998" /> however, will have an opportunity in that connection of giving their views.  We are governed by international convention and, short of cutting our connection with the International Postal Union, we have to stand the loss which falls on us in that connection.  That is because of our peculiar geographical situation.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to Deputies who may be thinking of the possibility of having the postal rates in this country changed to the rates in Great Britain to have these figures before them.  It may be also of interest to them to know the losses that would accrue to the Postal Department if we were to change our rate to the rate prevailing in England.  The cost of the reduction to the rates prevailing in England would be £241,000.  That is, of course, a reduction in the postage in letters.  The Saorstát rate for postcards, parcels and newspapers is the same as in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of the postal service, I will deal with the various subsidiary items connected with that service.  Motor mail services continue to be availed of.  We have improved the mail service by the introduction of motor transport.  There are now 91 motor car services in operation under transport, while departmentally the number of motor vehicles employed on mail service is 59. Owing to the difficulties in obtaining vans of a suitable type the establishment of additional motor services has had to be postponed, but it is hoped to start them without further delay.</P>
    <P>Deputies may remember that in 1924 we introduced the cash on delivery system into the Postal Department. That system has developed to a fairly considerable extent, although it has seemed to have slowed up considerably during the last year or two.  The figures under the head of cash on delivery items are as follow:&mdash;In 1924, 1,644 items were delivered with cash collection of £1,831 10s. 6d.  In 1925-26, there were 4,673 items, with a cash value of £4,666 15s. 3d.; in 1926-27, the <Col N="1999" /> items were 10,413, with a cash value of £10,859; in 1927-28, the items were 13,112, with a cash value of £13,849.  In 1928-29, the number of items were 14,918, with a cash value of £15,712.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to know, as they will see under the appropriate sub-head, that a considerable saving is now being made in regard to the charge for the conveyance of letters.  That is due to the fact that negotiations with the Great Southern Railway Company for a revised agreement for the conveyance of mails and letters was made last summer.  Under the new contract, which will last over a term of ten years, the payments originally made to the railway company are reduced by £25,000.  Negotiations are also completed with the Great Northern Railway Company and a reduction is effected.  Negotiations are also going on with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Universal Postal Convention is being held in London, and as this Department is represented there by its principal officials it may be of interest to indicate the work which is being done. I will outline the work of the Convention and indicate its effect on the postal services in this country.  The Saorstát adhered to a Universal Postal Convention in September, 1923, and was admitted to the Universal Postal Union in July, 1924. The countries of the Union form one single postal territory for the reciprocal exchange of correspondence and freedom of transit for that correspondence, except parcels, is guaranteed throughout the territory of the Union.  It is for this reason the Saorstát is obliged to deliver, without remuneration, a large amount of excess correspondence which comes into this country for delivery.  It was thought this matter might be rectified at the London Congress, the question being about to be raised by the Australian Post Office.  At a preliminary conference, however, it was unanimously recommended that <Col N="2000" /> no alteration be made on the grounds that it would cut across the fundamental principles of the Convention. It may be taken that the proposal is dead.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give particulars of that kind. Necessarily there must be countries <Col N="2001" /> where that happens, but I cannot mention any particular one.  Probably because of the suggestion it has put forward, Australia is in that position.  If the Deputy wants exact information on the point, I shall get it for him.</P>
      <P>Leaving postal work on one side and turning to other work performed by the Post Office, the following figures may be of interest&mdash; Value of money orders issued in the year 1928-29, £5,289,634; money orders paid, £7,186,456; postal orders issued, £1,460,083; postal orders paid, £1,475,989.  Dealing with the Savings Bank, the conduct of which is part of the work of the Post Office, it may be of interest to know that the value of deposits during last year was £1,212,324 and the value of Savings Bank withdrawals, £1,003,340, showing a balance of £208,984.  There are some figures which I will give you dealing with Savings Bank deposits and withdrawals, and they may be of general interest.  They show that in the year 1923 the number of deposits made in the Free State Savings Bank was 424,853, and that the average amount deposited was £4 18s. 2d.  In the year 1928 the number of deposits was 502,255, and the average amount deposited was £2 8s. 3d.  The obvious deduction is that the number of deposits had increased while the average deposit had decreased.  The number of accounts remaining open at the end of 1923 was 80,400, and the number of accounts remaining open at the end of 1928 was 174,000.  The average amount standing to the credit of each account in 1923 was £19 17s. 2d., while the average amount standing to the credit of each account in 1928 was £17 16s. 10d.  That indicates an increase in the number of Savings Bank accounts, with a slight decrease in the amount standing to the credit of each account.  The value of Savings Certificates issued for the Post Office Department during last year was £1,384,796.  The value of the Savings Certificates repaid in the same period was £419,939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now pass from the postal <Col N="2002" /> side to telephones.  The estimated revenue for the telephone service during 1928-29 was £343,000, and the estimated expenditure, £378,000, showing a deficit of £35,000.  Telephones definitely take second place amongst the activities of the Postal Department.  They take precedence of the telegraphic service; they are gradually expanding and increasing while the telegraphic service is contracting.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general work of the Telephone Department during the past year there were 73 new telephone exchanges opened, and provision is being made for further extensions during the current year, particularly in Counties Donegal and Mayo.  There is, however, much scope for an increase in the number of subscribers at rural exchanges. Of those opened last year 62 have less than four subscribers each, and in the remainder of the cases the number varies from 4 to 11.  Additional trunk circuits, representing about 240 miles of wire, were provided during the year.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give the average cost of installing the 73 new exchanges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the figure.  It is easy to ask a question of that kind, but it could not be answered now.  If the Deputy puts down a question I shall get the information for him.  In regard to semi-automatic rural exchanges, I may mention that a new type of switchboard has been developed with a view to giving full night services to rural exchanges, and is at present undergoing trial at Tallaght. The main feature of the switchboard is that no operator is required at the rural exchange.  When a subscriber rings he is connected automatically to the main exchange, which serves the rural exchange&mdash;Dublin in the case of Tallaght&mdash;and the main exchange deals with the call.  If the lines between the exchanges are all engaged, the call is not lost, but is &ldquo;stored,&rdquo; and reaches the main exchange operator as soon as a line becomes free.  The results of the test have, on the whole, been very satisfactory, <Col N="2003" /> but experience has shown that certain modifications are desirable, and these are being embodied in a second experimental board now under construction.  An additional station on an existing rural party line was provided at Glanmire.  The party-line system is not, however, a success.  There are only 7 such lines in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be interested in the development of automatic telephones, and I may mention that the principal feature in connection with the telephone service during the past year was the decision to convert the Dublin Central Exchange from manual to automatic working.  The automatic exchanges already installed have given excellent service since their inception a few years ago. Nevertheless, before deciding that subscribers connected to the Central Exchange, the replacement of which had become essential on account of the worn-out condition of the plant, should also be on the automatic system, it was considered desirable, in view of the heavy cost involved, that the proposals of the Department's technical officers for reconstruction should be examined by a special Committee, which should include foreign experts of repute.  The foreign experts were the President of the Telephone Service in Germany and the Director of the Telephone Service in Sweden, and the Committee after close examination of the proposals unanimously decided that they should be adopted without modification.  Under the proposals the subscribers&mdash;nearly 4,000 in all &mdash;connected to the Central Exchange will be transferred to the Ship Street and Merrion Street Auto Exchanges, and the question whether it will be necessary to reconstruct the Central Exchange on a large scale, or whether its future use can be confined to trunk purposes, is being left over for decision in the light of general conditions and development a year hence.  Finance authority has been received, a contract has been placed for the extension of the two existing auto exchanges and installation work is proceeding rapidly. <Col N="2004" /> The &ldquo;Main Frame&rdquo; extensions, i.e., as distinct from the automatic installations, will be carried out by a Dublin firm.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that about 300 of the Central Exchange subscribers will be on the automatic system by next month, and that the change over of all subscribers will be completed by the end of the year.  These subscribers are probably now on the automatic system, as this statement was prepared over a month ago.  The change to automatic working involves the change of telephone numbers in all cases, but whether the subscribers remain permanently connected to Merrion Street and Ship Street, or are ultimately replaced on a reconstructed Central Exchange no further change of numbers will be involved.  It would be well if it were generally known that the coin boxes used in connection with the automatic system will enable telegrams to be phoned from Call Offices.  This is not practicable under the existing manual system.  The Committee also recommended, and it has been decided that, subject to the financial aspect in each case being satisfactory, all the outlying exchanges, including Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Killiney, Rathmines, etc., etc., shall ultimately be automatic.  Conversion in these cases will, however, only take place as renewal of the exchanges is necessary.  After the Central Exchange, Rathmines, which is also in an obsolete condition, will be the first to be taken up.  It is hoped that it can be taken in hand next year.  The Committee made an inspection of certain provincial exchanges and gave general consideration to the question of provincial extensions. They were, however, unable to suggest any improvement or alteration in the attitude already adopted by the Department, and considered that in the conditions obtaining in this country the policy of gradual, step by step development, the circumstances of each locality being considered and dealt with on their merits, was on entirely sound lines.  In regard to the finances of the telephone system, there seems to be a misconception, as there is a <Col N="2005" /> general opinion that as the system expands it must necessarily become more remunerative.  That is not quite the case.  It is difficult to make the telephone service absolutely a paying one.  In that connection I might, perhaps, quote the statement that I made last year, in which I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ordinarily in an expanding business, proportionately to expansion, expenses on the unit basis have a tendency to decrease as expansion takes place.  This rule does not apply to the telephone services.  Overhead expenses do not, of course, increase in the same proportion as the number of telephones. The cost of apparatus tends to fall.  The savings effected on these are offset to a large extent, if not altogether, by the increased expense in cost of the plant necessary to provide ready means of communication between the increased number of users of the telephone.  Exchange plant and staff increase out of proportion to the number of added subscribers. In effect the advantage which the user of the telephone gets from development and extension is not cheaper rates, but an increased service, i.e., a greater number of persons with whom he can talk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same remark applies to England, where the telephone surplus is decreasing as expansion takes place. Though overhead costs are reduced there is not a corresponding reduction in the cost of maintenance and operating expenses.  The public, however, get a better and wider service. On the question of extension in areas outside our cities, I should say that it is one that is receiving very considerable consideration. Connected with that is the question of rural telephone extensions.  An endeavour has been made to urge on farmers the desirability of taking up party-lines, but I must admit that it has not been successful.  I have given the question of the extension of telephone services to rural areas considerable thought.  The conclusion I arrived at is that the extension of <Col N="2006" /> the party-line system to any considerable extent in this country is not feasible, and that the expansion of telephone services in non-city areas must to a large extent depend on how it is taken up by residents and business people in smaller towns.  Advantage has not been taken of the system in smaller towns to an extent which might reasonably be expected.  It is hard to expect that farmers living in districts surrounding country towns would instal telephones when they know that if they did they would not be able to get into direct touch with business people in the towns.  In this connection it must be noted that conditions here are different to those in most countries, and it so happens that our means of communication in regard to roads and so forth are exceptionally good, and consequently there is not the desire to instal telephones that there is in other countries where such means of communication are not so good or where postal facilities are not so frequent or so good.</P>
    <P>In this connection it might be interesting to give figures showing the number of telephones per one hundred of the population in various countries.  In the United States it is 15.3, Canada 12.6, Mexico 0.4, Belgium 2.2, Denmark 9.2, Netherlands 3.0, New Zealand 9.5, Germany 4.2, Great Britain and Northern Ireland 3.3, Poland 0.5, and the Irish Free State 0.9.  On this list we come lowest with the exception of Poland and Mexico.  Other figures which may be of interest to Deputies are the number of calls per head of the population.  In 1927-28 the total number of trunk calls was 1,515,000, and in 1928-29 the number was 1,709,000.  In 1927-28 the number of local calls was 17,345,000, and in 1928-29 the number was 19,088,000. The number of calls per head of the population in 1927-28 was 6.3, and in 1928-29 it was 7.0.  That shows a slight but definite increase in the total number of calls per head of the population.  It may be of interest to know that we have now telephonic communication with exchanges that are in direct communication with <Col N="2007" /> Dublin from the greater portion of Europe.  I have a list of countries with which we can communicate direct from the Saorstát by telephone, but I do not think it is necessary to read it at this stage.  The provision of fifteen telephone kiosks in Dublin and suburbs, in addition to the one at College Green, has been decided on, of which the following nine have already been erected:&mdash; Blessington Street, Eden Quay, Burgh Quay, Westmoreland Street, Phibsboro' Road, Parkgate Street, Dolphin's Barn Street, Harrington Street, Ranelagh, at the Angle.  The remaining six kiosks will be located at:&mdash;St. Stephen's Green, Leinster Road (opposite the Free Library), Baggot Street Hospital, Merrion Gates, Ballsbridge and Pembroke Road (near cab shelter).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one at Parkgate Street and another at Phibsboro'.  Passing now from telephones to the telegraph section, I may say that there were no serious dislocations of the telegraph service during the year and, generally speaking, the stability of the various circuits comprising the telegraph system was satisfactory.  The improvement in this respect must be attributed, in a large measure, to the policy pursued in recent years of removing telegraph superpositions from telephone circuits whenever a favourable opportunity has presented itself.  Two new telegraph offices were opened during the year. The policy of replacing sounder instruments by telephones at offices where telegraph traffic has declined, and permits of this course, is being continued, and during the past year 18 offices were dealt with in this manner.  Prior to 1922 there were 58 telegraph offices at which an obsolete type of instrument known as the &ldquo;A.B.C.&rdquo; was in use.  This instrument is antiquated, cumbersome and costly to maintain, and in conjunction with plans for extension of the telephone system the number of <Col N="2008" /> offices using this instrument has, by the substitution of telephone working, been decreased to 4.  During 1928-29 the number of those offices dealt with was 9, and the remaining four will probably be converted during the present year.</P>
      <P>The number of telegrams forwarded during the year 1927-28 was (ordinary), 2,929,957, and in 1928-29 the number was 2,411,806.  The number of Press pages in 1927-28 was 91,674, and in 1928-29 it was 87,477.  The number of messages delivered in 1927-28 was (ordinary) 3,091,219, and in 1928-29 the number was 2,601,115.  The number of Press pages delivered in 1927-28 was 139,970, and in 1928-29 the number was 137,086.  Deputies who may be inclined to compare these figures with those given in last year's statement should remember that the figures given last year for the year 1927-28 were necessarily estimates, and were only approximate figures. They had to be changed when the actual figures were ascertained. These changes were only slight and will make no real difference in any conclusions drawn from them.  In regard to the number of Press pages there was a mistake last year in quoting the number of Press telegrams rather than the number of pages.  Press telegrams are generally quoted in numbers of pages. That does not necessarily mean a page but rather a certain number of words.  Last year the number of Press telegrams was quoted instead of the number of Press pages.  It may be taken that the number of Press pages quoted here are accurate in so far as they relate to 1927-28, and they are as accurate as they can be for the year 1928-29, as we have not yet got the actual figures.  The indications from these figures are that ordinary telegrams both forwarded and delivered show a decrease of about 16 per cent., and that the number of Press telegrams shows a slight decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of telegrams per head delivered, contrasting the year 1923-24 with 1928-29, are, respectively, 1.25 and 0.9.  A similar <Col N="2009" /> contrast in regard to the number of telephone messages shows that the figures for 1923-24 was 5.4 and for 1928-29 it was 7.0.  That indicates a general extension and increase in the number of telephone messages per head of the population, and a contraction in number of telegraph messages. In that connection I might also give some figures showing the number of telegrams per head in various countries. This is the list: Australia 3.1, Belgium 0.7, Canada 1.4, Denmark 0.6, France 1.3, Germany 0.6, Great Britain and Northern Ireland 1.3, the United States 1.9, and the Irish Free State 0.9.  The reason I give these figures is that they indicate that the Irish Free State is but one of many countries where the number of telegrams per head of the population is comparatively trifling and that the general tendency is to increase telephone communication as compared with telegraphic communication.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the question of the effect of the increased charge, perhaps it might be well to give an indication to the House of the general tendency of telegraphic traffic, because that in itself must indicate the policy that is to be followed.  Speaking last year on the same subject, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>....The telegraphs, which are gradually yielding to the telephones, may be regarded as being in a transitional and declining stage.  It may be taken, however, that although a declining service, it is not a dying one, and will remain essential to the comfort and welfare of certain members of the community.  Owing to the necessity for maintaining our lines in good working order, and the impossibility of reducing the staff in exact proportion to the declining revenue, our unit loss on telegraphs may possibly be greater as traffic decreases.  On the other hand, a traffic increase, <Col N="2010" /> while decreasing the unit loss, might possibly increase the gross loss.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, what is indicated in the paragraph I have quoted is practically what has happened&mdash;the revenue taken on the basis of the old rate of charge has decreased. The unit loss per telegram has increased, but the gross loss on the telegram&mdash;that is the loss to the Post Office service and to the State &mdash;on the telegraph system has decreased.</P>
    <P>If I were to outline the policy which must naturally develop from the trend of the telegraph and telephone traffic, it would be that the telegraph service, as reduced to present proportions, may be regarded as an essential service, necessary to provide means of rapid communication between persons who could not otherwise get into quick communication with each other.  As it is a subsidised service, it should be provided at the least possible cost to the general taxpayer.  It must not be subsidised to the extent of adversely affecting the traffic of the telephone service, which is an expanding service, practically self-supporting, and absolutely essential as part of the system of agricultural and industrial development.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of increased charges, the precise figures are not available at present, but the estimated figures which are available will serve to give a general indication of the effect of the increased charge of sixpence per telegram. Before entering into details of the effect of this charge, I want to point out that it was originally proposed to enforce this charge in the Budget resolutions, but it was found that it was not practicable to enforce it until a much later date, so that the increased charge did not come into operation until 1st August.  The following statistics of telegraph finances may be of interest.  In 1927-28, the expenditure under the head of Telegraphs was £378,016, and in 1928-29, £355,100, showing a decrease in expenditure of £22,916. The revenue for 1927-28 was <Col N="2011" /> £223,733, and the revenue in 1928-29 was £223,610, showing a decrease of £123.  The revenue was approximately the same as in the previous year.  The loss on the telegraph service for the year 1927-28 was £154,283.  The loss on the same service in 1928-29 was £131,490, showing a decrease in the loss of £22,793.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that it was not stated at any time that the revenue from the telegraph service would increase by the amount of the anticipated saving.  In this connection I want to quote a statement made by me last year which indicates my views as to what the effect would be:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It should be mentioned that in the statistical statement furnished in this Estimate no cognisance is taken of the effect of the imposition of the additional charge of 6d. to the minimum rate for telegrams.  This change is estimated to effect a saving of about £66,000.  This saving will be reflected in the deficit shown on the telegraphs and in the deficit shown on the general accounts.  It will reduce the total estimate deficit on the general accounts for the year to £263,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might say that the position is much more favourable than anticipated, as the amount of the deficit on the general accounts is not likely to exceed £194,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise that it was not indicated that the revenue from the telegraph service would increase by the estimated amount of £66,000, but it was estimated that a saving of that amount approximately would be made, and that this saving might be made in <Col N="2012" /> various ways or by a combination of various ways.  It might be made by an increase in the revenue from the telegraph service; by a decrease in expenditure; by an abnormal accession of revenue to another service, due to the increased charge; or by the prevention of loss in the service which would otherwise have occurred. As a matter of fact, what has happened is a combination of these various ways by which we said a saving might be made.  The estimated saving was £66,000 for twelve months or at the rate of £44,000 for eight months, so that in so far as it is necessary to justify the estimate of savings to be made it is only necessary to justify £44,000, because the £66,000 was the estimated saving for twelve months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the loss on the telegraph service is about five times greater than the postal, and four times more than the telephone, although the telegraph revenue is only one-ninth of the revenue earned by the combined services. The tendency of telegraph revenue was to decline, and of loss to increase.  As the telegraph service was subsidised to a considerably greater extent than either of the other services, the Dáil, on the proposal of the Minister for Finance, agreed last year to an increase in the telegraph rates in order that the service would be made less unprofitable to the taxpayers by requiring the telegraph user to bear a more equitable proportion of the cost of handling his telegrams.  It was made clear at the time that the higher rates would only reduce the loss&mdash; there would still remain a big deficit which cannot be cleared by internal economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will probably expect to know what the effect of the increased rates has been.  At this stage it is not possible to give precise information on that point.  The increased rates have only been in force since August last, i.e., two-thirds of the financial year, and moreover the <Col N="2013" /> commercial accounts, only from which definite conclusions can be taken, will not be completed before October next.  It is, however, possible from certain statistics available to give an indication of the effect of the extra rates.  In the four months of the financial year&mdash;April to July &mdash;when the old rates were in force it is found that the declining traffic in telegrams was responsible for a loss in revenue of about £5,900, or at the rate of £17,700 for a full year. The decrease in traffic was 8 per cent.  After the introduction of the new rates in August the rate of traffic decline increased to 25 per cent, but a revenue improvement at the rate of £6,000 a year took place.</P>
    <P>It must not be assumed that a decrease in telegraph business involves a loss of revenue to the Post Office.  The quick communication services of the telegraph and the telephone carry between them an increasing amount of traffic, but there is a diversion from the one to the other.  The higher telegraph rates have accelerated that diversion.  It need hardly be pointed out that a transfer of business from a service carrying a heavy and permanent loss to a service which at present is almost self-supporting, and which tends to become wholly self-supporting, is on sound financial lines.  The revenue from telephones during the past year increased abnormally&mdash;by about £29,000&mdash;and of that increased revenue a substantial proportion&mdash; the exact amount cannot be ascertained&mdash;represents business transferred from the telegraphs.  The decrease or the diversion of telegraph traffic has enabled economies to be effected in that branch of the service.  The full effect of such economies will not be felt in the past year's working which, however, will show a reduction in expenditure of £23,000.  That amount will, it is expected, be increased to at least £26,000 during the present year.</P>
    <P>To sum up the arguments that I have been giving in regard to the <Col N="2014" /> increased charge on telegrams and to show that the anticipated saving of £44,000 for eight months of the financial year is taken into account I think it would be well to give a summary of the figures that I have already given in general terms.  I pointed out if Deputies approached this from the point of view of anticipated increase of revenue from telegraphic services they were looking for something which we never attempted to show would happen. We did foreshadow that a saving at the rate of £44,000 for the eight months would take place.  As a matter of fact, we are satisfied that savings of that amount in the various services of the Post Office due to this particular charge have taken place.  To sum up, the anticipated savings for the full twelve months was £66,000; the anticipated saving for the eight months, 1st August, 1928, to 31st March, 1929, was £44,000.  The loss in revenue&mdash; 1st April to 31st July, 1928, was £5,900.  Therefore, the proportionate loss in revenue for the twelve months ended 31st March, 1929, was £17,700. The estimated revenue for the year 1928-29 was £223,610, and the estimated total revenue for 1927-28 was £223,733.</P>
    <P>To explain these figures again, what they indicate is that a loss is shown in the first three months of the financial year of £5,900 and that there would have been a loss in revenue of £17,700 at the end of the financial year, whereas in actual fact the revenue was approximately equal to the revenue for the previous year, so that it indicates that a rectification of revenue to the extent of £17,700 took place because of the increased charge of sixpence on telegrams. Allowing in addition for the decrease in expenditure as a result of the reduction in traffic the actual decrease was more than this, but we allowed for the decrease in expenditure which we believe was directly attributable to the increased charge and to the decreased number of telegrams <Col N="2015" /> of a sum of £20,000, and that added to £17,000 makes a sum of £37,000.  In addition to that we must allow for an abnormal increase in telephone revenue caused by the diversion from telegraphy of £8,000, and all these figures show a total of £45,000, which accounts for the saving of £44,000, which we estimated would take place.  There is no doubt there was an abnormal increase in telephone revenue.  It increased at a very much greater rate than in previous years.  To anybody who follows these figures&mdash;and I acknowledge it is rather difficult to follow them on an occasion of this kind; they are really figures which would be much better dealt with if we were sitting round a committee table, but as Deputies wished to have them I have given them&mdash;they indicate that we are satisfied that the saving anticipated on the telegraph service because of the increased charge of sixpence has been effected.  The matter can be approached from various other angles, but no matter how you approach it it tends to show that a considerable saving has been effected in the Post Office service because of the increased charge.</P>
    <P>Passing from the telegraph service side to the stores branch, which is another comparatively important section of the departmental working of the Post Office, I want to say that during the year 1928 the contracts placed by this branch were as follows: contracts to the extent of £216,937 on Saorstát manufactured articles; £41,946 on British manufactured articles; £55,088 on articles produced in other countries.  The reduction in purchases as compared with 1927 is largely due to reduced Army and engineering requirements. The Post Office Stores Department acts as a purchasing branch for various other departments.  The sum of £11,053 was spent on purchasing outside An Saorstát articles which could be manufactured within An Saorstát.  This was due to the fact that the lowest prices quoted by Saorstát manufacturers were not <Col N="2016" /> within the preference percentage allowed by the Minister for Finance in favour of goods produced in An Saorstát.  During 1928 a total preference of £3,085 was granted on contracts to the value of £216,937 placed in An Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The question of obtaining increased supplies of stores from foreign sources is still being actively pursued, more especially in the case of items which are under the control of British ring firms.  The principal items procured from places outside Great Britain during the year were:&mdash;154½ miles lead covered cable at a cost of £8,134; 34,400 insulators at a cost of £510; 102½ tons bronze and copper wire at a cost of £15,328.  There are various other activities of a very important and interesting character carried out through the branch.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to deal with one or two of the comparatively unknown activities of the Post Office.  They are not very well known to the general public and might be of considerable advantage to them.  There is the express delivery system.  I want to inform Deputies that all information in connection with these matters is to be found in the Post Office Guide.  It is also not generally known that there is such a thing as express delivery of messages sent by telephones.  Rules governing this are to be found in the Post Office Guide on page 275.  On account of the decreased use of the telegraph it may not be known to the general public that it is within their power to send messages by phone from any place where a telegraph call office exists to any other telephone exchange and when the message reaches that exchange it will be written down and forwarded by express messenger to the person to whom the message is being sent, and will fulfil to a large extent the functions of telegrams and will be cheaper.  The only charge will be the ordinary charge of sending a telephonic message and the payment, approximately the payment for the delivery of telegrams, to be <Col N="2017" /> paid to the express messenger who is sent out with the telegram.  There are also railway letters and there is cash on delivery, which is not taken advantage of to the extent to which it might.  There is also a phonogram by which messages can be sent and received by telephone.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Department is, I believe, the largest employer of labour in the State, the established staff employed by the Post Office Department numbering 4,397, the unestablished staff being 8,135, the grand total being 12,532.  The service given by the staff in the Post Office during the past year has, in my opinion, been satisfactory.  I believe that, generally speaking, it will be found that the Post Office officials have been attentive to their duties and courteous to the public. Promotion in the Post Office is necessarily somewhat slow.  The various grades in the Post Office are such that the lowest paid servants employed are far the greater number of the officials of the Post Office Department and the higher posts, what might be called the plums of the service, are comparatively few. It is, however, a fact that avenues are open to promotion to all, from the highest to the lowest, and that a boy messenger can hope to attain any position in the Post Office service. As a matter of fact, all the higher officials of the Post Office have graduated from the ranks of the Post Office service.</P>

      <P>The General Post Office, it is expected, will be open in July of this year.  It may be of interest to the Dáil to know that it is the intention of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to issue a centenary commemoration stamp in connection with the O'Connell Centenary. Owing to the short time at our disposal we have been rather rushed in our preparations of this stamp, but the preliminary engravings have been prepared, and it is hoped <Col N="2018" /> that a stamp will be available for issue around the time of the actual centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want again to emphasise the statement which I made at the beginning that the Post Office Department is the nearest approach to a business undertaking of any Department of the State, and that on that account it is not too much to ask that Deputies should approach it from the point of view of its being a business undertaking, and that as far as possible controversial and political matters should be kept apart from a discussion of this kind.</P>
      <P>As far as the policy of the Post Office is concerned, it seems to me within the limits set to it by Parliament that it should be our policy to bring it as closely as possible within the limits of a commercial undertaking. We have been hampered in that regard by the fact that we inherited a system which was devised for a country with much greater resources than ours, and a much thicker population, but we feel satisfied that, taking into account the special circumstances applicable to this country, the services rendered by the Post Office are as satisfactory as could be expected.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. Before I enter into any criticism of the Estimate itself, I must certainly pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary for his staying powers.  He has certainly given us a very exhaustive account of the activities of the Post Office service, so much so, that whilst he has displayed an amount of staying power himself, I am afraid the Deputies could not stand up to it.  If the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary were prepared with a view to confusing the House, he could not have done better.  Also, if he had done nothing else than helping to prepare such a long-winded statement, then I say he must be very industrious.  It is only right, perhaps, at the beginning that I should pay a tribute also to the courtesy and efficiency of post and <Col N="2019" /> telegraph officials as a whole.  I certainly join with the Parliamentary Secretary in that tribute at least.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening remarks, amongst other things, that Deputies should endeavour to discuss this Vote from the point of view of a business proposition rather than that of public utility.  I think our aim should be rather the other way about, and that those words should be transposed, and that we should endeavour to approach this question from the point of view of public utility rather than that of a business or commercial proposition.  Surely, the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that in every civilised country the Post Office and such social services as these are never looked upon as an ordinary commercial proposition, and it has never been suggested in the most modern countries that they should be a paying proposition when they render a decent public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to a matter which has occurred in Cork city. It has been considered, as part of the economy campaign, I suppose, necessary to discharge a number of workers from the Engineering department. These employees are mostly married men with dependants. The wages paid to these men are about £2 10s. 0d. a week.  I think it will be conceded by anybody having any knowledge of the work performed by these men that they were not overpaid.  They had of necessity to be absent from their homes for very long periods at a time, and their work is acknowledged to be of great importance and utility to the community.  We may be told it is part of the policy of retrenchment and economy which the Government may feel necessary, but I would ask why begin this policy of retrenchment and economy on the lower paid wage earners.  I suggest that there are many other avenues through which economy might be achieved, without throwing out of employment this very large number of men who <Col N="2020" /> for a time, of course, will be able to receive something in the nature of unemployment benefit through the labour exchanges and ultimately will be thrown on the rates.  In the end the community will have to maintain these men and their families. I am not going to suggest for a moment that if these employees were going to be redundant in any way that the State should continue to employ them, but I do suggest that it is false economy.  The work of maintenance and repair in the engineering branch, as most Deputies know, is not perhaps so apparent or obvious as that of the postal side.  These men were engaged, as I have already said, many times long distances away from their homes and from their headquarters on the maintenance and repair of telegraph poles, wires, derricks, and so on.  Whilst we here acclaim the virtues of the Minister for Agriculture, for instance, and whilst we subscribe largely to the great improvement he has brought about in regard to butter, eggs, and so on, I say that the very people who will suffer as a result of the curtailment of these social services will be the farmer, the shopkeeper and the merchant, to whom it is absolutely necessary to have quick and ready contact with the outside public.  In my view, and in the view of any people who have given this matter any consideration, the policy of the Department should be greater efficiency.  They are not going in this case to get better and more efficient service, but rather less service and less efficiency, with consequent loss to the country.  We say that there is plenty of scope for the activities of these men.  Going round the country, I have seen myself where certain of these services have been neglected.</P>
    <P>They are badly in want of repair, and if that state of affairs is allowed to continue, some of these days we will have representations made from the Chambers of Commerce, Farmers' Associations and others as to the lack of services at perhaps the most <Col N="2021" /> crucial times in their business dealings. We know, from time to time, owing to the effects of a storm or gale, that wires are blown down and telegraph communication is delayed. We know that the elements, like some of our politicians in this country, are rather uncertain things, and at any moment there may be a breakdown in these services.  It may occur when many of these trained and efficient men are scattered or perhaps rendered less efficient by a long term of unemployment, and I cannot understand the idea underlying what I suggest is false economy.  We do know that the telegraph service is a ready and easy method of contact, and it is wrong, in my view, at this stage in our history, when we have development, particularly in agriculture, when we are expecting greater development, and when we are engaging in further enterprises, to interfere with this very vital and important service.</P>
    <P>I do not like to have to make these comments.  I recognise the good work that has been done in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I recognise that there are conditions in the service that are not the worst and that there are very many capable administrators in the service, courteous and efficient men, but I would not be doing my duty were I to let this Vote pass without comment, and commenting in the only possible way I can, that is to suggest to the House that this Vote should be referred back for further consideration.  There are many Deputies in this House who have perhaps greater interest in these men than I have.  I may be considered an altruist in this particular direction. These Deputies belong to every party, and I hope that they will make themselves articulate, as they have promised these men to protest against their discharge, because of the fact that they are not redundant and because the work is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he would cause inquiry to be made in his Department to see if anything could be <Col N="2022" /> done to keep these men employed. I know the work is there, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will admit, or his officials will admit that this maintenance work is absolutely essential.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will undertake to do that, I will be prepared to withdraw my motion.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked Deputies to approach the consideration of this Estimate in a somewhat different spirit from that in which they approached the consideration of other Estimates.  I think it is due to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should congratulate him on having himself approached the consideration of this Estimate in a different spirit from that usually adopted by other Ministers.  Unlike other Ministers, he has gone to considerable trouble to place at our disposal information relating to the work of his Department, which will be of considerable assistance in making up our minds as to whether it has been efficiently managed or not.  Other Ministers, as Deputies will have noticed, are more anxious to conceal information relating to their Departments than to reveal it.  Because of the information which the Parliamentary Secretary has placed at our disposal, we are able to judge more clearly the value of the services which the Department is giving to the people and the value we are getting for the cost it involves us in.  If Ministers would take the same trouble to give Deputies information relating to their Departments, the discussion on these Estimates would in future be much more valuable than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are special matters in relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that we wish to make reference to.  He will recollect that he invited us to approach the consideration of the Estimate and accounts in the same spirit as the members of a joint stock company would approach the consideration of the accounts of that company.  If we were members of a joint stock company assembled to discuss the <Col N="2023" /> administration of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs during last year, I think most Deputies will admit that the first thing we would ask for would be the accounts.  It is impossible for us to know whether our company is being efficiently managed and whether we are getting value for the money expended unless we have the accounts. We have not got them.  It is now over three years since the accounts of the Department were published. In 1926 the accounts for the previous four years were published and nothing has appeared since.  I do not see how we can approach the consideration of the work done by this Department in anything like a critical spirit unless we have the accounts made available.  No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why they are not made available. Some time ago I asked the Minister for Finance why the commercial accounts for the years 1926-27 and 1927-28 had not been published, and he informed me that the accounts for the year 1926-27 had been audited, and would be published in due course.  That is not good enough.  It is not fair to the Dáil to ask Deputies to vote a very large sum of money in respect of a Department concerning which we have only estimated figures when there are available audited accounts of the working of that Department for the year 1926-27.  It is not asking too much that the accounts for 1926-27 should be made available in the year 1929.  We would be justified in demanding that the accounts for the year 1927-28 should be made available in 1929.  If we are going to get only the accounts of the Department for four years, then I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary should ask us to approach the consideration of his Estimate as members of a joint stock company would approach the consideration of the affairs of that company.  The Post Office is a commercial Department. It should be considered as such, even though Deputies might be reconciled to that Department being worked at an annual loss.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony has stated that it is never suggested in any other country that the Post Office should be a paying concern.  I do not know where Deputy Anthony gets his information, but, as far as I have been able to discover, there are very few countries in which the Post Office is not actually a paying concern. It certainly is in Great Britain, and there is no reason whatever why it should not be made a paying concern here.  I do not mean to suggest when I say it should be made a paying concern that staffs should be dismissed unnecessarily, that wages should be cut down, or that other hardships are to be inflicted on the community.  You can make it a paying concern without reducing the services given or the wages paid to the workers which, in many cases, are abnormally low.  The deficit upon the working of the Post Office has been very substantially reduced, as the Parliamentary Secretary informed us, since 1922.  He estimates this year that it will not exceed £194,000.  He appears to have erected in his mind a barrier against any further reduction.  He seems to take it for granted that in this country, because of the special conditions that prevail, with a preponderance of the rural over the urban population, the actual wiping out of the deficit is not possible.  If it has been possible to reduce it by £900,000 in seven years, I think with very little additional effort it can be made completely to disappear, and we might possibly have in this country, even as in England, an annual surplus in the Post Office which could be used for the relief of general taxation, for the reduction of postal charges, or the extension of services.  The fact that the deficit has been reduced does not indicate that all is well with the Post Office expenditure.  The estimate for 1929-30 is only 3.4 per cent. less than the actual expenditure for 1927-28. Despite the fact that during that period there has been a fairly substantial automatic drop in salaries and wages, due to a fall in the cost of living index figure, I think the <Col N="2025" /> decrease in the amount paid in wages, due to that fall in the cost of living, exceeds the actual reduction in Post Office expenditure.  The net expenditure in the Post Office since 1922 fell slowly until the year 1926-27, when it rose, and in the year 1927-28 the net expenditure actually exceeded the expenditure for the year 1926-27.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>As shown in the commercial accounts, the expenditure has progressively decreased for all years since 1922.  The expenditure for 1926-27 as shown by the commercial accounts was £2,357.715, and for 1927-28 the net expenditure on all services was £2,335,059, which shows an increase of something like £22,000.  I think the Deputy must have wrong figures, because there was a progressive decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only go upon the figures available in the Appropriation Accounts and the Estimates. I have already pointed out the commercial account has not been made available to the Deputies for these years.  However, that is a minor matter, and there is no need why we should actually spend much time over it.  But it does appear that the figures for all the years show that there has been a very considerable slowing up in the decline of expenditure.  On the other hand, as I was pointing out, the payments to the Exchequer in 1927-28 were less than in the year 1923-4, though in excess of the two previous years.  The estimated net receipts for 1928-29 are less than the year 1927-28.  I know that merely making statements like that is of very little value, because anyone can play tricks with figures.  The Parliamentary Secretary, consciously or unconsciously, has been playing some tricks with figures in the course of his statement.  I might possibly be <Col N="2026" /> accused of playing tricks with figures.  We could each prove each other incapable of telling the truth by twisting figures.  But twisting figures carries us nowhere.</P>
      <P>When we come to examine the position in the various branches of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we get a clearer insight into what the actual position is.  First of all, let us take the Postal Department. The estimated loss for the Postal Department for this year is £27,000.  That is a very considerable improvement on each of the previous years since the Post Office was taken over by the Free State Government.  It is something upon which the Deputies of all parties can congratulate themselves.  It will be noted, however, that it is only in the actual item of letters that there is in fact a gain.  Possibly the decline in the deficit is due not so much to an increase in the efficiency of the service, but to a decline in the volume of those items which represent the annual loss.  There is a gain and there has always been a gain from the letters.  But in printed matter, papers, newspapers, postal packets, registered correspondence and money orders there has been a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>These have all increased.  The numbers have increased. The numbers of the non-paying services have practically increased since last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear. Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean to imply that the loss is less this year than last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total loss is less.  The number of non-paying articles has increased.  Therefore, the increase in the gain is due to the saving on the essential paying portion of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to this proposition as to how the Post Office can be made a paying service and how the annual deficit can be wiped out, we have got to examine all these items in the postal grants which represent the loss, printed <Col N="2027" /> matter, papers, newspapers, postal packets, registered correspondence, money orders, and so on.  Every one of these items, each single one of these items handled by the Post Office represents a loss recorded.  If the number of items are to be substantially increased, I take it that the loss would be increased, though not in the proportion of the increase in the number.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if the service were wiped out altogether, the Post Office would stand to gain by the amount of the annual loss.  For instance, last year the Parliamentary Secretary estimated that the loss upon the sending of newspapers at a special rate through the post was £70,000.  It seems to us that the sending of newspapers through the post at a special rate is in the nature of a subsidy to commercial concerns.  Newspapers are commercial concerns formed for profit, and when the taxpayers are asked to foot a bill of £70,000 each year in order to enable these concerns to get their goods to the people at a specially low rate, that is, in my opinion, unreasonable, in view of our financial and economic position. It will be, however, very difficult to make out a strong case for it.  It seems to me that there is, on the other hand, a very strong case for our readjusting rates so as to wipe out that loss.  If the practice of sending newspapers through the post were discontinued, we would gain £70,000.  That is the meaning of these figures.  If the sending of these papers through the post was to continue and the rates increased, this loss of £70,000 would be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable from the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has made available, that the number of newspapers delivered here exceeds the number posted by something over two millions.  Two millions, therefore, represent the foreign newspapers which come in here through the post in the year.  I do not know if the International Convention to which the Post Office here subscribed would rule out any <Col N="2028" /> possibility of collecting a delivery charge on those foreign newspapers. Possibly it would.  I take it they are not considered to be parcels, and I understand only parcels are to be exempt from the International Convention. But if it would be possible to devise any scheme by which the delivery charge would be collected upon foreign newspapers coming into this country, it would, I believe, be a very useful plan to adopt, because not merely would it help to reduce the Post Office deficit considerably, but it would help traders in this country by inducing the persons requiring those newspapers to buy them from the shop instead of getting them direct from the producer.</P>
    <P>The loss upon registered correspondence is estimated at £145,000.  It was pointed out here last year that this loss is due to the fact that the registration fee is not sufficient to cover all the processes involved in dealing with valuable mail items. Again, it seems to us that persons requiring the advantages of registration should not expect the general taxpayer to subsidise him.  If I wish to send a letter or parcel in a special manner to somebody throughout the country I should be prepared to pay whatever the extra cost is involved in sending that letter in that special manner.</P>
    <P>When a person registers his letter or parcel he is merely asking the Post Office to take special care of it. There is no other advantage in it, because, unlike the system that exists in other countries, that packet will be delivered at the address, not necessarily to the individual.  In France and in other places the postman will not deliver a packet except to the actual person, or to the person who claims to be the actual person. If that person is not convenient the postman will not deliver it.  He will take it back again.  Here the postman delivers it at the address and takes the signature of any person in the house for that packet.  Apart altogether from that, it is my view that the fees for registration could reasonably be increased so as to reduce that loss of £145,000 by half.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2029" /> I find that on the delivery of parcels there is an estimated loss of £90,000.  It is probably a very rough estimate.  We find that the parcels delivered exceed the numbers posted by approximately one million.  That is a figure anyway given for the year 1928-29 by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The estimate for 1926-27 was much lower.  In that year the number delivered in excess of the number posted was only 400,000, so that it would appear from the Post Office Estimate there is a very substantial increase in the number of parcels delivered here and the number posted outside the country.</P>
    <P>That increase in the number of parcels is possibly due to the practice which has grown up of shopping by post.  Most Deputies who read any of the English newspapers know that there are large pages of advertisements asking persons to send a deposit of sixpence or a postal order to get their articles direct from the manufacturer.  In that way a fairly substantial trade has been built up between this country and England. A number of people adopt the advice given in the advertisements and get over these parcels by post.  As a result of that shopkeepers here have been complaining of a considerable loss of trade, and it seems reasonable that the Government should be asked to take action to stop that practice, which is detrimental to Irish industry and to the national revenue. Some years ago a delivery charge of sixpence was imposed on such parcels, and the immediate effect was to reduce the number coming in considerably, but that was only temporary. The number of parcels coming in from outside now is actually in excess of what it was before the additional charge of sixpence was imposed. In any case, if we are faced with a loss of £90,000 on the delivery of such parcels, I think it is time that we should seriously consider an increase of that charge.</P>
    <P>If we were to wipe out that loss or reduce it considerably we would be doing the taxpayer a good turn, and by interfering with that particular <Col N="2030" /> form of traffic we would be doing the traders of this country a good turn also.  The fact that there is a substantial trade of that kind going on is also borne out by the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to postal orders.  The number issued in this country exceeds substantially the number cashed by over £160,000.  We can take it that that gives additional proof that the practice of sending postal orders to England for goods to be sent back by post has increased considerably.  When we find on the one hand that the number of postal orders issued exceeded the number cashed and that the number of parcels delivered exceeded the number posted we can conclude that that is so.  So much for the postal services.</P>
    <P>Now I want to get to the telegraph services, with particular reference to the additional charge of sixpence which was imposed last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary estimated last year that the deficit on the Telegraph Department would be £101,500.  Now he informs us that he estimates that loss at £131,490.  The expenditure upon telegraph services, he also stated, decreased by £23,000, while the revenue remained stationary, the loss being approximately £23,000 less than that in the previous year.  If we examine these figures we will understand the full significance of what has happened as a result of the imposition of the additional charge. We find that the people paid the same amount for telegraph services, but received considerably less service. I recollect, in a discussion on the Telegraph Bill last year, that numerous Deputies on these benches pointed out that the decline in the use of telegrams as a result of the increased charge would almost inevitably be such as to ensure that there would be no increase of revenue.  The figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary now bear us out.  Instead of there being an estimated saving of £66,000 as a result of the increased charge, there is only a saving of £22,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary may attempt <Col N="2031" /> to prove that the increase in the use of telephones was such as to compensate for the decrease in the estimated saving on telegrams.  I think that he has given no figures to prove that the increase in telephones this year has been, in fact, anything more than normal.  There has been a steady increase in the use of the telephone service during the last three or four years.  It does not appear that the increase has grown with any abnormal rapidity this year.</P>
    <P>Reverting to telegrams, we find that the revenue has not increased, but has remained stationary. Despite the fact that an additional charge of sixpence was imposed, there was no increase under that heading, but, if the people paid the same amount in that respect, the actual amount of service they received was less by an amount represented in cash by £23,000 or, as the Parliamentary Secretary informed us, by a twenty-five per cent. decreased use of telegrams.  I am not quite sure if twenty-five per cent. was the figure which he gave.  He said that it was eight per cent. in the four months before the charge was imposed, and twenty-five per cent. in the next eight months. When we examine the figures given in the commercial accounts for telegraphs we find that there has been no reduction in the administrative cost corresponding with the decline in the use of services.  It is possible that such reductions could not take place because, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, as the service declined the unit loss, or the loss on each individual telegram, was increased.  That tendency has been considerably accentuated by the increased charge.  I doubt if the increased charge will help the Post Office to balance its accounts.  It seems that the attitude which was taken up by those who opposed the increased charge last year was correct and that we would have had a smaller loss now if the charge had been left the same.  It does not seem at all clear to us that the reverse would have been the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> When we come to consider the position of telephones, we get another situation.  The loss upon the telephone service grew very rapidly from the year 1924 until last year. The charges were reduced in 1924, and since then there has been a very rapid increase in the loss on the service, an increase which it is hoped to arrest this year.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his remarks, made repeated reference to the telephone branch as being a practically paying branch.  I am not clear what he meant by that, as he estimated a loss on that branch this year at a figure which exceeded considerably the loss on the postal branch.  It is not clear that a service, on which it is expected to lose £35,000, and on which we were losing only £3,000 in 1924, can be described as an almost paying service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy knows that there was a considerable decrease in charges in the year 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That accounts for the increased loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said that the loss since 1924, when the charges were decreased, has been increasing substantially.  We hope that the Minister's estimated figure will be realised, as it would indicate that such a loss is being now actually reduced.  We hope for a reversal of the tendency in future.  The growth of the deficiency in the telephone service has, of course, been considerably accentuated by the fact that the capital liability has been increased, involving higher charges for depreciation and interest.  It is noticeable, however, comparing the year 1924-25 with the year 1925-26, the last year for which we have the commercial accounts&mdash;I would not have selected these years if the figures for any later year were available&mdash;although there was a decrease of some £12,000 in revenue from rentals, there was an increase of practically the same amount, £12,800, in administrative expenses.  Salaries <Col N="2033" /> went up by £12,937.  The cost of maintenance was decreased by £3,920, although the cost of supervising the maintenance was increased by £788.  In other words, although there has been a decrease in revenue and in the actual cost of maintaining the system, there is an increase in administrative costs and in the cost of supervising the maintenance of the system.  That seems to indicate that as the visible source of supply dwindled, the demands made upon it increased.  It does not suggest that there has been proper supervision over that department. If there had been, I think that with a growing deficit and a declining revenue, there would not have been any increase in administrative expenses at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the introduction of the Estimate last year I had occasion to draw attention to the very substantial increase that there had been in the staff of practically every one of the departments of the Post Office.  In the Secretary's and Solicitor's Office, for example, a staff of 112 in 1922-23 and of 119 in 1923-24 became 127 for the year 1928-29.  In the Accountant's Office the staff taken each year from 1922-23 was:&mdash;1922-23, 200; 1923-24, 200; 1924-25, 200; 1925-26, 211; 1926-27, 213; 1927-28, 273, and 1928-29, 273. Similarly, in the Stores Department the staff in 1922-23 was 114, in 1923-24, 136; in 1924-25, 149; in 1925-26, 145; in 1926-27, 150; in 1927-28, 164, and in 1928-29, 163.  In the Engineering Branch, a staff of 489 in 1922-23 became 554 in 1924-25, 563 in 1925-26 and 574 this year.  In practically every branch of the administrative side of the Post Office there has been that very steady increase in the number of officials.  The staff of the Secretary's Office, of course, reached its maximum in the year 1924-25 and then declined, but the staffs of other headquarters offices continued their increase.  The percentage increase between the year 1925-26 and the year 1928-29 is:&mdash;In the Accountant's Office, 29.4; in the Stores Department, 9.4; in the Engineer's Department, .9.  There has been, of course, a decrease in the number of <Col N="2034" /> the staffs in the metropolitan and provincial offices.  In other words, while the number of those actually carrying out the services of delivery and collecting the post has been decreased, the number of those directing them, the number of brass hats at the top, has been growing equally rapidly.  If the staffs were in this year 1929-30 no higher than the number found necessary in the year 1925-26, there would be a saving of practically £25,000.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to see any civil servants dismissed merely for the sake of having a reduced Estimate, but we do stand, and stand very firmly, for what has been called ruthless efficiency in all Government Departments. We do not think that there should be any man or any woman in the employment of the Government for whom there is not need and who is not quite competent to fulfil efficiently the duties of his or her position.  It we want to provide relief for persons out of employment, we ought to provide relief by other means than employing them in Government offices.  If there was need for a certain number of officials in the Post Office in the year 1925-26 there does not appear to have been any substantial increase in the work done by the Post Office as would necessitate the very substantial increase shown in the staff this year. The Estimate for the Stores Branch, for example, for this year shows an increase over actual expenditure for the year 1927-28 of £1,100, or almost 2 per cent.;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and those who are directing the policy of the Post Office appear to think that because, let us say, of hard work in the past, or perhaps because they have been able by good fortune to reduce the deficit in a rather spectacular manner, they can now stop. That is not so.  I do not think the efforts should be relaxed until the deficit is wiped out.  There does not appear to be any reason why the Post Office in this country, as in Great Britain, should not be a paying service.  The deficit this year, as estimated by the Parliamentary Secretary, is £194,000.  If the various <Col N="2035" /> suggestions which I have made were put into operation it would be possible to change that deficit into a surplus without inflicting any undue hardship upon any section of the community.  We could, for example, adjust the rate for newspapers, so as to wipe out the loss of £70,000.  We cannot afford, in our present circumstances, to subsidise commercial firms of this sort.  I do not believe in subsidies of that kind.  Similarly, we are suffering an annual loss of £19,000 in giving special rates for the transmission of Press telegrams. That is a subsidy, and that could be so modified or abolished as to wipe out that loss.  If that suggestion is adopted a sum of £89,000 will be taken off the deficit.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the additional parcel delivery fee which I suggest should be imposed, was decided upon, another saving of about £25,000 could be realised.  The case for that is very strong without reference to the Post Office accounts at all.  The growth of the practice of shopping by post with London houses is not something that we would like to encourage. It rests with the Post Office to stop it, and they can stop it with financial advantage to themselves. Also, if the suggestion which I made to increase the registration fee for registered correspondence, so as to reduce the loss upon that item by one half, was adopted, we would save another £75,000.  Again, if the staff of the various headquarters offices were reduced in 1929 to the level that was found sufficient in 1926, another saving of £25,000 would be secured. There are in the service of the Post Office quite a number of officials with very high salaries&mdash;salaries of over £1,000 per year.  If these officials, with salaries exceeding £1,000, were reduced to that figure, and if those just slightly under £1,000 were modified in a corresponding manner, without inflicting any considerable hardship upon the individuals concerned, because a man can live with some tolerable degree of comfort on £1,000 a year, there would be a saving of at least another £6,000 or <Col N="2036" /> £7,000.  Certainly I think that saving should be effected before any reduction is attempted in the wages of men at the bottom, or any scheme adopted to diminish the services given by the Post Office which would involve the dismissal of those men at the bottom.</P>
    <P>If the various suggestions which I have made&mdash;I can make other suggestions if necessary&mdash;were adopted, the deficit would be changed into a surplus.  It might then be possible for us to consider the possibility of reducing the rates for postal delivery.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that if we were to reduce the letter rate from 2d. to 1½d., which is the English level, it would cost £241,000.  I think I am correct in assuming that that estimate leaves out of account the possibility of increased business following a decrease of the rates.  It is my belief that if the Post Office was, as the Parliamentary Secretary asked us to consider it, a joint stock company, and if we were the directors of that company facing up to the position, we would probably decide to reduce our charges rather than to increase them in that particular item of letters, which is, in fact, the only item paying at present.  Because the letter post is paying us we should foster it, and I believe it would pay better still if the charge was reduced at least to the British level of 1½d.  It is only in respect of services upon which we are suffering a steady annual loss that we should endeavour to place restrictions by way of increased charges, knowing that if these services disappear altogether we shall gain rather than lose.  But in the matter of the delivery of letters the reverse is the case.</P>
    <P>I put these propositions before the Parliamentary Secretary and I ask him to consider them.  I know that he is anxious to put the Post Office upon a sound basis just as much as we are.  He has repeatedly given expression to that view, not merely since his adherence to the Government Party, but before.  I do not wish to re-open old sores by making reference to the various criticisms of <Col N="2037" /> the Post Office the Parliamentary Secretary was responsible for before the great turn-over, but I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, even in these days, cannot altogether forget the promises of his youth; and if he remembers them in time he will be anxious to try to take some steps to translate them into fact.  He has an opportunity of doing what he himself suggested when he was in opposition, and I hope he will do it. He is not altogether going in the wrong direction; he is going in the right direction, and it merely requires an effort to speed up the work and to hasten the progress.  But because it has not yet been done, and because we are not satisfied that the right spirit animates the higher officials of the Department, we are going to support Deputy Anthony's amendment.  We feel that those responsible for the control of the Department&mdash;the higher officials&mdash;are too anxious to seek for economies at the bottom, to seek for economies by reducing services, or cutting salaries, or dispensing with the lower-paid employees, whereas if they set about the task properly they could obviate the necessity for that form of economy while, at the same time, putting the Post Office on a paying basis by tackling it in the manner indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary and the Post Office staff have reason to be congratulated on the statement that we have heard this evening.  The Post Office is a gigantic machine, and I do not know that there is any Department in the State which has had to function under greater difficulties during the past six or seven years.  A saving of £900,000 has been effected since 1922.  Whilst we all would like to see and would encourage economy, and are glad that that saving has been effected, I should like to say that sometimes false economy is attempted. I am very pleased that the recent suggestion with regard to the reduction of services in the country, which would have saved £40,000, has been definitely abandoned.  This curtailment of services would have <Col N="2038" /> penalised a very large number of deserving people who are in receipt of 13/-, 14/- or 15/- per week and who render very valuable service.  They deliver letters round the country to persons who live at considerable distances, and I am pleased that that false economy has been definitely abandoned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the telephone service, I must say that it is very much improved, and the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has given are very interesting.  The revenue was £343,000, and the expenditure £378,000, the deficit being £35,800. Certainly, it does seem some consolation to the subscribers that they are not blistered as much as I considered they were blistered, because the charges certainly appeared to be very high.  From the figures that have been given here, it is apparent that the subscribers are gaining and that the Post Office is losing.  There is one matter I should like to refer to which may not be generally known.  It is in connection with fixed time calls.  Any person can, by paying 25 per cent. more than the ordinary charges, get into direct communication at any time of the day or night with any place in Great Britain.  If you want to talk to a person in London at 10 o'clock at night by going to the Post Office and asking for a fixed time call and paying 25 per cent. extra you can telephone to that person.  I was glad to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say in connection with provincial development, and I agree with him that step-by-step development is the best way, and that in connection with rural telephone extension success must depend on the support given by the business people in the smaller towns and the residents in the rural area.  I hope that these extensions will be developed, because they are being very much used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to telegrams, I do not like the increased charge of sixpence. Whilst we may have made a saving, I know that it has done harm to us in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where people have to pay 50 per cent. less for telegrams than we <Col N="2039" /> have to pay here.  The result is that, as the figures have shown, people are using the telephone now instead of the telegraphic service.  There has been a decrease of £23,000 on the telegraphic service and an increase of £29,000 on the telephone service. Taking everything into consideration. I am quite satisfied that great improvements have been made.  I see no reason why this Vote should be referred back, and I am surprised that the amendment should come from the Labour Party, because, of course, the chief Opposition Party want to refer everything back, whether good or bad.  I hope Deputy Anthony will see his way to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote against the amendment.  I was unable to be present to hear the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, but as I have criticised the Vote on previous occasions I want to make it perfectly clear that, although I am not quite satisfied with matters at the present time, I do not think that anything could be gained by referring it back.  In the first place I congratulate the Executive Council in not carrying out their determination to lessen the postal services throughout the country by the dismissal of so many servants of the lower grade, as was contemplated. I think that was a very good thing indeed.  There were two matters with regard to which I offered severe criticism on previous occasions, and one of these was the telephones. I have used a great deal of bad language in the past in regard to telephone operators, but I may say now, since the automatic machines have come into use, they have been a very great success.  If we still have to ring up the Exchange, the same mistakes are still liable to occur, although I must also admit that the amount of incivility one gets now is very small compared with the amount of incivility one used to get in former years if one had a complaint to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> The other point I was strong on was the fact that I could not get my letters in the morning until I came back to the house for lunch.  I had been frequently summoned to a meeting of the Selection Committee of the Dáil and the letter did not reach me until one o'clock although it summoned me to a meeting that was to take place at eleven o'clock. The Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs has looked into that matter, and since he has made arrangements I have no cause for grumbling because the letters are now delivered in time.  I am dissatisfied with three or four other points. I think it was a mistake to increase the cost of telegrams.  I believe with Deputy Lemass that there is no question but that telegraphic communication would be used more frequently than it is if we had not put on this extra amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw, I think, made a mistake as to what the cost of telegrams outside is.  If a person in Northern Ireland should telegraph here it would cost him 1/6, whereas if he sent the same telegram to England it would only cost him 1/-.  He pays the same as we pay for a telegram, so that it is, I suppose, a sort of retaliation. Deputy Lemass was perfectly right, to my mind, when he said that as far as the amount paid in letters is concerned, if we got back to the 1½d. postage there would be so much more communication and so many more stamps used as to more than make up for the deficit of £240,000 stated by the Parliamentary Secretary as the actual loss that would accrue by the reduction of the extra halfpenny.  I agree with Deputy Lemass when he said that a mistake was made in the mathematical calculation there, because I believe that there would be such an increase in the number of letters posted owing to the reduction of the cost from 2d. to 1½d. that the loss would be more than made up.</P>
    <P>Now we still have the grievance, I think, about the 6d. that has to be paid on small parcels, and on books that come through the parcel post.  It is not the ordinary post but parcel <Col N="2041" /> post.  I think that is one of the things now that causes me, perhaps, to use some of the bad language I used to vent upon the operators at the Telephone Exchange sometimes.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the figures of the Estimates.  The figures approximately show a net decrease of £192,000, and, of course, that is a step in the right direction, but it is a small amount when one considers that the Post Office Estimate amounts to something like £2,300,000.  A diminution or decrease in that amount by less than £200,000 is not a great deal.  I agree with Deputy Lemass, also, that it is a great pity to make any reductions fall upon what I might call the working services.  Of course, every man is a working man, but as far as the lesser paid officials are concerned I think it is a great pity that cuts should be made upon them without adequate cuts being made in all directions in the service.  I would like to press upon the Parliamentary Secretary that these people with the small wages are less able to afford cuts than those, as Deputy Lemass said, with much larger salaries.  I only wanted to say that the grievances I used to have have to a large extent been removed, and that so long as the Estimate is decreasing I would be prepared to vote for this Estimate.  But I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take into serious consideration the suggestions made by Deputy Lemass to reduce the letter rate to 1½d.  That and the reduction to the old rate in the cost of telegrams would probably result in a larger financial gain than the Parliamentary Secretary has any hope of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a number of grievances under which the staff of the Post Office are labouring at the present time.  In doing so I would like first to focus attention on the question of the necessity for rebuilding the Sorting Office of the G.P.O. in Dublin. As is well known, Dublin is the chief forwarding and distributing <Col N="2042" /> office in the Free State, and that being so one would naturally come to the conclusion that it should be the largest and most important office in the country.</P>
      <P>Instead of that we find that as far as Dublin City is concerned the chief sorting office is housed in a disused distillery in Pearse Street.  As far as accommodation for the staff is concerned, in Pearse Street it is utterly inadequate and insanitary. I understand that the staff have been working in this insanitary building in very congested circumstances for upwards of four years. I understand that this question has been brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and the reply given is that the question is at present under consideration and that negotiations are going on with the Dublin Corporation in regard to the street widening proposal and that consequently the matter has been somewhat held up.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite this matter so that the people will not have to carry on under the insanitary conditions in the old distillery which is supposed to be the sorting office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to draw attention is in connection with the Engineering Department. I understand that a number of labourers working at present in the country are under notice of dismissal. Some of them have been dismissed in Cork.  As well as that, I understand that some of them are under notice in different parts of the country.  Also, it is contemplated that a larger number will be dismissed in the near future.  I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that they have given from five to seven years' service and that whilst these men are dismissed I understand that there is plenty of maintenance work at present held up upon which these men could be employed owing to the fact, as the Post Office allege, I understand, that they have not the necessary funds. While the Engineering Department have been putting forward the contention that they have not funds at <Col N="2043" /> present, it might be interesting to point out to the House that in this particular Department thousands of pounds can be spent on automatic telephones for which there is no public demand and on which the saving is only problematical.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider these matters with a view to retaining these men whom he is contemplating to dismiss on work which is absolutely necessary maintenance work.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter to which I would call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary is in connection with the new post office at Lifford.  Lifford is just on the border of Co. Donegal, one hundred yards or so inside the Six Counties. I would like to point out to the House, and more especially to the Parliamentary Secretary, that when the Border was first established, as far as the postal services were concerned, they were in an absolute state of chaos.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will probably admit that.  Up to a few weeks ago, in fact, the staff responsible for the postal arrangements, as far as Lifford was concerned, were working in a couple of railway carriages, not ordinary carriages as you know them on the Great Northern or the Great Southern Railways, but narrow-gauge carriages, belonging to the County Donegal Railway, in a very insanitary condition.  Although the staff did that, have carried on as well as they could, and got things into proper working condition, I understand that as far as these men, who are working under trying conditions, are concerned, the Post Office contemplate doing away with their services and bringing into Lifford Post Office a number of established men to take their places.  I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary, as far as that staff in Lifford is concerned, that they have carried the Post Office Department through a very trying time.  The Post Office were confronted with difficulties there that did not exist in any other part of the country.  They have <Col N="2044" /> brought the Post Office to a proper state of efficiency, and I say it would be very ungrateful if these men were thrown on the scrap heap and others brought in.  I think at least the vacancies should be held for those who carried on so manfully, and that they should be put on to the established staff.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy Lemass referred is that of the minimum charges for telegrams.  That peculiarly affects Donegal, being as it is a Border county.  I would like to point out that, in my opinion, more especially within ten or twelve miles radius of the Border, the Post Office is losing money by this increase.  For instance, during the fishing season in Buncrana, which is about ten miles from Derry City, it is usual for fishermen to send approximately one hundred telegrams per day.  One hundred telegrams handed in at Buncrana at 1/6 per telegram would amount to £7 10s.  Those fishermen, if they so desire&mdash;it shows the futility of partition in this country&mdash; could pay a messenger boy 1/- to travel to Derry City and hand in those telegrams.  As a result of 1/- they could save £2 10s.  They could get those telegrams sent for £5, and in any place in the Saorstát they would have to pay £7 10s.  That is a question the Post Office should take into consideration.</P>
    <P>References have been made, I think by Deputy Sir James Craig, to the abolition of the sixpenny tax as far as parcels are concerned.  I want to say definitely and clearly that I am against that for the simple reason that I believe that if you abolish that, people in England, Scotland, Wales and the Six Counties are going to send small consignments to Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, and thus get over the question of the tariff.  I believe that can be done easily if the sixpenny tax is removed, and I urge that it should not be removed.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his remarks, stated that the number of letters received from other countries exceeded the <Col N="2045" /> number which we sent out, and he made mention of the fact that this particular matter was governed by an international convention, and there was no possibility of getting readjustment.  He also made reference to the fact that at a conference to be held very soon in London by the Post Office, the Australian delegates are going to raise this question of readjustment&mdash;that the countries getting more letters than they are sending out should have some sort of readjustment.  I think the delegation we send across to attend that convention should back up the Australian delegation in order to get readjustment. I believe there is a deficiency. We get in more letters than we send out, and I believe that is one of the reasons that there is a deficiency.  Owing to the fact that we handle more, we are at a loss. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into those things, the matter of the G.P.O., the matter of Lifford Post Office and of the engineering staff.</P>

      <P>There are only a couple of matters I want to refer to in connection with this Vote.  One is the question of the cost of telegrams in the Free State.  It is, to my mind, a retrograde step to have increased the amount for sending a telegram from 1/- to 1/6 for this reason, that far more business would be done if a telegram cost only 1/- than is done at present.  To my mind, we would have a distinct increase in the revenue of the Post Office if it were brought back to 1/-. Deputy Cassidy has gone into the mathematics of the thing, and he is perfectly right as far as he has gone in the matter.  He referred to Lifford Post Office.  There is another matter in connection with Lifford that I would like to refer to.  Lifford has been made the central Post Office for Donegal, I understand. Lifford ordinarily is a place in which it would not matter very much whethere a man was English-speaking or Irish-speaking, because there is no Irish spoken in it at all.  Being the central office for Donegal, however, a lot of correspondence must pass <Col N="2046" /> through this office which is destined for areas which are Irish-speaking. On that account, the man who is responsible for the office in Lifford should have a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  I understand&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the gentleman in charge of the office there has not a competent knowledge of the Irish language, which means that some junior official in the office must do the work which that man should be competent to do. I have no objection to the gentleman himself.  I do not know the man, but I have been informed, whether correctly or incorrectly, that he has not a knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that the County Council of Donegal recently refused to appoint a girl as a clerk who was competent in every branch of knowledge that she was required to have, except the Irish language, with the result that they made her go to school and pass a qualifying examination before they would give her the appointment.  The same thing should apply to the man who has charge of Lifford Post Office, because a lot of correspondence from Government Departments and from people in Scotland and America comes in Gaelic and he should have a knowledge of the language.  The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that a man is appointed who has that knowledge. He need not penalise the man who is at present there.  He can give him an equal appointment anywhere in the country, but there should be a man in that post office who is competent to carry on the duties that he should carry on in a place which is one of the Gaeltacht areas outlined on the map issued by the Government.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Anthony has done a useful public service in drawing attention again to the type of economy that has been effected in the services of the Post Office.  The figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary, indicating a very substantial saving, are interesting, <Col N="2047" /> but if the savings made under the different headings are of a similar kind to the saving that prompted Deputy Anthony to put down this motion, then their value is a doubtful quantity.  Some members of the House who have been in touch with this matter already have got information with regard to the position that obtains in Cork at the moment.  We have again an exemplification of the policy of throwing out of employment people who have nothing to look forward to as an alternative to that employment.  I have here a list of people immediately affected by this proposal.  In a great many cases they are the fathers of large and helpless families.  When we consider that the basic wage of the people thrown out of employment, as a result of this change, is a very modest one, something like £2 or £2 10s. a week, and that above and beyond that, as has been stated, on very good authority, there is necessary work for such men, it is very hard to understand the reasons that prompted the decision.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what consideration he has given to the case that has been submitted on behalf of the men concerned, and whether he has any answer to the contention that the men concerned could be engaged on useful work at the moment.  It seems rather an extraordinary policy that people of that kind are to be thrown out of work and compelled to look for unemployment insurance money or for outdoor relief, when their services could be utilised by the State department concerned.  If that be the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and we have no reason to thing it is not, because we have a good many examples of it already.  I do not know that there is any apology needed for moving that this matter be further considered.  The fact that the telephone service that he is particularly interested in has been adjusted to suit the needs of Deputy Sir James Craig does not affect the position that has been indicated in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> We are certainly dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied, not alone with this aspect of the postal service, but with the lack of facilities in many other cases.  We have in different places reasonable demands for services.  I know of some towns in West Cork where demands have been submitted to the Post Office for several months for reasonable postal deliveries during the day or for a second delivery, and though the feeling officially was in favour of that demand, and a very fair case was made for it, we have heard nothing about the demand since.  I want to call attention to the demands that are being made and to the lack of postal facilities in many places.  People in many parts of the country are not concerned with automatic telephones so much as with the ordinary postal needs.  I suggest that this matter should be considered in the light of what the people need. I disagree with the view that has been expressed that this service should be regarded as a business proposition, and that we should look at it from the point of view of directors dealing with the particular affairs of their companies.  I hold that these services should be looked on in the same light as other social services, and that the convenience and the needs of the people as a community should be considered rather than the amount of revenue to be derived under one heading or another from the particular Vote.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again as strongly as I can my protest against the action of the Department in cutting down the number of labourers employed on the outdoor engineering section, and to ask that there should be some consideration given to the areas in the country that have pressed, without success up to the present, for facilities that they ought to be entitled to.  I support Deputy Anthony's motion, and hope that we will have some revision, of the decision that has been taken in this matter with a view to continuing the employment of men who have considerable periods of service, who have large families to look after, and who are ready to perform useful work in <Col N="2049" /> the capacity in which they have been hitherto employed.  It would be a very undesirable thing to put such men on the scrap heap or to compel them to become a charge on public funds.</P>

      <P>A year ago on this Estimate I complained about the inefficiency of the telephone service in the rural areas.  There has been no improvement since in that service. It is very evident that the instruments in use are obsolete.  I pointed out that the hearing was very bad, and a Deputy indicated that it was due to atmospherics and that my complaint was due to the fact that I had not a receiving set.</P>

      <P>On the telephones. It is evident, as I pointed out then, that the telephone apparatus in the rural areas is very bad and new installations would require to be put in.  But apart from the actual apparatus, the system of telephones seems altogether wrong.  Take, for instance, Mullingar and Delvin. They are ten statute miles apart.  To get a telephone ring from Mullingar to Delvin the call has to go through Dublin, a distance of over 100 miles. Then there is a wait of half an hour or an hour before you get the call. One would get from Mullingar to Delvin and back in his car in that time.  That not only applies to Delvin and Mullingar, but to Delvin and Castlepollard, and various other areas.  I pointed out last year that to get a service from Meath to Westmeath, or from Louth to Westmeath, one has to go around through Dublin. A direct line of telephone would save expense and make the service efficient, which it is not at present. That is in reference to the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate last year, and I daresay in the debate to-day, reference was made to the impartiality of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the giving of employment.  There is no impartiality in this Department in the giving of employment.  As Deputy Murphy pointed out, men with long years' service as auxiliary <Col N="2050" /> postmen are passed over when it comes to the case of placing an established postman.  Men of no experience, but simply because they were in the National Army, are put over their heads.  I had occasion to write to the Minister on this particular matter, with reference to a case in my constituency, and I got the following reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 10th January on behalf of (so-and-so), I am directed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to express regret that there is no work available in this Department for which the particular individual could be considered.  It may be explained that the officer in question was employed in the Delvin Post Office as a boy-messenger from 1920 to 1924, and that his services were dispensed with on account of the abolition of his post.  No promise of further employment in this Department was at any time given to him.  But up to 1928 it was found possible to provide him with intermittent work of a purely temporary nature in the absence of an ex-National Army candidate. Under the existing regulations, preference must be given to ex-National Army men for any temporary or part-time positions which arise in the Post Office, and as there is now a suitable ex-National Army soldier available in the the Delvin area, it is regretted there is very little prospect of this man being requisitioned in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I also wrote about an auxiliary postman being established in the Glasson district, but the reply I got was that owing to certain Civil Service regulations a man who would be a messenger boy like this individual would get the post in preference simply because he was a member of the National Army.  Not only that but when I took up the cases of these two men the Department of Posts and Telegraphs wrote to them very stiff letters threatening them with dismissal for airing their grievances through me and telling them they were not entitled to do any such thing.  Now it is evident to us, from these cases, and others, that positions in the Post <Col N="2051" /> Office are absolutely reserved for ex-National Army men, whether they are fit for the positions or not.  Men with long years' service as auxiliaries are passed over, and there is no impartiality whatsoever in the service. I will go further and say that the efficiency of the service is on this account impaired.  There are men placed in positions in my area who simply because they were in the National Army were given them. Some of these men are hardly able to read.  It is a well-known fact that in the rural areas in Westmeath men are employed as postmen who cannot deliver the letters on their route. They drop them into the wrong houses.  Of impartiality there is none.  I do not know whether the heads of the Post Office are Freemasons or Knights of Columbanus. It strikes me they are a kind of Ku Klux Klan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the figures which have been given the House this evening by the Parliamentary Secretary will serve a useful purpose, if not in the course of this discussion, at any rate for future reference.  I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to two of the four items in the Estimate, where there has been an increase in the figures for the coming year, and in which I consider there should be a reduction.  We have been informed by the Parliamentary Secretary, in the statement read to the House this evening, that association with this International Conference has led to very satisfactory results. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a supplementary question with regard to the number of representatives which this State sends to such Conferences and the expense incurred. I find in the reply which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to that question that decisions which are not unanimous are not operative.  Therefore, we have it that if any dissension or difference of opinion is disclosed in these Conferences no result comes from the discussion.  That is, in cases where there is a difference of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> I cannot see why it is necessary for this State to send three representatives to any International Convention or Conference when we could be equally well represented by one.  In the Estimate this year there is an increase of £305 under this sub-head.  The Estimate this year is £1,205.  Under the sub-head the details are given, and I am surprised to find that the subscriptions to the International and other conferences amount to £660. There is a decrease from the previous year, where the Estimate was £880.  Strange to say, travelling expenses and subsistence allowances are £360 as against £10 in the previous year, and in the matter of incidental expenses there is set out £185 as against £10 in 1928-29.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to accept the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, who is also Chairman of the Economic Committee, that he is anxious to find items in the lists of the Estimates, including his own, where savings could in the national interest be effected.  I am drawing his attention to this particular case, where I believe a saving could be effected without hurting anybody. I believe we could be represented by one individual at this Convention.  I say so for this reason: I believe that an agenda is supplied to the Department of State or to the individuals who are going to the Convention.  If the Department of State is supplied with the agenda, which will set out what is to be discussed at the Convention, the individual who will represent the Department can have consultations beforehand with technical advisers or heads of the Department, and he will be enabled to put the Free State Post Office point of view before the Convention.  That will obviate the necessity of taking with him two individuals for excursion purposes.  We are not in a position&mdash;and I can refer to the Parliamentary Secretary's own words&mdash; to increase our expenditure under a heading of this kind for the reasons I have given.  If we send one in future as against three in the past, it means that the saving that would <Col N="2053" /> be effected would represent wages that could be paid to 14 provincial postmen.  My contention is that what could be saved in this way would employ 14 provincial postmen. The Parliamentary Secretary seems to doubt my figures.  I understand that the average wage paid to provincial postmen amounts to 22/- per week.  That saving would almost accurately represent the yearly wage for 14 postmen.</P>
    <P>Under the sub-head dealing with superannuation and other non-effective charges, I notice there is an increase for the coming year of £17,050. I wonder to what extent is the increase here concerned with the dissatisfaction which exists amongst old servants in regard to promotions?  I happen to know a good many Post Office officials.  Anybody in contact with them knows there is a great deal of discontent.  Some of it has been given expression to in this House, particularly with reference to unfair promotions that have taken place.  I suggest that the increase in the superannuation charges particularly affecting the Post Office is due to the fact that men with long and efficient service are being overlooked and preference is being given to people simply because they come from a particular county or a particular part of the country.  I would like to know if there is to be any increase under that sub-head, and, if so, why?</P>
    <P>I received two complaints within the last twelve months from constituents of mine.  The complaints dealt with interference with letters coming through the post.  In the two cases which came under my notice, the parties concerned could not be charged with, or suspected of, activities in connection with anti-State agitation; in other words, they are not, and their families are not, associated with any organisation.  In one case letters were addressed to a young lady, and she had absolutely no connection with anti-State activities such as are going on at the moment.  I made inquiries, and I have been informed that there is a high official in the office of the Minister for Justice charged with the <Col N="2054" /> power of serving notice upon the Post Office authorities to hold up letters addressed to certain people who may be suspected of anti-State activities. I want to know to what extent that power exists, and, further, when the power is exercised, what becomes of the letters handed to the Detective Department for the purpose of scrutinising the nature of the correspondence.  I heard in a few cases that letters were allowed to lie in the Detective Department of the Ministry of Justice for a fortnight or three weeks.  What is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary or the heads of his Department in regard to letters of that kind? What is the arrangement where letters are found not to disclose matter relating to anti-State activities?  I would like to know whether such letters are returned to the Post Office for delivery within a reasonable time and whether responsibility for failure to deliver them lies with the Minister for Justice or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a serious matter, and it affects the confidence of the citizens in the administration of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I agree with several Deputies who protested against the increase in the charge for the forwarding of telegrams. I think the Parliamentary Secretary's figures prove that the increase has not justified itself up to the present, at any rate.  I prefer to look back to the time three or four years ago when the Parliamentary Secretary, led by the then leader of the Farmers' Party, advocated an inclusive charge for the forwarding and delivery of telegrams.  It would be much more satisfactory if the increased charge would now be accepted for both the forwarding and the delivery of telegrams.  It is very unfair&mdash;I do not want to repeat protests made here before&mdash;that citizens have to pay 1/6 for delivery as well as 1/6 for forwarding a telegram, especially in a case where the telegram is for the benefit of the sender and not the receiver.  If the charge for sending telegrams is reconsidered&mdash;and I hope it will be&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, for reasons he gave to the <Col N="2055" /> House two or three years ago, will see how necessary it is to sanction whatever revision there may be in such charges which will for the future include delivery as well as forwarding.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there were 73 new telephone exchanges set up during the last financial year.  What was the average cost for the installation of these telephones in whatever areas they were installed?  I and other Deputies representing the same constituency made representations on at least two occasions to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department endeavouring to persuade him that telephones should be installed at certain places.  We got a reply, without any figures being given in support of it, indicating that the installation of a telephone at such-and-such a place would not justify the expenditure involved.  I would like to know the average cost for the installation of the 73 telephones referred to.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the policy of the Post Office authorities which requires postmen to report the existence of wireless aerials on their routes, and even attend court and give evidence in cases where wireless licence defaulters are prosecuted.  I think it is a wrong practice and a bad policy to force the postmen, who are very poorly paid officials and most of whom are in temporary employment, to do the duty of what I think should be a police officer.  Any person who has a wireless set and who has not paid the licence, which by the law he is obliged to pay, is guilty of an offence under the law, and that person should be dealt with by a police officer rather than by a postman.  The postmen have to keep the people on their hands; they have to be friendly with the people, and it is very unfair, especially in the case of a temporary postman, to expect him to report on an individual to whom he delivers letters; an individual who may have powerful influence, and whose influence, if exercised behind the postman's back in the shape of an anonymous <Col N="2056" /> letter, may get the unfortunate man into trouble.  It is really a police officer's duty, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will arrange that officers of the law and not temporary postmen will be called upon to perform this obnoxious duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to try and understand how it could be possible for Deputies to take the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary and judge this Vote, not as a Government Vote but as a report of a joint stock company. I imagine that if Deputies were shareholders in that joint stock company they would want to be suffering from psycho-pathological optimism to retain their shares in that company.  First of all, the Parliamentary Secretary, who would probably be the managing director in that concern, tells us that he is creating a saving by making the deficit smaller.  In other words, if you save one year as against another on the deficit you are doing well.  The total deficit in the years to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred amounts to over £4,000,000, so that your company would want to be very strong financially to maintain its progress, particularly in view of the argument which the Parliamentary Secretary brings to bear on the question.  On the one hand, he says that by imposing an extra sixpence on telegrams you reduce to a certain extent the traffic in telegrams and thereby reduce the loss which you had on the telegraph end and you transfer that traffic to the telephone department.  He says at the same time that where you increase the telephone traffic you increase your loss and, instead of making your loss less, and instead of approaching at some time or other a profit in the telephone department by all the improvements you are making and all the facilities you are giving to people to take greater advantage of the service, you are thereby going to inflict on the ratepayers a greater deficit each year. These are the arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> Take telephones, for instance.  The telephone installations are evidently of a very huge nature from a capital point of view.  If we examine items M (1) and M (2) in the Estimate for the years which the Parliamentary Secretary took into review when introducing this Vote, we find that while we took over debts in the shape of annuities on debt created under the Act of 1921 a certain amount had to be reduced each year, and you find that in 1926-27 the annuity in that particular item amounted to £42,000.  In 1927-28 it was reduced to £40,000, in 1928-29 it was reduced to £38,000 and now it is down to £34,000, roughly at the rate of £3,000 a year.  Now, take the capital account in respect of debt created under the Act of 1922.  In 1926-27 the amount of the annuity was £25,000, in 1927-28 £42,000, in 1928-29 £58,000 and now it is £71,000. Add to that the superannuation item, about which Deputy Davin spoke, and you find that in the telephone department, while everyone is anxious to have it increased from the point of view of utility, there must be something wrong if the arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary are correct.</P>
    <P>The only way that we can judge it is as a utility service and not as a joint stock company, which, no doubt, would only run such services as would prove to be a paying proposition. If the Parliamentary Secretary looks up the report of the debate on the financial Motion, in regard to the increased cost of telegrams last year, he will see that I pointed out what would happen and, as a matter of fact, Deputy Cassidy to-day mentioned that it did happen.  In areas around the Border people are crossing the Border and sending telegrams from the Six Counties, so that we are not only losing the extra sixpence, but also the cost of sending the telegram. Deputy Cassidy has illustrated that, and I am sure he is in a position to substantiate his statement. The Parliamentary Secretary should surely be in a position to find out if that is not the case.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave figures, <Col N="2058" /> and the manner in which they were given, as Deputy Anthony pointed out, was confusing inasmuch as it was impossible to follow them.  For instance, I was interested in a particular item, namely, newspaper deliveries. I understand that the system adopted by the distributors of newspapers is that they buy from the Post Office franked labels.  They then bring the parcels to the railways and distribute them themselves. If the Parliamentary Secretary is taking credit to his Department for the distribution of newspapers so handled it would be better to clear the air in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would draw his attention is the reception and distribution by the Post Office of parcels containing dutiable goods from outside the Saorstát to domestic trading concerns.  What happens in that case is that many concerns order goods which come in by post and many of them get samples. If these come from foreign countries and happen to contain dutiable commodities the concern receives a notice from the Post Office stating that the parcel was opened and was found to contain dutiable goods and, as they were not declared, the concern was liable to a penalty and the goods could be confiscated. What should be done in that Department is what is done in all other countries where a parcel is suspected of containing dutiable goods and where no declaration was made on the outside.  In that case the person or concern receiving the parcel should be notified that the parcel is there so that they could send a messenger or go in person to have the parcel opened.  If the goods are dutiable the duty would then be paid, and if it is not paid the goods could be confiscated.</P>
    <P>I think that the system here is a loose way for the State to handle consignments to individuals.  They open parcels in the absence of the consignee.  Where the Post Office authorities suspect dutiable goods, they should send for the consignee to attend in person or send a messenger, and have the parcel opened in his presence to see whether the goods are <Col N="2059" /> dutiable.  The constant reception of these threatening notices by traders is a source of great irritation.  The matter could be easily adjusted, and thus worry to a great number of traders could be saved.  I have received numerous complaints in this respect.  There was, for instance, a case in which an individual in America sent a present of a gold watch to his aged father.  The old gentleman received a note from the Post Office stating that the parcel had been received, that it contained a dutiable commodity which was not declared as such, and that he was liable to be fined a certain penalty and also liable to lose the watch. That is stretching matters too far. It is true that year by year the gross deficit has been reduced.  As I said before, if we were to take the Parliamentary Secretary at his word, and if we were to judge this Vote as we would a report of a joint stock company, the only way we could treat it would be, as Deputy Anthony wants, to refer it back for further consideration, because if we were to place confidence in it as a joint stock company as shareholders, we would require to be suffering from psycho-pathological optimism if we were to continue as shareholders in that particular concern.</P>

I am afraid that that is a very doubtful asset to this country.  He did not state what proportion, if any, was collected on behalf of Irish firms.  It strikes me that we should not give any help to cross-Channel firms who advertise in papers circulating in this country, with the result that people are induced <Col N="2060" /> to send away for goods that they could very easily obtain at home.  These goods in many cases may be of inferior quality to the native products.  In my opinion the work of this particular branch is aiding the importation of goods to this country, and it would be no harm if it were discontinued.</P>

      <P>It would be no harm if the system were discontinued, because it is of no benefit to this country whatsoever.  Complaints have been frequently made in this House with regard to the status of Waterford City Post Office.  I understand it is placed in a grade which is not in keeping with the importance of the City of Waterford, and that towns which have not a population as large as Waterford have offices of a higher grade than Waterford City Office.  The result is that officials of that office are paid a lower salary than those working in the offices of a higher grade.  I understand attention has been frequently called to the matter.  I am not sure whether it has been rectified within the past twelve months. <Col N="2061" /> If not, it would be well that the matter should be adjusted now.</P>

      <P>I intend to be very brief, as I have only a few questions to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. We are asked to view this Department as a business concern or as a joint stock company.  I do not know that that would be possible, in view of the fact revealed by, I think, Deputy Davin, that correspondence is held up in the course of transmission through the Post Office if certain people are suspected of anti-State activities.  I understand that last year the President said that this practice had been discontinued.  Perhaps my memory deceives me.  However, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state how many citizens are on that black list, who compiles the black list, what is the exact procedure when correspondence is so held up, or is there any time limit to the delay in the delivery of such letters?  As regards inefficiency, it has been stated that owing to the method of selection of temporary postmen, letters are frequently delayed a day or more in the city.  I know that when I lived in Dublin up to some months ago, I frequently got as many as five or six letters for people living two streets away delivered amongst my correspondence, and I had to act as postman in order to get them delivered that day.  These letters were not addressed in Irish.  Of course, I have had letters sent out from my office addressed in Irish which came back to the office because they were addressed in Irish.  On the matter of telephonic communication, I have but an academic knowledge, and I should like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what the system is.  I do not ask a detailed statement, but how is there a saving, for instance, in 'phoning from Ballina to Sligo?  These towns are only thirty miles apart, but one has to 'phone from Ballina to Mullingar and back to Sligo, a distance of 200 miles.  Does the system follow the railways, or is there any great expenditure in sending the message around 200 miles when a line of 30 <Col N="2062" /> miles would be sufficient?  That is just a point upon which I would like information, if the Parliamentary Secretary would give it.</P>

      <P>I want to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary what steps have been taken with regard to the Savings Bank to enable it to compete with the existing commercial banks.  It appears that during recent years the ordinary commercial banks have made very strenuous efforts to capture the Post Office Savings business by providing thrift accounts.  In that way they get a lot of money which would ordinarily go to the Post Office Savings Bank. So far as one can see, very little effort is being made by the Post Office Department to counter that movement.  There is no need to stress the importance of an effort to counter it.  It is notorious that there is room for a good deal of investment in certain Irish institutions&mdash; some of them semi-State institutions &mdash;the money for which is not forthcoming, and it seems to me that the Savings Bank might well be asked to provide a lot of that money.  In answer to a question this week, the Minister for Finance said that of £6,000,000 invested in the British Post Office by Saorstát depositors, since the Saorstát came into existence something like £1,000,000 has been re-transferred, leaving about £5,000,000 in the hands of the British Post Office Savings Bank, upon which no more interest is given than would be given by the Saorstát Savings Bank.  At a time when everybody is regretting the export of capital from the Saorstát it seems very regrettable that the Government cannot succeed in re-transferring that money from the British Post Office Savings Bank to the Saorstát one.  The Committee on Agricultural Credit expressed great concern that all the savings bank money and Trustee savings bank money was going to England for use there, and they commented strongly on the loss that accrued to Ireland by that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surely a confession of failure on the part of the Saorstát that, in <Col N="2063" /> face of that report by a committee of people who would not, according even to the standards of the Saorstát, be regarded as extremely pro-Irish, the present Government has not been able to do anything effective to get back that money.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to say that further strong efforts will be exerted to get a return of that big sum of £5,000,000.  I think that if postmasters and sub-postmasters throughout the country were made full use of, and if it was put up to them that they were expected to interview the various depositors&mdash; apparently the depositors are known, because the Minister for Finance this week stated that circulars had been distributed to them to the extent, I think, of a couple of million&mdash;and that they were expected to convince these depositors that it was important to get back that money, one might expect a better return than that a mere one-sixth of the money should be re-transferred in the course of some six or seven years.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to say that in Dublin and in Cork, where the bulk of the Savings Bank deposits come from, the Post Office officials are being encouraged to induce the investment of more money in the Savings Bank, and are being encouraged to counter the efforts of the other commercial banks to get hold of the money, because it would be much more valuable to the State if they could get that money than that it should go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>To my mind post offices throughout the country could be made a great deal more use of in regard to collecting the savings of the people than has heretofore been done.  I think that even without legislation, the Post Office might be used for the payment of rates, the payment of debts, the payment of land annuities the collection of accounts of various kinds, and such matters as the ordering of magazines and books, and so on, and I think it should be possible to devise a cheque system by which. in the larger towns at least, the Post Office could be made as useful to <Col N="2064" /> those of small means as the commercial banks are to those of larger means.  At all events, there is admittedly a great need for getting more money for the purpose of the State.  With the machinery there, which could certainly fulfil the need to a very large extent, it is extraordinary if the Post Office are prepared to say that they cannot go any further in that line.</P>

      <P>I was very much surprised to hear Deputy Davin state that there was an official of the Department of Justice attached to the Post Office whose duty it was to supervise the receipt of letters for certain individuals in the country. Deputy Fahy mentioned that the President stated last year that this censorship of letters had ceased.  As far as my recollection goes, the President did state that the censorship had ceased.  I should, therefore, like the Parliamentary Secretary to refer to the matter and let us know the exact position.  Deputy Davin stated that there was an officer whose duty consisted of the censorship of letters.  I received a letter some four or five months ago addressed in my own name, with the name of my own post office and county on it, but, in addition, there happened to the name of an adjoining post office, which is quite near mine, and which was added by mistake. The post office officials in Galway, which is my constituency, know me very well, and in all the local post offices I am well known. I do not see, therefore, when there was a slight mistake made like that in the direction of a letter, any necessity why it should be opened. The letter had been opened when I received it.  I reported the matter to the postmaster in Galway, and I believe he did his best to discover how it happened to be opened in the post, but he failed.  That is a state of things that should not be allowed. In any case, where a letter is opened, the postmaster of the place to which the letter was sent, whether by mistake or otherwise, should be questioned, and the matter sifted in a more thorough manner than is at <Col N="2065" /> present done.  I am given to understand that the post office to which this letter was sent is frequented by the Civic Guards.  I should like to know whether the officer who is in charge of the censorship of letters can get in touch with local barracks, and whether letters can be opened in an off-hand way by Civic Guards who frequent the post office.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested here that the charge for the delivery of telegrams should be paid by the persons sending them.  That is a change which is very necessary.  I know many cases in country districts where medical officers and others who receive a large number of telegrams have to pay up to £3 or £4 a month for the delivery of telegrams sent by people who evidently do not know that the delivery charges are so high.  If those who send telegrams were charged directly at the post office where they are sent, it would be much easier for everybody.</P>
      <P>As regards the installation of telephones, that matter is proceeding rather slowly in my county of Galway. I was wondering if the Parliamentary Secretary would allow the same privileges to medical men and those who require to use telephones at night as are allowed at present to the Civic Guard.  If there is an urgent call in the country for a doctor at night it is sent through the Civic Guards, and I have found them always obliging.  But it should not be left an open matter.  It should not be left to them to take or receive messages as they will.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that medical officers and nurses' cottages, if they have telephone installations, should be connected at night through the exchanges in the same way as the Civic Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe an order was issued before the last general election that people employed in the Post Office should not take part publicly in the elections.  As far as Galway was concerned, this order was not carried out.  I know in my own constituency, Connemara, a number of personating agents of the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate were postmasters, <Col N="2066" /> postmen and other postal officials. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire into this matter, because if the order mentioned was issued, it was disobeyed in West Galway.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil does not approve of the proposed lease or licence in respect of portion of the workhouse premises, Scariff, Co. Clare, as set out in the Statement laid before the Dáil, pursuant to Section 2 of the State Lands Act, 1924, on October 11th, 1928.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would bespeak respect for the grey locks of this motion.  It is the oldest on the Order Paper, and it has grown grey in the service of the Dáil, so at the outset I would ask the Dáil to have respect for its grey hair.  I shall in brief recite the history of the Scariff Workhouse plots. Some time during the Black and Tan struggle, the Scariff Workhouse was burned as a military act and ceased to be any use as a building, and the plots were naturally supposed to be owned by the Clare County Council. On the 18th July, 1924, at a meeting of the Clare County Council the plots were formally given on an application from the Secretary of the Scariff Branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union to eight or nine people to be used for the raising of vegetables and potatoes, etc.  Every year since these people have paid a certain amount to the Clare County Council for the use of these plots.  They have tilled the plots and got potatoes and vegetables out of them to some extent, and these vegetables have been the means of tiding those people over a period of hardship and unemployment on several occasions.  That is <Col N="2067" /> very important for the people, and the Clare County Council took that into consideration, and there was no division of opinion on the matter in the Clare County Council.  The premier body in the county decided that it was so important that they had no reluctance whatever in handing these plots over to the plotholders, and since August, 1924, they have been in the possession of these plot-holders.</P>
    <P>When the State Lands Act was passed this land became vested in the State, and a certain amount of the land&mdash;a small portion, one of the plots&mdash;was required for certain use other than by the plot-holders.  I formally objected by putting down this motion asking the Dáil to disagree, but inasmuch as I was not then convinced that it was the policy of the Department of Local Government to bite continuously into these plots and cause by what you might call a policy of attrition, the sacrifice of these plots, I do not press the motion.</P>

      <P>A co-operative creamery has been installed in the building and facilities have been afforded the extension here and there of that undertaking.  I want to be quite definite at this stage in saying that I am myself whole-heartedly in favour of the co-operative creamery, and I can assure the Minister that the people interested in that project will acquit me of any desire to impede the progress of the creamery.  Now we find there is a fresh bite made into these plots.  I hold it is not necessary for the creamery or for anybody to bite into these plots to any extent.  One would want to know the district to understand the position.  There is sufficient ground for the creamery without going into the plots.  That is plain to anyone who knows the district.  What I am anxious the Minister would tell us is where is this work of attrition to cease? When these men acquired these plots from the Clare County Council they <Col N="2068" /> were of opinion that they were acquiring certain rights.  They are now five years in occupation of these plots.  I do not think the Minister will be able to say that they have not used them well.  I have gone through these plots on occasions and I have seen that they have been very carefully cultivated.  The holders have tilled the land and have spent money in the purchase of manures and fertilisers and, to some extent, they have made the land arable and turned it into small gardens.  There may be no reason for supposing that this continuous biting in is going to be the policy of the Ministry, but does the Minister contend that a lawn tennis court and a residence for a professional gentleman are of more importance than the continuance of these plots for the production of food for several families in the Scariff district?  If it is the Minister's system of economic philosophy that a lawn tennis court and a big house for a professional gentleman are of more importance than vegetables and potatoes for several families in the town of Scariff, then I am afraid I shall not agree with him, and I shall ask the House to disagree with that proposition The plotholders now apply that they may be dealt with under the State Lands Act.  Would the Minister tell us why he should not give them facilities to hold this land under the State Lands Act?  Anyhow, I hope the Minister will tell us what he proposes to do.  Does he consider those people have no rights or that this system should continue?  The plot-holders have been there for four years expending time and labour and money on those plots, and the sole purpose of this motion is to find out what the Minister proposes to do.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this motion is to find out what he proposes to do, whether he proposes to turn them down altogether or proposes to allow, as he said, lawn tennis courts or residences of professional gentlemen to grow up there.  I hope he will now tell us what exactly is his position in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad to realise that the Deputy's purpose in putting down the motion was to enquire as to the policy in the future and not to oppose, as the motion in fact suggests, the lease which is being granted to the Scariff Co-operative Society.  The matter perhaps might have been brought up in a different way, because what the motion proposes is that the Dáil disagrees with the proposal that is now in operation to give portion of the old Scariff workhouse grounds on a lease to the Scariff Co-operative Creamery Society for the purposes of their creamery.  I take it that the Deputy withdraws from the position of opposing that and that this is simply an inquiry as to what is the attitude of the Department to the disposal of such lands as remain unallotted now in Scariff.  The Deputy has correctly pointed out that in August 1924, certain persons were given, by the Co. Council, under the Short Lettings Order that was issued in March, 1924, lettings for plots in the grounds of the Scariff workhouse. Subsequently the Land Act of 1924 provided that these lettings could not be arranged except under the Act and by permission of the Minister. The position passed on till January, 1927, when an inquiry was held by an inspector sent down by the Ministry to inquire into a certain number of applications that were being made for leases of portion of these lands.  Certain people appeared before the inquiry, I think the East Clare Co-operative Society, the Scariff Co-operative Society and certain other private persons.  They made application and proposals for certain portions of these lands.  It is correct to say that the plotholders, as such, did not appear before the inquiry and did not make any formal claims there.  However, the position that developed from the inquiry was that certain lands were leased to the Scariff Co-operative Creamery at a rent of £10 a year under a lease of 99 years and certain other lands were leased to the East Clare Co-operative Society at a <Col N="2070" /> similar rent and that certain other lands remain.</P>
      <P>The leases that have already been given have impinged upon the plots that were held by some of the plot-holders. Certain proposals are at present before the Department&mdash; they are not, perhaps, very pressingly before them&mdash;for the disposal of the other lands.  The position of the Department is that the remaining portion of the land will be disposed of to the best advantage of the local ratepayers.  Every aspect of the matter having been weighed up, the Department would be of necessity both disposed and to a certain extent compelled to lease these lands that belong to the ratepayers of Clare on the best possible terms.  As far as a war of attrition on the plotholders is concerned, I will ask Deputies to accept it that in Scariff the remaining grounds that are there should be disposed to the best possible financial advantage of the ratepayers as a whole.  That will be the policy of the Department. Naturally each application for a lease must be considered on its merits, and would have to come before the Oireachtas. Deputy Hogan would rather leave me under the impression, and I am sure leave the House, that in so far as facilities were available for plotholders that they were denied these facilities.  The attitude of the Department all along has been to facilitate plotholders as far as possible.  The statement has been made that every year the plotholders who are there have paid certain sums.  I would remind the Deputy that that is not so, and that there are four persons at present in possession of plots there who have not paid rents to the Co. Council for three years.</P>

      <P>At any rate, on <Col N="2071" /> 27th November a letter was addressed to the Deputy informing him that the proposals before the House did interfere with some of the plot-holders. The letter from the Department to the Deputy stated: &ldquo;The Minister is prepared to consider whether the lands should be let to these men for cultivation in the coming season only.  The Minister, however, observes that although the lands have been there and let for several seasons, three have not paid the rent in 1926-27, and of the others four have not paid in 1927-28.  It would be a condition of any lettings now made that all arrears of rent should be paid up; it would also be necessary to satisfy the Department as to the rent and other terms of letting.&rdquo; That was November, 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary of the Co. Council reports in February that the position is, as I say, that four men have not paid rent for three years, two for two years and another has not paid rent for one.  So that the persons who are occupying those plots have not co-operated in any way with the Department or helped the Department to overcome such difficulties as have existed in allowing them to have their plots.  The attitude of the Department has been that such lands as are available for plots may be used as plots, but can only be used as plots within the strict terms of the Land Act, 1924, and with the proviso that leases will only be granted from year to year, so that more advantageous lettings of any of these lands in the interests of the ratepayers in general will not be prejudiced.  I hope that we are clear that the House does not take up the attitude that leases of any of the lands here shall not be granted to the Creamery Companies if they want these lands for business purposes and at a fairly substantial rent, on satisfying the Department and the Minister for Finance. That is all that is involved in the motion.  If there is any other point involved in the further letting of the other parts of those lands it will, I take it, have to arise on another motion.  I would like it to be understood <Col N="2072" /> that the policy of the Department is quite clear and considered in the matter, and in so far as plot-holders can be accommodated the Department is prepared to accommodate them, but any lettings for the current year will be on the understanding that the people getting these lettings will be made pay whatever arrears of rent they owe and might be expected to pay for the current year.</P>

      <P>I have considerable sympathy with what the Minister has said, if the statements he has made are absolutely accurate and if he has been properly informed by his Department.  But with the principle that he lays down when he says that State lands, and these lands in particular, will be let, if not sold, on the most advantageous terms irrespective of other considerations, I would not be inclined to agree.  If there are people like these plotholders who have been in possession, some of them for a considerable time, provided, of course, they pay whatever rents or fees they have agreed to, I do not think it would be fair to give the land to somebody because he is more wealthy and offers a rent or a price that these poor people would not be able to compete against.  I do not think I would be prepared to support the Minister in going that far, or in giving him an absolutely free hand to let these lands, or any of the lands, irrespective of considerations that ought to be taken into account, where there are poor men who can make good use of the land, who have made good use of it, and have met their obligations.  If the Minister insists on carrying out his principle that on all occasions the State is to be free to accept the highest bid without taking into account other considerations, I certainly would not agree.</P>

      <P>May I clear the matter up?  I have a letter here dated 13th February, 1929, from the Secretary of the County Council in which he explicitly states the facts. A letter was written to him on 12th February, 1929, inquiring whether the persons who had these plots had paid the arrears of rent.  I have a reply dated 6th March, stating that some of the plotholders are in arrears, and that they have promised to pay as soon as they are able.  I have had no further communication since.</P>

      <P>I am not to be taken as suggesting that the Minister is not telling us what he has information about, but I think the Minister is incorrectly informed.  I have been informed by an official of the Clare County Council that the rents due on these plots are paid up to date, and that the tenants are prepared to continue paying.  I think that disposes of that point.  The Minister asked the House to reject my proposal disagreeing with the granting of land to the Co-operative Society at Scariff.  It will be noted, although there are two proposals from the Co-operative Society in Scariff for the acquisition of some of these plots, <Col N="2074" /> that notwithstanding the fact that application has been made by these plotholders to get facilities under the State Lands Act, we find no proposal from the Minister with reference to these.  He tells us now that the plots will be let to the greatest advantage of the ratepayers.  Does the Minister suggest that the Clare County Council is not the best authority as to what would be the greatest advantage to the ratepayers in that district?  Does he suggest that the Clare County Council in 1924 did not appreciate the necessity for safeguarding the interests of the ratepayers, and does he suggest now that his Department is in a better position to see what is to the advantage of the ratepayers than that body?  I put it to him that it ought not to be a question of the highest rent that could be got for these plots.  Does he suggest that somebody can come in and buy these plots over the heads of the unfortunate people, for whom the vegetables they grow on them are an absolute necessity, and for portions of the year are the only margin between them and starvation during periods of unemployment and hardship?  We really are not objecting to the acquisition of certain of these plots, but to the fact that the Minister has given an indication that he is prepared to acquire, in part or in whole, these plots for some other purpose than what they were intended for, and that it is portion of his economic philosophy that these plots should be given to the highest bidder.  If a man wants a lawn tennis court, is he going to get these plots for such a purpose if he is prepared to pay more for the land than a man in a side street in Scariff is able to pay for his cabbage plot, or if a man wants a site for a nine or ten-roomed house is he prepared to give it to him?  I suggest that that is the policy of the Minister, and I will ask the House to vote against any action of the kind.</P>

      <P>I do not want to mislead any Deputy.  I have not said that.  I have said that portions of these plots on two different occasions have been acquired by the Scariff Co-operative Creamery quite unnecessarily. There are other portions that are not used as plots at all, and that could be acquired by the Scariff Co-operative Creamery. I do suggest that it is in the realms of possibility that a tennis court might spring up, or a nine or ten-roomed house might spring up to the total destruction of cabbage or potato plots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter which I wish to raise now arises out of a question I addressed to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on Wednesday of last week.  The question, and the answer to it, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dr. Ward asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will specify the ports at which second-hand clothing is admitted to the Saorstát, and whether he will state in detail the precautions that are being taken by his Department to insure that such clothing is not capable of conveying infectious or contagious disease.</P>
      <P>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney: I would refer the Deputy to the Small-pox (Importation of Clothing, etc.) Temporary Regulations, 1927, which came into effect on the 1st September, 1927, and are still in operation, under which second-hand clothing, used bedding and rags may only be imported into Saorstát Eireann from Great Britain and Northern Ireland through the ports of Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Galway, where it becomes the duty of the Port Sanitary authority to undertake the disinfection of the articles and return them to the custody of the Customs and Excise authorities, subject to the following exemptions: (1) articles transmitted by the postal service or forming part of passengers' luggage; (2) goods in course of transit through Saorstát Eireann to an outside destination, if suitably packed; (3) articles accompanied by a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health of the place of origin in Great Britain or Northern Ireland or of the port of arrival in Ireland that they had been efficiently disinfected; (4) articles accompanied by a certificate from a Medical Officer of Health in Northern Ireland that they had not been imported from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I think it cannot be disputed that if it is possible for second-hand clothing to get into this area without thorough disinfection, a danger to the health of the community arises out of that state of affairs.  I understand that this material is for the most part collected in public institutions in England, Scotland and Wales, in such places as hospitals, jails, sanatoria, etc., and, owing to the economic conditions existing in this country, a very big trade is being done in this second-hand clothing at the present time.  I think it is a far greater trade than any Deputy in this House realises.  I went into the approximate figures with the Customs' authorities in my own district, in the road and rail station at Monaghan, and I found that approximately <Col N="2079" /> £5,000 worth of these goods are imported through that station annually. I do not know what the value of the entire importation into the Free State would be, but it must run into a very big figure, seeing that it is so high in a station like Monaghan.  The poor people are glad to buy this clothing because of their poverty and its cheapness.  It is not my intention in this matter to deprive them of this cheap form of clothing.  What I do want to ensure is that if they are forced through economic conditions to buy this clothing they will buy it with safety to themselves, and with safety to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that in recent years the matter has been commented on by medical men that skin diseases have become prevalent and mysterious outbreaks of contagious and infectious diseases, some of them indeed of a very deadly nature, are occurring.  The origin of these diseases has not been effectively traced by the Public Health authorities. There are peculiar features in some of these outbreaks.  I drew the attention of the House on the Local Government Vote to a small epidemic of typhoid that occurred in Monaghan.  That was a fatal epidemic.  It was confined to one family, but there were four deaths.  I understand that in other parts of the county there have been similar mysterious cases with fatal consequences.  I understand further that the medical officer of health in that area attributed this particular outbreak to the importation of second-hand clothing.  As I have already said, these outbreaks have some peculiar features.  They are peculiar in their high mortality, and they are peculiar in their virulence. That suggests to me, and to more eminent authorities than I profess to be, that these diseases are not the ordinary diseases of their class that have their origin in this country.  It certainly is possible, if effective disinfection of second-hand clothing is not being carried out, that these diseases could be brought in through <Col N="2080" /> that medium.  It is certainly possible that these diseases have been conveyed through that means.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter before, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not appear to be conversant with the conditions under which second-hand clothing is being imported.  I do not wish to labour that point, but I think if the Minister is not conversant with a particular question raised here&mdash;and that question is an important one &mdash;it would be better he should admit he is not particularly clear on the matter, and that nobody should be deceived or misled by the answer.</P>

      <P>I wonder to what the Deputy is referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Minister's statement on the Local Government Vote in this House, which I will quote if necessary.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Arising out of the small-pox position in Britain, a number of months ago regulations were introduced to secure that all second-hand clothing would have to come in through certain ports and would have to be examined and disinfected there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on, at the close of the debate, I asked the Minister if it were possible, even by paying duty, for second-hand clothing to be admitted by the land frontier, and the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Customs officials cannot admit second-hand clothes; their instructions are that second-hand clothing must come in through definite, specified ports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That does not tally altogether with the actual condition of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister for Local Government at that time, and I beg to repeat the suggestion, that second-hand clothing, if admitted at all to the country, should be disinfected at the point of entrance.  If it is to be admitted across the Border by land stations it should be disinfected at the point of entry.  For that purpose it would be necessary to specify certain stations at which <Col N="2081" /> such material could be admitted.  I do not think that we should be at the mercy of any outside sanitary authority to protect ourselves in a serious matter like this, which involves the lives of our people.  The people who have to buy this particular class of clothing, owing to circumstances over which they have no control, are entitled to protection and security and, as I have said, their neighbours are entitled to similar protection and security.  When these diseases come into the country they do not recognise any social distinctions, or political distinctions for that matter.  I would like to urge upon the Minister not to approach this matter from any party point of view, because I have not raised this question for any political or party purpose.  I have many supporters amongst the people who trade in second-hand clothing, and there are people amongst them, too, who have a certain admiration for the Minister for Local Government. There is no accounting for these things, but that is an undoubted fact.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for anybody other than a medical man to grasp the importance of such a question as this.  If the Minister would obtain the certificates of disinfection that are being issued submitted to the Public Health Department, I think he would find some peculiar discrepancies.  I have not seen many of them, but I have seen some of them, and I do not think that all the certificates that purport to be issued by the medical officer of health are in the same handwriting. The Minister can verify this matter and have it put to the test. Certificates signed by some medical officers of health in the Six-County area, notably in the case of Belfast, are signed by a person on behalf of the medical officer of health.  I do not think that should be so.  If this clothing is to be admitted on a certificate that it is safe and that it has been effectively disinfected, the least that should be insisted upon is that the actual certificate should be issued by the medical officer of health himself.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a large consignment of that material at <Col N="2082" /> Monaghan Station.  If the Minister would send down one of his medical inspectors while it is there, I think the Minister would agree with me that something more stringent would be required than the existing regulations. I saw a certificate there issued by the sanitary authorities in Glasgow, and the very wording of the certificate would suggest that it was not issued even under the supervision of the medical officer of health.  The certificate set out that a number of articles had been disinfected in a certain consignment, and included in these articles were brass fittings and a frying pan.  I do not think that a medical officer of health ever issued a certificate that he had efficiently and effectively disinfected a frying pan.  The exemptions to the Small-pox (Importation of Clothing, etc.) Temporary Regulations, 1927, that I have mentioned here are really the danger: For instance &ldquo;Articles accompanied by a certificate of the medical officer of health of the place of origin in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  When a medical officer of health in England certifies that a certain consignment of clothing in the possession of a certain person has been effectively disinfected, that person can on that certificate send the consignment across here, but there is nothing to prevent such person, say in a remote town or city in England, disposing of that consignment in another part of England and sending across, on that same certificate, a substitute consignment that has not been disinfected at all.</P>
    <P>The position under the fourth exemption is not as it should be&mdash;&ldquo;Articles accompanied by a certificate from a medical officer of health in Northern Ireland that they had not been imported from Great Britain.&rdquo; How is a medical officer of health in Northern Ireland to know that articles of clothing had their origin in the Six County area?  The next point is that on the certificate of the medical officer of health in Northern Ireland that these clothes had their origin in Northern Ireland, they can be admitted without any disinfection whatever.  I think common sense <Col N="2083" /> should suggest to the Minister that we are as liable to get contagion from the Six Counties as from England, and that it is at least as necessary that second-hand clothing having its origin in that area should be as adequately and as effectively disinfected as clothing coming from anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea made by Deputy Dr. Ward for better supervision in the disinfection of second-hand clothing at the point of entrance to the Saorstát. He has dealt with the question of the danger of the spread of disease from second-hand clothing.  He has specifically dealt with typhoid fever, and he also mentioned small-pox.  In a country where the regulations are so stringent in regard to vaccination and where the Department over which the Minister presides has taken such drastic steps to enforce vaccination, we should be also equally stringent about the regulations for the disinfection of second-hand clothing at the point of entrance. In to-day's &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; it is reported that the Medical Officer of Health for Cork has stated that there is a danger of contact with small-pox in Cork.  I think in future the Minister should take every precaution to see that second-hand clothing entering, not alone Cork, but any other area, is thoroughly disinfected.  It is well known that one of the great means of spreading small-pox, one of the most deadly of diseases, is second-hand clothing.  We have an instance of typhoid fever being conveyed by bad water and sewerage arrangements.  We have had an instance within the last six or seven weeks of a very serious outbreak, and at the present moment a bye-election is pending for this House owing to an outbreak of typhoid fever.  It may not have been due to second-hand clothing, but we should not wait, as the Ministry did in the case of the Carrick-on-Shannon outbreak, until an outbreak takes place before taking proper steps.  We should not wait to lock the stable <Col N="2084" /> until after the horse is gone.  The warning is sounded now, and I hope it will be taken in the spirit in which it is given&mdash;a purely non-party spirit.</P>

      <P>I do not understand this talk about a non-party spirit, except it is to suggest that sufficient precautions in matters of public health, arising not only out of second-hand clothing, but other matters, are not taken by the Department. I repudiate these suggestions, and I say that even if we turn to the question of typhoid fever, no specific case has been made here to-night that second-hand clothing spreads that disease in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing myself to the matter raised here&mdash;to the question of second-hand clothing. Certain regulations have been introduced to deal with the second-hand clothing business from the point of view of disinfection to the extent necessary.  That question arose solely out of the small-pox position in Great Britain and was dealt with solely from that point of view. When medical experience in the country dictates to the public health authorities here that further measures to deal with second-hand clothing are necessary because of other factors in regard to the spread of disease in the country, then we can reconsider the position and what further measures are required in the matter of second-hand clothing.  The present position arose out of the fact that for some time past a small-pox <Col N="2085" /> epidemic, of rather increasing dimensions from 1922, has existed in Great Britain.  As early as July, 1923, very detailed instructions were sent to all medical officers of health with regard to every aspect of every possible situation that might arise out of contacts coming from Britain or the disease developing here.  From 1st September, 1927, certain regulations with regard to the control of second-hand clothing were introduced. I am not quite clear what Deputy Dr. Ward's attitude is.  As far as I understand it, his attitude would seem to be that second-hand clothing should be allowed in at the four ports or at an additional number of places, and that second-hand clothing coming in here should be disinfected at these ports or at these places.  I am not clear as to what it is he suggests, but I take it that is what he means.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have been clear enough if the Deputy addressed himself to the point of second-hand clothing coming into this country unaccompanied by the certificate of the medical officer of health.  If it comes to these four ports and is there disinfected, disinfection takes place at the public expense. The situation, as far as we are concerned, does not seem to be such as to require greater precautions than those existing.  We accept second-hand clothing accompanied by a medical certificate in certain circumstances.  The great bulk of second-hand clothing coming into this country comes from Glasgow or Scotland in pretty large consignments. It has to be accompanied by a Customs declaration, by an invoice specifying the different articles in it, by a medical certificate&mdash;if it comes from a Scotch town, from the medical officer of health in that town&mdash;<Col N="2086" /> that the clothes have been disinfected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen them, but I am explaining what the position is.  Consignments reaching the Customs Officer must have a Customs declaration, an invoice and a medical certificate.  If there was any reason to suspect that these certificates were not quite in keeping with the contents of the consignments then we would have had representations from the Customs officers to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that I have made a misstatement when I said a certificate has been signed by a Mr. Jones on behalf of the medical officer of health in Glasgow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not in the least, but I do suggest that if a consignment of second-hand clothing comes in here to Dublin, as many of them may, the medical officer of health in person, Dr. Russell, should not be called upon to detach himself from his important duties to go down to superintend the work of disinfection. The persons who are employed under him may be fully relied upon to do it.  If second-hand clothing is going to become such a very important matter in our lives that the city medical officer has himself in person to go down to superintend the disinfecting of any consignments that arrive here, let us have a case made for it.  There is no case made here that second-hand clothing has been the cause of any single case of sickness here.  If the facts are that that danger is there, let our medical officers of health get down to that particular case and let us have the facts brought home.  At the present moment, while it is not disinfected at the public expense, second-hand clothing comes in with the safeguard that is provided in Customs documents, and we accept the report of medical officers in the Six-County area or Great Britain that consignments sent here have been properly disinfected by them.</P>
