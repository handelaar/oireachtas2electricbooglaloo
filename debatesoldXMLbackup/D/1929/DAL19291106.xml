      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Liberty Hall, Dublin, was the General Headquarters of the Irish Republican Army up to noon on Easter Monday, April 24th, 1916; whether these premises were demolished by British artillery fire and their entire contents removed or destroyed by British military forces; whether the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, which owned the premises, made application for compensation and was informed that its claim was rejected because it was held that the Union had participated in the Insurrection; whether all other similar claims for compensation have been paid, with the exception of a few (of small amount) rejected for the same reason; whether the Union two years ago renewed its claim; whether the Minister then refused to entertain the claim, notwithstanding his promise to do so when the matter was mentioned in the discussion of the Estimates in July, 1927; and whether the Minister is aware that the only persons now denied compensation are those who the British Government considered were implicated in the Insurrection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts in regard to the destruction <Col N="702" /> of Liberty Hall in April, 1916, and the claim for compensation lodged by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union with the British Property Losses Committee of 1916 are as stated by the Deputy. As to the Union renewing its claim two years ago, the facts are that in the course of the debate of 6th July, 1927, on the Estimate for Property Losses Compensation, Deputy William O'Brien raised the question of compensation for the damage to Liberty Hall, which he said was the only building damaged in 1916 for which compensation had not been paid, and I replied that I was not sure about the case, but that I would agree with him that if his supposition were correct, namely, that it was the only building damaged in 1916 for which compensation had not been paid, compensation ought to be paid.  I did not, as the Deputy suggests, promise to pay compensation, but undertook to have the matter investigated.  This was done, and, as a result, it was discovered that a number of other cases had been rejected at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In coming to a decision not to entertain the application of the Union, I was influenced by a number of important considerations, namely (1) any action that might be taken by the Government would have to be general in character and would open the door to a great variety of claims in respect not only of property but also of personal injuries, thereby imposing a heavy burden on the Exchequer; (2) the investigation of the claims and assessing of compensation would be an impossible task in view of the difficulty of securing reliable evidence after such a lapse of time; (3) the Provisional Government in 1922 by public notice proclaimed the 21st January, 1919, as the commencement of the period of damage or loss in respect of which liability for compensation was accepted by the State, and the same date was fixed in the Damage to Property Compensation Act, 1923, and the Government could not accordingly go back to April, 1916, without involving themselves in a <Col N="703" /> liability for compensation in respect of injuries or loss sustained between then and the 21st January, 1919, which would increase very substantially the burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In reply to the final part of the Deputy's question, I may say that I am not aware that the only persons now denied compensation are those who the British Government considered were concerned in the Rising.  Inquiries have, in fact, been made at my Department by persons who claimed to have suffered personal injuries or damage to property in 1916, but who did not receive any compensation, and I cannot assume that all or any of these were persons who took part in the Rising.  Apart from the 1916 cases, however, there must also be a number of persons who suffered losses in the period between April, 1916, and 21st January, 1919, who did not receive any compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister's reason for refusing compensation in this case is because there are cases other than the Transport Union case in connection with Liberty Hall?  Does the Minister deny that there is a liability on the State to pay compensation? If the Minister admits the liability, is he not in a position to make whatever arrangements are necessary and, if it is essential, to come to the House in order to get sufficient authority to pay compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit there is any liability.  I say that the matter should have been raised, as it easily could have been raised, when the damage to property legislation was being passed.  I say that it is really too late in the day now, and while it might happen that it would be possible to investigate this particular case properly, if we were to go back at all, we would have to admit other cases which could not be properly investigated.  Consequently, the door being closed, and having been allowed to remain closed so long, I do not think it could now be opened.</P>

      <P>Could not this case be dealt with in a manner similar to the case that was discussed on Deputy Aiken's motion in the House quite recently, with which the Minister promised to deal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I do not think so. As I say, this particular case suffered even more from the point of view of delay in having the matter brought forward for investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe that this is really a debt of honour on the part of the State, considering the part that the Union took in the Rebellion?  Will he undertake to look into the matter again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this matter two or three times since it was first brought to my notice in the House two and a half years ago. I said that while I might be disposed to consider it favourably, I had come to the conclusion that it would not be right to reopen the matter because of the difficulties that would arise from considering cases as far back as 1916 and the utter impossibility that would in most cases exist of getting reliable evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numbers of other cases.  We have made no attempt to find the actual number. We considered this case on the basis that it was the only case. When we found it was not the only case and that there were others, we came to the conclusion that we would take no further action in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith (for Tomás O Raghallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how many <Col N="705" /> applications for repayment of the Dáil Loan, 1919-20, have been received from South Kerry (Killorglin, Caherciveen, to Kenmare) by his Department, and how many of these were favourably considered up to 31st December, 1928, and how many have been favourably considered since 1st January, 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The records in my Department are not kept in such a manner as would enable me to furnish the Deputy with the precise information he requires without the expenditure of a considerable amount of time and labour on the part of the staff.</P>
      <P>I am, however, in a position to give him certain information regarding the former Parliamentary constituency of South Kerry.  During the period in which the loan was floated particulars of only 307 subscribers were furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance, and these were duly entered in the Register. Since that date 191 names have been added to the Register in respect of this constituency, making a total of 498.  Of these 386 have been repaid to date.</P>
      <P>The claims of those persons whose names have not yet been entered in the Register are being investigated, but the rate of progress is necessarily somewhat slow, as great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining reliable lists of subscribers or satisfactory evidence of the transmission of the various amounts subscribed to Headquarters.  It would assist considerably if all documentary evidence in the possession of local collectors and others connected with the loan in South Kerry were forwarded to my Department.</P>

It is an excellent road and quite as passable for horse traffic as any other road in the country.</P>

      <P>I have to inform the Minister that there is not a day that passes in which there is not a serious accident on that road. Horses are falling there daily, carts are broken and a great number of people injured.  To my knowledge, the road is no more than a skating rink and in that portion of the country there is a great outery because of the fact that the farmers cannot take their farm produce into Fermoy over this road; also the people of Fermoy are bitterly complaining at the loss of their trade owing to the fact that the people of the district cannot take their horses and carts into the town.  I want to know if the Minister is aware of these facts and whether or not he will adopt the suggestion of laying gravel for about two feet on each side of the road so that horses would be given a chance of walking along there without the danger of injury?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>No improvement has yet taken place in the position referred to&mdash;in fact, owing to the seasonal scarcity in British eggs the margin of price between stamped and unstamped eggs in British markets has tended to increase.  For some time to come Free State exporters must expect to realise for their eggs lower prices than those obtainable for British (including Northern Ireland) eggs.  The demand for the latter is, no doubt, partly sentimental, but is largely due to the belief that unstamped eggs are necessarily fresher than stamped eggs.  Many complaints have, however, been made in the Press and other quarters in Great Britain in connection with the higher price demanded for unstamped eggs, and indications are not lacking to show that consumers will not continue to pay for unstamped eggs prices out of all proportion to their value, as compared with stamped eggs from the Free State.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, as intimated in my previous reply, it is more than ever imperative for Free State exporters to ensure that their eggs will reach the British market in the freshest possible condition, and that the requirements of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, and the Regulations made under it, are strictly observed.</P>

    <P>If the Deputy refers to the lands of Lattin East, the property of Nicholas J. Green, these lands were also included in the provisional list, but the owner having objected to their inclusion therein, and also to the inclusion of the lands of Ballinagleragh, the Land Commission allowed his objection as regards Lattin East and disallowed it as regards Ballinagleragh.  The price of the lands of Ballinagleragh was fixed and published in accordance with the Land Act of 1923, and on the owner's appeal it transpired that the tenure under which Nicholas Green holds both the lands of Lattin East and Ballinagleragh constitutes him a tenant within the meaning of the Land Act, 1923, and he has now been returned to the Land Commission as a tenant of these lands on the estate of Captain Charles Moore.

      <P>From the information at my disposal, I can say that the unemployment position has substantially improved during the past year.  On the 5th November, 1928, there were 22,087 persons registered as unemployed at the local offices of the Department of Industry and <Col N="718" /> Commerce.  The latest available figure is that of the 7th October, 1929, on which date there were 19,463 persons so registered as unemployed. The reduction in the number of emigrants is a healthy sign.  During the first nine months of 1928, 20,413 persons emigrated from Saorstát Eireann, while during the corresponding period of the present year, the number of emigrants was 16,797, a decrease of 3,616.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to the Dáil on the 3rd July last, large sums of public money are annually expended on services which, either directly or indirectly, promote employment.  The Estimates for Supply Services for the current year show very substantial provision for services of the kind mentioned.  The Commissioners of Public Works will spend £358,940 on new works, buildings, alterations and additions, and £54,000 on drainage. There is provision for a grant to the Local Loans Fund of £142,000, but the fund itself will provide £407,000 in the current year for land improvement, drainage, and public health schemes, all of which promote employment.  The beet sugar subsidy of £108,334 will undoubtedly prove a factor in relieving unemployment in the beet growing area.  There is provision in the Vote for Local Government and Public Health of £241,575 for housing grants, £161,650 will be spent by the Land Commission in improvement of estates, and £43,000 is earmarked for afforestation schemes.  The expenditure on fisheries and rural industries may also be mentioned as contributing to the relief of unemployment.  Apart from supply services, the capital expenditure on the Shannon construction works and the operations of the Electricity Supply Board is estimated in the current year to amount to £1,934,350.  A sum of £600,000 has been placed at the disposal of local authorities from the Road Fund for works during the current financial year, and employment on the roads is up to the average of previous years.  There has been an increase in the extent of public health works embarked on by local authorities. <Col N="719" /> and housing schemes estimated to cost approximately £500,000 have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>The programme of legislation for the present session includes a Bill which provides £250,000 for grants and loans for the construction and repair of houses and outhouses in the Gaeltacht.  These schemes will provide useful employment in the area in question.</P>
    <P>Instructions have been given to those Government Departments administering expenditure which provides employment to take steps to ensure that the maximum amount of work will be given during the winter period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that the figures he has submitted of those registered at the unemployment exchanges cannot be taken as a true index of the position in regard to unemployment?  The President knows very well that there are many thousands of people who are unemployed but who are not registered at the unemployment exchanges. Again, I do not think what the President has said with regard to emigration is altogether correct, because the President must know that in many areas people are only waiting to get sufficient money to emigrate, owing to the fact that they cannot get employment at home.  The President has also stated the steps which the Government propose taking to relieve unemployment, but I suggest to him that some step should be taken prior to Christmas with a view to absorbing some of the unemployed, because the President, and every member of the House, knows very well that great poverty and hardship exist throughout the country owing to the state of unemployment. I suggest, therefore, that the Government should take immediate steps to get started some of these works which the President has enumerated.</P>

      <P>Various Deputies have committed themselves to an interpretation of my statement which the statement did not permit of. The taking of the number of persons registered as a barometer and comparing it with last year's number was the only extent to which any use was made of that particular figure.  I did not say that the registration of persons unemployed exhausted the whole list; I compared the list of persons entitled to be registered with the same list for last year.  The same answer might be given to the irrelevant question which Deputy Aiken put to me.  It leads me to believe that he does not understand what I said.  There are fewer persons going to America. Apparently, there was some addition to the number of persons available for employment this year over last, allowing for the smaller number of emigrants.  If we had the same number as last year there would be employment, presumably, provided they were employable, for these <Col N="721" /> 3,616, or they would have to be dealt with in one way or another. The question he raised was another question.  By reason of the fact that 3,616 fewer persons left the country last year, having regard to the normal supply, I would point out that employment had been found for the additional number.  So far as Deputy Morrissey's question is concerned I believe that a Supplementary Vote will shortly be introduced &mdash;certainly before the end of the financial year&mdash;to provide an additional sum for the Unemployment Insurance Fund, a clear indication that the number of persons employed is greater than the number which was anticipated when the Estimate was compiled.</P>

      <P>The President alluded to the emigration of the previous year as being normal.  Does he look <Col N="722" /> upon it as normal, and does he want a similar number to leave the country every year?  Further, what data has he to go upon to prove to the House that the reduction in the number of emigrants is accounted for by increased employment?  Would it not be more probable that the reduction in the number of emigrants is caused by the fact that a fewer number of people have the money to buy their tickets, and also that the type of people who offer themselves for emigration is not up to the same standard as previously?  I think before he makes the statement that the reduction in emigration is accounted for by increased employment he should at least examine the figures that were given the other day by the American Consul when he stated that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1.  As the sub-section stands at present it precludes the possibility of these premises which are registered for the slaughter of cattle, sheep, pigs, or goats from being used for carrying on the business of crating. Having regard to the principle underlying this Bill, I am rather astonished to find this exception made and before saying what is in my mind on the question I would like an explanation from the Minister as to why the crating premises are excluded from registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a little bit involved. In fact it is very involved. I think Deputy O'Hanlon's point is this.  There are various premises in the country, for instance, where pork is killed and crated, but apparently under sub-sections (1) and (3) when read together the pigs cannot be slaughtered and crated in the same premises.  That is really the grievance as far as I know.  It is to remove that grievance that the amendments suggested by Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Ryan are put on the Paper.  The present position is that most of the pork exporters both slaughter their pigs and crate the pork in the same premises, but you have other exporters who slaughter the pork and then send the pork to crating premises near the port of export.  It was not the intention to prevent the owner of say a pig-slaughtering premises from crating the pigs on the premises nor was it the intention to compel him to crate the pigs in a crating premises, nor was it the intentión either to compel him to pay a registration fee in respect to crating premises which are contained within the slaughtering premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question as between the lawyers as to whether as the Bill now stands it is possible for a premises which is in fact a pig slaughtering premises to be used also as a crating premises.  Just read Section 5, sub-section (f): &ldquo;The Minister shall cause to be kept (that is to say the Minister <Col N="730" /> must keep) a register (to be called and known as the register of crating premises) of premises in Saerstát Eireann in which the business of crating for export pork, mutton and lamb or any of them is carried on.&rdquo;  It would look as if under that section and sub-section the Minister is coerced into keeping a register not only of the slaughtering premises but of the crating premises as well, even though that crating premises is within the slaughtering premises, and then when you come to sub-section (3) there is a provision which amounts to this, that premises registered as a slaughtering premises shall not be registered as a crating premises.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it appears from the sections as they stand that any owner of a slaughtering premises who at present crates his pigs in the premises cannot in the future, if this Bill is passed, crate his pigs in the premises.  That is the grievance, I take it.  My own view at present is that as the Bill stands that is the position, but I want to say that is not shared by the draftsmen.  They are not quite clear on that point.  I do not want to go into the involved legal arguments in connection with it, but I suggest as this Bill must come up on Report, and as on Report there will surely be a number of amendments, and as it is absolutely certain that this Bill will be recommitted on Report, that these amendments should be left over.  I will guarantee either to satisfy myself that at present the exporter may crate his pigs in the premises in which he slaughters them or, if not, to introduce amendments which will enable him to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted the whole sub-section would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act in relation to the registration of premises in any particular register, premises registered in the register of cattle slaughtering premises, or in the register of pig slaughtering premises, or in the register of sheep slaughtering premises or in the register of goat slaughtering premises, or in the register of crating premises, shall be capable of being registered in any other or others of those registers, but shall not be capable of being registered in the register of horse slaughtering premises or the register of crating premises.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is that crating premises shall be capable of being registered.  The implications of that would be that the owner of the premises should apply for registration of the premises as crating premises and pay a pound registration fee, as well as a pound registration fee in respect of the registration of the same premises as slaughtering premises.  I take it the Deputy does not want that.  That is the first objection to an amendment like that.  I would also require to examine further the implications of accepting that amendment.  It may or may not be the best way of doing it, but I will give a definite undertaking to the Deputy.  It is only a question of drafting, and none of us are draftsmen.  I will see to it before the Report Stage that pigs may be slaughtered and pork exported from the same premises in which they are crated without any extra registration fee.  Is not that what the Deputy wants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I approach this entirely apart from the question of fees.  As I gather from the principle of this Bill, it is the object of the Minister to have Irish products put on the market in the best possible condition with regard to cleanliness, quality and price.  I put it to the Minister that I would prefer to put in the Bill that they must be crated on the premises, and then <Col N="732" /> there will not be any doubt about it. If it is the view that you are to slaughter pigs on one premises and take the carcase away to other premises, you are unfitting the carcase for sale in a proper condition.  I do not want to say exactly what I think, but I do believe, and I put it to the Minister that in the drafting of this Bill there was some little mental reservation in the minds of those who put this before the Minister&mdash;that there are vested interests in crating which ought to be safeguarded. I want to safeguard the interests of the farmer.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (3) to delete the words `including any,' line 11, down to and including the words `this Act,' line 13.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister has several ways of refusing a licence without coming to this.  For instance, under Section 6 there is a whole list of conditions that must be fulfilled before the registration of the premises may be granted.  I think that this is a thing that may be used in a very unfair way.  For instance, there are some fairly important centres where there would not be a veterinary inspector employed at present.  One of these centres might be ideal for a meat factory.  The town of Arklow is one place where there is no veterinary inspector, and Arklow would be an ideal centre for the export of mutton.  If an enterprising man who was willing to fulfil all the other conditions in regard to structural suitability, cleanliness, and so on, wanted to start a factory he could be turned down on this condition, on the grounds that the cost of the veterinary inspection would be too high.  I think the Minister has sufficient powers to prevent any man starting without this additional power.  I would like to know what he has to say before going further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the amendments that, to my mind, do not matter a lot.  The Deputy mentioned that if an enterprising man proposed to establish some kind of a factory in Arklow, because there is no veterinary surgeon there the Minister might refuse to give the necessary licence, notwithstanding that the man was ready to conform to all the other requirements.  If such a thing occurred the Minister could not possibly get away with it in the Dáil.  There are equally drastic powers taken in the Eggs Act and the Dairy Produce Act.  What I am <Col N="735" /> going to say now applies not only to this amendment, but to other amendments that will come later.  In no single case has any matter arising under these Acts relating to the administration of the Acts by the Minister ever been brought to the Dáil.  As regards the case the Deputy mentioned, if he raised it in the Dáil he would have all details, he would be in a position to show that this man was a substantial man, and had everything ready; that he was prepared to give so much employment there; that it was a suitable place, and the farmers were ready to send in the pigs and so on.  And all that development was to be held up because the Minister considered veterinary inspection there would be too expensive.  No Minister could do so, and that is the real safeguard against any of the drastic powers that are contained, not only in this Act, but contained equally in the three Acts that have already been passed.  The Deputy will find that a real safeguard and a real limitation on the exercise of arbitrary powers by the Minister.  The Dáil is there, and the Minister can be challenged in the Dáil and made to justify a case.  This is only the fourth of a series of Acts, some of which have been in operation three or four years. Nevertheless, not one single case of hardship has ever been brought up. That is not due in any way to the personal qualities of the civil servants or of the Minister who is responsible.  It could not be.  It is due to the fact that a Minister must realise when he is taking action in any of these cases, especially in a non-political matter of this sort where things are debated more on their merits, that he must stand over his action and prove, not only to his own party but to the Dáil generally, that his action was sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put it to the Deputy again that that is the real safeguard not only in connection with this particular amendment, but with other amendments.  I will point out our intention in this regard.  We would not dream of interfering with a factory in Arklow.  But take another <Col N="736" /> extreme case.  Take it that there was a veterinary inspector in Schull, in West Cork, and that there was a place ten miles away also on the coast where somebody wanted to start a factory.  He might have personal reasons.  There might be disputes with the Ministry.  There might be other reasons which went to the merits of the case why he wanted to start this factory five or six miles outside Schull.  There is no railway in Schull; neither is there a railway five or six miles away. If he insisted, out of cussedness, on putting up a factory five or six miles outside Schull when Schull was the obvious place from the point of view of the farmers, surely the Minister should have some discretion&mdash;in an extreme case like that.  That is an extreme case on the one side. Deputy Ryan has quoted an extreme case on the other, but I am pointing out that extreme cases on one side or the other must be provided for. The best safeguard is the fact that the Dáil is there to criticise any action that the Minister may take. As a matter of fact, I am not keen on that&mdash;I do not know that it will arise, but I should like to have it in. If I am pressed I shall take it out.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendments to Section 12, the amendments to Section 12 and amendments 43 and 44 to the Schedule raise the same point, namely, what will the maximum fee be, and I am desirous of not putting the question in any way that would prevent Deputies' proposals with regard to the fee being put to the Committee.  It seems to the Chair that the most profitable way of discussing the question, which is all-important, namely, the question of <Col N="737" /> the amount of the licence fee, would be to take Section 12 now first without taking any of the amendments, and on the discussion of Section 12 to hear the Minister, to hear the Deputies who have amendments 6 and 7 down and the other amendments, 43 and 44, come to a conclusion on Section 12, and then take these amendments in whatever form might be most suitable, either on the Schedule or on Section 12, at the next Committee Stage.

I am asking the Deputy to postpone this amendment to the next Stage, when he can, in fact, obtain a Committee discussion on the points raised.  We shall now hear the Minister on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My position in connection with Section 12 is as follows. Sub-section (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There shall be paid to the Minister in respect of every half-year by every licensed exporter in respect of each exporter's licence held by him at any time during such half-year or at any time during <Col N="738" /> the preceding half-year contained in the same year a fee (in this Act referred to as an exporter's half-yearly fee) computed in accordance with the rules set out in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>The Schedule provides that the minimum fee shall be £75, so that in respect of each exporter's licence there is a minimum fee of £75.  In other words, if the exporter had a licence for beef there would be a minimum fee of £75; if he had a licence for beef and mutton there would be a fee of £75 for each, that is, £150; if he had a licence for beef, mutton and pork, there would be a minimum of three times £75&mdash;£225. That is the Bill as it stands.  I first propose to alter that and to make the maximum minimum fee&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;£75, no matter how many licences the exporter may have.  That is number one.  Number two: I propose to accept, as I have already indicated. the principle set out in Deputy O'Dwyer's amendment, and in Deputy Bennett's and Deputy Wolfe's amendment&mdash;amendments 43 and 44 to the Schedule.  Amendment 43 reads:</P>
    <P>At the end of the Schedule to add a new Rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Schedule the minimum fee in respect of a beef exporter's licence or a pork exporter's licence shall be £50 and the minimum fee in respect of a mutton exporter's licence, a goat flesh exporter's licence or a horse flesh exporter's licence, shall be £25.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I propose to accept that&mdash;that is to say, I propose that the exporter who has only one licence shall pay a minimum of £50, if it is a beef licence, and £50 if it is a pork licence, and £25 if it is a mutton licence.  I also propose to accept amendment 44, which reads:</P>
    <P>At the end of the Schedule to add a new rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Notwithstanding anything in this Schedule contained, where <Col N="739" /> a person is the holder of two or more exporter's licences in respect of the same premises, if one of those licences is a beef exporter's licence or a pork exporter's licence, the total minimum fees in respect of all such licences shall be £75 and if none of those licences is a beef exporter's licence or a pork exporter's licence, the total minimum fees in respect of all such licences shall be £50.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, if an exporter holds two licences, and if these two licences are a beef licence and a pork licence, his minimum fee shall be £75.  If he holds a beef exporter's licence and a mutton exporter's licence, the minimum fee shall be £75.  If he holds a pork exporter's licence and a mutton exporter's licence, the minimum shall be £75.  But if he holds a mutton exporter's licence alone, it will be £25.</P>
    <P>It is rather complicated and I shall go over it again.  First of all, the greatest fee that can be paid as a lump sum is £75, and that can only be paid under the conditions set out in amendment 44.  In other words if he has a series of licences, and one of the series is beef or pork, the minimum fee shall be £75.  If he has any other series except that series, for instance, if he has mutton and goat flesh, the minimum shall be £50. I am dealing with a case where a man has a series of licences.  This Bill deals with beef, mutton, pork, goat flesh and horse flesh.  We might for simplicity leave out goat flesh and horse flesh, as there will be no export.  Let us confine ourselves to beef, mutton and pork.  If a man has a series of licences, and one of these is a beef licence, then the minimum fee is £75.  If he has a series of licences, and one of them is a pork licence, the minimum fee is £75.  But if he has a series of licences which does not include pork or beef, and one of which is a mutton licence, it is £50.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is emphasising &ldquo;series&rdquo; overmuch. Does he not also have to pay if he has only two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="740" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two are a series.  If he has more than one licence, and one is a beef or a pork licence, it is £75.  If he has a mutton licence alone, it is £25.  I will not mind the Schedule at all, but shall put it in my own way.  If he has more than one licence, and if any one of these licences is a beef or pork licence, the minimum fee is £75.  If he has a mutton licence alone, the minimum is £25.  If he has a beef licence alone, it is £50, and if he has a pork licence alone it is £50.</P>
      <P>These are the proposals contained in these two amendments.  Now these two amendments are really not properly drafted.  They are quite simple in their way; they leave the schedule and the section as they stand, and they begin by saying: &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions.&rdquo; Of course, you cannot repeal the foregoing provisions simply by submitting an amendment which contains the words I have read.  But I propose to accept the figures set out in the two amendments, and I propose to ask the draftsman to make the necessary changes both in Section 12 and in the Schedule.  That is, so much in regard to the fees.  With regard to the point contained in the amendments of Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Hanlon.  Deputy Ryan suggests a deposit of £10, and Deputy O'Hanlon suggests a deposit of £12 10s.  I suggest £20, but I am quite ready to split the difference and to make it £15, and I propose to insert the necessary provision to that effect.  I do not propose to agree with Deputy Ryan's suggestion, which prescribes that a sum of 6d. shall be paid, instead of one shilling, in the case of cattle, or the other changes in regard to the prescribed sum for pork or mutton or lamb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef and pork are the big items.  Factories engaged in the <Col N="742" /> beef and pork trade are factories with a big turnover.  A factory dealing with lamb is a small trade and obviously there should be some relation between the fee and the turnover. You have factories in places where they do a lamb trade or a mutton trade alone.  These factories should not be asked to pay the same fee as, say, a bacon factory, where every pig, whether for bacon or pork, has to be inspected, and where, perhaps, twenty or thirty, or forty or fifty thousand pigs a year are dealt with.  You should not charge the same amount to a small factory as to a big one, in the same way as you should not charge as much in respect to a lamb as in respect to a bullock.  There must be some relation between the fee and the value of the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should consider very carefully his new proposals before that section is again submitted.  I think it is going to handicap enterprise a good deal. Take a small factory trading exclusively in lamb.  If at a particular time there is a boom in pork and they are asked if they could supply some pork, would it not mean a great hardship if for a few weeks' trade they were obliged to pay so big an additional fee as is proposed here.  You may have that happen any day of the week.  As a matter of fact, it has been represented to me that a small factory in my own constituency has had that experience. They started with lamb. Some of their people in London urged them to supply pork for a particular period.  Their factory is going to feel the expense of these fees very considerably, and it would be a loss not only to the proprietor and his customers but to the meat trade for anything to happen to hurt a small efficient firm of that kind.  That is plain, if I am to go by what I have before me in the way of testimonials from the people whom they are supplying.  For instance, letters of this kind have been written to the proprietor of the particular firm that I am speaking of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the placing of the embargo on continental meats and the consequent effort on the part of Irish traders to develop the dead meat trade between Ireland and Smithfield, many exporters have ventured into the business, and it has only been those who have succeeded in handling the goods in an efficient and proper manner who have been able to make the venture <Col N="744" /> sufficiently successful to continue, many in the meanwhile having gone out.</P>
    <P>We consider that your consignments can be classified among the best of those which come to London, both as regards quality, dressing and general handling, and we would also go so far as to say that in our opinion you as consistent and regular consignors can rightly be grouped amongst those to whom the credit of developing the dead-meat trade with London is due.</P>
    <P>The following is another testimonial from another firm:</P>
    <P>We are pleased to testify that all carcases of beef, mutton, and pork consigned to us during the past 12 months have arrived in a good and marketable condition, mainly due to the care exercised in the shape of packing and wrapping.</P>
    <P>Your supplies have been sent with pleasing regularity and have been unfailingly of good quality and your consistency has been rewarded by good prices being returned.</P>
    <P>Also we would like to mention that the carcases have always been dressed in the best workmanlike manner.</P>
    <P>The third testimonial reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In reply to yours of the 6th. We have great pleasure in stating that the pigs we have received from you have always been the best dressed, best condition, and of the best quality, and compare very favourably with any senders from Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is one of the smallest firms in the meat exporting trade.  It has been represented to me that the fees that were in the Bill originally would have made it impossible for that factory to carry on.  It has also been represented to me that the amended fees proposed will also involve great hardship.  I suggest to the Minister, before he makes up his mind finally on the matter, that he should consider whether he will not be handicapping efficient people of <Col N="745" /> that kind, and whether he will not be doing a disservice to the meat trade by putting on restrictions which would have the effect of preventing those engaged in a particular branch from developing a seasonal trade or a trade that would be called for when particularly high prices prevailed over a short period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take an opposite view to that expressed by Deputy Moore.  If it is true that the examination will be so severe that it will be very hard to get even sound meat through, the reason for that is that every class of carcase, sound and unsound, has been sent indiscriminately to England and Scotland. There has been no examination in the past, the result being that sound and unsound carcases have gone out of the country indiscriminately. I do not know that some of the people who have been handling pork in the past could be described as having small factories.  For the sake of courtesy you can give them that title, but the actual position has been that cows and pigs have been going indiscriminately out of the country without any examination whatever.  People who want to do their business well; and who want to uphold the credit of this State, have had to appoint officials themselves to do this work.  I happen to be connected with a factory that has had to engage not only a meat inspector but a veterinary inspector as well. We have had to pay the salaries of these officials out of our own pockets. The other people have paid nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the State is now proposing to provide a cheap system of veterinary inspection.  I think that these people ought to pay some little thing for that service.  It is the cheapest kind of inspection that they can possibly have.  As the State is now proposing to provide that, those concerned in these small-sized factories ought to have no objection to the proposal in the Bill. Everyone must pay, and there can be no discrimination between one set of people and another.  It is well known that there are a lot of people who, without any capital, go out and <Col N="746" /> kill pork when there is a market for it, but who drop off after a couple of weeks or months, when there is a fall in prices.  I think these people ought not to be taken into consideration as much as has been suggested by some Deputies.  They are now going to get cheap inspection that they had not before.  The lack of that inspection in the past meant that carcases were being sent to England and Scotland in the most extraordinary condition.  I have seen Irish carcases at Birkenhead that were a disgrace to the country, and to whomsoever sent them out.</P>

The small man will have to pay his £75 as well as the large exporter.  I am afraid that in Deputy Gorey's statement we find some of the advice on which the Minister acted when he fixed the original fee for the three classes at <Col N="747" /> £225.

      <P>Yes, but I still hold that a fee of £75 is far too high.  If we want to have competition in the trade, then we must see to it that the small man is allowed to carry on. You are not going to have that competition if you allow the dead meat trade in this country to fall into the hands of three or four large firms, who, of course, will ultimately form a ring and pay what they like.  That is what it amounts to.  I consider that the fee of £75 is still too high. I think that the figure suggested in Deputy Ryan's amendment would be quite enough.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the very clear explanation that has been given by the Minister of the amendments that I have tabled, I am afraid there are still some Deputies who have not yet grasped the meaning of them.  Certainly the last Deputy who has spoken does not appear to have grasped their meaning. As I have indicated in my amendments, there will be no single fee of £75.  As regards the three classes of meat exported there will be a fee of £50 for beef, a fee of £50 for pork and a fee of £25 for mutton. I hope that is clear.  The object that I and the Deputies associated with me&mdash;Deputies Dwyer and Wolfe&mdash; had in putting down these amendments was that we felt that the original sums specified in the Bill were too high and that a reduction ought to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt, further, that it was necessary to safeguard in some way the small exporters, upon a certain number of whom the Bill will necessarily be hard.  Perhaps it will follow from a Bill of this kind that some of the small exporters will ultimately disappear because of various circumstances. In some instances there is <Col N="748" /> insufficient accommodation, and the premises are not suitable for proper packing and inspection, as was pointed out in the course of the Second Reading debate.  Taking these things into consideration, a good many of us felt that there should be a safeguard for the very small exporters. A man who may be exporting, say, only a few porkers or a few lambs per week would, under the Bill as it originally stood, have to pay a fee of £75.  Our amendments, if accepted, would reduce the fees. A man who exported beef, mutton and pork would, according to the Bill as introduced, have to pay a fee of £225.  If our amendments are accepted that would be very considerably modified.  The exporter who exports pork will pay a fee of £50.  If he exports a few sheep as well he will pay only £75, and not two fees of £50 each.  The object of the amendments is to secure as far as possible that the small exporters would be saved from extinction.  Of course, the amendments might be modified or extended at a future stage.</P>

      <P>I am chiefly interested in the small exporters, as I know a good many of them in the trade.  They deal principally in beef and veal, and they give a good deal of employment.  I know five of them in one town and their total killings would not amount to very much, and would not, in my opinion, be sufficient to enable them to pay a fee of £50 for a licence even if they all combined.  There are three factories, or slaughter-houses, killing for those five.  They are doing a nice trade and making a living out of it, and giving a good deal of employment, but they are making no big profits. If they are compelled to pay £50 they will either have to send their cattle to one of the larger factories to be killed or they will be driven out of business altogether.  The small people who are engaged in the trade were prevented by different regulations from shipping cattle alive, and now they are to be driven out of the business altogether.  I think the licence should be reduced <Col N="749" /> considerably for people, say, killing less than 1,000.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in the large or the small exporter, but I am interested in the exports from the country, with which this Bill is supposed to deal.  I have down some amendments and they more or less dove-tail into one another.  In one amendment, I propose that the fee be £12 10s.  According to Section 23, the Minister may refuse a licence if 3,000 have not been exported in twelve months. I propose that the number should be reduced to 1,000, and at 3d. per head that would give yield of £12 10s. I propose that as the minimum.  The sections in this Bill are watertight, and I would perfer that the amendments which have been tabled should stand and not be discussed until the Minister has produced amendments which he suggests, and then the whole matter could be discussed. I have certain views in the matter, but at present we are more or less beating the air in discussing the amendments as we have not before us the amendments which the Minister will bring forward at a later stage.  We have passed the Financial Resolution authorising the Minister for Finance to make arrangements to meet the costs of putting this Bill into operation.  I am not concerned with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister stated that the licence fees at £75 would yield £19,000.  He has since made a suggestion which would have the effect of reducing the yield by more than one half.  I do not care whether the Bill will cost £19,000, £20,000 or £30,000.  The <Col N="750" /> trade in pork alone to this country, if developed, should be worth £5,000,000.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister admitted that the Bill was intended principally to deal with pork, and he pointed out that the dead meat trade in cattle was gone since the Drogheda factory ceased working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking of that.  The Bill is intended to deal principally with the pork trade. That trade starts about the beginning of October and winds up about April.  The fee originally fixed was £75 for a pork licence, and one would have to export 6,000 carcases, not in 52 weeks but in about 20 weeks.  Now that number has been reduced to 1,000, which is a very considerable reduction.  A good deal has been said about wiping out the small traders.  I know a small society of farmers that exported last year 500, and the year before 500, and their total turnover was £4,000. Out of 1,000 killings there were only three rejected as being unsound.  At the same time three are too many, and the Bill is to provide even against that number slipping through.  As the trade was conducted, in the small factories there was no veterinary inspection.  I will not move any amendment until I hear what the Minister has to offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad that the Minister has accepted the amendment put down by Deputy Dwyer and Deputy Wolfe, but I think, if he considers matters further and gets in touch with those and other Deputies, he may see his way to accept the amendment of Deputy Dr. Ryan on Report.  There is no one in any party here who stands for having badly packed meat sent out of the country.  We all want to have the meat packed here and not to have it sent off driven on its four legs.  It was with that view that Deputy Dr. Ryan moved his amendment reducing the fee.  We want inspection, but we believe, as this trade is so <Col N="751" /> important to the country as a whole, that whatever inspection is necessary should be provided at the expense of the State.  The President to-day talked a lot about what has been done to relieve unemployment. If we were to kill in this country all the cattle that are driven off, it would provide very much more employment than has been so far provided during the last seven or eight years by the Government by means of tariffs or the Shannon scheme.  We should do nothing to discourage people who want to start meat packing companies or societies in different towns and villages.  If the Minister and those in his Party who wish him to reduce the fee get together and discuss the whole matter they may agree to Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I will run the risk, like most of the previous speakers, of getting lost in this subject before I finish what I have to say.  I think that in discussing this matter we are missing the point. Deputy O'Hanlon touched on it lightly, namely, how the money will be raised if it is taken at so much per head.  The fee of £75 or £50 is not absolutely necessary if the export is greater than 4,000 pigs.  If it is greater than 4,000 it will work out higher.  I think that there is something to be said for having a lower fee than £50, say as has been mentioned, £25, which would work out at a minimum of 2,000 pigs.  I take it that after that, threepence a head would still increase the amount.  I do not think that any Deputy has made the point that a per-head rate is not a proper one to charge.  We all recognise that but, in spite of Deputy Gorey's sentiments about big exporters, I think that the small exporter should be considered and should be allowed to get a start by a little accommodation.  The season is short as it begins in October and ends, perhaps, a little earlier than April and it would be a big help to the country if you brought down the minimum on which such a man must <Col N="752" /> pay to 2,000 or 2,500 pigs.  That would be for the best interests of the trade and it would not give an insignificant sum.  We must remember that if we can hold this trade, which we expect we can do, with inspection it will improve.  All you have to do, so far as I have seen, with producers is to show them that they have a paying market and they will rise to the occasion.  I make the plea that if the fee cannot be reduced to £25 it should be kept to £30 so that we will get in line in all districts in the country, not only the big exporters, who will have our blessing, but also the small exporters.  I therefore support the suggestion to have the fee reduced from £50 to £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputy O'Hanlon and other Deputies to understand that I am not concerned with the big or the small exporter, but with having the meat exported in a proper condition from the country.  I admit that the small exporter may be efficient, but it is more difficult for him to be efficient than for the big exporter, who has a big turnover and bigger plant.  There is too much sympathy with the small man in this country, but there is little room for him in this matter. We are not so poor, not so lacking in organisation, that we must depend on small, ill-equipped factories. Even if most of our farmers are small and not very wealthy, it only requires organisation to see that our factories are a reasonable size and properly equipped.  I dislike the general point of view that we are such a poor country and so lacking in organisation we must continue to do business in a small footling way. We will never get anywhere on those lines.  Deputy Moore read some letters from English importers in connection with the trade which they did with an Irish exporter.  I do not know the exporter referred to.  He may be the most efficient man in the world.  The Deputy, of course, did not, and need not, give names, but I do not pay too much attention to letters of that sort.  I am not now referring to this specific case, but I am speaking generally <Col N="753" /> when I say that letters of that sort do not convey much to me.  I have hardly ever known a case where an egg exporter lost his licence and was not able to get letters from English importers saying that they had done business with him for years and that he was a satisfactory man.  I am not speaking now, as I say, of Deputy Moore's case or of the exporter in question, but I would not pay too much attention to that.  In my view there is a limit in smallness beyond which we cannot go and have efficiency.  The real fee which we should consider is not the minimum fee, but the fee to be charged per head.  We are charging 1/- for cattle.  There is, as Deputy Gorey pointed out, an old-cow trade, and the sooner it is killed the better.  If that fee kills it because it would not be worth 1/- a cow, so much the better.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where, however, there is a genuine beef trade a fee of 1/- is not too much.  There will be, perhaps, disadvantages, but there ought to be distinct advantages from the point of view of exporters, and it ought to lead to an enhanced reputation for Irish fresh meat.  If so, it will be worth a fee of 1/- per head. The same remark applies to pork. For the same reason, a fee of threepence per head does not appear to be too much.  I have the fees charged in Holland, which was our real competitor before.  Holland charges 1/6d. for cattle, 3d. for calves immediately after birth, and 5.4d. for pigs and sheep.  In Denmark the fee was 3d. in 1928, 3.3d. in 1927, 3.9d. in 1926, and 3.9d. in 1925.  In practically all cases the fees were dearer than ours.  The Danish and Dutch farmers obviously considered that those fees were good value.  I suggest, if the general provisions of this Bill are passed, that the farmers will be getting as good value as those in other countries.  I have undoubtedly made big concessions in regard to fees.  I have met the exporters about whom Deputy Corry speaks.  I realise that it is their business to <Col N="754" /> expect more, and that it is not their business to say anything to me which would give the impression that they would be thankful if we went further, but they did not put on the poor mouth which has been put on now on their behalf.  I met nine or ten representatives from Cork, representing a great many small businesses, and they were quite reasonable.  They said that undoubtedly there were small businesses which would have to go. While they did not agree to the fees which I suggested, they agreed to the general principle that there should be graduated scales.  My impression was that they came to the conclusion that I was meeting them fairly.  I do not say that I am repeating what they actually said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you that.  The question of a minimum fee would not arise in Denmark or in Holland, because they do not believe in doing business in the way we do it.  They have no patience with what you call the small man in business.  They give him as good a chance as anybody else, but he is not such a fool as to go into a big trade.  They realise that a man cannot run into a trade for a fortnight, then drop it and run into another trade.  Without having any detailed knowledge at the moment, I do not believe that the question is of any importance in Denmark, even though it is a country of small farmers, or that it is of any importance in Holland, because the farmers there are well organised and they will not go into a small trade. They will do a little organisation before they start factories, and when they start factories they are able to equip them properly and to make proper arrangements for the transport of their produce.</P>

      <P>I am not out to crush the small farmer either, but I am out to see that nobody, big or small, good or bad, exports bad meat to England or elsewhere if we can stop it, and in doing that, if big men or small men have to suffer it is their look-out.  On the question of reducing the minimum fees, if a man holds more than one exporter's licence he will not pay more than £75 as a fee.  If he holds only one exporter's licence he will not pay more than £50.  If he has a mutton licence his maximum fee is £25. That is a big concession, I suggest, as it stands.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken and other Deputies suggested that it might be made lower.  I think I will have to fight on that line.  Further, I will put in my amendments and, as the Ceann Comhairle suggested, I think the next stage of this Bill should be deferred until this day fortnight.  I will undertake to have my amendments handed in by this day week.

I now presume that Section 12, as amended, will be put if this amendment is adopted, and we are only agreeing to it in the hope of defeating it on the next stage.  The Minister mentioned Holland and Denmark, but there is one difference between Holland and Denmark and this country.  In Holland and Denmark the meat exporters have not to compete with the live stock exporters as they have to compete in this country.  Practically no live cattle or pigs come out of Denmark or Holland to England, so that the people in the dead meat trade are in competition only with one another and not with live stock exporters. <Col N="756" /> This Bill is going to benefit the exporters of dead meat by getting a better price for the meat in the English markets, but the question of holding that trade is another matter, because Holland and Denmark were not able to keep their trade, and had to get out when the British told them.</P>

In certain parts of the county it would be impossible almost to do that, except in one or two cases.  In the county town of Cavan I understand it would be impossible for more than one man to get that amount, and very frequently even that man would not get it.

    <P>licence was the registered licensee of the premises in respect of of the premises in respect of which such licence was granted and has ceased to be such registered licensee;</P>
    <P>(d) that the holder of such licence, if an individual, has died or, if an incorporated body, has been dissolved and that such licence has not been transferred by the Minister under this Act to another person within three months after such death or dissolution; or</P>

    <P>(3)  Before revoking (otherwise than in accordance with an application in that behalf made under this section) an exporter's licence, the Minister shall give at least one fortnight's notice in writing of his intention so to revoke such licence to the holder thereof, and shall consider any representations made before the expiration of such notice by such holder, and may if he thinks fit cause an inquiry to be held in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>(4)  A notice of the Minister's intention to revoke or alter an exporter's licence may be served by delivering it to the person to <Col N="759" /> whom it is addressed or by leaving it with a person over sixteen years of age on the registered premises in respect of which it was granted or by sending it by post to the person to whom it is addressed at his last known place of abode.</P>

      <P>Under this section the Minister takes power to revoke an exporter's licence if it is proved that such licence was secured by fraud or misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or innocent.  I have put forward this amendment because I believe that the Minister should not be the judge of whether a man committed an act either fraudulently or through misrepresentation. I think the person who is accused of that should have at least an opportunity of hearing the evidence against him in open court or somewhere else.  He should have an opportunity of hearing what are the charges and the full evidence to substantiate those charges which come before the Minister.  The Minister may have some reason for putting in this clause which I am not aware of and I am open to conviction on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Ryan that this particular sub-section (2) (a) raises an entirely different issue from paragraph (b).  If a man is accused of fraud he should have an opportunity of clearing himself before a judicial body.  Take the case of a man who applied to be registered as the owner of slaughtering premises and was so registered, and it was brought to the Minister's notice afterwards that he was not the owner but his brother and you had a dispute between them.  Now, supposing <Col N="760" /> that clause was not in the Bill what could I do?  I could do nothing unless I strained some other clause in the Bill, closed my eyes and held that the premises were not properly equipped, that the regulations were not obeyed and said to the holder of the exporter's licence, &ldquo;you must leave these premises because they are not clean.&rdquo;  That is not the way to do business.  This man had acquired by a trick a vested interest as against his brother. What would I have to do under the circumstances?  I would have to say to the man that I was informed that there was a case made that he was not the owner of the premises and that he would have to establish his title in court; give him a reasonable time to establish his title in court. If he did that he was all right and if he failed to do that the registration was cancelled.  That would be the procedure.  I think that meets the Deputy's point because I would not be the judge as to whether or not the licence was obtained by fraud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 11.</P>
      <P>After sub-section (4) to add two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) It shall be the duty of every registered proprietor of every registered slaughtering premises to keep or cause to be kept in such premises records showing the price paid for each live pig purchased, the dead weight of each pig after preparation for export, and the price received for each pig from the consignee and such additional particulars as the Minister may require and all such records may be inspected at any time during office hours by an inspector or person or persons from whom pigs were purchased for export by such registered proprietor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6) It shall be the duty of every licensed exporter who is not the registered proprietor of the premises in respect of which he is so licensed to keep or cause to be kept in such premises records <Col N="762" /> showing the price paid for each live pig purchased, the dead weight of each pig after preparation for export, and the price received for each pig from the consignee and such additional particulars as the Minister may require and all such records may be inspected at any time during office hours by an inspector, or person or persons from whom pigs were purchased for export by such licensed exporter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the object of these two sub-sections is very clear.  Getting back to the question that we are dealing with, the matter of fees, in my opinion the higher the fee that is put on the exporter the more restricted will be the number of slaughter houses and none but the large men will survive.  I do not say a word against that.  The effect of this Bill will be that the export trade will be in the hands of about thirty men instead of 160.  This Bill, therefore, creates a monopoly in this country, for you will have confined the business to about 30 large exporters. For what?  To export Irish produce to a country which is sheltering that particular trade at the moment. There is a monopoly in Ireland, and there is a sheltered trade at the other side.  In other words, there is no competition at the other side.  All through this Bill there is not a word in regard to the producer, and there is nothing in this Bill to control the profits which these privileged exporters may extract from the producer.</P>
    <P>The object of my amendment is to enable any person who supplies pigs to these licensed exporters to come into their premises and ascertain the price received for the pig.  I do not mean to say that the exporter is not entitled to his legitimate profit.  This enables the Government Inspectors to go in and find whether the exporter is extracting too much profit from the producer.  I think that is most important, because if this Bill is not going to bring in money to the producer it fails.  The Bill is not going to bring any money to the small people.  The Minister said <Col N="763" /> there were too many small people in this country&mdash;too many people doing business in a small way.  With that I agree.  But here we are dealing with a trade in which the small farmer and the labourer are the principal producers of the products we are dealing with.  We must protect these people.  I do not believe, if this amendment is accepted, that the small man who sells his pigs to the large exporter is going to worry him or to be a nuisance to the factory, but I do think that it is the proper thing for the Government when they are giving a monopoly to these exporters to put the producer in the position of knowing what profit the exporter made on his pig.  Supposing that by this Bill we increase our exports by, say, £1,000,000.  If the trade is worked properly we should increase it by that much.  The increase should be enormous.  Let us take it that it is £1,000,000.  If this Bill passes in its present form no one knows into whose pocket that £1,000,000 is going to go.  The sum of £1,000,000 divided amongst the small farmers would be an enormous benefit to the country, but if it goes into the pockets of the exporters I do not believe it will be any financial benefit to the country at all.  For that reason I think it is important that these records should be kept. The Minister has specified the number of records to be kept, and he leaves it open to himself to extend that in any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has practically unlimited powers.  The Minister will find, that if he reads sub-sections (1), (2), (3) and (4) of Section 17, and also the penalty sections.  The Minister will find there that he has wide scope in insisting on the keeping of records.  An additional record of the price got for a pig, with the weight of the pig and the price paid, would not be a matter of great inconvenience to the exporter.  I know there will be a considerable amount of excitement as to how this record should be kept.  A number of people <Col N="764" /> will say it would be quite impossible to keep it.  Take the man who sells a tubercular pig for export and it is condemned by the veterinary inspector. That man will be able to tell from whom he bought that pig, even though he bought 40 pigs in the same place, and he will be able to tell the value of the pig.  If that is found possible, there is no reason why regulations should not be brought in by the Minister by which each pig would have an identification mark.  That would be a proper regulation, because if it were found that a pig was tubercular, and that that pig came from a particular place in the country where tuberculosis is rampant, it would be necessary for the Minister's Department to come down there to the producer and see where the tuberculosis is. There should be no trouble about that.  If we can find where tubercular pigs are, and keep records, we should just as easily be able to keep records of what the exporter has got for his pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting that the exporters are not going to play the game; but as a safeguard for the producers and in the interests of the dead meat trade I think it is important that some such provision should be made and some record should be kept.  I can visualise a state of affairs, if this Bill becomes law in its present state, in which after twelve months, there will be a falling-off in the quantity of dead pork exported and there will be a want of confidence in the exporters on the part of the producers.  We will be then in the position when the exporter will not know the value of the animal that he is selling.  I believe that the large exporters are going to benefit under this Bill.  The large exporters will not be worried about £100 or £150.  It is the large exporters who are perfectly safeguarded here, and they will get their fees out of the producers.  In my opinion, the Government should put a purely nominal fee on the exporter, and I have put down a figure of £12 10s. as such a fee.  The <Col N="765" /> exporters should also be placed under control so that the producers will be treated fairly.  If large fees have to be paid, the exporters have a ready excuse.  They will tell the producers: &ldquo;I have to pay the Government all this money,&rdquo; and the result is that the price of pork comes down.  I ask farmer Deputies who are pig raisers to support this amendment and to insist that the Minister will accept the principle of it.  That would enable the producer of the pork to get fair play.  The effect of this Bill is to establish a monopoly and it will permit a certain number of exporters to deal with a sheltered trade.</P>

      <P>It is said that fools enter in where angels fear to tread, and I am afraid that in this instance I am doing the foolish thing, because I do not know very much about the pig trade.

      <P>I think it is very unfair for Deputy O'Hanlon to expect the factories, most of which are in a struggling position, to do what no other traders in this country are expected to do, and that is to keep a record of what has been paid for certain articles, and then, after all the operations of the trade have been completed, to be obliged to inform a person what was obtained for a particular pig.  Naturally, the person who sold the pig would be dissatisfied, because he would not understand fully the various divisions of the trade.  It is quite obvious to anybody reading the balance-sheets of any of the co-operative bacon factories that they are not making any great profit.  I think we ought not to put any further barriers in the way by making people dissatisfied with what they are getting.  Deputy O'Hanlon said he was putting forward this amendment because the whole trade was going to be left to a ring of thirty large exporters.</P>

We hope before the Bill goes through that we will have more than thirty exporters, and that we will be able to bring the fees down, and so enable more people to deal with exports and not have all the work of exportation left in the hands of big men.  Deputy O'Hanlon advocated the reduction of the fee to £12 10s., but there is nothing of that nature in his amendment.  The Deputy has made no reference at all to the minimum figure of £75.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that in addition to those regulations he should also provide a special force of the Civic Guard&mdash; perhaps he would bring in the C.I.D. &mdash;for the purpose of protecting the exporters as soon as the producers find out they are being fleeced.  I am afraid from the way this Bill is working out that Deputy O'Hanlon's estimate is correct.  This Bill is going to place the dead meat industry in the hands of a ring.  I believe that ring will fix their prices and they will start out to rob the people.  It will mean the killing of the fresh meat trade.</P>

      <P>We have had a clear indication of what it all means from the Deputy from Cork.  He points out that there is a class of cattle that <Col N="767" /> cannot be shipped from the country for obvious reasons.  He mentioned that there were five traders in a small town engaged in that particular trade and they were all in deadly competition.  I need only repeat what the Deputy said; it is scarcely necessary to add any further remarks to it.  Deputy O'Hanlon, who has a knowledge of office work, surely realises the extra labour that would be entailed by this proposal of his.  It would mean keeping records of the dead weight of the pig, the price paid for the pig, and many other particulars.  Why, it would necessitate the employment of a special staff.  What would the charge be in the circumstances on the industry that we all seem so anxious about?  From whom would the money ultimately come?  What about the producer in that case?  I have some knowledge of an office, and without going into half the details that the Deputy suggests are necessary, I know it would require the employment of a pretty big staff. We must realise that the pigs will not be sold individually, but will come in batches of twenty and thirty from each producer.  This proposition will not work out as a business matter.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt as to who will pay the cost of the increased staff.  The producer will, of course.  Trade is going to remain in the hands of thirty individuals.  If there is any profit in this trade, we will have such competition as we have in the case of the old cow trade, where five in a small town are competing closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profits of these cannot be kept <Col N="768" /> secret any more than the profits of anything else.  If there are any profits we will have plenty of competition, and it is a joke to assume that the trade can be done without the secrets of the trade leaking out. It is not like Guinness's brewery, because we cannot be a second Guinness's brewery.  It is a thing that everybody can do, and if there is a profit in it everyone will be after it.  I suggest that the Deputy should withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey has stated that this is impossible.  This thing has been done in many societies.  I have seen returns myself where pigs were absolutely identified. The prices were sent from London to societies, the pigs were identified to the producers and the prices paid for them were shown. There is nothing extraordinary in the keeping of the records.  The whole question is as to whether the House is inclined to help the producer or to shelter the exporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it could be done the question is, should it be done?  Sub-section (2) of Section 17 states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of every licensed exporter who is not the registered proprietor of the premises in respect of which he is so licensed to keep or cause to be kept in such premises such records as the Minister may, in each individual case, consider satisfactory of all consignments of fresh meat and offals exported by him or by any other person on his behalf from those premises, and within twelve hours after the despatch of any such consignment to enter or cause to be entered in such records such particulars as the Minister may require of the fresh meat and offals comprised therein and the name and address of the person to whom and the route by which the same was consigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, a register must be kept of the number of carcases in the consignment, the weight of the consignment and the person to whom it was sent.  That is all they have to <Col N="769" /> keep, and that is all I can ask them to keep under the Bill.  I have no doubt that if I attempted to ask the factory to keep the sort of records Deputy O'Hanlon suggests they should keep I would succeed, but I could not enforce such a right.  This Bill is to improve the general standard of fresh meat.  Deputy O'Hanlon's suggestion is that records should be kept showing the price paid for each pig by the factory owner and the price at which he sells the resultant product; in other words, the keeping of a register which would show the profits by a very simple calculation&mdash;the general profit of the concern and the profit made in respect of every single consignment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would show only the gross profit.  It is not a question of the net profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite easy to get the net profit when you were dealing with pork.  After all, there would be no doubt about getting the information which would give you the net profit.  The Deputy would admit that this is almost a revolutionary proposal and that it is a proposal that should be considered on its merits.  Now, this Bill is in no way concerned with the profits made by the exporters or by the farmers, this Bill is concerned to improve the quality of exported fresh meat.  The reason why we are endeavouring to improve the quality of exported fresh meat is that we hope there will be a bigger demand for the meat, that if there is a bigger demand for it, there will be a bigger price for it, and if there is a bigger price it will be shared in by everybody from the farmer up.  We hope that.  But the object of the Bill is to improve the quality of fresh meat.  The Deputy has suggested really a totally different Bill&mdash;a Bill to control the prices, to regulate the profits and to establish the relation between the wholesale price, the retail price and the price to the farmer, to establish the relation between the profits the farmers would make and the profits the factory would make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> That is the sort of Bill to which the Deputy's amendment would be relevant.  How, therefore, can we consider it in relation to this Bill? It is a revolutionary proposal.  It would be the only trade in the country where not one, but hundreds of vets.&mdash;certainly fifty or sixty vets. and examiners and all that class of people&mdash;could walk in and find out the private details of the business of the firm, details which these firms hide from everybody else and which they hide from their competitors. There is only one body in the country at present which can insist on getting private details of that sort, the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and their powers are fairly limited&mdash;for the purpose of collecting income tax.  Of course they are pledged to secrecy, and all sorts of precautions are taken which are effectual for preventing the secrets getting out. But here is a case&mdash;one case and one case only&mdash;where it is proposed to give a right to 50 or 60 people to go in and examine these firms' books and to get information which they show to nobody but their directors, information which would be valuable to their competitors.  It is really a revolutionary proposal and a proposal to which there would undoubtedly be, rightly or wrongly, tremendous opposition.  Therefore it is a proposal which should be put up by itself and on its merits and not introduced as a sort of side-wind to a Bill dealing with something else.  This Bill deals with the export of fresh meat with a view to improving it, a totally different matter.</P>

But it is another thing to keep records for the inspection of 50, 60, 70 or 80 inspectors for the purpose of enabling the Minister to take action on the facts and figures which these inspectors would get.  For instance, supposing it were found that, as a result of an examination of the prices which a factory owner paid for a consignment of pigs and an examination of the price which he got for the finished article produced from the consignment, the Minister came to the conclusion that 20 per cent. was made on the consignment, what steps should he take?  Should he say: &ldquo;You should give a bigger price to the farmer and you should be content with less than 20 per cent&rdquo;? There may be a case for State Socialism of that sort, but it is a huge issue which should not be argued on a Bill like this.</P>

He has talked a great deal about them, and he says that he has their interest at heart.  He says he represents them and that he wants to look after their interests.  Now he is in favour of giving me, an irresponsible person like me, power to go into their factories, to examine their books, to find out exactly what they paid for each pig, to find out exactly what they got for all their pork, and to say, in fact, how much of that they should get, and how much they should hand over to the farmers.  That is his <Col N="772" /> position&mdash;the man who is so concerned about keeping the exporters of Cork in business.</P>

What is the point of incurring all the hostility by introducing such an amendment, because undoubtedly it will be opposed tooth and nail by every exporter, and there will be a revolution, particularly in Cork, where Deputy Corry comes from.

      <P>There are too many small businesses.  Is not everything we are doing in connection with the creameries tending to a monopoly? Are we not trying to hand over the creameries to the farmers?  Does <Col N="773" /> anyone suggest that we are not right in closing the small creameries and amalgamating them?  There is no hope for business in this country except in the way of rationalisation and amalgamation.  I will not argue about small businesses and the necessity for protecting the small man, because Deputies can take it that from my point of view, rightly or wrongly, the more amalgamation that takes place the better, and any influence I have has been in the direction of more and more amalgamation. I know country towns where there are four times too many small shops.  Does it lead to competition and price-cutting?  Not at all. It leads to prices going up.  You can get more competition from four big firms which are doing their business efficiently than from four hundred small ones.</P>

If an unhealthy pig gets through we are able to know him when we see him killed, and we are able to advise whoever sent him in within a day or two.

      <P>This section deals with the inspection of registered premises and the point is that if an inspector finds any irregularity or reason why the licence should be withdrawn in his opinion, if he reports the matter to the Minister as the section stands the Minister may serve a notice.  I think that section should be worded in a stronger way.  If there is any irregularity and if the inspector has proved it and so on the Minister should be compelled to serve the necessary notice.

      <P>An inspector, for instance, reports to the Minister that the general condition of cleanliness and the state of the premises are not what they should be.  The Minister communicates with the factory owner and he denies it and says that the plant and equipment are perfect. The obvious thing to do is to send down another man.  On re-inspection they find, for instance, that it is quite good enough.  The Minister ought to have a discretion there.  If the Deputy's amendment were carried I would have to act on every report that came on.  An inspector may make an error in his report and we consider without going into all the circumstances that it is asking too much.  It would make a particular veterinary inspector the Minister for the purposes of the Act.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3) (e).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a particular sub-section on which there has been a good deal of discussion even up to the present time.  It is a paragraph which deals with the minimum number of 3,000 porkers&mdash;that the Minister may refuse to renew the licence unless there are 3,000 porkers exported.  It has also been suggested on another amendment that the number be reduced to 1,000, but I do not see very much use can be served by putting in even 1,000.  I do not see why there should be any number at all mentioned. As we have already mentioned, in discussing previous amendments, the Minister has power to discontinue the licence if the premises are not suitable, if there is not proper cleanliness, and so on.  If the licensee is a satisfactory person from every point of view except that his number is low, that is, for instance, if the amendment were carried for 1,000 and his number were only 990 and he was satisfactory in every way, I do not see why there should be a number mentioned at all.  I mentioned before on the Second Reading that it is rather a dangerous thing to mention a number in some ways.  The proprietors of a factory whose numbers were a little bit low towards the end of the year might feel compelled to go out and compete at an <Col N="779" /> uneconomic figure in order to make up their number for the year.  In that way it would lead to a position we do not want, the position of driving some of the factories into liquidation by paying too much for their porkers.  I would like to ask the Minister to accept this amendment and to cut out the number altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment. The volume of pork trade will depend on the price pork is fetching as against the price bacon is fetching. If it is more economic to fatten pigs up to the point of their being bacon pigs, it will lessen the supply to the pork industry.  Therefore, there might be one year when there might be a considerable volume of fat pork there.</P>

It is not and it should not be, but, in so far as it does that, is it any harm? Is it not all to the good?  Deputy Ryan's point of view is that so far as it does it is harmful.  If you accept the point of view that amalgamations are good, then you should be in favour of some number.  What number do you suggest to make it reasonable?</P>

They would much prefer that they would have the pride of creating a business and making it successful and they are not going to be influenced by the fact that amalgamation is the order of the day and that everything is going into the hands of big corporations. I think it should be left to another opportunity to discuss that matter, <Col N="781" /> but up to the present it is not at all clear that a business in which the proprietor can control the operations and see the work done has not yet a place in the world and cannot be made to compete fairly well with the bigger concerns.</P>

      <P>I met those people and satisfied them.  They thought that we were going to make arbitrary regulations.  But in the case of exporters of eggs there was a case where the crates were so unwieldy that they were difficult to handle and had to be crushed into carriages, with the result that the eggs inside were broken.  That happened to one exporter.  He saw himself that it was absurd, and gave up that particular method of consigning eggs. We thought that possibly the same thing might occur with pork, and we are taking power to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment down to try and persuade the Minister that the penalty in the case of those who might desire to export and who did not comply with the regulations should not be put upon the carrying company, as it is proposed by the wording of this section.  In the first place, the carrying company in the ordinary way will get a consignment with the veterinary officer's certificate, and once the company is put in possession of that certificate, that should in itself relieve the carrying company of any further liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should amend the section at a later stage so as to make it definitely clear that when a carrying company accepts a consignment accompanied by a veterinary officer's certificate they should be relieved of responsibility and that the penalty section should only apply to the carrying company when they fail to produce the certificates in support of any consignments of this kind which they accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was definitely established that they knew the certificate was fraudulent it would not be right to let them off&mdash;if they knew, for instance, that this stuff came from exporters whose licence had just been cancelled&mdash;and that could happen readily.  A licence is cancelled for some reason; the exporter continues to export, and the railway company know that he is exporting after the licence is cancelled; the veterinary certificate is there; the exporter prepares a consignment with the marks on it, it is held up, and the licence cancelled; then the railway company knowingly takes the goods and they should certainly be liable for the penalty. They are safeguarded absolutely by the section, which states: &ldquo;Unless such person proves that he did not know and could not reasonably have known that such fresh meat or offals were being exported in contravention of this section.&rdquo;  We have exactly the same provision in the Dairy Produce Act and there is no trouble about it.  I think the carrying companies with whom I have been in contact realise that.  From the last communication which the Department had from them, it seemed to us that they realised that it was reasonable enough.  In fact, they did not know that such a provision was in the Dairy Produce Act, because we never had any occasion to operate it.  Still, it is well to have it.  The Deputy, if he wishes, can bring it up again on Report.</P>

The exporter may hold these until his licence is cancelled and then he could come along with the certificate and present it to the railway company and they might accept the consignment after getting notice from us that the licence was cancelled.  They should not be in a position to do that.  The Deputy, if he wishes, can bring this up again on the next Stage, which will be a fortnight from now.</P>

      <P>My object in putting down my amendment was to preserve the funds that Section 24 now proposes to take for medical certification to the approved societies and, consequently, to allow them to remain available for the benefit of the insured persons.  Section 24 proposes: &ldquo;There shall be debited to the benefit fund of every approved society in respect of each member (not being a serving soldier) of such society the sum of fivepence for the year 1929 and the sum of two shillings for the year 1930 and for every succeeding year,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it was heretofore the practice that the State provided payment for medical certification.  It is now proposed that the finances of the society are to be used for that, and that 2/- per insured person per annum will be deducted for that purpose.  I think that is a wrong on the insured person.  I think that the adoption of medical certification as a principle under this Act has not proved satisfactory and that neither the societies nor even the members will get value for the 2/- per head per annum that is being charged.  I think it is well agreed that the medical certification system has not worked well; that there have been abuses.  It is fairly well known that certificates are pretty frequently issued when the medical practitioner has not seen the person for whom he has given the certificate over a long period.  Cases have been reported to me where a doctor has left to his maid or to somebody else in the house a number of certificates with instructions that &ldquo;If so-and-so calls for a certificate you can give it to him.&rdquo;  Numbers of these certificates are left there to be called for by people who went to obtain them in order to get continuing medical benefit.  That is not a good system.  In principle, it is wrong that the doctor should be paid by the number of certificates issued. Doctors, like everybody else, are human.  If they can avoid extra work, they like to do so.  Some are <Col N="795" /> more soft-hearted than others and very free in giving certificates. They claim it saves time and bother and that it is a great convenience to the insured person.  I believe it is a wrong principle.  Some other means more effective in dealing with malingering could be adopted and it would be better for the insured person. Some of them have consciences and can be reminded of the fact that it is not right to get certificates in that way.  Such doctors &mdash;I am not saying all doctors are like that&mdash;as do act in that too generous way ought to be reminded that it is not proper.</P>
    <P>I know that letters have been issued by the Insurance Commissioners pointing out that abuses have arisen in connection with this matter.  The medical certifiers in the Free State have been notified, and individual doctors have had their attention called to the fact that too many certificates are issued, and that when these cases were reviewed by other doctors it was proved that 50 per cent. nearly of the total that got certificates regularly could not prove they were unable to work.  Therefore, it seems to me that the system is wrong.  Representations have been made, I am sure, to every member of the House by the Association of Approved Societies and the Association of Trade Union Approved Societies on this matter.  I feel&mdash;perhaps it is a strong term to use, but I think it is a correct term to use&mdash; that this is robbing the funds that ought to be left for the benefit of the insured persons.  It is taking moneys that they have paid for the purpose of getting insurance treatment, and they are not really getting the medical benefit they ought to get.</P>

      <P>(Clare): To my mind there is a good deal wrong with the measure that the Minister is introducing, a good deal that might be plain to the Minister himself and to anyone who has had any experience of insurance administration in this country.  First of all, I want to say that the method the Minister has adopted of dealing with this Bill in Committee is not a desirable one.  National Health Insurance is a purely technical matter, very technical to a good many Deputies who might, in ordinary circumstances, be sitting in this Chamber. It is a very technical matter to most of them, and I think that a special committee of the Dáil would be the proper way to have dealt with this Bill.  I thought that probably the Minister might have adopted that line and taken the Bill before a special committee.  What I take particular exception to is the method by which it is proposed to recoup the medical certification fund&mdash;that is to say, the method by which the Minister proposes to take moneys away from the subscribed funds of members of societies in order to recoup medical insurance certification.  I want Deputies to realise that no attempt whatever is made in the Bill to give anything for medical certification.  The only pill that the Minister administers in this medical provision is the pill of taking money from the sick people and from the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of medical certification is, in itself, somewhat interesting. When the British Government of happy or unhappy memory was responsible for the administration of National Health Insurance in this country they gave £60,000 towards medical certification, and the first act of a free people in this country was to drop a grant such as that of £60,000 or something like it.  Now we find that the £45,000 that it is probably proposed to put up for medical certification alone is not to be got from the approved societies in the fashion that it was got before, that is, from the fund made up of unclaimed stamps, but rather that it is to be got by taking it away from <Col N="797" /> the money set aside for sanatorium treatment.  The Minister is Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I dare say that one of the functions of the Minister is to read a good many reports such, for instance, as the minutes of board of health meetings and documents of that kind.  I want to say without any disparagement of the Minister&mdash; I hope he will accept it in the spirit in which I say it&mdash;that he has not had much experience of the actual operations of board of health meetings. He does not know the hundred and one difficulties that they come up against or the multifarious duties that they have to carry out, beyond probably a theoretical knowledge of it.  He has no practical experience of it.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the giving to these people of a grant of £27,000 odd is not the proper way to administer sanatorium treatment.  I also put it to the Minister that when members of the board of health have disposed of the work that comes before them, work relating to cottages, sanitation, hospitals, the appointment of doctors and nurses, matters relating to water supplies and other things, that they will not be able to give to the proper administration of sanatorium treatment the attention it requires.  If we are going to recoup the administration funds of certain societies by 5d. per head, and if it is necessary to do that, then I think it should be done in some other fashion besides taking it from the money that has been set aside for sanatorium treatment.  I suppose we will have another opportunity of dealing with this matter when the sections come up for consideration. For that reason I do not want to delay very much further on the matter, except to register my definite opinion that the Minister, from two angles, is, in my judgment, dealing in a very injudicious fashion with this question of National Health Insurance.  He has put before the House a measure that, for the average Deputy, is highly technical. I submit that he should take it before a special committee and <Col N="798" /> have it dealt with fully and adequately before that committee. In the second place, not alone has the Minister and his colleagues in office dropped the £60,000 that was given by the British Government for medical certification in this country, but he is imposing upon insured persons, by taking away from them what they were getting for sanatorium treatment, a burden that it is not fair to put upon them.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to clear up the point raised by Deputy Hogan, and on the Second Reading of the Bill by Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  It is a question that is creating considerable alarm amongst people in the approved societies&mdash; the question that no provision is being made in the Bill for the free sanatorium treatment that hitherto was given either by approved societies or by boards of health.  I have had conversations with some people who were interested in this matter.  They would like the Minister to explain what his views are, and to say how he proposes to provide free sanatorium treatment for the people who have contributed towards it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment moved by Deputy O'Kelly had been in order and were passed, the result of it would be to throw the whole cost of medical certification on to State funds.  It would also leave for the benefit of the societies the 5d. per head that, during the last few years, had actually been taken for medical certification as well as 2d. of the 6d. that insurance committees had for administration purposes and that, in actual practice, it was found was not wanted with 3d. actuarially available in respect of each insured person because of the fact that their fundamental contributions had to be brought to the nearest halfpenny.  As well as throwing back that 5d. which, by an Act passed here every year, we have taken for medical certification, it would throw back into the insurance societies the 1/7 which it is now proposed shall not be spent by insurance committees, <Col N="799" /> but that the equivalent of it shall be paid as a State grant to local bodies. The policy of the Executive Council is not to leave that 5d. to the societies, but&mdash;for the same reasons that actuated us in the last few years&mdash;to take it for medical certification. It is not the policy of the Executive Council, in making separate provision for local bodies to the extent of £27,000, to take the 1/7 per head or the equivalent to it, and to pay it into the insurance societies fund as extra benefit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy questioned the whole idea of medical certification.  In so far as it is possible to keep medical certification right and useful, every step that can be taken has been taken towards that end, and there is no proposal in the Bill to do away with medical certification.  The point has been raised that £47,000, or even £30,000, is too much to spend on medical certification.  That is a different matter, but we are not dealing with it in this particular Bill.  As to the point raised by Deputy Hogan, that this is a technical Bill and ought to be dealt with by a special committee, none of the main points in the Bill is in any way technical.  I do not know that the Deputy can point to any amendment which could be described as technical.  Any of the amendments put forward deal with matters of very plain and superficial facts, such as whether sanatorium benefit shall be taken away from people, or whether or not something equally obvious should or should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the method by which funds were made available for the administration of these benefits is plain to every Deputy, or that the method by which they were accumulated is plain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggest is plain, that if sanatorium benefit is taken away from the Act, and if we say we will pay to the local bodies the amount that insurance <Col N="800" /> committees have actually been handing over to them every year for the treatment of insured persons, and that we are handing over that as a State grant to the local bodies, there is nothing technical about that.  If people argue that, as well as handing over £27,000 to local bodies, another £27,000 should be left in the funds of the approved societies, there is nothing very delicately technical about that.  I had no suggestion put up to me until now that this Bill should be dealt with by a special committee.  I have pointed out why we were following what was done eight or nine years ago in England.  I have pointed out the great increase in the provision made for tuberculosis here since 1922.  I have emphasised that although sanatorium benefit was included in the National Health Insurance Act the funds provided were not sufficient to deal with all the insured people, so much so that the giving of sanatorium benefit was taken from under the Act in Great Britain in 1920 or 1921, and that the funds which have been available here for the different bodies have not been sufficient to deal with the proper treatment of the insured persons have been applying to the insurance committees for treatment.  In some cases the money has been exhausted in four months, and in other cases in six months, and only those insured people who apply to the insurance committees while they are in funds can get free treatment.  You have the case of an insured person in a hospital getting free treatment, and another person in the next bed having to pay 5/- or 2/6, or whatever it is, per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I am telling what the general policy of the Bill is.  We are removing the sanatorium benefits at a time when the estimated funds available for insurance committees during the current year will be £27,000, but when the expenditure by local bodies on general tuberculosis treatment in <Col N="801" /> addition will be £59,000 of a State grant, plus £59,000 from their own moneys.  In the year 1922-23 the amount actually given in State grants was £21,000; outside the expenditure from insurance committees there was an expenditure of double that amount, £42,000, on tuberculosis schemes carried out by local bodies.  That total expenditure has gone from £42,000 to £118,000, and it is at a time when the general expenditure on tuberculosis has risen to this particular figure that we are taking away the sanatorium benefit from the Insurance Act and are regulating that the ordinary insured persons will rely on the ordinary public scheme, in the same way as many of them up to the present have had to rely.  In order to secure the general position of local bodies we transfer in addition to the £59,000 that will be given as a State grant, I suppose next year as this year, £27,000 every year to these bodies to recoup them for what they will not receive in the future through the insurance committees, and while they will have to deal with insured persons.  The local bodies during the current year are going to deal with an expenditure of £118,000 that insurance committees have had nothing to do with.  With the exception of six counties, they are going to deal as boards of health with an additional £27,000.  They are going to deal with four-fifths of that amount as well.  According to the Statute under which they are set up boards of health may make provision to delegate to a sub-committee set up for the purpose any of their powers, functions and duties. Such a committee must consist of not less than three persons.  It may consist entirely of the members of the board of health, members of the board of health and others, or of persons not members of the boards of health.  Boards of health are appointed to do a certain class of work.  Persons who are members of boards of health ought to be able to sectionalise their work, one section dealing with water schemes, another with public health, and so on.  At <Col N="802" /> all events the machinery is put into their hands if they want to use it. I think I have replied to Deputy Alton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Local bodies and boards of health in most counties have been getting from insurance societies £27,000 for the purpose of giving sanatorium treatment to insured persons.  That has not covered all the insured persons. With the tuberculosis services improved as they are, we propose to take away sanatorium benefit in cases where there may be any statutory obligations of any kind on an insured person to get them, but we propose to hand over that amount to local bodies in plain recognition of the fact that we are leaving the insured people on their hands under ordinary schemes, but we are also paying them the amount they got in the past for insured persons.  You definitely are passing to a period at which there will be no obligation, good, bad or indifferent, on insured persons to get sanatorium treatment, but if you put £27,000 and impose an obligation on local bodies to give sanatorium treatment you impose on <Col N="803" /> them a burden which they never had, and you are securing for insured persons a right which they never had; and also if the number of insured persons increased, as it might, by 50 per cent. in another few years, you impose on local bodies fresh burdens which nobody thinks of imposing on them.</P>

      <P>A tuberculosis scheme in a normal county provides a tuberculosis officer, some full-time nurses, some part-time nurses, a central dispensary where he attends two or three times a week, and others where he attends perhaps once a week or a fortnight.  In most <Col N="805" /> counties they have special tuberculosis institutions for chronic cases, not the county home.  There are arrangements to provide institutional treatment for, say, early cases of pulmonary tuberculosis such as Crooksling or Newcastle.  There are also arrangements by which surgical cases, usually children, can be sent to places like Cappagh or Coole. Provision in a county home or in a wing of such home, or perhaps in a few rooms of such home, only arises in an exceptional county which is somewhat behind the times.  I think that the Money Resolution should be passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absent when the discussion commenced, but, so far as I understand it, it concerns the question whether the State should bear the cost of medical certification or whether it should be borne by insurance funds.  I did not hear the Minister dealing with that question beyond saying that it was not the policy of the Executive Council to meet out of State funds the cost of medical certification.  It seems to me that a good deal of what the Minister has stated has really been designed to confuse the question. There is no doubt that the State is not going to lose anything as the result of shuffling the burden under the Bill.  The money which it will have to pay to local bodies in respect of sanatorium treatment will be recouped by the fact that it will have no longer to bear a share of the medical certification costs which it bore in the past.  The local bodies are losing nothing, as they will continue to get contributions from the State similar to those which they got from the insurance funds.  The only persons who are losing anything are the insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they losing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are losing, at any rate, that amount of sanatorium benefit which was available before.  The Minister admitted that some of them succeeded in getting sanatorium treatment as a right and <Col N="806" /> free of charge under existing Acts. None of them, however, will now have that right, and they will have to take their places in line with the ordinary population and secure whatever treatment may be made available by local bodies.  They are, however, to continue to pay the same contribution.  That has in no way been diminished.  It seems to me that if the State were to continue to meet the cost of medical certification it would be fairer than the method proposed in the Bill, because insured persons who have to pay the same contribution would be getting something in exchange for what they are losing, namely, the possibility of benefiting when their societies have surplus funds at their disposal.  The State seems to me to be economising at the expense of people who cannot afford it.  There is a case for keeping on the State that portion of the cost of medical certification which the State met in the past.  The Minister has not answered that point beyond stating that it is not the policy of the Executive Council to do that.  I would be glad if he would tell the Dáil why it is not the policy of the Executive Council to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to make the cost of medical certification a charge on insured persons through the approved societies is entirely objectionable, and is more or less contrary to the practice which has obtained hitherto.  In Great Britain medical certification forms part of the medical benefit scheme.  Of course in the Saorstát at the moment we have no medical benefit scheme, and until medical benefit is extended I submit that the present state of affairs should be continued, and that the 1/7 set free by the removal of sanatorium benefit from the Act should be left in the societies' funds for the provision of alternative benefits, such as dental or optical treatment.  Either of these treatments might, in my opinion, be regarded as essential benefits, if the original intention of the Insurance Acts is to be preserved, namely, prevention and cure of sickness.  There <Col N="807" /> appears to be no justification whatever for taking permanently from the funds of the societies 5d. per annum for medical certification. That is a margin which should be left in the societies' funds to safeguard them to some extent from the danger of insolvency which at the moment threatens them.  The Minister will agree that the amounts paid out in sickness benefit during the last two years has increased enormously, and the chances are that many of these societies, particularly the smaller ones, may soon become insolvent, and in consequence it may be necessary for the people who are members of those societies to have their contributions increased.  I think that the present state of affairs should continue until the whole question of medical benefits has been gone into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always held the opinion that the introduction of this Bill should have been postponed until a full, comprehensive Bill dealing with all matters in connection with National Health Insurance was introduced.  The Minister has referred to the question of sanatorium benefit, and suggests that the people who hitherto were accustomed to receive this benefit through insurance committees will receive the same benefit from the boards of health.  I do not think that will be so.  As Deputy Hogan has pointed out, the duties which have to be carried out by members of the public boards are very onerous and intricate.  Anybody who has experience of meetings of these boards knows the long hours that are spent in going through the ordinary duties appertaining to the boards, and I do not think that this will be a wise change.  Moreover, insured persons who pay for this benefit do not want to be placed in the position of having to appear before boards of health as suppliants, so to speak.  They are paying for this benefit through the Insurance Act, and, as far as my experience goes, all claims have been met by the insurance committees with the moneys available.  My <Col N="808" /> principal objection to the change is founded on the fact that ordinary decent people who wish to preserve a sense of dignity will not like to have to appear before boards of health to obtain this benefit.</P>
    <P>There was another point in connection with the change which is important.  Am I to understand that boards of health will have power before granting this benefit to ask an applicant to pay the whole or part of the cost of sanatorium treatment? It may be that the boards of health will inquire into the means of the different applicants, and it may happen that these people will be asked to make a certain payment towards the cost of the treatment.  That will be a very undesirable state of affairs. I think, for the reasons advanced by the various Deputies here, that this section dealing with the transference of the powers of committees to boards of health should be deleted from the Bill until such time as the Minister will be in a position, after consultation with the approved societies, to introduce a Bill dealing with insurance in all its aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that public boards will receive the £27,000 which was formerly given to insurance committees and that there would be a State grant of £59,000 to public bodies for dealing with tuberculosis. Is the increase attributable to the agreement arrived at with county medical officers to deal with the large number of non-insured persons?  Were these public bodies not promised a fifty-fifty grant, and did the Minister not promise that he would be responsible for fifty per cent. of the cost of dealing with tubercular cases amongst non-insured persons?  The amendment means, to my mind, that the Minister has discretion to change the amount allocated to each county as he pleases.  For instance, Dublin, where we hear there is a large number of persons receiving sanatorium treatment, may get a larger grant from the Minister than other counties which have been administering the Act satisfactorily for a number of years.  I have been a <Col N="809" /> member of a sanatorium committee for the last fifteen years, and during my fifteen years' experience I have never known of one applicant being refused domiciliary sanatorium treatment or surgical treatment.  It may happen in larger areas.  The amendment gives to the Minister the right to take back from certain counties the amount allocated to them, and to give it to any other county he wishes.  The insured persons will have no rights at all.  The Minister mentioned that he is doing the same as has been done in England. The English Government, on taking away the sanatorium benefit, gave widows and orphans grants, which were not given here.  The Minister seems to be giving nothing and taking all.</P>

      <P>Medical certification normally is an integral part of the work of national insurance. It is an essential part of the cost, and but for the particular circumstances in which no agreement with the doctors was arrived at in Ireland years ago, when the National Health Insurance Act came into operation, I take it, it would be an integral part of the scheme here.  At any rate, looking at national health insurance now, we have to say that where medical certification is required, the cost of the medical certification should be an integral part of the scheme.  In circumstances in which, when we compare our expenditure from public funds on the treatment of tuberculosis with the expenditure in 1922-3, in circumstances in which we are spending now £76,000 more than we were spending then out of ordinary public funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of non-insured people.  I say in the circumstances in which we are spending £76,000 more on tuberculosis <Col N="810" /> work than we were spending seven years ago, we propose to take tuberculosis treatment from under the National Health Insurance scheme and to transfer to local bodies, in addition to what we are giving them already&mdash;£27,000 per year&mdash;insured persons and transferring them over in the same way as ordinary people.  I say we are doing that.  We are making that change when £76,000 more than was spent seven years ago is being spent. We are doing it at a time when the total expenditure, if you include the £27,000 that I have mentioned, is £145,000.  That £145,000 is being spent entirely on tuberculosis schemes, £27,000 of which, or less than one-fifth, comes from insured funds and at a time when the total number of insured persons receiving treatment is 3,492 and the total number of non-insured persons is 11,004. That is, while the moneys that are available from insurance funds are less than one-fifth of the total amount of money being spent, the number of insured people receiving treatment is more than a quarter of the total number receiving treatment, showing that a considerable number of insured persons are receiving tuberculosis treatment entirely outside the financial scheme of the insurance funds.</P>

    <P>This is not a case of certain persons going as suppliants before the board of health or any other public body.  It is a question of persons being referred either by their own private doctor to the tuberculosis officer of the county or being referred by the dispensary doctor to the tuberculosis officer of the county and being dealt with by him and having their cases subsequently reviewed by the local body responsible for the expenditure, to see if their circumstances are not such that they might be reasonably asked to pay something towards the cost of treatment. So that it is not a question of going as a suppliant before anybody like the board of health.  It is being taken up by the medical machinery in the country, whether private machinery or dispensary machinery, <Col N="811" /> and brought under the notice of the tuberculosis authorities and being helped in that way.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he has considered the question of co-ordinating the laws with regard to National Health Insurance dealt with in this section? Quite a number of Acts are there mentioned, and, as Deputy Hogan said here to-day, this whole question of National Health Insurance and the laws relating to it are very intricate and technical, and it would facilitate everybody who has any business dealing with National Health Insurance if there was some kind of co-ordination and some simplification of these laws.  People who have to look up these Acts have to make so many references that it is very hard to understand them.  I think if the Minister would undertake, when this Bill is passed, to ask his legal advisers to go into that matter, it would be a very useful work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>There are quite a number of lines in the Department's working in connection with which I am arranging a codification of the laws.  I have not given any consideration to this, but I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to do it at the present moment. Reference back to the ideas current here as to changes required in the laws, on the Second Reading, would show that we might spend a lot of time codifying Acts that are very <Col N="814" /> intricate, but which, from the point of view of the people administering the Acts, are not so intricate at all, that we might waste a lot of time of the Oireachtas in doing this, and then it would not be worth while. If we were to go in for the codifying of the whole National Health Insurance Acts, in the light of the discussion that took place here, it would not serve us at all.  I may take some of the ideas discussed here on the Second Reading, and see how they may be moulded into an improved National Health scheme; but if we were to labour in any particular direction, I would prefer to do it in that way than in codifying the present Acts.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I do not want to be raising any conundrums for the Minister, but I would like some information with regard to people <Col N="815" /> who are exempt from insurance payments, and who automatically come into insurance benefit at the present time.  In the ordinary course of the administration of the Act it is well known that one must have a certain number of contributions to credit before one can get treatment.  Am I to understand that these people will get full credit right from the time that the Insurance Act came into operation&mdash;from the time they were employed&mdash;up to the present?  I want to have it made clear if the minimum number of contributions to entitle one to treatment is 104.  People who are exempt from insurance automatically come into insurance now.  What is the position regarding ordinary benefit?  I do not know if I am right in raising the matter at this point.  It is a matter of administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at this stage to raise the matter of the obligation on small farmers in the country to pay National Health <Col N="816" /> Insurance contributions because they do occasional work on the roads.  It is, I understand, a matter of considerable hardship upon numbers of such individuals throughout the country.  Occasionally they do road work, but they are never engaged on that work for a sufficiently long period to acquire the certain number of stamps necessary to entitle them to benefit. These people look upon the obligation to pay as merely a form of tax out of which it is impossible for them to receive anything in return. If the exemption clause is to be abolished altogether it would seem that all their hopes of finding any avenue of escape from the present imposition will be removed.  It seems to me that some of the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts could have been extended so as to include the class of person that I have in mind.  In the 1918 Act there was a clause that had reference to persons intermittently employed.  With regard to certificates of exemption, as far as I know, no certificates have been issued in this country.  I think that if the section were extended so as to make it workable it would be possible to include in it persons of the class that I have described.  These unfortunate people are also subject to the payment of unemployment insurance contributions from which they get no benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know none of that class of person has applied to be treated as an exempted person.  I do not see that we can take a particular type of person like that and discriminate as between him and the ordinary worker on the roads.  I do not see what solution there is for a problem like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of 1918 provided that a person employed intermittently could claim a certificate of exemption.  That section never operated in this country.  As far as I know, no one ever got a certificate of exemption.  It is possible that the persons who could claim were <Col N="817" /> ignorant of its existence and were not aware of the fact that they could be relieved from paying contributions. It would not interfere with the Minister's scheme if that particular section were not repealed. It would then be still possible to grant certificates of exemption to those who were not working a sufficiently long time to enable them to receive benefit.  Considerable hardship is imposed upon the people in rural districts.  The small farmers who occasionally do road work have to pay National Health Insurance contributions as well as Unemployment Insurance contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for doing away with exempted persons has been very fully gone into.  In the past such a person was a privileged person, because, without paying anything himself, he was entitled to receive benefit.  I do not think that we should be driven away from our position, a position that was fully concurred in by the Committee that went into this matter. If there was anything like the serious grievance that the Deputy suggests, I think that we would have heard something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that most Deputies have already heard about that grievance.  I am thoroughly in favour of the abolition of certificates of exemption on the whole, but it seems to me that there was one particular class of the community disregarded when these Acts were being enacted by the British Parliament. Such a class does not exist at all in England.  I refer to the small farmer who has to supplement the livelihood he earns from his land by working occasionally on the roads. While working on the roads he has to pay contributions under the National Health Insurance and the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and yet he does not get any benefit.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of devising some means by which such persons would be exempt from obligation to pay.</P>

      <P>In taking over these deposit contributors and apportioning them to societies, it might happen, if a long interval were allowed, that the healthy lives would join up, perhaps at an early stage and perhaps by consent, with different societies, leaving a balance of unhealthy lives which some societies are inclined to fear might be dumped in on one of them.  Their idea is that it would be better&mdash;in fact even better than my proposal&mdash;if it were made the law that on the passing of the Bill all those people who do not at present belong to approved societies and who are to be allotted to societies by the Commissioners, should be there and then allotted to different societies in whatever manner they desire, but that there should not be a long interval during which people with healthy lives might select one society, or one set of societies, and the unhealthy lives might afterwards be dumped on to one or other of the approved societies.  Such societies would feel a grievance if that method were adopted.  They are of opinion that the sooner these people are dealt with the better, either by being obliged themselves to join up at once with some approved society that they themselves will select, or by the Commissioners fixing right away on societies for them.  They have had long enough to decide upon it themselves. The Commissioners could divide them as they thought proper among all the approved societies, or in whatever way the approved societies thought right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Commissioners to allow a period of three months inside of which a deposit contributor can select his own society.  Then such deposit contributors as have not joined societies will be prevented from electing to join any particular society, and the Commissioners will take the whole list of the residue and assign them to societies.  At the moment, a deposit contributor has the right to join any particular society that he desires, and we consider, in the first place, that it might be undesirable to take away from the individual his right to join any particular society.  It would be, perhaps, even more satisfactory from the Commissioners' point of view if they had not actually to allot deposit contributors but if these joined societies of their own selection. However, the Commissioners will allow three months, and after that the question will arise as to allotting deposit contributors to particular societies.</P>
      <P>Another amendment suggests that the Commissioners should be able to take the bad lives, separate them from the good lives, and then divide up the bad lives in reasonable proportions amongst some of the societies. The Commissioners could have no information upon which to do that, and what the Commissioners will probably do will be to take the deposit contributors over in alphabetical order, or in some way like that, and allot them to societies that they know to be of reasonable strength and capable of supporting them.  But I would suggest to the Deputy that there are good reasons why deposit contributors, between this and the passing of the Bill, and between the passing of the Bill and a reasonable period, say two or three months, should be allowed to join any society they wish.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 14 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 12 of the Act of 1918 shall be construed and have effect as if the following sub-section were inserted at the end thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where an insured person who has given notice of illness within the prescribed time fails for a period of twelve months to submit or continue to submit medical or other satisfactory evidence of incapacity he shall be treated as if he had not given notice of illness since he last received benefit or ceased to submit such evidence of incapacity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to remedy a very serious defect which has come to light in the administration of benefits under the Acts.  It has been held that an insured person fulfils the statutory conditions for benefit if he becomes ill and gives notice of illness.  There is, however, no obligation on him to submit evidence of incapacity within any specified time, and the consequences are that he can wait for an indefinite period&mdash;for five or ten years&mdash;then lodge a medical certificate with his society, and demand payments for the whole of the intervening period. During that time he has avoided supervision, although the Act normally contemplates that he should be subject to the society's supervision from week to week.  Consequently the society is at a great disadvantage in deciding whether benefit should be paid or not.  The amendment stipulates that a period of twelve months should be given, and if the member has not prosecuted his claim during that period that he shall become disentitled to any benefit whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand this particular amendment, it might provide a very serious grievance for a number of people.  I understood the Deputy to say that medical certification was not required, and that benefit only <Col N="823" /> became payable on disclosing evidence of incapacity.  I think the Commissioners insist on evidence of incapacity being disclosed by means of a medical certificate.  As far as I can understand the amendment, it is intended to apply to cases like this: An insured person becomes ill, and is ill for six months, when the agent of the approved society comes along and says: &ldquo;Your benefit is finished now.&rdquo;  In ignorance, the person accepts that statement.  Thirteen or fourteen months pass, and then someone tells him: &ldquo;You have been disabled; you have been sick all this time; you were entitled to disablement benefit after six months' sickness benefit.&rdquo;  The person then goes to the approved society and makes a claim for disablement benefit.  If in any particular case like that it could be shown that it was through the action of the approved society's officer the person was deprived of disablement benefit, not understanding that he was entitled to it, and did not submit the necessary certificate, it would be wrong that a person who was really disabled over that period should be statute-barred from getting the benefit.  If the amendment is intended to cover any other case than the type of case I suggest, I would like to have a clearer explanation of it.  But, in order to be entitled to be paid benefit, a person must bring forward evidence of incapacity, and in normal cases we would not contemplate that a person would not make a claim or would not send in a medical certificate for a period of twelve months.</P>

      <P>I am told that there have been cases of that kind where men who for many years had not prosecuted their claims came along after five, six or ten years.  I have been told that that is so.  It is a hardship on approved societies to have claims of that kind thrown upon them for which, according to the rules, they have made no arrangement. <Col N="824" /> The difficulty of certifying that a man had been ill all that time then arises.  The man may have been ill, but may not have known his rights in the matter.  At any rate, some approved societies suggest that there ought to be some limit of time during which a man can prosecute his claim, and that they should not be liable where a man had been ill&mdash;even if it were for four or five years&mdash;if he came along with the claim unexpectedly when they had no opportunity of supervising or of knowing whether he was really ill or incapacitated.  There ought to be some safeguard for the funds of the society by limiting the amount of the claim.  There have been cases of the kind.  I heard of one case where an ex-soldier who went through the war, got benefit out of the British Army Pensions Scheme, and who, as soon as he had exhausted his rights there, went along to the insurance people. There was no limit to the amount he could claim.  It is suggested that there should be some limit in order to prevent extortionate demands being made on the societies.</P>

With their knowledge of the working of the Act they claim that as the section stands it is not clear.  If the Minister has got a copy of the document, I need not refer to it any further.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I move, on behalf of Deputy Corish, amendment 10:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I will have to repeat what I said on the Money Resolution in this matter, and I am afraid I will have to ask the Minister to give us more definite reasons for this alteration. In replying to the criticism that was advanced on the Money <Col N="828" /> Resolution, he juggled somewhat the figures.  He gave us lists of thousands of pounds which were being paid in tuberculosis treatment more than were paid in previous years, and told us, notwithstanding the provisions made in the Insurance Acts of 1911 and 1918, etc., that a good many people affected with tuberculosis had to go without treatment. These things in themselves were very interesting, but he did not tell us how the present Bill improves the situation.  He did not tell us why the administration of sanatorium treatment should be taken out of the hands of people who had years of practice and experience, and who to a great extent are very well known for social work, and did that social work very well, and handed over to a body who have no experience whatsoever in the administration of sanatorium treatment. I do not say that with any intention of disparaging the integrity of the boards of health.  I do not say for a moment that they are not good, useful bodies to administer certain services, but I do say that for the administration of sanatorium treatment they are not at all adapted.</P>
    <P>It was on this consideration that I asked the Minister to refer this matter to a special committee of the Dáil, because there are so many intricacies in it, so many things which Deputies would like to know before they would come to a conclusion or make up their minds as to what they would do in respect to this section of the Bill.  The Minister told us that there is nothing technical in it.  I submit to the Minister that there are many things technical in it, and I submit to him that the taking away of the money for sanatorium treatment and handing it over for medical certification is one of the worst uses that could be made of the money.  I know that in ordinary circumstances I would be speaking with doctors to right of me and doctors to left of me, and I suppose I would be in a dangerous position in doing that.  £45,000 is to be given <Col N="829" /> for medical certification alone, and not one ounce of medicine or attention is given, simply a patient is suffering from T.B. or something of that kind.  That is all that is in the certificate and the money is diverted from where it is useful and doing good work in sanatorium treatment and is to be handed over to make up that fund.  £60,000 given by the British Administration was dropped somewhere in 1922 or 1923.  We took fivepence per insured member as well as an amount of money out of the Unclaimed Stamps Fund to make up the medical certification fund.  The only reason adduced by the Minister for robbing the sanatorium fund is that he wants to make up the medical certification fund.  He has endeavoured to evade the point of questions.  He has not said that the taking of that money from the administration of the sanatorium benefit is going to be any good to the insured persons; he has not said that it is going to give any additional sanatorium treatment.  He has simply said that he wants to replenish the medical certification fund and that is all.</P>
    <P>It will sound something like a platitude to repeat this, but it must be repeated on this occasion.  Those of us who have some experience of local bodies, those of us who know the amount of work they have to go through, those of us who know the large correspondence, the administrative details and the local considerations that press upon them will know perfectly well that to tack on this administration of sanatorium benefit to county boards of health is not the best way, and that is putting it mildly, to administer sanatorium treatment.  I submit that the Minister ought in all sincerity to take the opinion of the representatives of the various boards of health in this matter.  He ought to take the opinion of the various county councils in this matter and ought to take the consensus of opinion in this matter of Deputies who have some experience of local administration.  I think if he takes all that he will convince himself that administration of <Col N="830" /> sanatorium benefit by the county boards of health is not at all suitable. There is no use in juggling with thousands of pounds, telling us that we are getting £59,000 and £100,000.  They simply reduce what we were getting before.  We were getting fifty-fifty in the matter of sanatorium treatment.  You are going to get that now.  £27,000 is going to be given as a grant from State funds to the boards of health. But you are taking from the funds of the societies and the funds of the members 1/7 in order to make up the deficiency that you have already in the medical certification fund. What is the good of your saying you are giving with your right hand when you are taking away with your left?  What is the use of saying that because boards of health administered sanatorium treatment in the past they are capable of administering all kinds of sanatorium treatment? The Minister ought to know perfectly well that the boards of health, under the present conditions, are not the proper bodies to administer this.  He ought also, before he says the boards of health could be used for this purpose, to tell us how the old county committees maladministered, what charges of maladministration he has against them. Has he any cases of where they did not give sanatorium treatment when they had the funds to do it?  I submit these things to the Minister and ask him in all sincerity and in consideration of the large volume of opinion that is expressed by the various public bodies to leave the committees as they are and not put the administration of sanatorium treatment on the county boards of health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of the maladministration of the sanatorium committees.  There is no question of maladministration by a sanatorium committee.  None has been brought forward.  But what has happened, say, in Clare, where the local committee has a sum of something over £600 a year to administer? In the first place they have to hand over that money to the <Col N="831" /> board of health to do this work, and in the second place, in administering it in that particular way, I suppose they paid £136 a year in salaries. With the exception of five or six local bodies throughout the country the insurance committees have taken their funds and handed them to the local boards of health with the names of the people who were to get sanatorium treatment.  If the Deputy suggests that the boards of health are incapable of carrying on the work of the sanatorium committees I do not know why the committees did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that they were not capable.  I did suggest that they were overloaded with work and that they could not possibly do this effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also pointed out that you have £118,000 out of tuberculosis schemes, and you add to that four-fifths of the £27,000 that the insurance committees had to handle.  All that money was directly administered by the boards of health.  So that what you are passing over to them now is the extra five or six thousand pounds that the committees that have not had agreements with the local bodies have been spending directly.  And this is throwing an untold and unwarranted burden on the boards of health.  Our tuberculosis schemes are part of our general public health schemes and must be carried out by the boards of health.  I have no representation from the boards of health that they have not suitable machinery at their disposal to do the work.  If I had any such representations I would be able to show them how they might be able to make use of the powers given to them to set up the proper machinery to carry it out. The Deputy talked of juggling with figures.  I explained fully on the Money Resolution and on the Second Reading that there was no complete statutory right existing by which an insured person would get sanatorium treatment, that he simply took his chance when funds were available.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks nothing of figures&mdash;that it is only fifty-fifty, fifty from the State and fifty from the local bodies, that it is only the same as in 1922 and 1923.  I say now that we are spending £76,000 more of ordinary public moneys in dealing with tuberculosis throughout the country.  It is at the time at which we have come to that we have taken away sanatorium benefit from the insured persons. The money that they were receiving from the insurance committees up to the present will be handed over to these local bodies subject to such conditions as the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance shall appoint when they are being handed over, because we are expecting them to deal in future with not only the insurance people with whom they dealt with out of their own funds, but with people that the insurance committees dealt with out of insurance committee funds.</P>

We want to ensure that the £27,000 which is to be allocated to the public bodies shall be used solely in the interests of insured persons and that it cannot be devoted to any other service&mdash;in other words, that an insured person recommended by the tuberculosis medical officer or any dispensary doctor for sanatorium treatment shall be entitled to receive that treatment, because of the fact that the public body had received a grant from the sanatorium fund.  At the present time, a certain amount of money is spent by public bodies and insurance committees on the treatment of tubercular cases.  I hold that under the Bill, as it stands, a large number of people who will find themselves at the mercy of members of boards of health and dependent upon charity will not look for treatment for themselves or their families if they have to go round and canvass members of the board of health or a sub-committee of the county council.  If insured persons have to appeal to these members by way of charity instead of by right, men who are in employment and whose children require treatment for tuberculosis will not seek to have them treated.  They would not like that the fact should be published that a member of their family was suffering from this disease, because it might affect them in their employment if their employers knew that their wives or children were suffering from tuberculosis, and they might find themselves out of employment.  The amendment asks that the insured person will be in no worse position under the Bill than under the old system.  I have fifteen years' experience of sanatorium committees and I have never yet known a case that was refused sanatorium treatment or surgical or medical treatment in a Dublin hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an insured person has been paying for what he has been promised under the 1911 Act, he should be entitled to sanatorium treatment, if recommended for it.  He is not getting any increased benefit, and is paying the same contribution, but he is now placed at the mercy of whatever committee the Minister may appoint&mdash;a sub-committee of the board of health or otherwise&mdash;if he himself or his wife or children want sanatorium treatment.  It is not in the interests of insured persons, and it will not help to stamp out this dreadful disease if insured persons have to go round and appeal to members of <Col N="837" /> these public bodies, and it will not make for the success of the county medical officers scheme.  Under the old system all cases were dealt with in secret and there was no publication of the names of persons receiving benefit, so that an insured person could rest assured that no one outside the committee and the doctor knew anything of the matter. As I said, this amendment is moved to ensure that insured persons shall have the right to which they were entitled up to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, No. 15 on the Paper, is in similar terms to that moved by Deputy Everett on behalf of Deputy Murphy.  We are anxious, as well as Deputy Murphy and Deputy Everett, to secure, as far as we can, that the insured persons shall feel that they have a right, which they have had up to now under the Act, to sanatorium treatment, even though abolished by an Act of this House just now, and that they have it under the same conditions as they had it heretofore.  Since the Act came into operation seventeen years ago, those insured persons had been paying for sanatorium treatment.  That was part of the benefits they had paid for and the payment was demanded from them by law&mdash;under the Insurance Act. We have deprived them to a certain extent of that right by the abolition of sanatorium committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us on this side of the House would not vote for the abolition of sanatorium benefits or sanatorium committees if it were to mean that all the rights hitherto enjoyed by insured persons under the Act with relation to sanatorium treatment were to be filched from them. The Minister made a statement earlier, which more or less reassured us, that those people would not lose their rights, but that the funds for the treatment of tuberculosis would be in proportion available for insured persons.  We are anxious to go a little further and, if possible, to secure from the Minister a guarantee that under the sum of £27,500 now allocated to the local body insured persons will be guaranteed <Col N="838" /> sanatorium treatment to the same extent, at least, as it was guaranteed to them under the Insurance Act heretofore.  The Minister told us, of course, that they could not expect to have that sanatorium treatment free; that in the past the funds of the insured committees did not allow in all cases of insured persons getting sanatorium benefit absolutely free, and that some insured persons had to pay a proportion of the cost.  We think that when insured persons have paid they ought to get such sanatorium treatment free.  My belief is that if the Insurance Acts were fully worked, and if all people that ought to be insured were brought within the ambit of the Acts, and paid their insurance tax and stamped their cards&mdash;employers and employees&mdash;there would be funds enough.  But the proportion of non-compliance in the Free State is very considerable.  It is probably decreasing, if we are to judge by the figures, but still it must be very high, and if the Acts were worked and the machinery available were used to a greater extent to prevent that non-compliance, the insured persons would probably in the past have been able to get free sanatorium treatment.  At least, some of us think so.  I would like the Minister to give a guarantee that the amount of sanatorium treatment given to insured persons in the past under the Act, and the rights that they had, will not be absolutely filched from them by the passing of this Bill, and that they will have a feeling that sanatorium treatment to which they were entitled, in so far as they were entitled to it, free, from the county committees or boards of health, will be preserved to them in the future.</P>

      <P>I should like to support to a large extent what has been said by Deputy Everett and Deputy O'Kelly.  What is causing a great deal of disturbance in the minds of the insured people at the present moment and in the minds of the societies with whom they are insured is that there should be no falling off in sanatorium benefit that <Col N="839" /> has been the right of those people in the past.  If the Minister could give an asurance that there would be no falling away from or interference with the benefits given to the insured people in the past, I for one would be perfectly satisfied.</P>

I want to be sure that the sum that morally belongs to the insured persons is earmarked for their benefit.  I would be glad if the Minister could go further and accept Deputy O'Kelly's proposition, that every insured person, if requiring it, should receive sanatorium treatment.  I see, of course, the Minister's difficulty.  I learn that the fund hitherto has not been sufficient to secure that benefit, but I would like to see that the benefit which insured persons have been receiving up to the present is not impaired in any way by the present Bill.</P>

      <P>No, but as far as the statute goes.  I do not say that I can ensure that it will be applied to all insured persons.  Take the situation that the House is dealing with.  Deputy Everett, who has moved this amendment, comes from Wicklow.  In spite of the fact that throughout the country we are spending this year £118,000 on tuberculosis schemes, the County Wicklow is not spending anything.  Whether that is due to the fact that County Wicklow has no tuberculosis to deal with except the cases of tuberculosis that find themselves amongst insured <Col N="840" /> persons I do not know, but the insurance committee has about £760 to spend.  Under a particular section of the 1911 Act, it is possible for an insurance committee to give sanatorium treatment to the dependants of insured persons.  There is possibly not a second county in the country in which it has been possible, out of the funds at the disposal of the insurance committee to do that.  Wicklow is a county in which it has been possible to do that. While the rest of the country is spending £118,000 through public moneys this year on tuberculosis schemes, Wicklow is a country which is spending nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it is possible for a particular county, out of its insured funds, to give sanatorium benefit not only to insured persons, but to the dependants of insured persons.  You have <Col N="841" /> other places where the money does not satisfy the demand at all, and where insured persons, either at the present moment or in years past, although they were insured persons, and although sanatorium benefit was included in the Act, had to depend on the expenditure of local or other State moneys in order to get tuberculosis treatment.  How could we enshrine in a statute a statement such as that which is embodied in the amendment before the House, a statement to the effect that insured persons shall get such treatment &ldquo;and in the same conditions as he would have been entitled to receive as sanatorium treatment if recommended therefor by an insurance committee?&rdquo;  If recommended therefor by an insurance committee he might get treatment for his dependants in Wicklow, but in the County Borough of Cork, or in most of our other counties, he would not have got anything, perhaps, if he applied late in the year.</P>
      <P>All that can be ensured is that the £27,000 will be spent upon tuberculosis. Insured persons, as well as other people, have this assurance: that tuberculosis treatment and tuberculosis schemes have so developed that we are spending £76,000 more this year than we were spending even seven years ago. Deputies quoted the figures of certain societies and the figures of certain members.  There are big representative societies which make representations to the effect that they do not see why a disease, such as tuberculosis, should be specially dealt with by sanatorium funds at all; why tuberculosis any more than, say, dental treatment, should be specially provided for as a statutory benefit under an Act.  I think there is a good deal to be said for that. We are taking sanatorium treatment from under the National Health Insurance Act.  We are giving £27,000 to local bodies because of the change made with regard to insurance committees, and we are ensuring that this £27,000 shall be absolutely ear-marked for the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the attitude of the Minister on this question cannot be described as satisfactory, but as the amendment before the House has been advocated by more than two groups or parties in the House, it is possible that we may be able to induce the Minister to change his mind.  The Minister says that the most he will be able to ensure is that the £27,000 odd which will go to the local bodies under Section 23 of the Act, will be used for the treatment of tuberculosis.  That, of course, is obvious from the terms of the Bill, but surely it should be possible in this Bill to impose upon those local bodies the obligation to expend whatever proportion of the £27,000 they receive for the purpose of providing for insured persons, free of charge and as of right, sanatorium treatment similar to the treatment they received when recommended by insurance committees in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to consider whether the fact of ear-marking a certain amount of money for insured persons might not have the effect of local bodies discriminating against insured persons once the amount of money allocated to a particular county under the grant of £27,000 had been spent.  They might feel &mdash;it would be easy for such a tradition to grow up&mdash;that a certain amount of money had been sent to provide for insured persons, and as between the residue of insured persons and the ordinary population &mdash;once that amount of money had been spent&mdash;they might discriminate against the insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if that mentality is going to exist in the minds of members of local bodies in the future it would have existed in the past.  These bodies are not going to get any more nor any less than they got in the past for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The only difference that this Bill will involve, as far as they are concerned, is that the £27,000 which they would have got from insurance funds in this year will instead come from the Exchequer, <Col N="843" /> and that they will not be under the obligation, which they would have been if this Bill were not passed to give in respect of that £27,000 free sanatorium treatment as of right to insured persons.  We voted against Deputy Corish's amendment to delete sub-section (1) and retain sanatorium treatment because of the reasons mentioned by the Minister himself.  Sanatorium treatment has not been anything more than a term in the Act for a large number of people.  Sanatorium benefit as provided in the Act of 1911 could only be given in so far as funds were available to give it.  The retention of that particular section in the Act, therefore, is of no benefit to insured persons. What is of benefit is that the amount of treatment which was available for insured persons under the Act should not be diminished in consequence of that particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sum of £27,000 going to local bodies for the purpose of giving treatment to insured persons. The local bodies will continue to get that £27,000 and they will continue to get other Government grants for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The only thing that the amendment of Deputy Murphy and Deputy O'Kelly asks is that in respect of the £27,000 they will be obliged to give free treatment to such persons as are recommended to them until the £27,000 is exhausted.  I admit that there will be certain areas in which the amount allotted will be exhausted, and there will be other areas in which it will be sufficient to meet the claims on it for the year.  Why should not the money be expended for the benefit of insured persons?  I admit that there is the possibility that the effect of such an obligation being placed on local bodies might be that they might discriminate against insured persons.  In respect of ordinary tuberculosis funds I cannot see that becoming serious, but if it became serious I cannot see why the Minister should not be able to deal with the development of such a mentality so as to ensure that if persons will be <Col N="844" /> asked to pay the same contribution as in the past they should have in respect of sanatorium treatment the same possibility of securing free treatment.  That is not asking too much.  It is possible for the Minister by accepting one of these amendments, or drafting an amendment which he would consider more suitable, to ensure that taking place.</P>
    <P>He says he does not think he has the power under any of the statutes to impose on local bodies the obligation to give free treatment to insured persons, but the powers he has in existing statutes do not matter.  It is the powers he is taking under this Bill that matter.  He can in this Bill take powers to compel local bodies to give free treatment to insured persons in so far as the £27,000 available for the purpose will cover it. The fact that in certain areas that amount will not go very far, or meet any big proportion of the applications, does not alter the justice of the claim that the £27,000 which is still being made available, and indirectly is being made available out of insurance funds, should be used for the benefit of insured persons. The point, perhaps, has been lost sight of that the State in giving this money to local bodies for tuberculosis treatment is taking steps to ensure that it will not lose, for it is releasing itself from the obligation to pay a similar amount in respect of medical certification, the cost of which will have to be met entirely out of insurance funds.  Because of the fact that insurance funds are being used to make this contribution to local bodies for the upkeep of sanatoria and that insured persons are paying it, steps should be taken in this Bill that the benefits, no matter how incomplete, of the past should be retained in the future.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Deputies have put down roundly-phrased amendments, and they cannot be clear as to what exactly they want to achieve.  You have a sliding position, if I might so call it, in different counties.  You could have a changing position in different counties at different times.  For instance, while you <Col N="845" /> might have a position, say this year or last year, in Wicklow, in which not only some insured persons but some of their dependants might be able to get all the tuberculosis treatment they applied for, in certain counties, you might have the position that the number of insured persons applying for tuberculosis treatment might exhaust all the funds.  How then is the local body to deal with the residue that finds itself up against an amendment such as No. 11 or No. 15?  Deputy Lemass speaks of persons recommended.  Amendment No. 15 speaks of persons &ldquo;duly recommended&rdquo; to a local body. &ldquo;Duly recommended&rdquo; by whom&mdash; by the approved societies?</P>

      <P>Is not that a condition that obtained up to the present?  What is asked is to give an assurance that there will be no change.  Up to the present where the amount was not sufficient to give all the people who required it sanatorium benefit, it had to be withheld. We recognise that.  We want an assurance that insured persons will, in the future, have as good a chance of getting treatment as in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the only possible way in which we could clearly arrive at that would be that there should be a condition under which these sums of money supplied to local bodies would not be less than the amount of money used in giving free treatment to insured persons.  Assuming that there was a demand on the part of insured persons for treatment up to that particular amount it seems to me that that is the only way in which you can deal with the matter at all.</P>

If that was made one of the conditions it would still involve insured persons giving proof of means and establishing the fact that they could not pay, and the money made available under Section 23 would be used for giving free treatment only to persons who could not pay for it, and who would get it free in any case.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that there is a possibility of county boards of health discriminating against insured persons suffering from tuberculosis.  It strikes me that the just thing to do would be, seeing that it is possible the £27,000 will not go round, to relieve these people of the amount of the contribution which goes towards T.B., as otherwise you are taking money from them that you should not.  It is a small sum <i>per capita</i> but it amounts to the big total of £27,000 in the year.  If insured persons are only going to get the same treatment as members of the public who are not insured, and even if they are to be, as the Minister suggested, discriminated against, I think they should be exempt from paying the contribution.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite clear what we want to do.  As I understand the matter, at present insured persons can get free sanatorium treatment up to the amount of £27,000 a year.  Clearly what we want to secure is that insured persons shall still have the right to free sanatorium treatment to the extent of £27,000 a year.  In future, that money shall come through the local boards of health instead of through the insurance committees.  As the Minister pointed out, it ought to be easy to do that.  I can understand his objection to the amendments, because in the form in which they appear they give an absolutely nebulous right, and therefore it would be a matter of chance whether these persons got free sanatorium treatment or not.  As I say, these persons at present get free sanatorium treatment up to the amount <Col N="847" /> of £27,000.  Surely we can secure in the Bill that that amount shall be spent if there are cases requiring it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Every official of an insurance committee serving at the date of the passing of this Act whose appointment has been sanctioned by the Insurance Commissioners and who is not transferred with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to the service of the council of a county or county borough or a committee thereof shall be entitled to receive compensation for abolition of office in accordance with the rules contained in the Third Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) For the purpose of making provision for the compensation of officials of insurance committees in accordance with the preceding sub-section a fund shall be <Col N="849" /> created, to be called the &ldquo;Insurance Committee Officials Compensation Fund,&rdquo; to which shall be credited such sums as are hereinafter provided and out of which shall be paid such compensation as may be awarded as compensation to insurance committees in accordance with this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposal contained in this amendment is with the object of making it certain that the small number of persons likely to be affected, about thirty in all, will receive the compensation to which they are entitled as a result of the passage of this measure.  The Bill, in the first instance, has been introduced in the public interest, and if it was necessary in the public interest to deprive certain individuals of their positions, I think it is desirable that they should be fairly and generously compensated.  Under sub-section (4) the Minister may make certain regulations in regard to compensation, but he is not obliged to do so, that is, he is not obliged to make regulations providing for compensation to the thirty individuals who are likely to be affected.  From our point of view, that is a great weakness in the wording of the sub-section.  Paragraph (a) of sub-section (4) says that the Insurance Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations in relation to the manner in which any surplus standing to the credit of the Sanatorium Benefit Fund or the administration fund of any insurance committee after all liabilities have been met, is to be disposed of.  The words &ldquo;any surplus&rdquo; constitute the trouble there.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether the Minister has at his disposal any figures showing the amount of any surplus which may be in existence after the passing of this measure. If no surplus is available there will be no money to give compensation and my amendment is to make it certain that a solvent fund will be created to pay compensation to those who are likely to be affected <Col N="850" /> by this Bill.  That is the serious difference between my amendment and that in the name of Deputy P.S. Doyle because, if the latter is accepted, it will not make it obligatory on the Minister to give compensation. The whole principle involved in Deputy Doyle's amendment will allow compensation to be paid only if a surplus is available. I would advise the Minister to pay due regard to the obligations which his predecessor undertook in the Local Government Act, 1925, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce undertook in the Electricity Act, and which were also undertaken but not at the expense of the ratepayers in the Railways Act, 1924.  If the policy has been adopted in the case of those Acts to give compensation to individuals removed from their positions in the public interest it is a public duty and responsibility on the part of this House to see that there is a fund to give suitable compensation to those deprived of their livelihood by the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>16.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Secretaries and other officials of not less than five years' service and whose income from other employment does not exceed £200 per annum employed by County or Borough Insurance Committees abolished under this section shall unless provided with equivalent employment under the County Council or Board of Health of such County or Borough Council be granted compensation for loss of office, such compensation to be on a scale not less favourable than that provided for officials compulsorily retired under the Railways Act, 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin has made the case that I wish to make in moving my amendment.  These officials of County Committees are being dispensed with, as Deputy Davin said, in the public interest.  Their employment is being taken from them and <Col N="851" /> it has not been the practice here&mdash; at any rate I do not presume that the Minister would wish to introduce a new precedent&mdash;that such people should have their appointments taken from them without compensation being offered to them. The Minister did say on Second Reading that under sub-section (4) of Section 22 funds would be available. I understand, but I do not know if it is correct, that the administration funds would have a surplus.  The funds of the County Committees have been pooled.  In some cases there was a surplus, and in some cases there were deficiencies, but whatever monies were available were pooled, and as a result of the pooling there is a surplus on the administration fund.  What the amount of the surplus is, is known to the Minister.  We do not know it, and we do not know whether out of that surplus, which is said to be available, there would be much money for the compensation of those people.  There are not very many of those people, but some of them have been in the employment of the insurance committees for 17 years, since the Act came into operation, and in justice to them, they should not have their employment taken from them and be thrown out of office without compensation of any kind.</P>
    <P>We think, of course, that there is a limit to the way in which public funds can be used in that manner, and Deputies on this side are of opinion that where a person has a living wage already, public funds should not be used to an unlimited extent in granting even compensation for the taking away of employment. In our amendment we set down that those who have already an income from other sources, of £200 per annum, ought not necessarily receive compensation out of those funds.  We suggest that all those officials who can be profitably employed by local bodies under the Board of Health, who are now taking over the work of the insurance committees, such of them as are available for such work, and <Col N="852" /> where the services of somebody like them would be needed, should be taken over by the local authorities, either the county councils or the boards of health.  Of course, the Minister could not order that, but if, as the Minister pointed out, these bodies have power to set up subcommittees to look after such matters as tuberculosis work, we think that if the Minister strongly recommended the appointment of voluntary committees of that kind, to take charge particularly of the work of looking after tubercular people, good work could be done by boards of health in that way, better work than a board of health could do through its own members at present.</P>
    <P>I think nobody who has any association with the work of a board of health in any county can deny the fact that these boards are overworked in many cases.  I understand that they cannot meet very frequently.  Of course, people have other duties to attend to, and when they do meet they have a long day's session.  Frequently towards the end of the day after long discussions on various matters relating to the health of the county, the secretary submits a recommendation from some committee.  The board perhaps have not time to go into it, and the secretary says: &ldquo;I suppose you will adopt the recommendation of such-and-such a committee.&rdquo;  That is how the work is done even by boards who would be willing and anxious to go into every phase of the work in the county.  They cannot do it.  They cannot overtake the work.  The Minister has pointed out that they have the powers to appoint sub-committees, and he should strongly recommend the appointment of voluntary committees to look after matter of that kind, especially after the abolition of the insurance committees which were doing a small circumscribed kind of work.  This other work to be performed, in general, would be more difficult work, but it would be work to which he could get people in every county who are interested in the matter to give the benefit of their services.  If such <Col N="853" /> committees were formed, the services of the employees of the late insurance committees could be utilised, and if they were so utilised, of course, compensation would not be necessary.  The Public Health services of the county in general would benefit.  The services devoted to the people who are suffering from tuberculosis would in particular benefit, and it would be an improvement all round.  It would save some expense for the public bodies, and these people having a knowledge of this class of work would do it probably more efficiently than those who have not such experience.</P>

      <P>I should like to give qualified support to the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kelly. There is a limit to the amount of public moneys which can be spent and there is certainly a limit to the amount of pensions that should be given.  The country is pretty full of pensioners at the present time and I would not be at all prepared to support pensions for people who have not been giving their full time to this work.  At the same time I think it would be hard on people who have been employed for periods such as Deputy O'Kelly has mentioned, 17 years, and who have given their full time to the office, to be dependent on the very vague provision which is contained in this Bill.  However, I think there are very many people who have other employment, to which this office has been a little addition.  The cutting off of this work, therefore, would not be of very great consequence to them.  On the other hand I think it should be possible to make an effort to absorb these officials in the new work contemplated. As far as possible the Commissioners should endeavour to absorb particularly people who have been giving their wholetime service to this work.  That is the suggestion I would make in support of Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, namely, that an effort should be made to absorb these officials engaged in this wholetime work, and secondly, I think it is only fair that people who have been employed as wholetime servants <Col N="854" /> should be compensated.  The other matter is one with which I am not sufficiently familiar to speak with any confidence.  But I think that people who have already good salaries and who had little appointments added on, in connection with insurance work could not have the same claim for compensation as those who were deprived of offices to which they gave fulltime service.</P>

    <P>(a)  for the establishment of a Wheat Control Board, which shall be a Limited Liability Company, charged with the purchase of imported wheat for re-sale to millers and the fixing of a minimum price to be paid by Saorstát millers for home-grown wheat sold to them for milling purposes;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have practically nothing to add to what I said when this motion was being last debated. This is the third or fourth time that this particular question has been discussed in the Dáil and the presentation of the case on this occasion is exactly the same as the presentation on a previous occasion.  I am quite convinced if we continue that procedure during the rest of this debate we will get no results of any kind&mdash;either positive or negative. For that reason I would like to come down to some specific points. All I am going to say now has already been said in the majority report on wheat growing.  I would like to put the net points that have been made there, and if speakers are to follow me in opposition, I would like them to deal with these points, because it is better to deal in some detail with these points than roam or travel in a general way, or discuss in a general way, a number of very numerous and complicated issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is contended, and arguments have been advanced to show, that wheat-growing for seasonal and climatic reasons is rather more unsuitable to this country than the growing of any other crops which are grown here now on a commercial basis.  That is contended, and that is held by a very great number of farmers.  That is the first point. The second point is a fact that can be established and cannot be denied, that the trend of prices has been more against wheat than against <Col N="856" /> any other crop, not for a few years, but for at least half a century.  That is a fact, and it must be admitted.  I go this far, and I say that that establishes a prima facie case that wheat-growing pays&mdash;not every farmer, not any farmer, but the average farmer, less than any other crop he could grow.  I say that prima facie conclusion is absolutely confirmed by an examination of the figures, which go to show that while there are something like 600,000 acres of oats, 300,000 acres of potatoes, 200,000 acres, odd, of mangolds and turnips, there are only 30,000 acres of wheat.  These are roughly the figures.  If you accept those admitted facts, then I say it is absolutely clear that so far as the average farmer is concerned, wheat pays him less than any other crop.  If anybody in the Dáil disagrees with me, I would like him to examine that specific point and to show me where I am wrong.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the second point. Nobody contends that there is sufficient tillage in the country; there is not.  There should be, and there could be more tillage in the country. In fact, Deputy Ryan made the case, so far as he made any case, for increased tillage rather than for an increase in a particular crop like wheat.  I have never heard it denied that the farmer who is producing most, the farmer who is doing best for himself in this country, is the mixed farmer, who is doing considerably more tillage than the average farmer.  I have never heard that denied.  I would like to know whether it is now denied here that the farmer who is doing the best for himself, and for the country as a whole, is the mixed farmer, who is doing more tillage than the average farmer of the country.  It is quite certain, and statistics prove it.  The conditions under which that farmer works are exactly the same as those under which 75 to 80 per cent. of the farmers of the country work, and 75 to 80 per cent. of the farmers of this country are small farmers, and practically all their work is done by the family labour.  It is the minority <Col N="857" /> of farmers who are doing the mixed farming, and who are doing more tillage than the average farmer.  In this respect of acreage they resemble exactly the majority of the farmers who are not doing as much tillage and not producing as much, nor making as much money for themselves or the country as the minority, who go in for more tillage, are making.</P>
    <P>If these are the facts, surely the business of statesmanship and agricultural policy should be directed towards either compelling or inducing that large body of farmers that I have mentioned to do as much for themselves and as much for the country as the minority of the mixed farmers are doing.  If Deputies are with me up to that point, I submit that one clear deduction can be drawn from these facts, and it is this&mdash;that there is no case&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;for subsidising wheat as compared with a subsidy for tillage as a whole or for any other crop.  I suggest, too, that Deputies who are in favour of a subsidy for tillage have first to show reason why they picked out wheat rather than any other crop, if in fact wheat pays less than any other crop.  If wheat pays less than any other crop, it will take a larger subsidy to get a given increased area than it would take to get a given increased area of any other crop.  That is obvious.  I, personally, do not think that subsidies are desirable.  I will give my reasons for that.  I think that they are a wasteful and inefficient method of encouraging increased production, and for this reason&mdash;that all the subsidies are mainly paid by the farmers themselves. In the particular case of wheat, the subsidy would be, to a very great extent, paid by the poorer farmers to the farmers with the best land.  I say that because, regardless of what agricultural experts in the Dáil say, wheat will be grown to a greater extent on good land than on bad land, and it will not in fact be grown to any extent in the Gaeltacht, in places like Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry, in <Col N="858" /> the Gaeltacht generally, the poorer parts of the country.</P>
    <P>My next reason is that subsidies, to a great extent, so far as we have any experience of them, bring about, not increased tillage, but the substitution of one crop for another.  We pay £24 an acre roughly of a subsidy to the best growers.  To a great extent that has brought about substitution.</P>
    <P>I hold that a subsidy of £2 or £3 an acre for wheat&mdash;an absolutely negligible subsidy as compared with what we are paying for sugar-beet growing&mdash;in so far as it would bring about wheat growing at all, would be almost entirely substitution.  It would only attract the farmer with suitable land, with a tillage tradition and who has land already under grain.  For those reasons I am personally against subsidies as a method of increasing tillage.  I am against them first for the reason that the farmers themselves would pay the larger part of the subsidy, and in that respect it would be merely taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another; and I am against them secondly for the reason that subsidies would bring about substitution.  I may finally add that the whole thing would be very costly to administer and the taxpayers of the country as a whole would be affected thereby.</P>
    <P>If there are people who think that subsidies are the best way to attain increased tillage, then it is up to them to show why the subsidy should be given and why the crop which undoubtedly pays the farmer of the country least should be selected.  If they do not agree with the contention that it does pay the average farmer least, then I ask them to examine specifically the reasons that I have given to show that it does pay the average farmer least.  I may be told, though it is not an answer, that we should encourage wheat growing because, in fact, we send about £7,000,000 out of the country for wheat.  That point of view, simply stated like that, practically means nothing.  So far as it means anything it means that we should <Col N="859" /> encourage wheat growing in order to lessen our imports.  Lessening imports as such is no advantage.  You could lessen imports and at the same time lessen production.  If you examined the statistics of imports and if you had equally available the statistics of production, and if you found both were going down, that would be a clear indication of bankruptcy. If you want to state the position properly, do not state it in terms of lessening imports, but rather in terms of increasing production.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the imports into this country increasing.  If we produce more I am firmly convinced there is no reason why economic laws which operate in every other country in the world should not operate here.  The universal experience is that the more production there is, the more imports and exports you have.  Denmark has been quoted by Deputy Ryan and, now that we are speaking generally, the particular phenomena which appear in Denmark are relevant.  In Denmark they produce more than we do, but they import and export more than we do.  The same applies to every other country in the world.  It is no advantage to lessen imports as such.  What is of advantage is to increase production, and that is what is wanted.  There is ample room, as I have pointed out, and it must be admitted, if people admit my previous contention, that the majority of mixed farmers should be induced or compelled to attain the standard of those who have more oats, barley, mangolds and turnips.</P>
    <P>If my contention is admitted, then there is plenty of room for an increase in oats.  There is actually a choice of crops.  There is room for an increase in oats and barley.  The people who are constantly advocating the theory that barley is as good as Indian meal can scarcely deny that.  There is room for an increase in mangolds, turnips, barley and oats and if these can be produced more economically, if the <Col N="860" /> farmer can produce them at a profit&mdash;as he must be able to do or he would not go on producing them&mdash;then if you want to increase tillage, why spend the small amount that is available in this country either through taxation or in any other way&mdash;because there is only a limited amount available over and above the amount legitimately required by the businessmen and farmers for their own needs&mdash;why spend that limited amount on trying to encourage a crop which, on all the evidence that we have had before us, is a crop that pays least and consequently will require the largest subsidy for any given increase in acreage?  If this debate is to come to anything, if we are to understand one another so as to disagree with one another, I would like these particular points dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no doubt, as the Minister said when he started answering Deputy Ryan, that he is tired of wheat.  I certainly think it would be a great job for the country if the Minister went to bed for a while, because he is not alone tired of wheat but he seems to be tired of the whole economic situation in this country.  We heard him on the last night and we heard him again to-night and what has he offered to the country to cure it of the economic evils from which it is suffering?  He talked a lot about the difference between cutting out imports and increasing production.  He talked altogether away from the vital factors that entered into this discussion.  He left out of the question the big number of unemployed that exist here and also the large amount of land that is unemployed. The Minister may throw up his head, but we have to examine this proposal for the growing of wheat in the light of the situation in which we find ourselves. The fact of the matter is that in this country we are faced with the position of the farmer who has 100 acres of land and four sons.  The whole family is in a bad way and half of the land is idle.  Bread and foodstuffs have to be purchased when, under proper conditions, the <Col N="861" /> land should be made produce all that would be required in the home.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said about increasing production. We want to increase production, but what are we going to concentrate on?  Are we going to increase the production of cattle and dump more cattle into the one market that we have for them and so further reduce the prices which we are obtaining there for our stock? The Minister says that he is weary and tired.  He has done something to benefit agriculture during the last seven or eight years; he brought in a Dairy Produce Act and he has tried to do what he could to abolish scrub bulls, all of which things are a benefit to the community as a whole.  If he would apply to the wheat and tillage situation the principles upon which he went when he was introducing that legislation he would, I am sure, find himself driven to support Deputy Ryan's motion.</P>
      <P>Eighteen months ago the Minister said that our present system of farming was the result of five hundred years of accumulated wisdom by the Irish farmers.  We all know, and the Minister knows, that our present system of farming, our whole economic situation, is not the result of five hundred years accumulated wisdom but is the result of five hundred years of British rule&mdash;British rule in the interests of Britishers and of British shipping companies and not in the interests of the Irish farmers or the Irish people.  No matter what problem we have to examine here we must examine it with the full knowledge that the system under which we are operating is not one that was developed by Irishmen in the interests of Irishmen, but one that was developed by England in the interests of her own people.  The fact of the matter is that we are sending on an average £6,500,000 to foreign peoples for produce which we could produce here.  At the same time our land is idle and large numbers of our people are idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We maintain that the best thing to do in the interests of the country is to give our people employment on <Col N="862" /> the land that is idle, and to get them to produce what we require.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, we are tilling only 12½ per cent. of our arable land, while Denmark is tilling 65 per cent.  If we tilled only an additional ten per cent. we would be producing all that we required, and if we increased our production our overhead charges would not fall so heavily upon us.  At the present time the rates, the rents and the taxes are crushing very heavily upon the people as a whole, all because their production is so very small. We have an enormous burden of about £24,000,000 in taxes, another £3,000,000 or so in land annuities, and another couple of millions in rates, all falling upon the agricultural population that has only 12½ per cent. of its land under food production. I do not hold any brief for the farmers who are not producing all that they could, but we have got to realise that it has been only within the last twenty or thirty years that the real science of farming has been taken up throughout the world, and that scientists have gone into agriculture with a view to benefiting it and putting it on a firmer basis.</P>
    <P>We have got to do things for the farmers that they will not do for themselves, that is the long and short of it, and the Minister has done things for the farmers that they would not do for themselves. Although it was quite apparent to intelligent farmers that the scrub bulls were ruining our stock, as a whole, they did not combine to eliminate them.  It was only when legislation was passed that the scrub bulls were eliminated, and it was only when legislation was passed to eliminate dirty eggs and inferior butter that the farmers accepted the fact and started to produce cleaner eggs and better butter.  We have got to bring in legislation which will encourage the farmers to grow more wheat, to grow all that the country requires, and if the compulsion is to take the form of increased taxation on some of the farmers we cannot help that.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much whether in the long run, over a period of years, Deputy <Col N="863" /> Ryan's scheme would add anything to the general cost of taxation. The Minister himself cannot be very sure, because on the last night, referring to Deputy Ryan's statement, he said: &ldquo;Irish wheat fetched 30/- a barrel for some years, but the area remained about 30,000 areas.&rdquo; Where on earth did the Minister get that figure of 30/- a barrel?  He certainly did not get it out of the publications of his own Department, because they say that in 1927 wheat fetched, on an average, 28/1½ per barrel, or 11/3 per cwt., and that in 1928 it fetched 9/6 per cwt., or 24/9½ per barrel.  This year it is very well known that the average will be around 25/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average for 1925, 1926 and 1927 was 30/-.  That was the evidence given before the Economic Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the 1925 and 1926 figures here.  But I believe that if the farmers were assured of a price they would grow more wheat.  There are many farmers who say that 26/- a barrel would pay them better than barley at 16/- a barrel, and it is well known that the most progressive farmers throughout the country are growing a good deal of wheat for their own consumption; they are feeding it to their own cattle, pigs and fowl, and if they got a little encouragement, if they were guaranteed a price for three years in advance, they would be encouraged to put more land under the plough, and they would have the inferior wheat for feeding their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have certainly done nothing for the encouragement of wheat.  The Louth Committee of Agriculture this year proposed to spend £50 to encourage the growing of wheat in that county by giving free seed to farmers of under £30 valuation.  As in the case of most other counties, most of the farmers who grew wheat there have gone out of it, but the Minister's Department refused to allow the Louth <Col N="864" /> County Committee of Agriculture to spend that £50.  The most they would allow them to spend was £10, and another interesting fact is that in the same week in which they refused to allow more than £10 to be spent in the encouragement of wheat-growing, they allowed £7 10s. to be spent in prizes for a ploughing match.  I think that anybody but a tired Minister would know that the farmers are more in need of being taught how to grow wheat than of being taought how to plough.  There was £7 10s. spent in prizes in one little village&mdash;Dromiskin&mdash;and they were allowed to spend only £10 for the whole county for the encouragement of wheat-growing.</P>
    <P>When the Minister rose to speak the other night it was quite apparent that he had not troubled to listen to Deputy Ryan, or if he had listened to him, that he was too tired to take in what he said.  He said that he gathered from Deputy Ryan's speech that wheat is the least exhausting of all crops.  I did not hear Deputy Ryan say that, and I do not know whether anybody else in the Dáil did.  I have read his speech, and unless the reporters are incorrect, he did not say that.  The Minister said, secondly, that Deputy Ryan had stated that wheat cleans the gound more than any other crop. I did not hear Deputy Ryan say that.  Another allegation by the Minister was that Deputy Ryan said that it is an ideal nurse crop for grass.  I did not hear him say that either, and another, that the ideal way to sow wheat is after oats or barley, that wheat suits a wider variety of soil than any other crop. Deputy Ryan contradicted him immediately, and if the Minister could support these statements he should have come back to-night, after several days in which to prepare his speech, to drive home these allegations. They were contradicted by Deputy Ryan there and then, and I challenge the Minister to support these statements on anything that Deputy Ryan said.  The Minister said:  &ldquo;I say that wheat impoverishes <Col N="865" /> the land more, and requires a choicer soil than any other crop.&rdquo;  Of course, wheat impoverishes land.  So does oats, so does barley, so do potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless we allow the 1,200,000 acres that we till at present to go back into grass, we will have to impoverish the land to the extent of growing the crops we require. After all, the land of this country has stood for thousands of years, and although impoverished by growing crops of wheat it still produces it, and, with modern methods of farming, we can put back into the land what wheat takes out of it. On the comparative price of oats, barley and wheat for a number of years recently, it is believed by most farmers that out of the profit from wheat, even at the prices we <Col N="866" /> are getting, it would more than pay them to put back with artificial or farmyard manure what it takes out of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that is the reason they do not grow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers in this country do not grow wheat because they have no security in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you said they were paid more for it.  They have no security in any crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no security in any crop.  Certainly if the Minister remains in office much longer they will not have any security for any crop.  Farmers got a certain amount of security for one crop recently, the oat crop, owing to the imposition of a tax of 2/6 per cwt. on oatmeal.  The result is that the production of oats has gone up.  If farmers got a little security for the wheat crop, the acreage would increase, and we would be retaining in this country a large proportion of the £6,500,000 that is now sent out to foreign farmers.  That is our object.  When we come to examine the economic situation of this country, we should concentrate on putting more land under the plough and giving employment to the people we are sending out of it.  There was a most alarming statement in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; the other day. Obviously, it had reference to the speeches that some Fianna Fáil Deputies made about emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; went to the trouble of interviewing the American Consul here to find out how many people were going out of the country and it found that fewer people had obtained visas up to June of this year than in the corresponding period of 1928.  Further down, the interview showed that, apart from the 20,000 people who had been granted visas, 4,053 people had been refused visas because, as the American Consul said, a lower type of person had been coming up lately.  The result of the policy of the Government, and of a half-million acres going under grass, has <Col N="867" /> been that we are sending the best of our people, the young men and the young women, away.  At present, there are not enough left here to fill the American quota.  If we go on like this for another twenty years, we will have done what the British failed to do&mdash;what the British deliberately set out to do&mdash; that is to reduce this country to a grass ranch, so that the least possible number of people will be able to obtain a living in it.  The reason the British wanted the least number of people living here was to secure that there would be no military endeavour to free the country.  If we allow present conditions to continue, there will certainly be no one left in the country but old people, and who will take care of them?</P>
    <P>I was reading an English paper recently and there is another aspect discussed in an article in that paper of which we should take cognisance.  An English gentleman was discussing the wheat problem and the problem of agriculture in England.  He said: &ldquo;Unless something is done for agriculture, we shall soon be dependent entirely on overseas wheat for our bread.  That is where a grave national danger might arise through hostile action by enemy submarines and air-craft.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What paper was it? Was it the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; by any chance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo; I might get something in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; that would be useful too.  This is what this gentleman says: &ldquo;That is where a grave national danger might arise through hostile action by enemy submarines and air-craft.  We must always bear in mind that there is never more than six weeks' supply of bread stuffs in this country.&rdquo;  We are dependent at present on British shipping companies to keep our people alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not so far as wheat is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="868" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the wheat that comes into this country comes in British ships.  Supposing a war arose between England and another country&mdash;and England is hardly ever at peace&mdash;we would be dependent on the bounty of the British for bread, but the British themselves have only six weeks' supply of bread stuffs, and certainly they are going to feed their own people first, as is natural to expect.  We would only get what is left over. From that point of view alone, it is of the utmost national importance that we should produce the wheat we require in this country.  The Minister made a note of the fact that I was quoting from an English newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>You asked what I was quoting from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to know if it was the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo;: that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was also interested to know the other day that Deputy Ryan was quoting from foreign agricultural experts regarding the wheat problem.  The fact of the matter is that if we do not do something we will soon have no data of our own to go on; we will be dependent altogether on foreign agriculture, because there will be no agriculture left here.  It is no wonder that Deputy Ryan has to quote from foreign agricultural experts, because the Minister is altogether opposed to the growing of wheat, and is giving practically no encouragement to his own experts to experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every other country in the world is devoting a lot of its time and attention to the production of its own foodstuffs and to the improvement of agricultural crops.  You had recently agricultural experts in Canada who produced wheat that ripened a fortnight earlier than anything they had.  It enabled them to go two hundred miles nearer the North Pole.  Without much attention <Col N="869" /> being given to it here, we have in seventy years increased the average amount of wheat per acre from something like 12 cwts. to 19 cwts. What could be done if there were a few thousand pounds spent in the development of proper seeds here for our country?  I hope that, even though the Cumann na nGaedheal Party may be compelled by the Whips to vote against Deputy Ryan's motion, they will make themselves active within the party in forcing the Government to adopt his motion afterwards or some similar scheme.  They can see as well as the ordinary person throughout the country that if we are to continue that adverse trade balance of £15,000,000 this country is very soon going to go bankrupt.  We had an adverse trade balance of £15,000,000 on an average during a few years past.  In one year it was £19,000,000, and at the same time we were importing almost £25,000,000 of foreign agricultural produce. Surely, on the face of it, there is need for something to be done. Surely, when you take into consideration that during that same period half a million acres went back into grass, there is a growing need apparent for doing something to keep the land from going back into grass, for keeping our people employed producing what we require in their native land, instead of sending them off to foreign countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothySheehy1927Cor" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy (West Cork) Mr. T. Sheehy (West Cork)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy (West Cork)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not get up to address the House or take up its time if the Deputy who has just sat down confined himself to the motion before the House.  He started with insulting the Minister for Agriculture by stating that he was asleep and remained asleep.  In answer to that taunt, I wish to say he is very much alive and the Saorstát is very glad that he is.  The Deputy took a dive into the ancient history of our country with regard to agriculture and farming.  I will ask him to go back in spirit to the time when Strongbow first landed in Ireland. <Col N="870" /> What brought him into the country? &mdash;dissension and disunion and with fourteen mail-clad warriors I am sorry to say he captured our country for the English king.  From that down to this the history of the farmers of Ireland has been a sad and miserable one.  I am not as extensive a farmer as the Deputy nor have I such an immense knowledge of farming, but I have a sad story in connection with it.  In the year 1805 my grandfather with nine children was evicted out of a small farm in Castlehaven in the County Cork.  There was no mercy for the farmers.  My father was then five years of age and when we were beginning to grow up as boys he told us that sad story of those times, when half-a-dozen Sheehy families, occupying an entire townland, were thrown on the roadside simply because the little naked children running about were a disgrace to the lords of the manor living near by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a policy that operated over the thirty-two counties as far as landlordism could go.  It was a sad history for the farmers and those who followed, but in 1879 the flag was raised, the flag of the land for the people, and then for the first time after a struggle of centuries we faced landlordism, and we never ceased until we wiped it off the face of this land.  I wish to ask the Deputies how could those brave farmers who struggled on from the centuries till their soil with any advantage? If they put a slate on their roof, their rent was raised.  How could they go on with a system of agriculture that would be of advantage to the country?  Thank God, times are changed; we are now a free and independent nation, and thank God that nation can produce a Minister for Agriculture who will show the way, in a practical and solid fashion, to the tenant farmers of the present day to increase their exchequers and pull down the adverse balance of the country.  I think with all due respect that in a debate of such vital consequence, where we are trying to work out what is best for the benefit of agriculture in our native land, <Col N="871" /> those little, petty strokes are too contemptible, and I sincerely hope that the remainder of the discussion on Dr. Ryan's motion will be on broad and practical lines, and that we will drop the trash of Deputy Aiken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture asked us whether we agreed that the object should be increased production.  We do agree with that, and he asked us if we agreed that the object was to increase tillage.  We do, and the purpose of our motion is to see that there will be increased tillage, and we think this is a most practical way of getting about it.  The Minister for Agriculture did not indicate himself how he proposed to get increased tillage and increased production. We have here in this motion a definite way in which it can be done.  There is coming into this country between wheat and wheat products on an average something like £6,674,000 a year.  Now the fact that we have here a market will give us an incentive to production.  We have a market there to supply the products that are coming here to the amount of £6,674,000 a year, and the Minister will find it very hard, I am sure, to show us where we have got a market to the same extent available for any other agricultural product. We regard the encouragement of wheat as the key to an increase of tillage.  We are interested in it because it fits in with the general programme which we think ought to be the economic programme of this country, that is, that we ought to set out to make ourselves as self-contained and as self-sufficing as possible in all the essentials.  Food is the primary essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What and flour are the chief articles of food, and here we have this big market for them open for us if we only go and take it.  The Minister for Agriculture asks us if there are to be subsidies for this crop, which, he says of all others, pays the farmers the least.  I am not sure that the <Col N="872" /> Minister for Agriculture has at all proved that it pays the farmer the least.  The figures which were given to the Economic Committee do not prove that it pays the farmer the least.  What we do know is that on account of the uncertainty of the market and the fact that you have this country flooded with foreign wheat&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that apply equally to the other crops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, to the same extent.  Take the case of oats. Dr. Ryan gave figures here on the last occasion and the Minister for Agriculture did not say that they were not in accordance with the information we got.  We have questioned these figures that were supplied to us, but, even taking them as a basis, an acre of wheat gives a profit to the farmer of £2 18s. 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me, I was on a different point.  Did I understand the Deputy to say that the reason the farmer does not grow wheat is because this country is flooded with foreign wheat?  This country could be flooded with foreign oats, but it is not, because the farmer finds that at the world price he can produce oats in competition with foreign oats, and the oats do not come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a question of that very soon, if the present policy of the Government is going to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is the same world question again.  As far as this question is concerned, suppose we grant that wheat is not as profitable a crop to the farmer it may be as profitable to the community, and that is exactly what our figures prove.  They prove, as regards the individual farmer, that he is affected by these other factors, the uncertainty of the market, and the conditions in the past&mdash;that is all. <Col N="873" /> But if it were a fact that this particular crop was not as profitable for the individual farmer as other crops, and that we proved that it was a more profitable crop for the community as a whole, that would be the very justification for the community giving a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  I made that point myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come along and examine the figures.  Take the figures as far as the community is concerned.  The figures given officially to the Economic Committee show that for beef the net profit per acre to the community is only £5 12s. 5d., whereas for wheat the value would be £7 3s. 5d.  That is a difference in value to the community between an acre of grass and an acre of wheat of £1 11s. 0d.  I think the Minister for Agriculture agrees that the number of extra acres we would have to grow would be something like 830,000 to supply all our needs. That shows you at once that substitution there would mean £1,286,500, and if the community as a whole profit to the extent of one and a quarter million pounds it would be good business for the community to distribute a quarter of a million to the individual farmer in order to produce the one and a quarter million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apply that now to potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but can you get a home market for potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you get an increase that will mean £1,600,000? In so far as you do we will help you in that scheme.  As a matter of fact, the growing of wheat would lead to the growing of potatoes also, because as we know potatoes and wheat go very well together.  The Minister for Agriculture has told us that if we increase our wheat crop we will have to increase our root crops, and potatoes might be a very suitable increase. Therefore, as far as this is concerned, there is no antagonism <Col N="874" /> whatever between our proposal to meet our requirements in wheat and any other proposals that may be made for the increase of tillage. Our case for giving a subsidy to wheat is that the community would be justified in doing so on economic grounds.  They would be justified in giving every penny of the resultant profits to the community by way of subsidy to the individual farmers, but, in fact, the amount of subsidy that we are asking and that would be sufficient on the basis we have taken&mdash;and I think it is a fairer basis than the basis the Minister for Agriculture has put up &mdash;in order to bring that profit to the community, a net value of one and a quarter millions, would be only a quarter of a million.  For every five pounds that the community would gain we would only have to give a pound to the farmer.  We think that would be good business apart from any other consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the increase you mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At present we have 30,000 acres.  The total number that would be required would be 860,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You think you would get an extra 800,000 for a pound an acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you all the figures in a moment.  They are worked out in the report.  The Minister for Agriculture knows just as well as we do that the subsidy is not based on the acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our subsidy is based on the amount of milling wheat that would be tendered for sale, therefore, in this particular case, if we do not get the production of wheat there will be no loss to the State, as it is only going to pay for goods received.  As I was about to say, look for a moment at the present economic position of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a comparison between the value of oats and wheat to the community. <Col N="875" /> He dealt with wheat and grass.  I would like him to deal with oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the relative figures for wheat and grass.  I did not work them out for oats and grass but I gave you the worth to the individual farmer per acre, and it is considerably less per acre than for wheat.  The profit to the individual farmer per acre of wheat was put down as £2 18s. 7d.; that is all costs paid, whereas for oats it was £1 16s. 6d.  That is considerably less.  We were interested in proving this case as far as wheat is concerned.  There is a difference of opinion as to whether land used for wheat production would be of more use to the community than land used for the production of beef or milk.  The Minister for Agriculture asked if the farmer was such a fool that if it was a more profitable way of employing his land to put it under wheat he would not employ it in that way.</P>
      <P>That is a sound argument and an argument that will have to be met, but I say that for our case that is not essential, though we do differ from him as far as the figures are concerned.  As a matter of fact, I saw recently where it was stated in England that 30/- per barrel would pay the farmer.  Every time I have met people since we were last here, who have grown wheat, I have put that question to them&mdash;whether they would or would not, under present conditions, grow wheat if they were guaranteed a fixed price of 30/- per barrel&mdash;and I have never yet met one who, if he got a fixed price of 30/- per barrel, would not revert to wheat.  Deputy Ryan, on the last day, gave the statement that was made to us in Wexford recently, that they would grow it for 25/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that is beside the question. What I want to have considered is this: what is our present economic position as a whole?  The position is this.  If you analyse our imports at present you will find that we are importing 60 per cent. manufactured <Col N="876" /> goods.  We are exporting only 40 per cent. manufactured goods. If we examine that fact, it indicates to us clearly that our whole economy is wrong.  When we import manufactured goods we pay for the cost of foreign labour.  When we export our own unmanufactured goods, the raw products of the soil, what we are doing is, we are making a present of the natural gifts of this country to the stranger. Every country tries, as far as possible, to retain its own natural resources&mdash;the things that spring up without labour&mdash;and if they have to export things they export the things on which the greatest amount of labour is spent, because it is the labour spent on them that gives them their exchange value.  Sixtynine per cent. of our imports are those things on which considerable labour has been spent abroad, and we are getting a very small proportion of the natural gifts, so to speak, of other countries.  We are, on the other hand, exporting goods on which there has been very little labour spent.  It is on the amount of labour that the exchange value is based.  Therefore, we are really making a present to the other people of these natural gifts.  As I say, every country tries as far as possible to keep for consumption at home all these natural gifts&mdash;the things that come directly without appreciable labour&mdash;and to give to the stranger the products on which they get value for the labour which they expend upon them.</P>
    <P>If we want to right our economy at all we must begin at that end, we must try to get in&mdash;if we have to get in anything at all for production &mdash;as far as possible the raw material for production, not the things that the stranger expends labour upon. We here are allowing to go partially to waste all the land that could be put into wheat for which we would have a home market&mdash;a market that could be relied upon&mdash;and instead of having it in wheat we are using it in a less profitable form, in grass. We want to change this kind of economy.  We believe that by becoming <Col N="877" /> self-supporting as far as food is concerned we are working in accordance with the best ideas of economy.  The Minister tells us that we need to increase production.  In what direction are we going to increase it?  We are showing one definite way in which we can do it, where there is a market that can be relied upon, where the conditions are not against us and where rings cannot control.  The Minister for Agriculture will tell us &ldquo;Let us increase butter and eggs and so on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It would be better put into butter and such products, because they require more labour for the finished product than beef.  Let the Minister look at the results.  We were discussing the marking of eggs to-day, and we saw what the results were.  Here is the position of some of our agricultural products in the British market&mdash;this world market in which we have to compete.  Take eggs.  In 1928 the average market price for Free State eggs in Great Britain&mdash;this is extracted from the British returns&mdash;was 12/6½ per 120.  The average market price of eggs from all countries was 13/6. That is, we are far lower for 1928, with all the work which the Minister has been doing in that direction that has been so much spoken of here. We are actually getting only 12/6½, whereas the average price for all countries was 13/6.  That does not show that we are going altogether in the right direction in dealing with foreign markets.  During the week ending 16th October the average price of first quality Free State eggs at the London Egg Exchange was 23/- per 120; of first-class English, 34/- and 35/-; Danish, 21/6 to 22/-; Dutch, 20/- to 23/-.  Then take butter.  On 17th October, on the London Provision Exchange, the highest prices for butter were:&mdash;Irish, 179/-; Danish, 200/-; Dutch, 196/-; New Zealand, 190/-; French, 184/-; Australian, 188/-; Argentine, 180/-.  Irish was the lowest of all these, lower than <Col N="878" /> the Argentine at 180/-, lower than the French at 184/-, than the Australian at 188/-, than the New Zealand at 190/- and the Danish at 200/-.</P>

      <P>These are statistics taken from the returns available. I have given the highest price for butter.  In the case of bacon it was substantially higher than that of any other country.  The prices for bacon in Great Britain were:&mdash;Free State, £4 19s. 5d.; Danish, £4 14s. 1d.; and the average price of all bacon imported, £4 9s. 4d.  It seems to me that the reason that the Irish bacon is able to hold its price&mdash;it may be its intrinsic value&mdash;is probably due to the fact that there is a limited supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the supply of Irish bacon in the market as a whole, it is comparatively small.  As I say, with us the position is this&mdash; that we believe that this question of the production of wheat is the key to the development of tillage in general.  The Minister for Agriculture on one occasion admitted that our whole policy in that particular respect stood or fell by wheat.  We believe it.  We believe that in this particular case wheat is the centre of the development of tillage in general, and is the centre of this whole policy of producing for ourselves the things that we can produce and have our own market for ourselves.  Let me give an example of what it would mean.  In some of the figures given to us, I think it was in the interim report of the Agricultural Commission in 1923 the labour involved in the cultivation of barley was set out at 85½ hours per acre.  Suppose we were to grow wheat, and put into cultivation the acreage required to grow wheat for our own needs, then, if <Col N="879" /> you go on the basis of a 50-hour week you would provide the equivalent of full-time employment for 27,000 persons.  I have shown that the net gain to agriculture for the community as a whole would be one-and-a-quarter million pounds&mdash; as a matter of fact, that is the minimum.  If we were to calculate the price at 30s. it would be much nearer to one-and-a-half millions. The Minister in fact has put no alternative forward.  He has been working for a number of years to increase tillage.  I wonder has he done it.  Statistics do not seem to indicate that.  He has been talking about stimulating production.  If you have a world market, it might well happen that if you increase your production your total return will not be increased.  As I say, the figures I have given in the case of butter and bacon, seem to indicate that if you go on increasing your supplies of butter and eggs you are not going to increase your price; you may have the opposite result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I showed, also, there was a more fundamental way of looking at it, and that was looking at the question of the whole nature of our economy. We hold that if we are to export&mdash; and we must export if we are to have the necessary imports&mdash;the goods we should try to export are finished products, as far as possible, and that it is ridiculous for us to import, as I pointed out some time ago, something like £23,000,000 under the head of food, drink and tobacco, and to export £21,000,000, if we are an agricultural country. Now, as to the objections that have been put up.  The first objection is to the amount of the subsidy.  In that report, to which I have referred, it has been calculated, on the average price that obtained over a number of years, that 30/- per barrel would be a price that, at present, would induce farmers to grow wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture says no.  He then tells us he will not predict.  Well, let us put it to the test.  We do not fix it definitely and say it should be 30/- per barrel.  What we say is there <Col N="880" /> should be a Board in control, which should examine the whole question as to what would be a fair price that would induce the farmers to grow wheat.  The Minister tells us, as I have said, that a subsidy would not be justified.  We have proved that it would be.  As I say, if the community is going to benefit by one-and-a-quarter million pounds, it is good business for the community to give one-fifth of that which is the sum we calculate by way of subsidy. It will not come on all at once, because we do not expect we are going to get in a year or two years the 830,000 extra acres of wheat. We know that time would have to be taken for that, and our proposition was proposition to cover about 50 per cent. of our requirements for a period of 10 years, I think.</P>
    <P>The Minister, although he does not want to predict, is predicting a number of things.  I believe that anybody who is not going to be convinced by the arguments put forward by us will only be convinced by putting it to the test.  The test will be whether the Board fixes prices that will induce the farmer to go into wheat-growing or not. The Minister says there are certain areas which will not be benefited. As a matter of fact, experts have stated that wheat is a crop that can be grown in practically every county in Ireland.  Though we know that Kerry and Clare are not the big wheat-growing counties at all, the best samples of wheat for our purpose&mdash;&ldquo;Red Stettin&rdquo;&mdash; came, according to the Department's Report, from those counties.  Therefore, it is possible to grow wheat in every county.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not hesitate to give a subsidy for beet growing, and the subsidy for beet was confined to a fewer number of counties than the subsidy we propose would be.  We hold that growing our own corn here, and giving the employment it would give, and being of general value to the community is just as important as beet, and if a subsidy is justified in the one case, a subsidy would be justified, at least, as much <Col N="881" /> in the other.  Therefore, it cannot be any question of principle that is in the Minister's mind about subsidies. That is the position as far as we are concerned.  Now the Minister for Agriculture talks as if this was some new proposition never mentioned in any other country.  I have here a few facts about what is done in other countries with respect to wheat.  In Bolivia there is a system of import duty under a law of 15th May, 1929&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but the fact that other countries all over the world think it worth while to protect in order to keep the home market for themselves is relevant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why we have taken the question of wheat.  We believe it is the first thing that should be dealt with.  As far as we are concerned, we believe that wheat is the key to the situation. If what we suggest is done, it will give direct employment to 27,000 people.  It can be proved that it is better for the community as a whole if wheat is dealt with first.  It will lead to a general increase in tillage, and it is the most suitable crop for protection, because of the fact that it is going to be a cash crop.  Wheat differs in this from some of the other crops: that it would be a cash crop.  To a certain extent, barley and oats are not so much cash crops, because they are generally used by the farmers themselves for feeding purposes.  I am now going to indicate what the position is in other countries in order that Deputies may have evidence that the question of protecting the home market in vital matters like food&mdash;in this case wheat&mdash;is in the minds of other people than ourselves, and is actually in operation in other countries. Surely, it should at least make us think when we find that being done.  If we are going to stand out in these matters we ought to have a very good reason for it, and ought to know the reason.  We contend that no reason has been put forward by the other side either in the Dáil or at the Economic Committee. In Bolivia a law was made in May, 1929, under which a system of import duties on wheat, gradually increasing for four years, was adopted.  After four years the importation of wheat, will be prohibited. The law there also provides <Col N="883" /> for yearly increases up to a fixed maximum of duties on flour.  There you have protection.  There is going to be final prohibition because the people in that country realise that it is to their interest to grow their own essential food articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the reason given for it by the Minister for Agriculture there, but that the money which was being spent abroad is now going to be spent in France.</P>
      <P>The Minister there has definitely given the reason for it: that it was going to give employment to Franchmen, whereas if they did not do that they would be paying for the employment of strangers.  In Germany, in July 1929, the duty on wheat was increased from 2/6 to 3/8½ per cwt., the duty on imports from countries enjoying most favoured nation treatment being increased to 3/2 per cwt.  In Italy, in June, 1929, the duty on wheat was raised from ? to 5/7½ per cwt., while the duty on flour was increased from 6/8½ to 8/2.  In Roumania, in June, 1929, the duty on wheat was raised from 9d. to 2/- per cwt.  In Norway, on August 9th, 1928, the State monopoly in grain and grain products which was in force there from 1917 to 1927 was restored.  Under the Act restoring the monopoly the State buys all Norwegian grain as well as any imports of grain and grain products necessary to cover the country's requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also anxious that we should have the home market protected as much as possible for oats and barley, but oats and barley do not lend themselves to the same treatment as wheat.  We are keeping them quite separate.  As far as Norway is concerned, the position there is that under the Act restoring the monopoly the State buys all Norwegian grain as well as the imports of grain and grain products necessary to cover the country's requirements.  That is to say, Norway has gone much wider than we propose in this particular case.  Grain and grain products in that country may not be exported without licence.  That is also a proposition which we should carefully examine&mdash;that of preserving the offals and the smaller grain that may not be suitable for milling, so that these would be available as feeding-stuffs for farmers.  In Norway they take care of that.  They say there that grain and grain products may not be exported without licence, except in the form of ships' stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also made there for expropriation by the State of all desirable commercial mills, compensation to be fixed by a valuation commission.  In other words, in Norway they are taking over the whole question of grain supplies in the country.  Control of the monopoly is vested in a director under the supervision of a council, while the selling prices are fixed for monthly periods.  They keep grain reserves approximately equal to one year's requirements on the basis of the smallest ration.  That would be a war time ration.  In Austria, on July 15th, 1928, a sliding scale of duties on grain and wheat was replaced by a duty on wheat fixed at four gold crowns per 100 kilograms.  The position of Switzerland and Norway is very interesting.  In Switzerland, following a referendum, a corn monopoly was established under the new system which came into force on 1st July, 1929.  The State is to <Col N="885" /> maintain a reserve of corn and to buy the home grown wheat at a guaranteed price in excess of world prices; to sell it to millers and to pay milling premiums to protect the national milling industry against foreign competition.</P>

      <P>The question I put to the Minister for Justice was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state what disciplinary action, if any, has been taken against two Guards stationed at Ardrahan Gárda Síochána Station and another Guard stationed for having, as is Síochána Station for having, as is alleged, assaulted on July 9th, 1929, Michael Sylver, of Rathbane, Ardrahan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in reply said: &ldquo;On the 11th July last it was reported to the local Inspector of the Gárda Síochána that Michael Sylver, of Rathbane, Ardrahan, had been medically treated for injuries which Sylver alleged were the result of an assault committed on him by certain Guards from Ardrahan and Kinvara Stations.  Disciplinary charges were in due course preferred against the Guards in question, but as Sylver refused to sign a statement embodying his allegations the charges of assault, which were denied by the Guards, were not substantiated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That answer might appear satisfactory if all the circumstances were not known.  I might at the outset state, so as, perhaps, to deprive the Minister of one of his usual answers, that I am not asserting that all the Guards are thugs, ruffians, or political partisans.  The bulk of them are not, but I do state <Col N="886" /> that it would be better to give the public confidence in the manner in which the Guards enforce the law. If when culprits are discovered they were punished it would be in the interests of the public and of the Guards.  There are reasons why this man Sylver was unwilling to sign a statement as required, and I shall deal with these reasons now.  I have here the affidavit sworn by Sylver which I shall read, and I have a letter from him which I shall also read, as well as a letter from the doctor who examined and treated him subsequent to the assault. The affidavit is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, Michael Sylver, of Rathbane, Ardrahan, in the County of Galway, farmer, aged 21 years and upwards, make oath and say: On the night of the 9th day of July, 1929, when returning from a circus at Ardrahan, about 12 o'clock, right at the end of the village I saw three men approach whom I recognised as Guard R.1 from Kinvara station and Guards R.2 and C. from Ardrahan station. When they were about three yards from me I said `Good-night, men.' They did not reply, but Guard R.1 stepped out in front of me and demanded my name, catching hold of my bicycle at the same time.  I replied `Sylver,' whereupon Guard R.1 commenced to use very dirty language and called me filthy names. He was apparently very much under the influence of drink.  He struck me on the left side of the head with his fist.  Then Guards R.2 and C. also struck me on the side and back of the head, and knocked me on the road.  Guard R.1 then lay on top of me and punched me on the head and face for at least five minutes.  He then went back to the others, who were standing about three or four yards away.  After talking to Guard R.2 and Guard C. for a minute or so, Guard R.1 came back to me and ordered me home.  I was in the act of getting up off the road when Guard R.1 again struck me with his fist between the shoulders when stooping for the bicycle.  Guard R. 1 made an attempt to kick me but the bicycle saved me.  I had to leave my cap on the road.  I suffered great <Col N="887" /> pain in the head and shoulders that night, and for days after.  My left eye was completely closed next morning and I had to get Dr. Gerard Coyne, of Ardrahan, to attend me.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sworn at Gort, within the County of Galway, this 29th day of July, 1929, before me, a Commissioner for Oaths in and for said County, and I know the defendant.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Edward M. Kennedy, Comm.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Michael Sylver.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reading this affidavit I have omitted the names of the Guards and substituted initials.  Now why did not Sylver sign the statement that the Minister refers to?  Light might be thrown on that by this letter which Sylver is also prepared to swear to on oath:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sending you on my affidavit and doctor's certificate in connection with the beating I got from the Guards on July 9th.  This Guard, R.2, was one of the two that beat Silk, of Ballindreene, on Easter Sunday evening at Labane.  R.2 admits that he beat Silk and is proud of it.  He held me up and searched me on the night of the 9th April last while coming from Ardrahan.  On that occasion he threatened me several times that he would knock me down on the road and kick me to make me obey the law.  About a week after the beating on July 9th I was arrested in connection with the Castle Taylor shooting.  While being detained in the Civic Guard barracks a Chief Superintendent and a Sergeant of the C.I.D. told me the beating I received on July 9th was good enough for me and that they were a long time waiting for me.  Both Guards have since been changed. The beating was reported by Dr. Coyne to the Minister for Justice, and he cannot deny it.  The outrage was condemned by the parish priest at both Masses on the following Sunday, 14th July.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The doctor's certificate is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I certify that I dressed and treated Mr. Michael Sylver for bruises and injuries to his body and eye.  The left eye was <Col N="888" /> severely bruised.  He was also in great pain.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(Signed) G.M. COYNE,</P>
    <P>Physician and M.O. to the Post Office, Gort, and to the Guards Gort, Ardrahan, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Doctor Coyne was in the medical service of the Free State Army, so he will not be accused of political prejudice.  I do not suppose if a cow kicked Sylver that the parish priest, who is not accused of Republicanism, would have denounced the outrage the following Sunday at both Masses.  It is a nice thing if the Guards are to kick a man to make him obey the law.  It is well if they are zealous in enforcing the law, but it is important to respect the rights of citizens, and respect of the rights of citizens is not inconsistent with the proper carrying out of their duties by the Guards in enforcing the law.  It might be significant also that on this particular night there was a friend of Sylver's at the circus.  Two Guards went to him and asked him if he had a light on his bicycle, and advised him to be sure to have it lighted up, and to be very careful when going home.  I wonder why the Guards were changed immediately after the occurrence?</P>
    <P>I believe that two or three days after the occurrence the local Inspector and some Guards and two members of the C.I.D. from Ballinasloe went to Sylver's house.  They searched the house, and were very impudent.  They did not use very nice language when speaking to Sylver's sister, and generally they behaved objectionably. They asked impertinent questions, and behaved in a manner not befitting the force.  They asked Sylver to attend an inquiry, and his reply was: &ldquo;My experience of your actions elsewhere, and your actions here to-night, lead me to believe that I would get very little justice at that inquiry, and I will not attend it.  I will raise the matter elsewhere.&rdquo; He has sent me the affidavit, a doctor's certificate, and a letter regarding the occurrence, <Col N="889" /> and I have raised the question here. I know that subsequently a C.I.D. man from Ballinasloe interfered with Sylver in a manner likely to prevent him from earning his living as an insurance agent, a business which he carries on part-time.  I ask the Minister to see that in such cases proper inquiry is made so that those few of the Guards, and they are a small minority, who have no respect for the law, will be taught to respect the law, that it will be impressed them that it is much more important to respect the liberty of the people than to enforce the law, and that the two are by no means incompatible.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Fahy's references, and to show that the Guards were not &ldquo;stravaging.&rdquo;  I would like to cite an instance in proof of it.  This young man some time ago got an appointment as an insurance agent for the Munster and Leinster Insurance Society. He was appointed by the Chief Agency Inspector when he was down in Galway.  I have reason to know that he got the appointment because I myself hold a position in the society.  I was in the area with this man.  Some time afterwards in the discharge of his duty he accompanied me on a tour of the county, and we went to Ballinasloe in the course of our duty.  After leaving Ballinasloe we came home towards his place through Loughrea.  Some three or four hundred yards outside Loughrea the car was held up.  We were questioned by a member of the C.I.D. and a Civic Guard who was with him.  The car was searched, and we were asked if we had any guns.  We proceeded to Loughrea after the search, and two C.I.D. men arrived in the main street in a car from Ballinasloe immediately afterwards. In the course of conversation with the Superintendent, who was down from Athlone, my name was drawn into question as the owner of the car.  I went to the C.I.D. man and asked him if he was discussing me.  In answer to my query he said that for some time past <Col N="890" /> I was driving a man around who was a danger to the public in the county. I will not quote here the answer I gave him.  It seems to me extraordinary that a man was driving around another who was a danger to the county, and that he was not under lock and key if he was a danger.  I asked him who was the man in question, but he refused to tell me.</P>
      <P>After some time, however, he told me that the man was Mick Sylver, of Ardrahan.  He said that I was also driving another big fellow from Dublin.  That happened to be the inspector of the society, and, I suppose, because he kept company with such a notorious man as Sylver, he was tarred with the same brush.  I would like to know from the Minister whether it is the policy of the C.I.D. to hound a man in such a way that he cannot honestly earn his living. It appeared to me, from the way in which the C.I.D. acted in connection with this young man, that they wanted to get him thrown out of his position and to deny him an opportunity of earning his living.  If those are the tactics to be adopted by the C.I.D., the public should know it so that it would clear the air, and if the C.I.D. have got these instructions, we would like to know if that is the Minister's policy.</P>

      <P>Let us keep to Deputy Fahy's question.  He asked me why proceedings were not taken against the Guards for having assaulted Sylver.  What does Deputy Fahy want?  Let us consider what his request is.  It is not that there is to be an inquiry.  Seemingly, he does not want an inquiry.  An inquiry.  I take it, is an inquiry in <Col N="891" /> which a man will give evidence upon oath, and at which he will be subject to cross-examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is of the very essence of an inquiry. Charges are formulated and brought against the Guards.  The matter is then investigated to see if there is any foundation for the charges.  The Guards go to Sylver and request him to make a signed statement upon which they can act, but he refuses to give any evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish that the Deputy would allow me to speak.  I have already said that an inquiry was to be held.  Certain charges, charges of assaulting Sylver, and other charges of being away from barracks during the night, were formulated against these three Guards.  Sylver refused to come forward and give evidence. As it would not be just to anybody to condemn a man unless his accuser comes into the open, goes to the inquiry and subjects himself to cross-examination, the charge of assault against the Guards broke down.  On the other charge of being away from barracks the Guards were duly dealt with in the ordinary disciplinary manner, and each Guard was fined a sum of £5, and warned for dismissal.  So far as the charge of assault is concerned, to say that the Guards are to be condemned on the affidavit of a man who will not come forward to give evidence, is to me ridiculous and absurd.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state how far progress has been made by the Commissioners of Public Works in regard to making the preliminary arrangements for starting work on the River Erkina drainage scheme, Leix, following the report of their inspector who held the recent inquiry into the &ldquo;objections&rdquo; against the scheme; and whether he will take the necessary steps to expedite this matter, particularly in view of the large and increasing number of unemployed persons in that area, who are anxious to secure work under this scheme, and many of whom will otherwise have to receive relief.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have under consideration their investigator's report on the public inquiry in respect of objections to the Erkina River drainage scheme, but no definite decision has yet been arrived at as to whether the scheme should proceed. In any event, actual drainage works would not be begun until about the end of next spring, since, owing to their nature, such works could not be economically undertaken during the winter months.</P>
