      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can now state what steps he has taken towards repaying those subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan, 1919-20, in County Roscommon, whose names are not on the primary register; if he will further state whether he has received the original list of subscribers in the Ballinlough district from Mr. William Judge, Clooncrin, Ballinlough, County Roscommon; and whether he is prepared to accept that list as authentic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>All persons in County Roscommon who are stated to have collected subscription towards the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan have been requested by my Department to furnish any records of such subscriptions held by them.  The information received as a result of this request is being examined, and it is hoped that it will be possible at an early date to authorise repayment to subscribers in certain areas.  A list described as the original list of subscribers in the Ballinlough district has been received from Mr. William Judge, of Clooncrin.  The list represents subscriptions amounting to £224.  Particulars of only £48 10s. of this amount were furnished during the period in which the primary register was compiled, and there is at present no evidence to show that the balance was ever remitted <Col N="588" /> to the Dáil Finance Department. Investigations are still being made in the matter, and until these are concluded I cannot state when repayment will be authorised in respect of the subscriptions shown on the list in question.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any idea as to when he will be in a position to say when these nonregistered subscribers will be dealt with?  I think it was last May I raised a similar question, and I got the impression then that the work would be undertaken immediately. That is six months ago, and the people are wondering what is going to happen.  I believe there are between three thousand and four thousand pounds outstanding in Roscommon. It is really a serious matter for people like Mr. Judge and others who collected money at the time, as they are being looked upon with suspicion by the neighbours when they do not see the money coming back.  The Minister's answer showing that only particulars of £48 were furnished out of £224 is going to put people like Mr. Judge in a difficult position.  I think the Minister should expedite it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the scope of the Government Contracts Committee, and what is the basis of differentiation between contracts to be settled by the Committee and contracts to be settled by individual Departments; whether any instruction has been given to the Committee to include the &ldquo;Fair Wages Clause&rdquo; in all contracts, and whether this Clause is so included; and whether statutory corporations such as the Electricity Supply Board <Col N="589" /> and the Agricultural Credit Corporation are regarded as bound by the obligation to include a Fair Wages Clause in all contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Contracts Committee directs and controls the placing of contracts by the various Departments of State (save those placed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health in connection with combined purchasing for local authorities) and each purchasing or selling Department works according to a regular plan which is approved by the Committee. No contract of a greater value than £1,000 may be placed without the written approval of the Committee.  Contracts for a lesser amount are referred to it for decision if a question of principle or a new departure is involved.  In regard to the query about the Fair Wages Clause, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Anthony on the 27th April, 1928. Statutory corporations such as those referred to in the latter part of the question are not Government Departments and the jurisdiction of the Government Contracts Committee does not, therefore, extend to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some dissatisfaction of the nature indicated has been expressed, but it is not of a general character or greater in degree than that which normally arises elsewhere following an allocation of grants.  A copy of the resolution referred to was received. I informed the County Council on the 14th October, 1929, that following previous representations this matter had already received careful inquiry and consideration and had on various occasions been discussed in my Department with local representatives from County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>

      <P>If a limited amount of money is to be distributed over a certain number of local bodies it will come to an end at some particular time and no inquiry in the world will stop the dissatisfaction that will exist in each of the different bodies if they do not get more.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bank of Ireland Bill, 1929, be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment on the paper in the name of Deputy Coburn I would like to put a point as to whether the amendment is in order, on the ground that it would impose a charge, and, if so, whether <Col N="594" /> a private Deputy can propose such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter very careful consideration and I have come to the conclusion that the amendment in the name of Deputy Coburn would, in fact, impose a charge.  That being so, it could not, I think, be moved by Deputy Coburn.  That decision, of course, is altogether outside of any other question as to whether the amendment is in fact relevant to the Bill.  It does impose a tax, and it cannot, therefore, be moved by any Deputy other than a member of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand then that it is out of order as far as a private Deputy is concerned to move this amendment?  The Bill seeks to give certain powers to the Bank of Ireland and also to put them in the same position as other joint stock banks and companies.  It seems that other banks have to pay an <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty on any increased capital, and surely it should be the business of the State to see to it that the revenue is safeguarded and that if the Bank of Ireland increases its capital in the near future this duty is imposed upon the amount of the increased capital.  It is a matter of indifference to me whether it is moved by a private Deputy or by the Minister responsible for safeguarding the finances and the revenue of the country as long as it is done.  If other banks have to pay this stamp duty I do not see why the Bank of Ireland should not do the same.  It seeks to be given the same status as the other banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the question for the Chair is merely that the Deputy has put down an amendment that it is not in order for him to move, and the Chair can go no further than to rule upon that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bank of Ireland have no special exemption from the stamp duty in question.  This stamp duty is chargeable on companies which have a limited liability.  Any corporation or company with unlimited liability is not chargeable, and the Bank of Ireland is merely freed from this particular stamp duty because it is a company which has not a limited liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that this has been ruled out of order on the ground that it would constitute a charge upon the State, as distinct from a charge upon the bank and the shareholders&mdash;that in the carrying out of this operation some charge would fall upon the State?  Is it the point that no member of this House except a member of the Executive Council has power to move any increase in the burden on an individual or a corporation as distinct from the State?  As I understood it, we were inhibited from moving an increase of burden on the State, but I certainly did not understand until new that we were inhibited from moving an increase of burden on an individual or corporation.  I want to know if that is the meaning of the ruling&mdash; that we are in future to understand that we cannot as private Deputies move any increase of charge on any individual or corporation, and that it can be done only by a member of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this amendment is in the nature of the imposition of a tax, and to that extent it is out of order.  A private Deputy cannot move for an increase of taxation or for the putting of an increased burden upon State funds.  This is an example of an increase of taxation, and an increase of taxation can only be moved by a member of the Executive Council. The question is, therefore, that the Bill be received for final consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was last before the House we indicated that in certain respects the specific <Col N="596" /> objections which we had to the Bill, apart altogether from the manner of its presentation, had been met by certain amendments which had been made in the Bill in Committee, and that our opposition to the Bill was no longer grounded upon those particular matters.  Before going on to state the ground of our larger objection I think there is a point which should be brought before the notice of the Dáil in connection with this institution and that is the fact that this public banking institution, the greatest in this country, has I think on loan the sum of £2,769,000 to the Government&mdash;I presume one must describe it in the Dáil as the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, at 2½ per cent.  Now I submit that that loan was made in the first instance in return for certain privileges which it was within the power of that Government at the date upon which the loan was made to confer upon the bank.  The power of the original borrower to confer and maintain the particular privileges of the bank no longer exists.  There, therefore, is, in our opinion, no longer any justification for a financial institution in this country advancing money to another Government at the rate of interest I have stated when our own Government, if it goes to the same institution to borrow the same amount of money, would probably be charged not less than 5 or 5½ per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact to which I am drawing the attention of the House was the fact which was elucidated in the Committee Stage of the Bill and of which possibly the House generally is not aware.  Notwithstanding that our objection still remains I am going to ask those members of the House who are prepared to vote for the passage of this Bill to say that the anomaly to which I referred no longer can be permitted to exist.</P>

      <P>The members of the House cannot say that at this stage of the Bill.  The Deputy is raising a particular question which does not seem to have any connection with anything in the Bill.  We are now dealing with the Report Stage; that is to say, we are dealing with the Bill as it has returned from Committee, and there does not appear to be anything in the Bill as it has returned from Committee on which the Deputy can, so to speak, hang this particular argument. Nothing has been offered for the decision of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not happen to have them in my hand at the moment, but I think, if my memory serves me properly, that you mentioned that to me at an earlier stage when we wanted to discuss the Bill, because there was a time when we asked you on what stage we could discuss the Bill.  It was at that time you told us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the circumstances.  The procedure on Private Bills, as has been explained before, is that a Private Bill is introduced into the Seanad and there gets a Second Reading.  From the Seanad there comes to this House a motion asking the Dáil to concur in the appointment of a Joint Committee for the consideration of the Bill.  When the Dáil is considering whether it will or will not agree to the setting up of a Joint Committee on the Bill the principle of the Bill is before the Dáil.  That is, in fact, in the Standing Orders in these or similar words.  It has been explained on more than one occasion from the Chair.  In connection with this particular <Col N="598" /> Bill, the Deputy and I think the Leader of the Opposition himself consulted me with regard to it and asked me at what stage of the Bill could they state a particular objection.  When it appeared to me that the objection was a radical objection, the advice I gave was that the motion for referring the Bill to a Joint Committee should be opposed. That was done.  It is at that stage that the principle of the Bill comes up; that is to say, when the House is asked to concur with the Seanad in the setting up of the Joint Committee for the consideration of the Bill, not at this stage.</P>

      <P>This is the only opportunity we have got of dealing with this question which was raised on the Committee Stage and on which evidence was given&mdash;the question with which Deputy MacEntee is dealing. Would it not be in order for Deputy MacEntee to review the discussion on that particular point and to suggest that the Committee possibly did not do its duty in failing to make a recommendation in that matter as they did on other matters that were of a similar kind?</P>

      <P>The real point is that on the Second Stage of a Bill it can be argued that the Bill does not contain certain provisions which Deputies would like to see in it.  On the Fourth Stage debate is restricted to the provisions in the Bill, and cannot extend to matters which Deputies would like to see in the Bill; and for this very simple reason, that it is then no longer possible to put anything into the Bill. Therefore, what the House is concerned with is the question whether the Bill; as it stands, should or should not be received for final consideration. The debate must proceed on that line.  That is the case both for private and public Bills.  In the Bill I find no reference to what Deputy MacEntee is raising, and <Col N="599" /> the House could not by vote now decide the question.</P>

      <P>Of course I accept your ruling in the matter and I am not going to refer again to this sum of money which is being advanced to the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but as I indicated at the outset our larger objection to this Bill still remains.  We are still opposed to piecemeal tampering with the present position of any bank in the Saorstát until a more searching investigation than has yet been carried out is made into the situation generally.  I think, if my memory serves me, that the Minister for Finance, when a motion to refer this Bill to a Joint Committee was last before the Dáil, said that he did not accept the report and the recommendations of the Banking Commission as being final and conclusive in this matter.  Neither do we.  We are confirmed in that attitude in rejecting the report because we believe that it has been based upon an entirely wrong principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds upon which that report was drafted are plainly stated <Col N="600" /> on page 3, paragraph 5 of the Final Report.  &ldquo;To put&rdquo; the Banking Commission state, &ldquo;our first and fundamental conclusion into plainer language, we may say that in our opinion whatever is done here should be done in such a way as to avoid for the present any serious breach with the currency, banking and trade system of Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, recent events have taught us what that connection with the British currency system means.  We have had an increase in the bank rate, an increase which has made the position of every producer, whether farmer or manufacturer, more difficult. It was not occasioned by any stringency of credit internally arising, or by any export of our capital resources beyond what has become the normal condition of this country, but is due entirely to the fact that our currency system is linked up with that of Great Britain.  In such a situation we in this country are like a rowing boat tied to a liner, in danger of being swamped&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy at the moment is endeavouring to tie a liner to a rowing boat.  I do not want to weary the House with a repetition of what happened on the 31st July.  The Deputy will remember it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had that fact in mind, and he knew&mdash;to use another maritime metaphor&mdash; that this argument was very likely to founder upon a point of order.  What I had to say in that regard can very well wait for another day.  I will content myself with saying that we on these benches feel that a further examination into the whole banking and financial system of this country should be made, and this time it should proceed, not upon the hypothesis that we should remain linked with the currency system and banking system of Great Britain, but that we ought to secure and maintain control of our own financial affairs.  It is quite obvious that at this stage I cannot state in detail our objections to the Bill.  I cannot pursue a considerable number of points which are <Col N="601" /> of great public interest, and which might very well be discussed at this, the last opportune occasion upon which they can be discussed here. But, having said what I have said, I would wish to say this: that there is one other ground of objection we have to the passing of this Bill, and that is the manner in which it has been driven through this House by the bloc vote of the Government Party and re-voted in the Committee. In that process the rights and legitimate wish of the chief Opposition Party in this House were ignored, and their chosen representatives were excluded from the Joint Committee appointed to consider the Bill in detail.  What that has meant to this discussion, what it has meant to the Bill, and what it has meant to the country is exemplified by what took place here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the minutes of evidence I see that counsel for the promoters referred to the point which I myself endeavoured to raise here, the fact that £2,769,000 of Irish money is being loaned at the present time to another Government at a rate of interest less than half of what our Government has to pay to the same lenders.  That fact was brought before the notice of this Committee, but beyond a very cursory examination of one of the witnesses who appeared in support of the Bill, no action was taken by this Committee. I say if this party had been represented, as it was its right to be represented, upon that Committee, by its chosen representatives, we would not have been precluded from discussing this matter here to-day.  The Committee would not have been permitted to deal with that important matter in the perfunctory way in which it was dealt with.  I believe if our representatives had been upon that Committee our Government, instead of to-day having to pay five per cent. upon its Exchequer bills, would be in a position to raise a loan of two and three-quarter million pounds at 2½ per cent.  That is how the partisan action of the Government in this matter has reacted upon the Dáil, upon the Exchequer and upon the country as a whole.  But it <Col N="602" /> has had very much more serious consequences. After all, possibly another Government may be able to secure this loan at this particularly favourable rate of interest.  But what happened when this Bill was before the Dáil has set the whole trend of future private Bill legislation in this House; it has created a precedent which, however unworthy of imitation, is likely to be invoked in the future, and from the point of view of the promoters of this Bill these facts have been most regrettable. This Bill, which was a matter of national concern, has come to be a purely party measure.  It has indicated that the affiliations between this large public banking corporation and the Government Party are closer than they ought to be, and are of a nature that other parties, particularly the chief Opposition Party, and the general public must view with alarm and distrust.  Whatever legislative decisions or arrangements have been arrived at in consequence of such relations, such decisions and such arrangements cannot endure and will not be permitted to endure.  This Bill has not been examined by a Committee truly representative of this House.  Instead it was sent to a packed Committee.</P>

It does not matter whether that legislation has been in the interests of individuals or of a corporation.  Legislation concocted and pushed through in this way will not be permitted to stand and if ever the opportunity is vouchsafed to this party to undo it we will, at any rate, reconsider the whole of this matter, and as an indication of our future attitude in regard to the Bill we propose to vote against it to-day.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this, but I think it is only fair&mdash;in view of the statements made by Deputy MacEntee&mdash;to the Committee that considered this Bill that I should refer to some of his statements.  I may say I was rather surprised that Deputy MacEntee should talk in such a loose and, if I might say so, rather wild way.  He talked about a packed Committee.  I do not know what the Deputy meant by a packed Committee.  The Committee was appointed in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>No. The Deputy's statement was that a precedent had been created.  That <Col N="604" /> is not so, but if the Committee had to take the course suggested to them by the Deputy's Party it would be creating a precedent.  The Committee appointed to consider the Bank of Ireland Bill was appointed in the very same way as every other Committee had been appointed, since the setting up of this State, to consider a Private Bill, and there was no departure from that.  The Deputy said this was a national matter and that it has been made a Party measure.  I submit that if it was made a Party measure the Deputy and his Party were responsible for making it a Party measure.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Fianna Fáil Party are not serious in their objections, and I must only come to the conclusion that it is all a bit of window-dressing, to use a phrase which is very often used here, and that Deputy MacEntee missed the tide.  He did not make his objection when it could have been made, and I am sorry that he and his Party did not give the Committee which was set up the benefit of the experience of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party nominated to act on the Committee by the Committee which had the right to nominate a Private Bill Committee. I must say that the Committee which examined the Bill went to a great deal of trouble and examined it in a very careful and detailed way, as a reading of the report would show.  I must say that the Bank of Ireland and their counsel <Col N="605" /> did all that any Committee could expect them to do, did all that they were asked to do in order to give the Committee any information which they required, and met them on all the points which the Committee put up to them.  The position to-day, as the Committee sees it, is this: that, as a result of the Committee's work, the Bank of Ireland is more of a national bank than it was before, and I would be sorry if this Bill were not passed.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, dated 22nd November, 1928, which has been printed and circulated be now considered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Report of the Committee of Public Accounts for the year 1926-27 was ordered to be printed about twelve months ago, and since that it has been awaiting consideration by the Dáil.  We have asked, like previous committees, for information from the Department of Finance with regard to the question of virement, and the Department of Finance satisfied our Committee that virement was advisable where an excess of a sub-head occurs in many cases.  We recognised the difficulty, and that it was impossible to have the matter decided either by a fixed amount or by a percentage, and we agree with the Department of Finance that discretion should be left to that particular Department.  As we point out here in this Report, however, we must disagree with the Ministry on one or two points.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Department of Finance pointed out to us that on some occasions when another Department required more money than had been voted under a particular sub-head, it would not be feasible to go before the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate, because there might be too much business before the Dáil.  We held that that is a question for the Dáil itself, and not for the Department of Finance, to decide.  As we state here the Dáil is quite competent to decide its own business, and to decide whether it is too busy or not to consider a Supplementary Estimate, and it is not the business of the Department of Finance to decide upon that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a few instances also of virement exercised in that particular year with which we disagree. For instance, the one taken as an outstanding example was the case of gratuities for retired officers from the Army.  The amount voted by the Dáil was £5,000.  The amount actually expended was £47,000 odd. The Department of Finance exercised virement in this case, and authorised the Department of Defence to transfer from their savings over £42,000 to this particular sub-head. That saving was made by the <Col N="609" /> Department of Defence ,on effective services, and the money was voted to pay for non-effective service&mdash; officers retiring.  That is a particular instance where we believe that virement should not have been exercised, because if the Dáil voted money for effective services, there is no reason for the Department of Finance to suppose that they would have voted more money for non-effective services.</P>
    <P>The money was not voted for an allied purpose, and on that account we object to the exercise of virement under that heading.  There were various other queries put to the Department of Finance to which we got, on the whole, satisfactory replies.  There is only one I would like to refer to in passing.  It is with regard to fishery loans.  &ldquo;The Committee hopes that there will be no undue delay in introducing the legislation contemplated in connection with these loans.&rdquo;  That is a paragraph that, I believe, appears from year to year in the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts, but so far it has been ignored.  There is another matter that arises year after year practically to which I would like to refer.  It is in regard to the factory that comes under the Post Office Vote.  Our Committee found, and I believe the same thing was found by previous committees, that if not extravagance at least mismanagement was responsible for the very high cost of the various works given to this particular factory.  A few instances brought out in the evidence before the Committee will illustrate this point.  The final cost of one particular contract worked out at £1.000 whereas the estimate on which the order was placed only amounted to £485.  In another case, the lowest outside tender for the job was £216 while the final factory cost was £333.  In another case, the price according to the rate-book supplied to the factory, was £96, while the final factory cost was £401.  These are some instances of jobs that were done in the Post Office factory to which our attention was called. Naturally some members of the Committee <Col N="610" /> were desirous of finding out why the factory was not closed down completely so as to effect a saving, or why at any rate those particular jobs were given to it.  We were told that the factory was necessary, and that it did some particular types of work cheaper than they could be done outside, and that in order to keep it on an economic level of working the more work that could be given to it the better.  It was maintained by the witness that the factory was going to be a paying unit.</P>
    <P>Another matter which came before us, and which I think is still awaiting a minute from the Minister for Finance, and also the Minister for Education, was the question of model schools.  It appears that in the model schools, and in certain national schools, there is authority to collect fees from the pupils.  Under the School Attendance Act of 1892 free education was given to the people of this country.  Authority to collect fees was permitted where the fees total more than 6/- per pupil.  Under the exception mentioned, some of the national schools of the country are permitted to collect fees from the pupils.  In the case of the national schools, the fees are collected by the manager and paid out to the teachers, but in the case of the model schools the fees are collected and handed over to the Department of Education, the Department afterwards paying out those fees on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to the teachers in the model schools. The point to which we took exception was that there was no appropriation of those amounts.  The Minister for Education, or his Department, kept, as it were, a private account of those moneys which did not come into the Appropriation Accounts at all, and handed them back again to the teachers.  We believe that is wrong. We think that any receipts that come into a Department like that should be treated as Exchequer receipts, and that any payments going out to the teachers in the model schools should be treated in the ordinary way as salaries or allowances, as the case may be.  There was also a small item in the Science and Art section under the Department of Education which <Col N="611" /> came before us.  It arose in connection with a payment made to the Cork School of Music.  A sum of something like £300 was paid, and for this a separate sub-head had to be opened by the Department.  This was sanctioned by the Department of Finance, but we hold that there was no authority for it, especially as it was treated as a grant-in-aid.  We hold there was no authority from the Department of Finance to do any such thing, and we recommend the disallowance of the payment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Gárda Síochána Vote, I believe that we have not as much to say as usual under this head.  We have, however, to report that there was still continuing at that date a considerable amount of unauthorised travelling in motor cars supplied to the Gárda Síochána force&mdash;that is unauthorised use of those motor cars for private journeys.  There was a system of checking the journeys on which the cars went as well as of the particular business that the officers had for each journey, but even so it appears that when the log book was checked over by the Comptroller and Auditor-General certain irregular journeys were detected and the particular officers concerned were asked to pay the damages.  Under this Department also there was a more serious case brought to our notice, that is where the Department of Justice claimed that certain sums of money should be paid into the Reward Fund which we hold was not justified.  The case arose where officers in the Guards were dismissed for misconduct.  The balance due for the particular month in which they were dismissed was paid into the Reward Fund.  We believe that is money that is really due to the Exchequer, that it should not go to the Reward Fund but that it should come back into the Exchequer.  We believe further that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not possibly be in a position to sanction the payment of that particular monthly cheque unless he was in a position to get a voucher from the person to whom the cheque was due, and that <Col N="612" /> person was a dismissed officer.  The Department of Finance in this case told us that they adopted a neutral attitude between the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Department of Justice, but we believe that they were not justified in adopting that neutral attitude because, as we state, &ldquo;it is alleged that the Exchequer balance is being diminished in an irregular manner, and, secondly, that claim is made that the statutory obligations of the Exchequer and Audit Department should be set aside in the interests of the Reward Fund.&rdquo;  We have asked to have this matter made right, and we hope the Department of Finance will adopt our view.</P>
    <P>In the Army Vote many matters arose&mdash;not perhaps as serious as in previous years, but still irregularities have come before us.  The Department of Defence, in three or four cases that came before us, acted without having the sanction of the Department of Finance, and in some cases where they did not act without that previous sanction they left very little time or discretion to the Department of Finance in the matter of giving or withholding their sanction. Even in cases where the Comptroller and Auditor-General drew the attention of the Department of Defence to this matter, that they had not obtained the previous sanction of the Department of Finance, we found that the Department of Defence even then was very reluctant to seek the sanction of the Department of Finance, even after the deed had been done.  We found, for instance, that in the case of a number of officers going to America for training certain allowances were given to them.  That was quite in order, but the Department of Defence allowed these officers to get allowances for uniforms at a date prior to the date mentioned in the Regulations which had the sanction of the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance.  The Department of Defence had not asked for the sanction of the Department of Finance to giving out these uniforms to the officers before the date specified.  One of the officers in <Col N="613" /> connection with this mission took his wife with him.  An advance was made by the Department of Defence of £45 to cover the travelling expenses of the officer's wife.  That was not authorised by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In another instance coming towards the end of the year the Department of Defence found that they had money on hands, and being reluctant to surrender it to the Exchequer they proposed to buy a number of motor cars.  They applied for leave to purchase these motor cars only on 28th March, 1927, four days before the end of the financial year.  In the ordinary way, the Department of Finance would have taken some time to examine and consider that application, and to decide whether the Department of Defence were justified or not in making such an application. In this particular case the sanction of the Department of Finance was given on 29th March, the following day, and the cars were purchased on 30th March.  If we are going to look at a matter of this sort in a businesslike way we must realise that they cannot possibly spend money to advantage in that manner, making up their minds to apply for sanction on 28th March, and then pressing, as they must have done, the Department of Finance to give their sanction straight away without any examination of their request.</P>
    <P>Another matter that occurred in connection with the Army was that some officer unknown asked certain firms in town to supply specimen mess uniforms.  These were supplied, but being supplied as specimens no officer was accountable for the uniforms, and afterwards it could not be ascertained which officer was responsible, and the account had eventually to be paid out of the Exchequer.  It amounted to £95 12s. The uniforms are still there, but they had to be paid for.  Minor questions also arose regarding officers who were not entitled to be mounted having their horses fed from Army rations.  That matter.  I believe, is being or has been made right.  Also with regard to the Officers' Hunting Club, officers incurred some expenses <Col N="614" /> which were not sanctioned.  They had a hut in the Curragh repaired and done up to suit their requirements without sanction having been obtained, and further they had some arrangement for Army transport which had no sanction from the Department of Finance.  The question that arose with regard to officers of the Civic Guards using motor-cars for private purposes also arose in the Army, but I think precautions are being taken to see that it does not occur again.</P>
    <P>The matter of warlike stores has arisen as on previous occasions, the estimates being much smaller than the actual amount spent.  We have asked that these estimates should conform somewhat better in future to the amount spent.  Under Army pensions two or three points arose, and perhaps the most important points that came before us for the year.  First is the point, which has been raised on previous occasions, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General felt he could not say that he had properly audited the accounts so long as the evidence on which the pension was granted was withheld from him.  This has been regularised, as we have requested, by a Bill which is coming before the Dáil.  As members of the Committee of Public Accounts I believe we have to be satisfied with that, but as members of the Dáil we have our own views of the Bill.  There was also a question of major and minor injuries.  It appears that if there is more than a 20 per cent. disability from a wound the applicant is entitled to a pension under the Army Pensions Act, but if there is less than 20 per cent. disability he is entitled to a gratuity only.  Where a person had, say, two minor injuries of 15 per cent. in each case the two 15's were added together to make 30, so as to make it a major disability, and in such a case a pension was granted.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General holds that that is not legal, that the Act does not permit it, and that all that should be granted in such a case is a gratuity for each minor injury, and that two minor injuries cannot be added together to <Col N="615" /> make a major injury.  We considered the arguments put up for and against this, and our conclusion given at the end of the paragraph is: &ldquo;The Committee cannot say where the Act allows the Minister a discretion, and until it is satisfied on this point cannot agree that the Department of Defence was justified in extending or interpreting its authority in this way.&rdquo;  That is our opinion&mdash;that the Minister had no discretion in deciding that in some cases two minor injuries might make a major injury and that in other cases they should go as minor injuries.  That is a question that will have to be further considered, and some ruling made on it as to whether the Minister has discretion or not.  The last case to which I want to refer is the case of a pension that was granted to the widow of a non-commissioned officer who was fatally shot in 1922.  Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act says that pensions can be awarded provided the person in question loses his life in the course of his duty while on active service and that death was not due to any serious negligence or misconduct.  The Army authorities were asked for a certificate as to whether the man was on duty on active service.  On 18th June, 1924, they certified that he was not.  The case was put to the Judge Advocate-General, who declared that the widow was not entitled to a pension.  His opinion agreed with that of the Army Pension Board.  After that the applicant came back again and asked to have the case reconsidered.  On l7th November the same Army authorities certified that the person was on duty and on active service, which was directly in opposition to the certificate issued by the same people on l8th June.  The case was then put to the Attorney-General, who thought that the person should get a pension.  His idea was that the onus of proof that the person was guilty of misconduct or serious negligence lay on the Government, who were opposing the pension, and that a person on active service is always <Col N="616" /> on duty.  He said that if the Government wanted to oppose the granting of this pension they would have to prove that the man was shot by one of his own comrades.  As that was found impossible the pension had to be granted.  Our report on that matter stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee has given most careful consideration to all the circumstances of this case, and, while not proposing to recommend disallowance, it desires to place on record its grave dissatisfaction that the benefit of the doubt as to the eligibility for pension should have been exercised by the Departments concerned in favour of the applicant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I beg to move that the Report be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to add to the points mentioned by Deputy Dr. Ryan, who acted as Chairman of the Committee which brought in this Report, except that there are a few points I would try to elucidate further, so that the House might understand why we have considered it necessary to refer again to certain matters.  With regard to the matter of virement, it is not very easily understood unless one spent a considerable time in studying the Estimates. The point I wish to refer to is that in connection with the Army Vote you will realise that dangers would arise, for the country as a whole, and probably for the Dáil in particular, if virement were not brought into line with the wishes of the Committee.  This House, for instance, might vote a certain sum for Army requirements.  Such Vote is divided into sub-sections, each of which conveys that certain sums are wanting for particular purposes. The policy of the House in regard to such matters could very easily be upset if attention were not paid to the proper spending of the money on items for which it had been voted. We might vote money for uniforms, for the upkeep of horses, and so on, and if stringent regulations were not enforced in the Army Department we might find ourselves faced with a situation in which the Army authorities, instead of spending the money <Col N="617" /> on matters specified, might have purchased a Tank Corps or a fleet of aeroplanes.  We might then find the whole policy of the Dáil upset by the Army authorities by their expenditure of that money.  That may be an extreme view, but we want to convey to the House the importance of having virement rigidly adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan referred to the Gárda Síochána Award Fund and showed that where a member of the Gárda was dismissed or ran away and left the country the authorities retained the pay due to him and put it to the credit of the Award Fund. While that might not amount to a considerable sum we consider it to be serious should the Exchequer not receive from the different Departments the money issued for a particular service or a particular individual in cases where such money was not spent.  In paragraph 11 page 19 of the Report reference is made to the fact that the House voted a certain sum, about £500,000, for the purchase of creameries.  The dealings in connection with their purchase had not been completed at the close of the financial year and the Department of Agriculture, who received the money, proceeded to put the unexpended portion on deposit. When the matter came before us we felt that that also could be a precedent which might have serious effects.  As we say, we feel that the proper thing to do is that at the end of the financial year any unexpended balances should be returned to the Exchequer and revoted for the next financial year.  That is only one case in which the Committee believed that if it were allowed to become a practice we might find a Department committing itself to an expenditure which was not incurred and holding on to that money, depositing it in separate accounts and never returning the unexpended portion.  I believe that the Minister for Finance will see the importance of that and will confirm the attitude of the Committee on it. Deputy Dr. Ryan referred also to certain actions which had taken place in the Army.  In one particular case there appeared to be, not <Col N="618" /> carelessness on the part of the person concerned but a looseness, amounting almost to ignoring the regulations laid down for that Department. In this case a request was sent, as mentioned in the Report, by the Army authorities to the Finance Department to sanction a scheme for the establishment of libraries at certain stations, and in their application they specified the setting up of five libraries.  When the Committee had this matter before them and when they got fuller details they found that the books had been actually purchased before permission was sought to allow them to proceed with the scheme and that not only were they concerned with five libraries but with twelve.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that if the regulations of the Department of Finance, which are backed up by this House, in connection with the financial transactions of every Department, are to be carried out, no Department should be allowed to make a farce of such regulations.  I think it is a very serious thing that a Department should go through the formality of applying for something that they had already got.  Not only did they minimise the extent of the purchase, but they bought far in excess of the quantity stated in the application.  In fact all this had been accomplished beforehand, and they were only trying to get round the regulations.  They probably thought that the Comptroller and Auditor-General might have questioned the thing.</P>
    <P>The Army Pension Bill is before the Dáil, and will come up for discussion. As Deputy Dr. Ryan says, while we are bound to be satisfied with the results we have achieved in pressing for the regularising of such matters as we felt were wrong, by the introduction of a Bill, as ordinary Deputies of the House we are not necessarily bound to the details of the Bill itself.  I would recommend also that the Minister and Deputies should read the evidence in connection with the pension awards to which Deputy Dr. Ryan referred in concluding his speech.  The Minister will then perhaps understand to <Col N="619" /> a certain extent the attitude of the Committee of Public Accounts in connection with pensions in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan deserves to be complimented upon the able and very impartial manner in which he presented the Report of the Committee to the House.  I only wish to deal with one particular matter to which Deputy Dr. Ryan himself referred.  That is the policy of the Department of Finance in relation to the work that has been carried out in the Post Office factory. I would not like that it should go to the House from any remarks that Deputy Dr. Ryan may have made in referring to this matter, that the Committee, or any member of the Committee, were of opinion that the factory should be closed down.  If that is the opinion of any particular member, and it was certainly not expressed during the proceedings of the Committee in dealing with that matter, it is certainly not my opinion.  I would like to see the work of the Post Office factory developed, and I would like to see a little more sympathy from the Department of Finance in that direction, because I believe if some more money were made available from the Department of Finance for the purpose of installing up-to-date machinery, from information I have received from people who take an interest in the factory, it would enable the factory to do a good deal more work at competitive prices, and incidentally would give more employment in the factory than is given to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister in looking into this matter, as I hope he will look into it, will not be prejudiced by the mismanagement which took place in this factory in years gone by.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he has not time, and I dare say he has not very much time to deal with matters of this kind, it would be very desirable that an Inter-Departmental Committee should be set up to go into the working of the factory for the purpose of trying to find out what means should be adopted and what further money should be made <Col N="620" /> available, to do a far greater amount of work than is done to-day in this factory.  I suggest that he should go into the whole question and deal with it in a sympathetic way because, as I say, people who take an interest in the working of the factory are of opinion that a good deal more work could be done in the place.  I hope the mismanagement that took place in the past is not going to prejudice the Minister in his attitude towards the future of the factory.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan in his references to the manner in which the estimate for the purchase of war-like stores was exceeded. I say that any extra expenditure under that heading should be submitted to the House, because it is a matter of public policy whether it would be wise in certain circumstances to incur expenditure over and above the sums allowed in the ordinary estimates.  I hope that what happened, in the particular case of which the Deputy spoke, will not occur again without bringing the matter before the House for consideration. Many of the matters which have been brought before the Public Accounts Committee especially in reference to the administration of the Army and Civic Guard services are matters which I think will not come up again.  Many things happened, particularly so far as the Army was concerned, at a period when officers, not altogether holding high ranks, took a good deal more responsibility on themselves in regard to public expenditure than was ever intended to be allowed by members of the House at any time.</P>
    <P>I must pay a tribute to the manner in which the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff have done their work in that respect.  The work which they did in bringing these matters before the notice of members of the House and of the Public Accounts Committee has been done in such a way as to prevent a recurrence of these cases, especially so far as the Army is concerned.  I served on the Public Accounts Committee for a period of three years, and in the early stages of our work certain matters were brought under the <Col N="621" /> notice of the Committee by the Comptroller and Auditor-General which were nothing short of a public scandal.  I think the members of the House and the Minister should support the Comptroller and Auditor-General in tightening up the administration of the Army in so far as it deals with expenditure of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies, though not to the same extent by any means, to the Guards.  One particular instance has been referred to by Deputy Dr. Ryan, in which the Comptroller and Auditor-General brought under the notice of the Committee expenditure that was incurred by officers of the Guards in joy-riding, or using motor cars for pleasure outside their ordinary hours of duty as Guards.  We were, however, as far as I remember given an assurance by the head of the Department of Justice that steps would be taken to prevent anything like that occurring again.  I think that Deputy Dr. Ryan, who was the very able chairman of the Committee and who has presented the report in a very impartial manner, deserves to be congratulated.  Congratulations are also due to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff for the very efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties in regard to public expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate should be a very important one.  It is rather unfortunate that we all have a tendency to say the same thing, but at any rate that shows the unanimity that prevailed at the Committee. There seemed to be three points of outstanding importance in this report. I will deal with them, taking the one of least importance first. This matter was referred to by Deputy Davin, and it touches on the use of official cars for private purposes. Admittedly it is very difficult to check this.  There are officers serving some distance from town&mdash; take as an example, although I do not think any instance occurred there, Baldonnel&mdash;in a place where there are no public transport facilities. One officer may be going to <Col N="622" /> town on duty, and another officer will say to him, &ldquo;You might as well take me and drop me where I want to go.&rdquo;  It is very difficult and practically impossible to check that sort of thing.  There are, of course, certain checks, but the Committee I think, found that those checks were fairly but not completely effective. I hope the Minister for Finance will continue to elaborate those checks&mdash;such, for instance, as the system of log books and reporting whenever a car is used for an unofficial purpose and in such a manner that the public purse may be saved.</P>
      <P>The second point is rather somewhat more important.  It is referred to in paragraph 4, and it deals with the position of the Post Office with reference to the Ministry of Finance. Of course, the position of the Post Office is and must be an exceptional one.  The Post Office is not only a spending but a trading Department, and a Department which is trading to the extent of millions of pounds in the year, and bringing in millions annually, is naturally disposed to feel that it should not be checked in its operations, and that emergencies may and do arise which require the spending of money without prior sanction.  There is also an historical reason for this position.  Prior to the Treaty the Post Office in Ireland had nothing whatever to do with the Irish administration.  It was not in any way controlled by the Chief Secretary's office or any of the Irish offices.  It was a branch of the G.P.O. in London, and was controlled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer there through the Treasury. Decisions were reached in London, but they merely came here as decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not the same necessity for discussions with the Treasury here as arose in London, and consequently the Post Office here was not in the habit of discussing these questions; it grew to assume a rather privileged position and gradually exercised a considerable amount of latitude.  In some respects, I think that is undesirable.  Although the Post Office is in that position, it is a <Col N="623" /> Government Department, and it ought to be subject to the financial check that occurs in other Government Departments.  The matter is one of some delicacy and some difficulty, but if the difficulty is ever to be solved it will be when the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs happen to be the same person.  In Gilbert's &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo; many serious problems of the same kind were solved by the eminent Pooh-Bah.  I trust that the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will, so to speak, be able to deal with one Department on one side of the stage and the other Department on the other side.  I know that he will be able gradually to resolve this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The third point that I desire to deal with has reference to abuse of the power of virement.  I have been anticipated in this matter by Deputy Davin and Deputy Ryan.  The particular subject to which reference has been made is the purchase of warlike stores.  I think the whole Committee were convinced that you could not lay down any fixed or definite limits with regard to the power of virement.  There is a note which forms an Appendix to this volume, written by the Minister for Finance, and it argues that matter very clearly and in such a manner as we would be all glad to accept. You cannot say you must not exercise virement over a fixed sum.  What should be checked is the use of the power of virement, the taking of the savings made on one sub-head and the spending of those savings under another sub-head in such a way as to alter public policy.  In this particular instance double the amount for warlike stores was spent following on a year in which four times as much was spent on warlike stores out of economies made in the pay and provisions of the men.  That is coming perilously near an alteration of policy.  If it is not checked almost anything might happen.  Without the sanction of the Dáil, sufficient savings might be made under various heads in the Army Vote to buy, for <Col N="624" /> example, a submarine, and there might be established, without the Dáil knowing anything about it, a Navy.  This could all be done merely by the exercise of the power of virement. There might be the temptation, too, for the Army to change from being an army of infantry, and it might become a mechanised army. That might be an improvement, but it would have certain far-reaching reactions.  There would be reactions of various kinds, and those ought to be faced here.  It ought not to be decided in an office where officials might say: &ldquo;We have saved so much on provisions and we can spend it on warlike stores, and never mind what the Dáil says about it.&rdquo; That principle is wrong, and I am sure the Minister fully realises it.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to make clear the fact that the Minister for Finance, in checking abuses of the power of virement of that character, will receive the support of all sections of the Dáil.  I say all sections because this question of public accounts has never been approached in my memory in a party spirit.  I am sure every section of the Dáil, without regard to party, ought to express its profound gratitude to Deputy Ryan for his conduct as Chairman of this Committee.  He was very fair and very capable, and I think that every member of the Committee, when the Deputy resigned his office, felt profound regret that he was not going to preside over their deliberations in the future. The whole Dáil owes a debt of gratitude to Deputy Ryan for his conduct in the Chair at the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cooper that it would be advisable that the Post Office repair factory should be handed over to the tender mercies of the Minister for Finance.  As Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Ryan have pointed out, while we have one view in the Committee of Public Accounts, and while it is our duty there to see that public funds are administered in accordance with the wishes of this Assembly, we as Deputies may have <Col N="625" /> other views.  This question of the repair factory arose because the Accountant and the Comptroller and Auditor-General reported to us that the costs of running that factory were somewhat excessive.  However, I do not think that you can expect very good results in the Post Office or any other Department that has to deal with what might be called public utility services if the officials in charge of that Department are going to be hampered at every turn by restrictions.  The Post Office, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, is in a very unique position.  It is a commercial department, and it ought to be run as far as possible as a commercial concern.  An ex-Postmaster-General in Great Britain has pointed out that it was impossible for the Post Office in Great Britain to make any headway on account of the extraordinary limitations and restrictions placed upon it by the Treasury. As Deputy Esmonde pointed out here last year, perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts, in their anxiety to see that things were carried out properly and economically, may have gone out of their way on occasions to strengthen the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the Department of Finance in dealing with the spending Departments. The Post Office.  I think, require sympathy,. consideration and co-operation from the Ministry of Finance more than any undue interference, and as far as possible the Post Office ought to be run as a commercial concern.  It would be very difficult to make it pay under the circumstances in the Free State.  But we must at least give the officials in charge every opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters that Deputy Cooper and other Deputies have not referred to is the question of overestimation. That is a matter that the Minister for Finance is no doubt anxious about.  He was anxious to prune his estimates as far as possible and when he is now making them up it might be no harm that we should refer to that question here. The total amounts surrendered in the year 1926-7 was £2,297,000. Some of that probably was accounted <Col N="626" /> for by the fact that each Department received appropriation moneys or extra receipts that they did not anticipate.  On the other hand if you go down through the Votes you will see that most of the Departments have not spent the money that was placed at their disposal by the Dáil.  Now the Committee of Public Accounts has as its duty to see as far as possible that when money is provided that it is spent.  When we are in the Dáil it is our business perhaps to keep down expenses as far as we can, but once expenditure has been sanctioned and passed here, it is the duty of the Departments concerned to see that the money is spent.  In some Departments there are difficulties.  In the Vote for Property Losses Compensation a very technical matter arose.  Very complicated legal proceedings extending over a long period of time took place and, as a result, there was a surplus in that Department of £490,000.  In the same way there is a difficulty in the matter of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings This Vote generally has a big surplus. The difficulty in that Department is that they have got extraordinary problems to deal with in matters of re-building on a very unusual scale throughout the country as well as here in Dublin. It has been impossible for the Department to say exactly what they were going to carry out during any particular year up to the present. It is almost impossible for them to say &ldquo;we are going to carry out this programme of work.&rdquo;  Certain factors arise in connection with these big building works and reconstructions that make it impossible to carry them out in the time specified.</P>
    <P>But now that that period is past I think that that Department which is a big spending Department should be able to cut out the surplus.  In the matter of the Army and Army pensions there have been very large surpluses also, in the last two years. In one particular branch of the Army Department there was a sum of £31,000, according to paragraph 31 of the Report of this Committee, paid out for the equipment of the Army <Col N="627" /> Reserve, the sub-head for it did not show any expenditure.  In that case it would seem to me that the policy of the Army Headquarters somehow did not work out in consonance with the financial expenditure.  It is a great mistake for a Department to do that.  I say that you must make allowances in cases such as in Public Works and in Property Losses Compensation and so on, but in the case of the Army we ought at this stage to have reached the point where the policy of the Army and the Army Headquarters would be definitely laid down at the beginning of the year and where such a thing as this expenditure for which I did not find any explanation in any case would not happen.  We ought to see that such a thing as the spending of £31,000 and then writing it up against a particular sub-head should not occur.</P>
    <P>Some of those Departments that have not spent the money allotted to them are Departments to which I would look for very urgent work down the country in the way of providing employment.  One of these Departments is the Land Commission. The Land Commission in this particular year surrendered a surplus of about £130,000.  That was partly made up of about £100,000 of money which this Dáil voted for expenditure on improvements of estates and which has not been expended.  The same thing applies to the Department of Fisheries.  If you go to the Fisheries Department you will see that on every single sub-head large amounts of money were unexpended. Undoubtedly the Fisheries Department, as it is at present treated by the Minister must find it very difficult to function.  The Department is given a few pounds and they are asked with this to do work that would need thousands.  Nevertheless here again on this particular matter I am against the Fisheries Department, because I believe that the money that was voted to them, small and all as it was, should have been expended.</P>
    <P>I wish also to reinforce the request <Col N="628" /> made by Deputy Ryan, and it is that this matter of the Fisheries loans should be wiped out.  There are a great many old matters in these accounts which, as Deputy Davin points out, have been going on for years.  No doubt they will not bother us in the future.  But the Fisheries loans have been going on for a long time.  Accounts have been kept.  Officials are being employed to look after that matter.  I do not know what hope the Minister has of getting in that money.  However, he has made a kind of promise to the House that he will introduce legislation to deal with the matter definitely. In the long run the best thing is to face the questions that are hanging over for several years and try to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>The Committee also advert to the fact that the explanations in connection with these Appropriation Accounts are not satisfactory.  At the foot of the Appropriation Accounts Deputies will notice that there are generally notes stating the reason why the amount of money granted has not been expended or stating the reasons for variations in the amounts.  &ldquo;As these respective explanatory notes,&rdquo; say the Committee, &ldquo;do not appear consistent, the Committee obtained particulars of payment made in both years with which it is satisfied, but a general comment regarding the explanatory notes at the foot of the Appropriation Accounts seems to be desirable. The Department worked these out on the principle of extreme brevity, sometimes to the point of obscuring the meaning intended to be conveyed. The Committee wishes to call attention to the desirability of greater clarification and consistency.&rdquo; Now one of the favourite explanations at the foot of the Appropriation Accounts is that &ldquo;the expenditure was not as great as anticipated,&rdquo; a quite unnecessary explanation. One has only to look at the amounts to realise that the expenditure was not as great as was anticipated.  Why should it be necessary to pay officials and to pay for printing and giving such a ridiculous explanation of the kind instanced? <Col N="629" /> At the same time we realise it would be utterly impossible and would make the report very voluminous indeed, if detailed explanations were given.  However, I think that the officials should not confine themselves to such barren platitudes as &ldquo;the expenditure was not so great as anticipated.&rdquo;  Let us get some definite reason.  The more information the Dáil and the public in general get on these accounts, the less trouble we will have, the whole lot of us, and the more co-operation.</P>

      <P>After careful study and a careful examination of this Report, and after reading through all the evidence, I have slightly changed my attitude towards the Public Accounts Committee since I spoke last year.  In fact, I have returned, as the prodigal son, to the bosom of the Committee.  However, I have not returned, like some prodigals the President spoke of, to ask for more.  I agree with other Deputies that the Committee is to be congratulated on the very fair, able and tactful manner in which the Chairman conducted the business of the Committee during this year, particularly owing to the fact that I think he only had had six months' previous experience of the work of the Committee.  There are certain criticisms one could make of the Report. In the first place, there is an unnecessary reference to small matters which really are not very important or of any serious consequence, and there is also an excessive verbosity in the proceedings of the Committee.  I noticed that on one occasion the Chairman had to point out to members of the Committee eleven times in three pages that they were not dealing with the matter under discussion.  I forget the actual page.  But all through there was a very great deal of unnecessary questioning of the heads of Departments.  After reading the evidence.  I disagree with most of the paragraphs dealing with the Army. I think that here we have a case where, as usual, the Department of <Col N="630" /> Finance, aided and abetted by the Public Accounts Committee, is interfering in what is, in fact, administration. We have an amazing paragraph dealing with the case where the Department of Finance set up a censorship of books&mdash;as to what books were or were not to be in the Army Library.  Surely that should have come under the Censorship Act, and the Department of Finance instituted this censorship without any reference to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Then there were various other questions dealing with officers' wives and other matters of a purely administrative nature which should not come within the purview either of the Department of Finance or of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Army should be in the same position as the armies in other countries where the heads of the Department, and not civilians in other Departments, are allowed to control the policy.  As I said last year, since the founding of this State there has been a discrimination, I think, between the royal departments and the republican departments, between the departments which we took over from the Kingdom and the departments which we took over from the Republic, such as Defence and External Affairs.  The older Castle Departments had their traditions. They were up to all the wiles of the Department of Finance for many years and they knew how to get over the difficulties which the Department of Finance made for them.  But I think the Department of Finance took advantage of the youth and inexperience of the Republican departments and bullied them in a manner which they were unable to do with the older established departments of the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to virement, I think that now a fairly stable situation has been arrived at which is largely a question of common sense as to how far virement is to be exercised.  I am still opposed to the principle of Appropriations-in-Aid.  I have never heard an explanation of it, and I see no reason why they should not be put down as extra receipts.  I understand <Col N="631" /> that this is the only question that the Commission which examined the Northern Ireland accounts could not understand and saw no reason for the difference between extra receipts and Appropriations-in-Aid. Although I have studied it for many years it tends, in my opinion, to confusion. Although the present Senator Johnson was most keen on it, I think it complicates the accounts.</P>
    <P>There were some suggestions that possibly, if the Committee of Public Accounts should prove too verbose and interfering, it would not perform any useful function in the State. But I have changed my mind in that respect, as I am satisfied that it does perform a very useful function.  In the first place, I think it puts the fear of God and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General into all the Departments of State, with regard to strict accounting, and in the second place, it is a very good school for teaching Deputies how the State is run.  I myself when I entered the Dáil six years ago, had not the faintest idea as to how the various Departments of State were run, and I entered the Dáil with only one idea&mdash;a rooted dislike of the Department of Finance.  During the nine months I was a civil servant they refused to raise my salary, but that was not the main reason.  During the years I have spent in the Public Accounts Committee I have certainly found it a great education for Deputies, to discover from the permanent heads of Departments how the various sections of the State are run.  For that reason alone I think a certain latitude should be allowed for questions dealing with these matters.  As we know, we have a large number of Deputies who are very suspicious of our State and who want to examine it inside and out and upside down in order to satisfy themselves that it was not invented by the devil.  That education is gradually taking place, and I think for that reason the Public Accounts Committee deserves the support of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I need speak at any great length on this.  I have furnished a minute to the Public Accounts Committee on the various matters raised in their Report, and I need hardly repeat what I said in the minute.  I think this discussion and the report out of which this discussion arises may be looked upon by Deputies, as by the various public Departments, with a great deal of satisfaction.  There are, perhaps, a certain number of things that we would not have if we were an old-established State with a normal history behind us, but they are quite few.  The number of matters to which attention has now to be drawn is not very great and most of them are not of a serious character. I think that we may well say that the public administration is being carried on with efficiency and regularity in which we may all take satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing that I would wish to disagree with in the remarks of the various speakers except, perhaps, to a very slight degree on the matter of virement.  I think that the distinction which Deputy Ryan emphasised between the effective and non-effective services is an important one, but in the matter that he was dealing with, the matter of the gratuities to ex-officers, I am not sure whether in practice there was such a clear line to be drawn as he thinks. The position was that owing to very great reductions in the Army a number of officers had become surplus to the establishment.  Those officers, as an inducement to bring about their retirement, were offered gratuities. If they had remained on as surplus officers, and if it was not proposed to carry out any demobilisation&mdash;in fact, it had been promised that demobilisation would not be carried out, that an officer would not be dispensed with on grounds other than grounds of inefficiency&mdash;the money that would have been paid them would have been, in reality, something in the nature of expenditure on a non-effective service, and I am satisfied that in that particular case the action that was taken in the matter of virement was quite correct. <Col N="633" /> However, I agree entirely with Deputy Ryan and with other speakers that the power of virement should be used as little as possible and that we should err rather in the matter of bringing in supplementary estimates than in avoiding the necessity for supplementaries by any too free use of the power of virement. I am satisfied that, circumstances having become much more normal, and all Departments having settled down to something like normal routine in the matter of estimation and in the preparation of Estimates, there need be no disputes in future on this question of virement.</P>
    <P>The Committee has recognised fully that from the point of view of public finance it is necessary that the power of virement should be preserved. On the other hand, the Department of Finance recognises that it is a power that should be as sparingly used as it can be, and that it should only be used where there is no question at all of preventing the Dáil expressing its opinion on some matter that a section of the Dáil might wish to express an opinion on.  As a matter of fact, I am in agreement with all that arose on the question of virement, except in so far as it affected the question of the gratuities to officers who were retiring from the Army.</P>
    <P>With regard to over-estimation, it is clear that there has been a very great and a steady improvement, and the complaint that it is possible to make in regard to over-estimation now is a very mild complaint compared with what might have been made two or three years ago.  In another year or two I think we will have eliminated any over-estimation that can be avoided.  I think we are always going to have over-estimation and, while it is bad to show in our estimates a greater requirement for expenditure than will prove to be correct, it is even worse to cut our estimates so fine that we will be requiring more money than was anticipated at the beginning of the financial year.  It is a matter of striking a balance, and I think it is not right to take the line that Deputy Derrig took, that it is the duty <Col N="634" /> of a Department to spend the money provided.  I think it is only the duty of a Department to spend voted money if it is required for the services that have been approved, and if it is actually required and can be usefully and economically spent.  But I think there is as much duty on the Departments to save any money that can properly be saved as there is to expend any money that may be voted, and if over-estimation arises from a Department having been able in the course of the year to effect economies, then I think that result, instead of being something to find fault with, should be praised.</P>
    <P>The question of the special position of the Post Office is under consideration, and while I do not intend to use the fact that I am nominally Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to give away whatever Post Office case there may be, I do say this, that it was specially difficult in former times to deal with the position, because the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was not a member of the Cabinet but an extern Minister, and it might have been possible to progress more rapidly with it if the Minister had been in the Cabinet. However, I think the points outstanding will be settled within a reasonable time, and that while giving the trading Department of the Post Office such special privileges as it requires, we will be able to control it in the same way as other Departments in all other matters.</P>
    <P>The fishery laws have been referred to.  The Bill dealing with that is in an advanced stage of preparation now.  I do not know if the discussions between the Department of Finance and the Department of Fisheries are entirely finished.  I see that Deputy Ryan registers doubt, as they say in reference to the pictures. I can at least assure him that it is in a much more advanced stage than it has ever been before.  I say that with a complete feeling of confidence.</P>
    <P>The question of fees collected by teachers in model schools is being dealt with.  The Department of <Col N="635" /> Finance agrees generally with the Committee, and the matter is under discussion with the Department of Education.  The question with regard to Cork School of Music will be dealt with by the introduction of an Estimate.</P>
    <P>Another point of some importance that was mentioned was that dealing with the purchase of cars by the Army just at the end of the financial year.  I recognise that expenditure along these lines should not be incurred, and perhaps should not even be allowed, but Deputies will recognise that the Vote for the Army has been coming down very rapidly, and in certain cases one of the means of getting the Vote for a coming year down was to allow fuller expenditure out of the Vote for the year in which the Estimate was being actually prepared.  As the Army Vote has now come down to a point where these reductions will not be taking place, there will be no question of anything like this arising in future.  As a matter of fact, the Army Vote from being most abnormal, and a most difficult Vote to administer in the past, has become a normal type of Vote now.  In future there will probably be no special features to attract the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Esmonde that there is no good case for retaining this system of Appropriations-in-Aid.  That is my own view.  I suppose the Public Accounts Committee still adheres to the opposite view.  In certain cases, at any rate, the system of Appropriations-in-Aid has the effect of making our Estimates totally misleading. In some cases the money expended on a service is actually more than appears on the Estimate because the gross total is reduced by the amount of Appropriation-in-Aid; though the Appropriation-in-Aid is of a kind that ought to appear simply as a receipt and not by way of a deduction from the gross expenditure on a particular service.  It is for that reason as well as the wording in the Constitution that I think <Col N="636" /> myself it is not logical and there is no good reason to retain the system of Appropriations-in-Aid.  But as I do not feel particularly strong about it and there were members of the Committee of Public Accounts in the past who were anxious to retain that feature of our Estimate system no steps were taken in regard to it.  I do not propose to go into the matters seriatim because, as I say, I dealt with most of them formally in my minute.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin gave me the impression that I may be misunderstood in what I said about the Post Office factory.  No member of the Public Accounts Committee was anxious that it should be closed down; what they were anxious about was that it should be run on a more business-like and more efficient basis.  At that time, at any rate, we would not like to see it closed down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde said that the Public Accounts Committee invariably sided more or less with the Minister for Finance against the other Departments, for instance, the Ministry of Defence.  I think that is fairly true.  We usually take the side of the Department of Finance against the other Departments when there is a dispute about expenditure. We are inclined at all times in the Public Accounts Committee to take, and I think we have always taken, the view of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as being the correct view.  I suppose I could not possibly pay a higher tribute to the Comptroller and Auditor-General than to say that in our experience we have always found him right.  As a public official I could not pay him a higher tribute than that.  As a rule, Finance agrees with the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor-General so, as a rule, we have taken the side of Finance against the other public Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the particular point mentioned about the library in the Army, the Department of Finance went in and actually censored books got by the Army.  I think they acted quite rightly.  The Army was supposed to get a technical library. When officials went in they found <Col N="637" /> such books as &ldquo;Stalky and Co.,&rdquo; by Kipling, and &ldquo;Sporting and Hunting Reminiscences,&rdquo; which could not possibly be supposed to represent technical books for an Army.  That shows the necessity for some such responsible official to go in and inspect these things.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night I was endeavouring to convey to the House the attitude which the Minister, on behalf of the Executive Council, expressed towards the decision of the Privy Council.  I think I had quoted the words of an interview with the Minister which was published in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on 15th November of last year.  The words were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It (the reference being to the decision of the Privy Council) has nothing to do with us.  When the original decision was given we made our position perfectly clear. We said that it was an entirely inequitable decision, a decision such as we could not accept and which we have no intention of accepting.  Really, we are not interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if the Executive Council and if the Minister for Finance were not interested in the decision of the Privy Council, if his Government did not accept that decision, why has he introduced into this Dáil a Bill the long title of which begins AN ACT TO CONFIRM A CERTAIN AGREEMENT INTERPRETING AND SUPPLEMENTING ARTICLE 10 OF THE TREATY OF 1921.  The agreement which, in so far as it relates to those officers who are to retire within what was the original permissive period of seven years, is founded entirely upon the decision of the Privy Council.  If entering into that agreement with the representatives of the officers who are concerned in this litigation conformed in every iota to the principles enunciated and laid down in <Col N="638" /> the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is not in fact an acceptance of that decision and an honouring of the obligations imposed by the acceptance of that decision, then what is it?</P>
    <P>The Minister said on 15th November that it was the intention of his Government to ignore proceedings before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  I must confess that I do not for myself see how they could have ignored that decision in view of the fact that the Government was officially represented before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when this matter came before it for the second time, in view of the fact that it assisted in placing this case for trial before that Judicial Committee.  I do not for myself see how, having once appeared before that Court, the Government could have ignored its decision.  And I challenge the Minister in this House to which he is responsible, to state here that he does not accept and the Executive Council, of which he is a member, is not accepting the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will be said that mine is a partisan voice in this matter, that I am concerned simply to bring the charge, that the Minister and the Executive Council have abandoned their earlier position, home to the Minister. But there are other people than I who can speak in this matter, people who are supporters of the Minister, and a journal which has advocated the cause of the Minister and his party, during the various elections and by-elections which have taken place in this country since the Treaty was accepted.  I have here a quotation from a leader in the issue of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; for February 21st, 1929.  In passing may I say that this leader is headed rather significantly with the word &ldquo;fleece.&rdquo; Possibly it may refer to the manner in which the Ministers were shorn of their courage and strength, as Samson was shorn by Delilah, but whatever the purpose of that word there is no mistaking the meaning or the significance of the article <Col N="639" /> itself.  Could anything, for instance, be clearer than this?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This settlement ought to satisfy everybody.  The civil servants will get their money; the Free State taxpayer will not be required to pay an additional halfpenny, and the authority of the Privy Council in Dominion affairs has been upheld.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And it has been upheld by the Minister in accepting the decision and in entering into an agreement which was based upon the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  I would not like, however, that the House would think that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; is injudicious and intemperate in its praise of the Ministers, because though it may love the Ministers it does not on occasions hesitate to chastise them, remembering what happens often when the rod is spared; and so in all the true kindness and fullness of its paternal dispensation it criticises Mr. Blythe even while it praises his works, for it goes on to say: &ldquo;Mr. Blythe's attempt to defy the Privy Council was ridiculous.&rdquo;  We agree it was ridiculous, ridiculous because he abandoned the position which he took up, and if it is ridiculous it is because he and the Executive Council in retreating from that position have covered themselves with ridicule and dishonour.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the British Government, in almost quixotic magnanimity, has come to Mr. Blythe's rescue with its offer to pay the cost of the civil servants' additional retiring allowances.  Once more it has given evidence of its good-will towards the Free State, and he would be a churlish Minister who did not recognise such generosity. We may hope that henceforward, for its own sake, the Dublin Government will be more tactful in its dealings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would say we may hope, for its own sake, that the Dublin Government will be more consistent in its public declarations that the things it says outside it will stand <Col N="640" /> over in this Dáil, that when the Minister declared that he was not interested in a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council he ought to have proved it by ignoring that decision altogether, by continuing to pay the compensation upon the conditions and principles which he thought were fair, and by leaving those who thought they were aggrieved by that decision of his to seek their recompense and to procure it, if they were able, elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Now that we know where the Minister used to stand, and that we have been able to satisfy ourselves by how much since then he has given ground upon this matter, let us return to the Bill.  The Bill is, as I have said, in effect an acceptance of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and a surrender to the blackmail of those transferred officers who carried their claim against the Executive to a foreign tribunal. That tribunal is one whose claim to exercise jurisdiction in this country or over its citizens should be repudiated by every true Irishman.  We, on these benches, at any rate, are not prepared to surrender to such blackmail.  We are not prepared to accept the decision or the judgment of such a tribunal.  We are not prepared to accept an agreement based upon such a decision and we will not, either directly or indirectly, allow that decision to stand or be honoured.  With a Government which has been like putty in their hands, the transferred officers under Section 14 of this Bill have procured terms and conditions of service which were not written into the Treaty and were never contemplated by the Treaty.  Remember that Mr. Amery, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, himself said in the House of Commons that it was not the intention of those who drafted Article X. of the Articles of Agreement of 1921 that the civil servants in question should be put in any more favourable position in respect to these matters than if they had remained in the service of the Crown under the British Government. The terms of Article X. of <Col N="641" /> the Treaty were onerous enough, too onerous by far for this country, but the terms which it is proposed to impose by this Bill are almost unendurable. Under the very first section, taken in conjunction with sub-section (6) of Section 14, the term &ldquo;transferred officers&rdquo; is given a very much wider content than it could possibly have had in the Treaty, for it is made to include not only established officers but unestablished officers, and even temporary clerks.  It covers, therefore, a greater number of persons and, therefore, the cost of compensation must be proportionately increased. Furthermore, the transferred officers constitute the great majority of the civil servants.  I think the total personnel of the Government staffs, excluding the Army, Civic Guard, cleaners, postmen, messengers and the temporary staffs in the Post Office is something like 14,000 persons. According to the figures which were furnished to me by the Minister yesterday the number of transferred officers affected by this Bill is 13,529.</P>
    <P>Now Section 14 of the Bill is a rather extraordinary one.  I do not know whether any of the members have read it, but it stabilises the present conditions in the Civil Service. By Section 14 the Civil Service will be entrenched in an impregnable position of influence and authority vis-a-vis the present Minister for Finance, the present Government or any other Government, so long as this Act stands and so long as the transferred officers constitute an important element in the Civil Service.  It will give these transferred officers a controlling power in the State.  They will have a right of veto upon all Government policy, because should they disagree with the Minister, should they disagree with the Government, or should they disagree with a measure introduced by the Government, they will be able to say that such a Minister, such a Government, or such legislation prejudices their position as set forth in Section 14, and immediately the Minister must be dropped or the legislation abandoned, <Col N="642" /> or else the transferred officers must be permitted to retire upon terms which would mean bankruptcy to the Government.  That is the purpose and the purport of Section 14.  If by any change whatsoever these officers are able to go to a tribunal and say that their conditions of service have been lessened, then they are to be permitted to retire upon the terms of Article X. of the Treaty as the Minister originally visualised it should work.  That is to say, supposing they should disagree with the Minister in the year 1935, they would be entitled to retire upon terms which may have been equitable in the year 1922. With this power in their hands, it is quite obvious that by a mere threat of retirement they can paralyse any policy of the Government.  If Section 14 is allowed to pass we will be governed by a bureaucracy of which this House and the Executive Council responsible to this House will only be a mask.</P>
    <P>Another thing.  It has already been admitted that a thoroughgoing reform of all the Government Departments is overdue&mdash;that is if we are anxious to lighten the burden of taxation on the people.  But such a reform must necessarily entail such alterations in the conditions of the Civil Service as would enable every transferred officer to appeal to Section 14 of the Bill, and therefore Section 14 must inevitably prevent any reorganisation of the Civil Service in the interests of the people. It condemns us to maintain for the lifetime, at any rate, of half a generation the huge, unwieldy, inefficient, extravagant machine which has come down to us from the British régime.  Section 14 will involve this country, I believe, in continuous over-taxation for a further ten or perhaps fifteen years, and will submerge our people still further in poverty and in depression.</P>
    <P>Again, one of the crying evils with which we have been afflicted since the Treaty was passed has been the amount of money paid away every year to absentee pensioners.  If this Bill goes through.  I believe it will mean an accentuation of that evil, <Col N="643" /> for, quite obviously, the people who brought this litigation to the House of Lords have their spiritual home in Great Britain; quite obviously, they are not loyal citizens of this country; quite obviously, they are not patriotic public servants, or they would have accepted the decision of the Supreme Court of this land.  Therefore, having shown, as I said, that their spiritual home is in England, there is not a doubt about it but that, when they do come to retire upon the terms secured to them by this Bill, they will do as a considerable number of their ex-comrades have already done&mdash;they will make their domiciles and homes in England.  If he were to produce this Bill at all, the Minister might, at least, have made such terms with those who were going to draw pensions under it as would ensure that they would, at least, live in this country and spend amongst its people the pensions which they are to pay them.  The negotiations afforded him an excellent opportunity for doing that.  It was a safeguard which was omitted from the Treaty and which the Minister should have had inserted in this agreement.  He cannot say that his attention had not been drawn to this evil.  He himself is aware of it.  He knows the amount of money that goes out of the country every year in respect of the pensions to ex-R.I.C. men, and in respect of the pensions paid to ex-members of the British judiciary of this country.  He saw that under this Bill further sums were going to be paid away in pensions, and I say he should have had the foresight and prudence to ensure that, at least, if these men were to draw pensions from the Irish Free State, they would continue to reside in the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Again there is the question of the effect of Section 16 (1) which says:</P>
    <P>Whenever a transferred officer to whom compensation under Article X. of the Treaty has been granted (whether before or after the passing of this Act) is employed <Col N="644" /> in any situation in a public department whether such employment commenced before or after the passing of this Act...</P>
    <P>(b)  so much of such compensation shall be payable in respect of any period whether prior or subsequent to the passing of this Act during which the remuneration of such transferred officer in such employment is less than his remuneration in his former office as with his remuneration in such employment will amount to his remuneration in his former office.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;situation in a public department&rdquo; is subsequently defined in sub-section (3) as including a situation under the Government of Great Britain or of Northern Ireland.  Section 16, though apparently at first sight it might be designed to secure a proportionate reduction in the pensions of those who retire from the service of this Government to take service in another, will, in practice, really have this effect: by enabling the Government of Northern Ireland or of Great Britain to avail themselves of the services of experienced officers upon less than normal terms, it will really have the effect of subsidising the Civil Service of the Government of Northern Ireland at the expense of this State, because many men may not like to continue in the service here as they are politically antagonistic to this Government, or because their homes or their families are in the North of Ireland, and they will be prepared, if they can ensure it, to accept a lesser remuneration in the Six Counties than they would have been prepared to continue working for here in the service of the Free State, if the Free State makes good to them the difference.  Mark the words:</P>
    <P>so much of such compensation shall be payable in respect of any period whether prior or subsequent to the passing of this Act during which the remuneration of such transferred officer in such employment is less than his remuneration in his former office as <Col N="645" /> with his remuneration in such employment will amount to his remuneration in his former office.</P>
    <P>So that a public servant who is in receipt, say, of a salary and allowance of £600 in the Twenty-Six Counties can go to Northern Ireland and discharge the same duties there for a payment of £500, and, so far as I can see, under the Bill the difference between his salary in the new employment and the salary in his employment under the Free State will be made good to him by way of pension or allowance.  I believe that that will, in practice, be the effect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In criticising the Bill we are rather at a disadvantage, because the Minister in introducing it had not the courtesy to explain the terms of the measure to us.  We can only go upon surmise.  I will ask the Minister, if he is going to reply, to explain the exact purport of Section 17.</P>

      <P>But what explanation did the Minister give of the Bill when he introduced it?  He simply said that it was to make operative a certain agreement.  I am anxious to know what the purport of Section 17 is.  It is quite possible that it may be perfectly harmless, but it does sound and it does read rather equivocal. What it says is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a transferred officer retires or is discharged (whether before or after the passing of this Act) from the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann in circumstances entitling him to compensation under Article X. of the Treaty and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board that at the time of such retirement or discharge any debt or other sum of money was or is due and owing by such transferred officer to a Minister who is head of a Department....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>then so much of his allowance shall <Col N="646" /> be retained to pay that debt.  Personally, I can see that there may be a question of provident funds and other things involved, but I should like to be quite clear as to what is exactly meant by Section 17.  I frankly confess that it may be quite a harmless section, but I do not know, and we have no information on this side of the House as to what is the nature of the debt referred to by Section 17.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would just like to refer again to the long Title of the Bill: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to confirm a certain agreement interpreting and supplementing Article X. of the Treaty of 1921...&rdquo;  Now this is the third occasion upon which this Dáil has had to consider &ldquo;An Act amending a certain agreement interpreting and supplementing Articles of the Treaty.&rdquo;  This is the third time a Bill, amending the sacrosanct Treaty of 1921, has been introduced into this Dáil, and every time such a Bill has been introduced into the Dáil for amending the Treaty, the Treaty has been invariably amended to the disadvantage of the people of this country.</P>

I know, of course, that the Minister is going to say that this Bill is not a disadvantage to the people of the country and that he will say &ldquo;What harm about the judicial decision of the Privy Council which does not impose a penny piece upon the people of this country?  The British are going to foot the Bill.&rdquo;  Of course the British are quite willing to foot the Bill after the Minister and the Government have humiliated themselves before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for the second time and have shown that whatever chastisement the people on the other side of the water administered to them in private has not been fruitless and that they are prepared to honour in every iota, as I have said, the acceptance of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. When I heard the Minister say he has no concern in this matter because the British are going to foot the Bill, it reminds me of the general who, having led the army into the field, at the end of a few weeks reported the position to the Government <Col N="648" /> at home saying, &ldquo;We have surrendered all along the line but that does not matter because the enemy have agreed to bear the cost of the pensions for the army.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I briefly, half an hour ago, expressed my opinion about the Department of Finance in its internal administration.  It is, therefore, a pleasure to me to congratulate it on its external activity in protecting the interests of the Irish taxpayer in spite of the attempts of certain parts of our Press to saddle the taxpayer with an unnecessary and an unjust burden. I think we are now conducting the funeral service over this famous Wigg-Cochrane case which has, as far as I know, brought about the demise of one Lord Chancellor, ruined the reputation of a second Lord Chancellor and brought a third Lord Chancellor in sackcloth and ashes to apologise for the decision.  Not only that but this famous case has brought confusion and has brought distress, and in the words of Lord Carson, it has brought indecency into the sacred precincts of the House of Lords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this case is concerned, I think the Minister will agree that I have stood by its cradle and followed its hearse.  I feel no hostility towards Mr. Wigg or Mr. Cochrane.  In fact, I never met them, and if I met them I candidly say that I should not know which was Mr. Wigg and which was Mr. Cochrane.  They are a kind of heavenly twins, but they have had a very important effect upon the whole constitution of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The mistake which I think is now being remedied by this Bill which Messrs.  Wigg and Cochrane made, was in believing in the doctrine of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They believed that, in fact, King George was there with a large stick in the form of a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to tell us what to do and what to obey; and they proceeded on that assumption, with the result that we know.  The correct attitude they should have adopted was to decide either that they were subject <Col N="649" /> to the Irish Government or the British Government, and when a decision was given against them in the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State they should have made representations to the British Government as to, in their opinion, an inaccurate interpretation of Article X. The British Government could then have followed the precedent already set in the case of Article XII. in asking for an opinion from their Judicial Committee without involving the Free State in that opinion, and then, by negotiations, similar results to this Bill could have been arrived at. That result could have been arrived at in a friendly way without creating disturbance and without creating bitterness, and without involving the litigants in what, in my opinion, is the crime of sedition&mdash;a crime for which I have been tried and condemned&mdash;a crime of stirring up feelings of ill-will and hostility amongst different sections of His Majesty's subjects.  I welcome this Bill, and the happy ending of a long and rather unpleasant dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in regard to this Bill. As I understand it, the principle of it is to make provision for compensation for certain officers in connection with Article X. of the Treaty.  In the discussion that has so far taken place other things have been introduced, but, as far as I could hear, nothing has been said on the merits of that particular question.  I listened with very great care to Deputy Derrig and to Deputy MacEntee in their attack on the Bill.  Neither of them addressed himself to the question as to whether or not compensation&mdash; any compensation&mdash;should be given to the civil servants who were transferred at the time of the Treaty.  I did not understand Deputy MacEntee to say that there should be no compensation paid.  I take it that the principle of the Bill is that there should be compensation paid.  In so far as that is the main principle of the Bill.  I cannot take it from anything that I have heard either Deputy Derrig or Deputy MacEntee <Col N="650" /> say that they are against it.  Article X. of the Treaty made provision for the compensation of transferred officers.  If we say now that we are not to make that provision and are not to give compensation to transferred officers, then, as far as I understand it at any rate, we are simply rejecting Article X. of the Treaty.  Deputy MacEntee has not gone that far, and I do not know if any Deputy who follows him will go that far.  The Treaty has been accepted by the majority of the people of this country.  Even that particular Article in the Treaty, as far as I remember, was contained in the alternative suggestions to the Treaty made in 1921.  That is my memory of the position at that time &mdash;that in the long discussions that took place in December, 1921, and in January, 1922, in regard to the Treaty, nobody was falling out about that particular Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, quite a number of things have been introduced into the discussion on this Bill.  Deputy MacEntee founded his objection to it entirely on the question of the decision of the Privy Council: that the Bill was giving effect to the decision of the Privy Council, and that it was an acceptance on our part of the decision of the Privy Council.  It may be my misfortune perhaps that I can never hope to understand the mentality of Deputies on that side of the House, but I can never understand why people who are so anxious to proclaim their national outlook should take advantage of every possible occasion that turns up, such as this, to show that the other people are right and that we are wrong. Deputy MacEntee quoted the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; to the effect that the decision of the British Privy Council has been upheld.  I suppose the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and all the British Conservative papers would say the same, and would insist on saying that this measure was a victory for them from their point of view.  I cannot understand what object Deputy MacEntee can have in supporting, as he seemed to me to be supporting here, the view of the <Col N="651" />&ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; rather than the view of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I take it that the greater part of Deputy MacEntee's speech was intended to show that the Minister for Finance, having taken up a certain position, has now receded from that: that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; says that, that some other people say it, and that Deputy MacEntee says it.  After all, in external matters we should speak as one body rather than as a party.  I cannot understand, therefore, why we should be so anxious to proclaim to the world that we have given way on this matter.  Personally I do not see any giving way on the matter.  I certainly cannot see that there is any victory in this for the Privy Council unless they are able to make their decision run here.  I think there is general agreement upon this point, that the decision of the Privy Council has not been imposed upon this Government.  Does the Irish taxpayer pay one penny more because of the decision of the Privy Council?</P>

I think I am a person of average intelligence, and though I listened carefully to the Deputy's speech, I have not been able to discover his point, if there is any point in it.  Perhaps Deputy Little, if he speaks later, will be able to throw a little more light on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am addressing myself to the point as to whether, in fact, the Irish taxpayer is called upon to pay more as a result of the decision of the Privy Council than he would be if the decision of our Supreme Court was upheld. That is the way that I understand the Bill, and if that is the case I cannot see the subtlety of Deputy MacEntee's argument.  I think Deputy MacEntee was carried away by his eloquence in painting the picture of what is going to happen in the future.  He told us that there are 13,529 transferred officers.  Possibly anybody listening to him would be under the impression that all these were going to get pensions.  Of course, that is not the case.  I think the Deputy was altogether extravagant in his statement in which he painted the picture of civil servants telling the Minister for Finance or any other Minister that if the measures the State brought in were not to their liking then they would hold the Government up to ransom, as it were, to take his own words: that if they did not like certain measures introduced in this House they could then claim their pensions, and in fact impose a very heavy burden on the State.  Of course that is all moonshine.  It will not be sufficient for them to say that they were displeased.  They will have to go before a tribunal, and we must assume that the members of that tribunal will bring some measure of judgment and common sense to bear on the matters presented to it for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am supporting the Second Reading of this Bill because the principle involved in it, as I take it, is the principle of compensation to certain officers.  Neither Deputy Derrig nor Deputy MacEntee said that there should be no compensation.  The question is whether there should or should not be compensation to certain officers in accordance with the terms of Article X. of the Treaty. <Col N="653" /> As I have said, nobody has argued so far, and I do not know if anybody proposes to argue, that there should be no compensation paid.  So far as the decision of the Privy Council is concerned, I am satisfied that the Irish taxpayer will not be called upon to pay any more than he would be called upon to pay if the judgment of the Supreme Court here were put into operation.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Connell saying what I claim to have been the first to have said in this House, that in questions of foreign affairs there should be an attempt at unity, but I think what-every unity there should be must be based on a real principle of independence. When the Minister for Finance implied a principle by saying that a decision of the Privy Council was a matter in which he had no interest, and of which he was going to take no notice, he was establishing a principle which we could all have followed in our hearts.  We could have backed that up as a principle, as a real attempt to stand firm on our own grounds and to check or control, if not abolish, the influence of the Privy Council.  It is not to the financial aspect but the constitutional aspect that I am directing my remarks, and to the establishment of a precedent.  I would point out to Deputy O'Connell the great importance of that principle, as to whether we are going to be ruled by the Privy Council or not.  I am reminded of another case which is likely to come before the Council, that is the question of the rights of fishermen in Northern Ireland.  A decision which has been given may be carried further to the Privy Council, and if a decision is given by the Privy Council against Ireland you may have, or you may not have, in this case a valuable precedent to go on.</P>

      <P>I am not going to go into past history, and I am sorry the Deputy is taking up that line.  It is cheap.  I am not going into past history, not that I have any apology for the past.  What we must do is, look forward and use our present position to be stronger to deal with England than in the past.  When the decision was given by the Privy Council the Minister for Finance took up the position that it was no concern of his and that he was going to follow his own line.  He then went to London and made an agreement. He has not at any point since repudiated in principle acceptance of the decision of the Privy Council, but in fact he has accepted every iota of the judgment of the Privy Council by the agreement.  It would be a very valuable thing if in some part of this Bill the Minister introduced a clause dissociating the agreement entirely from the decision of the Privy Council, or in some way or other making a declaration that he had not accepted the decision of the Privy Council.  That would be useful to us in the future.  Although from the financial point of view it is not going to be a loss, at the same time the decision of the Privy Council was that the Irish Free State should pay these officials, no matter who recoups them.  In fact, it is the Irish Free State who is going to pay them.  If the agreement had been that the British Government was to pay them direct it would be a different question, and a different principle would be involved.  It might then be said that some sort of victory in principle had been achieved, but as it is this Bill accepts in principle the decision of the Privy Council, and it is for that reason we oppose it.</P>

      <P>When Deputy O'Connell was speaking I was thinking that it would be very interesting to see him at a cross-roads in Mayo defending Section 14 of the Bill, and explaining to the small holders and the labouring men of that county <Col N="655" /> how just it was according to sub-section (3) of that section that when a man received promotion, or hereafter receives promotion, if he is not satisfied with that promotion he can claim then to go out on pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, as I say, be very interesting to hear Deputy O'Connell defending that in Mayo, or defending it to the people we discussed here yesterday on the Dublin Poor Relief Bill.  I wonder what the Executive Council think of presenting such a proposal to the Dáil in the present circumstances.  Any man of 35, 40, or 45, no matter what his age, may, if he is not satisfied with the promotion he gets at any time hereafter, claim to go out on pension and remain a cost to this State, in face of the fact that all over the country there is nothing but complaint of the terrible injustice at the present time of the pension Bills, and of the extravagance they mean to a small and impoverished State such as the Saorstát. One would think that sub-section (2) of Section 14 was the limit.  According to that, where a man claims that he is required to perform duties which are different to, or are not analogous to, those which he has been performing, or had an unreasonable addition to his duties imposed, he can also claim to go out on pension.  The sub-section gives no indication of what is to determine the meaning of the words &ldquo;unreasonable addition to his duties.&rdquo;  There are plenty of civil servants who have never had the third of a day's work to do.  Would a 300 per cent. increase in their work be considered unreasonable?  Would that give them the right to retire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not for a moment mean to speak disparagingly of the civil servants as a whole.  I have said before, and I say it again, that I think the Civil Service is one of our greatest assets.  I think the efficiency of our higher civil servants particularly <Col N="656" /> is a thing of which we ought to be proud.  It is a valuable foil to the blunders and incompetence of certain business elements in this city that have brought Dublin to the position that was described here yesterday, but it is not just to civil servants, in my opinion, to put them in the position where they will be regarded by the whole people as an enemy of the people, and who can hold up the country to ransom&mdash;to be regarded as persons who are entitled to claim privileges that no employees of any kind should be entitled to claim.  Deputy O'Connell is familiar, no doubt, with another treaty that was made in the Dáil with another section of employees. A treaty was made with the railway employees a year or two ago.  I think the Deputy knows a thing or two about that, and how far that treaty has been kept and worked out, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce could say how that treaty has been kept, and whether it has meant hardship and injustice to numbers of men who relatively have given as good service to the State as any civil servant.  In my opinion this whole matter has been approached from a wrong angle.  I think the Government could easily have made an agreement with the great bulk of the civil servants that would not have placed them in this invidious position.</P>
    <P>That would have left them in a position where they had a free and fair contract with the State, and where they would not be dependent upon such questions as whether there had been an unreasonable addition to their duties and whether the promotion which they got was satisfactory or not.  I think that the passing of the Bill will do a great deal of harm to the Civil Service, and, even if only for the sake of the Service, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw Section 14 and see whether he could not draw up a fairer agreement, one that will lead to less resentment amongst the people and to a happier position amongst civil servants than is likely to prevail if that section goes through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to approach this question in probably a different spirit to most Deputies.  I am prepared to give to the Government, and to every Government, every credit that possibly could be given to them for any attempt they may make to develop and improve the international constitutional position as it exists.  A certain position and condition were established by the Treaty, which most certainly were not the position and condition which had previously been held out as being the desire of this people, and for the moment, in relation to a Government functioning under that condition, and above all in relation to a Government which defends that condition, there is a good deal to be said for any claim that they may put forward that they are using to the best of their ability anything that is good in that condition.  Personally I feel prejudiced, under the very awkward circumstances in which they stand, in favour of giving them as much credit as I can for any effort they make to develop that position. I will go further and say that I like to give them credit for any effort they make by legitimate means to develop and improve that position, even if they fail to accomplish their object.  As I understand the declaration made by the Minister for Finance in public in relation to a decision of the highest court that exists under the most extreme British interpretation of the Treaty, it was a repudiation of its authority to interpret in any way any Article of that Treaty.  &ldquo;It has nothing to do with us.  Really we are not interested.&rdquo;  That is the declaration of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in relation to all authority of the Privy Council and in relation to the interpretation of an Article of a Treaty between us two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for that declaration, and every man in this House, whatever his politics may be and however much upon other matters he may be separated and divided from the present Executive, ought to uphold that Executive to the extent to which it meant and <Col N="658" /> stood by that declaration.  The Minister on another occasion, dealing with the decision of the Privy Council, said: &ldquo;Such a result was not intended by Article X. of the Treaty.&rdquo;  Here is a claim by the Minister for Finance, in the name of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, to interpret himself, over the head of the Privy Council, the Articles of the Treaty of Agreement between this country and England. To the extent to which the Minister meant that and stood over it he is entitled to the unhesitating, unquestioning and open support of every man in this House, however much he may be opposed to him in other matters, who believes in the independence, the liberty and integrity of this country.  The question at issue is whether or not this Bill, as we now have it, implements and stands over those declarations, or whether this Bill is the tearing up of those declarations.  On the previous occasion when this matter was raised I rose and asked the Minister for Finance&mdash;so as to give him the opportunity of taking the credit of standing over, up to that date, that declaration&mdash;whether he then meant what he had previously said, namely, that in the interpretation of this, and, therefore, of any other Article of the Treaty, the decision of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth did not concern him and did not even interest him.  If this Bill carries out that declaration it is our business, however we may be opposed to this Government, to support them.  I have gone through this Bill infinitely more anxious to find that it upheld that declaration than to find in it anything which would enable me to oppose my political opponents on the other side of the House.  If this had been a Bill to alter an agreement, if this Bill had declared that the interpretation of that Article was still the interpretation which was given to it by our Supreme Court, but that it was desirable to alter it in order that England might fulfil the obligations which she thought she had to these people, and that we were prepared to be her agents in doing so, then <Col N="659" /> there would have been a good deal to be said for this Bill, and the Bill in that form might have been a victory not merely for the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, but for the whole principle of a free Ireland. Does it contain that?</P>
    <P>It contains a mixture of clauses, some of them merely machinery, and then a mixture which makes it impossible, as far as I, an ordinary man reading it, can see, to separate what is interpretation and what is supplemental.  If this Bill had been a Bill supplementing that agreement, had it set out the existing terms of that agreement, as our courts had interpreted it and as the Minister for Finance had said he would stand over it, and if it had gone on then to show supplemental provisions, it would be a matter which might legitimately have been done.  Disregarding for a moment the fact that there was a third interest in this matter, the transferred servants, the two high contracting parties, had the right to alter the agreement which was made.  But in so far as this is an interpreting instrument which in its general body seems to interpret the agreement in the directly opposite way to that in which our Supreme Court has interpreted it, and to that which the Minister for Finance said he would stand over, we, as far as I can see, are not entitled to pass this Bill without admitting that in so doing, that very little thing, the defeat of an individual Minister in negotiation, has been accomplished, and that that very big thing, the defeat of a high principle, for which that Minister stood, has been defeated.  Not merely has the Minister himself, not merely has the representative of one of the high contracting parties, said that such result was not intended by Article X of the Treaty, but the representative of the other party to that bargain has in set terms declared the same.</P>
    <P>According to the Secretary for Dominion Affairs, Mr. Amery, in the British House of Commons, it was not the intention of those who <Col N="660" /> framed Article X. of the Articles of Agreement that it should have been decided in the way in which the Privy Council had decided it, and in which we here interpret it.  Now we are going to have this extraordinary position, that the men who go into the Division Lobby to pass that Bill as an interpretation of that agreement, the men who are going to vote for that as the interpretation of that agreement, are men who, through the Minister for Finance, are already bound and have declared to the world that that is a false interpretation. The Minister for Finance cannot vote for that Bill without publicly forswearing himself and without publicly throwing away the principle to which he declared he was devoted.</P>
    <P>I think the House will recognise that I, in speaking, have not spoken in any sense of antagonism.  There is no man in this House who would more willingly congratulate the Minister for Finance, who would more willingly, in the name of this country, express to him gratitude, if that Bill had been a Bill which did still declare on the authority of this Dáil that the interpretation that was put on that Treaty by our courts was the only interpretation.  It is no grateful labour of mind, it is not pleasant on my lips, and it is no way grateful to my heart to say that in this matter the Minister has failed both himself and his country.  If, in fact, he does believe that he is carrying out in this Bill the declaration he has made that the decision of the Privy Council in these constitutional matters and the interpretation of our treaties is nothing to us, and is not even interesting to him, then I ask him to so alter this Bill that it will make it clear on the face of it that the interpretation which was given by our courts is upheld, and that anything which is added to that Bill is a separate and distinct thing to alter the Articles in order that the interpretation may be different, and in order to carry out the machinery which is otherwise required.  The Minister has the opportunity to do the big thing, and to do it with the <Col N="661" /> support of the House.  I wish he would do it.  He may say, as has been said, and as I think he is probably right in saying, &ldquo;Apart, perhaps, from administrative costs this will cost you nothing.&rdquo;  That is probably true.  There may be administrative costs in the matter inasmuch as we are the people who are to handle the money and give it out, but that is a trifle.  He may say that in this matter nothing is lost but honour, that nothing has been thrown away but principle.  I do not want him to make that defence. I do appeal to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to do what they want to do in this Bill in a way which, instead of tearing up a significant declaration of the rights of this country over an interpretation of the Treaty, will make that right clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to contribute to this discussion, but I certainly could not continue to listen as I have done for the last hour or two to so much that has little or no bearing on the main points involved in this Bill.  Stripping it of a lot of verbiage and casuistry&mdash;I can give it no other terms&mdash;I come to deal with the actual facts.  Some people seem to think that these transferred officers have no rights.  In the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which governed, at least to some extent, the 1921 Treaty, it was provided that a servant of the Crown not desirous of serving the new Government could be released in six months and could not be retained longer than two years after the date of application.  That is embodied in our Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with a lot that has been said this evening by Deputy MacEntee with regard to certain transferred officers who may, after getting their pensions, retire to some other country. In such circumstances another country would derive the benefit of the pensions which those people enjoy.  That is one of the things which we cannot prevent.  There is another side to that particular phase of the question.  I know there are <Col N="662" /> many people in this country, ex-civil servants and others, who enjoy small pensions and who are a very serious menace in the labour market to those seeking employment.  That is a phase which has not, perhaps, been considered by some Deputies who have spoken in opposition to this Bill.  It has occurred in my experience that many ex-civil servants who enjoy a small pension of, say, about one pound per week, enter into competition with others seeking employment.  Sufficient attention has not been paid to the equities of the whole case.  Whilst I hold that this Bill is capable of amendment, it is at least an attempt to translate into some kind of action the various happenings of the last couple of years, notably the famous Wigg and Cochrane case which has been referred to by more than one speaker.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested that it would be difficult to defend Clause 14 at the Mayo cross-roads.  I suggest that he would have as great a difficulty, if not a greater difficulty, in defending his position at the Wicklow cross-roads.  I want to know what Deputy would have the temerity to stand up at any cross-roads in Ireland and say to a pensionable officer that if he were transferred to another Government he should not take with him all the rights and privileges that attached to his former position.  That is, in effect, what this Bill means.  We took over in this country a number of officers who served the British Government.  They got the guarantee under the Treaty that their positions and conditions would not be worsened&mdash;that their opportunities for promotion and betterment would not be worsened.  Exception has been taken to sub-section (3) of Section 14.  Where a transferred officer receives promotion and claims that his position in the situation into which he has been promoted has been materially altered to his detriment, he has the right to retire.  He has that right already without any existing legislation.  He has his rights under this Article of the Treaty to retire on pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> As far as I can see there is nothing in Section 14 to which any reasonable objection could be taken.  It may require amendment here and there, but on the whole the principle underlying the Bill is good and acceptable. I know there are many transferred officers who are just as patriotic as any member on these benches or on the Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.  I deprecate, at the same time, the fact that some of these who have been given decent pensions by this Government have thought fit to go to other countries and give those other countries the benefit of their pensions.  However, it is a matter of equity and justice. We cannot prevent it.  We have only to hope that where, under this Bill, decent pensions and superannuations are awarded, the recipients will, perhaps under better conditions, decide to continue to live here and to spend their money in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about what I previously said in regard to this matter, and I think there has been something very like an attempt to misrepresent the position that the Government took up.  I might recall to Deputies that after the litigation here there was an appeal to the Privy Council, and there was a judgment delivered by the Privy Council.  After some time a question was asked in the Dáil.  It was on the 22nd February, 1928 (col. 108, vol. 22).  The question was asked by Deputy Esmonde for Deputy A. Byrne.  In my reply to that question I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have had under consideration the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Wigg and another versus the Attorney-General.  The Government are desirous of honouring to the fullest extent their obligations under Article X. of the Treaty. It is clear, however, that some of the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee in the case referred to would, if given effect to, result in more favourable treatment under Article X. of the Treaty being accorded to transferred <Col N="664" /> officers in the matter of bonus than they would have received had they remained in the British Civil Service or than transferred officers who elect to remain in the Civil Service of the Saorstát would receive on ultimate retirement in the normal course under the Superannuation Acts. Such a result was not intended by Article X. of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Then I proceeded to outline what was intended.  I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council has, accordingly, decided to introduce into the Oireachtas at the earliest practicable date proposals for legislation providing that awards of compensation already made by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Committee, which was presided over by Mr. Justice Wylie, shall be binding in law.  The legislative proposals will include a provision for the setting up of a Statutory Committee constituted somewhat on the lines of the defunct Committee whose duty it will be to adjudicate upon all pending and future claims under Article X.  The determination of this Committee on any application or question referred to them will be final and conclusive. In assessing compensation the Committee will be required to adhere in the treatment of bonus to the basis applicable to officers in the British Civil Service immediately prior to the transfer of the officers to the service of the Provisional Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I proceeded to state that the Government was prepared to pay the costs.  It was recognised at that time, or shortly afterwards, that legislation, concurrent legislation, by the British Government would be necessary, because both the British Government and the Saorstát Government are interested in those officers.  They were officers of the British Government, and the Treaty provided for their treatment and for their protection.  The position that we found ourselves in when the Privy Council delivered this judgment was that our Supreme Court <Col N="665" /> had decided in one particular way, it had as it were advised us that the meaning of the Treaty in regard to this business was a certain thing. The British Government had been advised by the Privy Council that the meaning was another thing. They, like us, thought that the judgment of the Privy Council was wrong.  We could proceed to deal with it, but the position would not be satisfactory as between the two parties to the Treaty unless there was joint legislation dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The matter at the time I made that statement had not been completely worked out.  I am not sure whether or not it was known at that time that the agreement with concurrent legislation would be based on an agreement, but it was at any rate fully recognised that in order to close the matter and to bring the two parties to the Treaty legally as well as in opinion into accord, it was necessary that there should be legislation both here and in the British Parliament.  After certain events in England, and for their own reason, the British Government decided to refer the matter again to the Privy Council for an opinion, hoping, as was clear, that they would obtain an opinion contrary to that expressed in the judgment when the case was heard.  We were asked to allow to arrange for counsel from this side to put the case before the new board. We agreed to that on the condition that the expenses in connection with the matter were paid by the British. The fees of the counsel who appeared instructed nominally for the Attorney-General here were actually paid by the British Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That board delivered another and even more extraordinary and absurd judgment than the first board. When that judgment was announced I was, I think, rung up by somebody on behalf of the Press, and I said that it would make no difference to us, that we were not interested in it, that the British Government had sought the opinion of the second board of the Privy Council for their own reasons.  Now the only modification that has taken place as compared with the intention in February, <Col N="666" /> 1928, when I first spoke on the matter, is simply this: that the British Government have agreed to pay the extra amount which the original Privy Council awarded to the civil servants concerned in this matter.  I, for my part, see no reason at all why we should obstruct or in any way hinder or make difficult the action proposed to be taken by the British Government in paying that extra amount.  It really is no concern of ours.</P>
    <P>Deputies have talked as if this matter of the Wigg and Cochrane case was fundamentally concerned with the question of the hearing of appeals by the Privy Council from the Supreme Court here.  That is clearly not so.  I would refer Deputies to a statement made by the late Minister for Justice on 3rd February, 1926, when he was discussing the Lynham and Butler appeal, on the Land Bill, which ousted the jurisdiction of the Privy Council in the Lynham and Butler case.  The quotation appears in the bottom of column 341, and reads:&mdash;&ldquo;For the moment we are not complaining about the admission of the Civil Service case of Wigg and Cochrane.  We disapprove of any continued exercise of this prerogative, but if it is to eke out an obsolescent existence for some little time longer before it becomes obsolete by the joint protest of the members of the Commonwealth, then Wigg and Cochrane is the kind of case that might be admitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, we did not set out in dealing with this matter to kill the appeal to the Privy Council.  We went before the Privy Council in the first instance when the case was being decided.  If the judgment had not been manifestly wrong and such as to throw a burden that was admittedly unjust on the Saorstát, we would have raised no objection to it. We would have been prepared to accept it.  Our point of view was the point of view that the late Minister for Justice stated, that this claim of the Privy Council to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court here was objectionable and that it was to be contested by the methods <Col N="667" /> that had been devised in all purely domestic matters; that its complete abolition was to be worked for, but that we were not out to make a test case of the Wigg and Cochrane case in that particular matter.  Incidentally I am quite satisfied that this particular case, although we did not set out to destroy the appeal to the Privy Council by means of it, has in fact finished the appeals to the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>I think it is no longer a question of getting the British Government to agree to kill appeals to the Privy Council.  It is only a question of getting them to agree to give the corpse a decent burial.  I think there will never again be an appearance for the Attorney-General of the Free State before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  The Privy Council committed an absurd blunder in connection with this matter. It received, by the denunciations of its judgment, which were delivered even in the British Parliament, such a shock as it will never recover from.  The judgment of the Second Board, instead of repairing matters, only damaged them further, and while we did not set out to do anything particular to the Privy Council in this case, the result of the blunders that were committed has been to bring the question of appeals from this country to the Privy Council to an end.</P>
    <P>As for ordinary matters that have no international concern and which are not in any way involving the British Government, we have already devised a method which completely stops appeals to the Privy Council.  This method we have used on a couple of occasions, and it, perhaps, could be perfected if it were necessary so as to make it still easier to prevent cases like the Copyright case or the Lynham and Butler case being dealt with before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  I think that Deputies may feel pretty sure, whatever their opinion is, that even since the time that the late Minister for Justice spoke, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a court of appeal <Col N="668" /> from the Saorstát has obsolesced a great deal and it is now in such a comatose condition that it will probably die, as the newspapers say, without recovering consciousness.</P>
    <P>With reference to the details of the Bill, I do not want, as it were, to anticipate the Committee Stage, but there has been a good deal of reference to Section 14, and Deputy MacEntee has delivered a sort of prophecy that, to say the least of it, is ridiculous.  If Deputies will read Section 14 with any attention they will see that it is quite a simple section, and, I think, one that is unobjectionable. It may be unnecessary in actual practice to protect civil servants.  It may be that no Government would do the things that perhaps some civil servants fear, but, in any case, it does not confer on them any rights beyond the rights they have actually had in practice.  As I explained when introducing this Bill, the effect of its passage will be simply to leave the position as it would have been if the Wylie Committee had been a statutory committee. The points that are here made clear were points that were decided, in the sense that they are set down in this Bill, by the Wylie Committee.  We felt bound to accept all the recommendations of the Wylie Committee as if they were judgments, and we acted on them whether, in fact, we disliked them or not.  The only difference this Bill makes is that the new Committee recommendations will be statutory recommendations, final and conclusive, and must be accepted.  In practice there will be no difference after this Bill is passed from the position that actually existed so far as civil servants are concerned while the Wylie Committee was operating.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (2) provides that a civil servant may retire with compensation if he is required to perform duties that are not analogous, and that were an unreasonable addition to the duties of his office at the time of transfer.  That protects&mdash;shall we take an extreme case?&mdash;a clerical officer from being told that in addition <Col N="669" /> to his clerical duties he must wash the corridor outside his office every morning.  It means that if a clerical officer were required to do duties of that sort he could then go before the Committee and could claim that he was required to perform duties that were not analogous and that were an unreasonable addition to the duties of his office, and he could claim to retire.  That may not, as I say, prove necessary in practice, but the object of a provision such as that is to prevent the Government actually forcing transferred officers out, and not incurring the liabilities that they would incur if they were discharged in a straightforward way.  I do not think it would occur, but any Deputy will see that it would be possible for a Government that would stoop to it to deprive civil servants of their rights by giving them duties which it would be impossible for them to perform and which they could not be expected to perform.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) simply gives the same protection to an officer who has been promoted since the date of the transfer.  This deals with a case of promotion in the normal course, and it simply means that the civil servant who has been promoted to a position has the protection that he had in his original post, because if you give no protection to a promoted officer it could conceivably happen that a Government, meaning to force a man out, would first move him out of the position which he held at the time of the transfer by promotion, and then, having deprived him of his Treaty protection, would proceed to treat him in some unfair way.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with matters that are proper to the Committee Stage.  The sections are all, in fact, perfectly reasonable and perfectly defensible.  They will not create the type of bureaucracy that Deputy MacEntee referred to.  As Deputy O'Connell, I think, said, in order to get these retiring allowances people will have to prove to the board that they have suffered unreasonable <Col N="670" /> treatment, and we must assume that the board, which will be presided over by a judge, which will have representatives of the Minister for Finance and the transferred officers on it, will take a reasonable view of any case that is put before it.  As a matter of fact, we are not going to have a rush for retirement, because I think it is perfectly certain that large numbers of the officers who have retired already are sorry they did so.  A great many officers retired thinking that they would get employment of other sorts quite easily, but they did not find that the labour market absorbed them at all readily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore talked about the man who had never done one-third of a day's work, and Deputy MacEntee talked about a huge, inflated, unwieldy, inefficient, and extravagant machine.  Those are stock phrases for use at the crossroads, and I do not think that they require any reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question, if I might. As the Bill is at present, does it, or does it not, give to the transferred civil servants from all sources exactly what they would have got&mdash; neither more nor less&mdash;under the decision of the Saorstát High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that could not be answered by yes or no. If the Deputy will read the Bill he will see exactly what it gives them, and I think he knows what it gives them.  It gives the people who retired before the 1st March the additional money which will be paid by the British Government, and it gives the people who retired after that the Supreme Court terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <P>Towards meeting further the cost of such measures as the College <Col N="674" /> may hereafter take with a view to increasing the proportion of instruction given through the medium of the Irish language, the Minister for Finance may, if and when he so thinks fit, by order made on the recommendation of the Minister for Education increase the said sum of twenty-eight thousand pounds by such sum not exceeding two thousand pounds as shall be specified in such order, and the Minister for Finance may by any subsequent order similarly made further increase the said sum of twenty-eight thousand pounds, but so that the amount of such increase together with all increases previously made under this sub-section shall not exceed the sum of two thousand pounds.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 2, line 49, after the word &ldquo;language&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or making better provision for the study of the Irish language and literature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to meet the point raised by Deputy Tierney, who urged that in addition to making such progress as could be made in the giving of instruction through Irish it was desirable that further arrangements should be made not only in Galway, but elsewhere for the actual teaching of the Irish language and for lectures in its literature.</P>

      <P>I consider this amendment effects a very large improvement in the Bill.  Personally, I would like to emphasise the view that I gave on the Second Reading, that I have, of course, no objection whatsoever to every attempt being made to encourage the teaching of various subjects through Irish, but I feel that until something is done to put the Irish language itself in a better position than it occupies at present in all the colleges of the National University that the attempt to go further with the teaching of other subjects through Irish is not likely to be successful.  I only hope that the Minister will be called upon to expend money for the object set forth in this amendment.  I think a <Col N="675" /> serious attempt will be made, as I said on the Second Reading, to put the Irish language in University College, Galway, as well as elsewhere, in the same position as the French language is in the Sorbonne in Paris, or the German language in the University in Berlin.  Until something like this is done, I feel that we shall not get very far with our efforts to encourage the teaching of other subjects through Irish.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment proposed by Deputy Fahy, because I think it is impracticable. I think it is an impossible condition to impose on the College. If Section 3 is passed, with Deputy Fahy's amendment, &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, the Governing Body of the College or the President of the College (as the case may be). when making an appointment to any office or situation in the College, to appoint to such office or situation a person who is competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language.&rdquo;  It would mean that in future no appointment of any man could be made to any chair or any position in University College, Galway, unless that person were in a position to discharge his duties through the medium of the Irish language.  Deputy Fahy must know that people are not to be found at the present time who will do work of a university standard through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with the provisions of the amendment <Col N="677" /> moved by the Minister for Finance, because it would help to provide the men who, in time, will be able to do the work through the medium of Irish.  But is there anyone who will get up and say if a person were wanted to fill the chair of engineering in Galway to-morrow, the chair of medicine, biology, zoology or any of these other faculties, that there are to be found men of first-class ability in their own particular branches who are able to do their work through the medium of Irish? Is it not likely that it would happen that a second-rate or a third-rate man, in the particular branch for which they were being chosen, would have to be elected for no other reason than that they were able to do the work through the medium of Irish?  If we are considering a faculty of engineering in Galway College, is it better to have third-rate work in engineering done through the medium of Irish or first-rate work through the medium of English?  That is the practical way of looking at it.  If it could be done, and if these men are available, then good and well, but I do not believe that they are available.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any proper provision has been made in this country or in the National University for the last eight or ten years to provide these people.  I do not believe that provision has been made in the University to provide people of university standard who would be able to lecture on scientific subjects through the medium of Irish.  I think it is quite wrong that we should not face the facts.  I do not believe it will help the language to pass Deputy Fahy's amendment.  I believe that it will be an injury to the language and the whole language movement.  It is impracticable.  It is well known that the position is that we have not these people, and, until we have, Deputy Fahy's amendment will not be a practical one.  I think it is going far enough to say that in all these appointments people who are competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language: <Col N="678" />&ldquo;provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such appointment.&rdquo; Why does Deputy Fahy want to cut out &ldquo;and also suitable in all other respects&rdquo;?  That is what he is really cutting out and saying although they may not be suitable in all other respects, provided they are able to do the work through the medium of the Irish language, they should be appointed.  I think, as I say, it is doing an injury to the cause of the Irish language to force that amendment until we are in a position to show that the men are available to do the work in the way in which it is to be done.</P>

      <P>I was very surprised to hear the attack on the amendment that was made by Deputy O'Connell. I am a post-graduate of University College, Galway.  I was a student there for five years, and all the professors that I knew there were native Irish speakers.  They are excellent men, well able to teach their classes through the medium of Irish.  I am surprised that in the year 1929 a Deputy from Connaught, like Deputy O'Connell, could come here and tell us that these professors are not able to teach their classes through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy O'Connell and this House that the professors of medicine in University College, Galway, who taught me are native Irish speakers, and I am a native Irish speaker myself.  What is more, the patients that attend the hospital there, where there are over 300 beds, are mostly native Irish speakers, and they have to be questioned in Irish.  It is no use for any ophthalmologist or radiologist going to these patients and asking them <Col N="679" /> questions in English.  The majority of these people are Irish speakers, and it is ridiculous to think that any English-speaking doctor could attend them.  If the hospital is to be used as a clinical hospital and medical students are to be trained there in the different subjects which they must pass it is absurd to think that any doctor can diagnose these cases if he does not know Irish, and if he has not a very competent knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>I think the feeling in Galway, and in University College, Galway, is that we want to have it an Irish-speaking college.  We want to have it a university where the professors will be competent to teach through the medium of Irish, and if you could get in 1914 and 1916, as we did get, a professor of surgery who has degrees that could not be beaten in any college or any hospital in Dublin or Cork, and who is a native Irish speaker, and if you could get a professor of medicine, a native Irish speaker, who is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and an M.D., and if you have a native Irish speaker as ophthalmologist and the same as radiologist appointed in 1914 or 1915, I do not see why in this year of 1929 we should not aim for that.  I do not see why anyone who passes through University College, Galway, cannot do his business through the medium of Irish&mdash;that is, as regards medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also accused Deputy O'Connell of having brought into question the capacity of the present staff of University College, Galway.  I maintain that it is altogether an invidious sort of statement to make.  When we are dealing with a matter like this we ought to be able to deal with it from the point of view of fact, and we ought to be able to do that without trying to make every ounce of political capital out of that aspect of it. Deputy O'Connell is as interested in this matter as Deputy Doctor Tubridy, and so am I.  We are anxious that as soon as possible a <Col N="681" /> state of affairs should be brought about in which lectures on every subject shall be delivered through the medium of Irish, but as regards the qualifications of the present staff of University College, Galway.  I would like to say that it has nothing whatever to do with this Bill.  This Bill deals with the qualifications of men who will have to be appointed in the future.  It has nothing to do with the present staff.  I would like to know, however, when Doctor Tubridy was attending his lectures in the Irish language in University College, Galway, what sort of Irish textbooks were used in these lectures. I have a certain amount of suspicion that these lectures were apocryphal.  I have a certain amount of doubt, whether even a native Irish speaker would be capable of delivering at the moment a full course of lectures on medicine or any other subject through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctor Tubridy raised the question of doctors attending patients in hospital, but the doctor could attend an Irish-speaking patient and examine him quite efficiently without being able to discuss all sorts of higher problems in medical research in the Irish language.  If the doctor has a sufficient speaking knowledge of Irish, altogether irrespective of his knowledge of medicine, he should be able to go very far in examining any patient.  The Deputy is inclined to confuse a good spoken knowledge of the Irish language and the capacity to deliver lectures to, say, an honours degree standard or a post-graduate standard in a very difficult and complicated technical subject and in a language in which no text books whatever on that subject exist.  That is a very different problem from being able to talk a language fluently to a patient.  I do not care who the native speaker is, or how fluently or well he may speak Irish, to talk at the present day of lecturing in the Irish language, on any subject, in which you have not got text books in the Irish language, is very little short of humbug in my opinion. There is a considerable amount of danger that we may, as I said <Col N="682" /> before, do harm by trying to go too far all at once in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in dealing with this Bill, that we in this country are going to have it hard enough to keep our standard of university education as a whole up to the general European or world standard without complicating the matter still further by going in for all sorts of humbug about lecturing in Irish when we know very well that we cannot lecture in Irish.  It is too serious altogether to allow political capital to be made out of it, or to allow personal advantage to be taken of it.  This Bill as it stands compels the Governing Body of Galway College and the Senate of the National University, if there is a vacancy on the staff, and if a person thoroughly qualified to lecture in the Irish language and in other respects is available, to appoint that person.  They cannot get out of it.  They are compelled by law, once this Bill is passed, to appoint such a person.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Fahy's amendment is passed it will mean, suppose a case should turn up in which, in the honest opinion of the Governing Body and of the Senate, a person properly qualified to deliver lectures in the Irish language was not available, that the Senate would be unable to appoint anybody, or else would be faced with the choice of appointing somebody not qualified either in the Irish language or in the particular subject in question.  It seems to me that there is far too much importance being attached to this matter of lectures through Irish. It is a very desirable thing, and a very important thing, that an advance should be made in that direction, as in others, but I must say that I cannot see eye-to-eye with Deputy de Valera when he says, as he said the other night, that it should be possible for a person to proceed to a university degree in this country at this time of day without any knowledge of the English language. I do not see how that can happen. I am prepared to maintain that the person, in the present state of education in this country, who pretends that he can get a degree in any subject <Col N="683" /> without a knowledge of the English language is talking through his hat.  A person cannot lecture on a subject without having text-books on that subject.  I do not know that it will be of any great importance whatever to have lectures, say, in medicine, or engineering, or anything else, in Irish by a professor to students who both have to use, all the time, English text-books.  You have to deal with that part of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is trying to maintain that the present staff of University College, Galway, are capable of delivering lectures in Latin.  I may be permitted to express a doubt on that subject, if the Deputy means by what he says about Latin phraseology that a medical lecture is all in Latin.  The fact remains, whether you call it Latin or whatever you like, that there is no text-book in the Irish language for medicine or any other subject which could come into serious consideration when teaching that subject up to the standard of an honours university degree.  There is very little likelihood for a long time that such books will be available.  If you take the case of my own subject, I consider that it would be very foolish for anybody to purport to teach the Greek language through Irish, in view of the fact that there does not exist even an elementary dictionary of Greek in the Irish language, much less text-books of other descriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be easy enough to provide that doctors, engineers, lawyers, and so on, have qualifications in the Irish language, and are able to speak the Irish language fluently and do business, to a considerable extent, in it, but it is altogether unjustifiable, in my opinion, to mix up that which is highly desirable and easily attainable, with the much more problematical and difficult question of proceeding right away, whether you have people qualified or not, to insist that all lectures in any particular subject <Col N="684" /> shall be delivered through the medium of Irish.  I quite agree that that should be the case later on, and that in certain subjects the time may very soon come when it will be possible to get people capable of lecturing through the medium of Irish. But, until such people are available, and until you are certain that such people as are available have full qualifications, not only in the Irish language, but in the subject which they propose to teach through Irish, I think you will be making a very grave mistake, from the point of view of the Irish language itself and of the general education of the country, in allowing an amendment of this kind to be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tierney opened his remarks by assuring us that he was anxious to have the Irish language occupy the same place in University College, Galway, as the French language in the Sorbonne. He may think himself that his speeches here on this subject, however sincere they may be, are advancing to that object.  I think they are retarding it, and that, whatever his own opinions may be, they are going to be used by people, who are not as sympathetic to the Irish language as he is, for another purpose. He says: &ldquo;Let us be sure of our facts.&rdquo;  He believes that this thing should be done ultimately, but not at present.  The point is, is it going to be done?  Deputy Tubridy has pointed out that when he was a student the professors of medicine in Galway, if they did not give the college lectures through Irish, did a good deal of the clinical work in that language, and if it had been compulsory upon them to do more I am sure they would have done it. The professors and students in Galway are living in the midst of an Irish-speaking atmosphere.  You have only to go a few miles from Galway on the lake and you can hear the children playing their games in Irish.  It was the case when I was a student.  That is a thing you will not find in many other places, and it happens less than two miles from Galway.  You have people of all ages <Col N="685" /> and classes capable of conducting their business in Irish.  You have the majority of the business people in Galway doing their business in Irish, and you have the position that the majority of the professors are Irish speakers, and, I believe, capable of doing their business in Irish.</P>
      <P>I see Deputy Good smile.  We are either in earnest in regard to this matter, or we are not.  I, for one, at any rate, as far as Deputy Tierney's remarks in regard to political capital and so on are concerned, would remind him that when a Deputy makes statements in public with reference to this matter of Irish, and gives expression to his own views, he ought to have no objection to criticism upon them.  Is it or is it not the case that Deputy Tierney evolved a theory of his own about a bilingual State which we were to have in this country?  I do not know in what publication exactly he published it, but I know that he produced an entirely new theory of his own which, I dare say, came from his contact with certain people of the Anglo-Irish type in Dublin who may have a certain idea about Irish.</P>

      <P>I do not want to refer to the writings of Pearse, nor to the question of the raising of the standard of university education. When the National University was founded it was made compulsory on the students that the possession of Irish was necessary to pass the matriculation examination.  However, very little has been done since that except that in Cork University professors have been found capable of dealing with such subjects as mathematical physics through Irish. There is also in Galway a professor in charge of the engineering school, <Col N="686" /> who, if he does not conduct his lectures in Irish, at least is a competent Irish speaker, and I am quite certain that so far as that professor is concerned, and from my own acquaintance with him, he will, if this amendment is carried, be in a very short time fully competent to do all his work in Irish.</P>

      <P>I understand that, to a certain extent, we may be travelling outside the amendment.  I am not speaking to that point about the staff in any sense of making undue capital out of what Deputy Tierney or of what Deputy O'Connell said. What I say is that they are speaking here, and they are trying to give the House the impression that they have full knowledge of the facts when, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of the facts, and when, as a matter of fact, the situation cannot exist, because you cannot get men capable of doing the work in Irish when there are men doing the work there in Irish already.  It is an argument in favour of this amendment that it must be easy to get men in future under the new conditions and new school programmes and Government policy if many years ago you had a large number of professors competent to speak Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in regard to Deputy Tierney's remarks was that text-books are not available.  Undoubtedly that is a difficulty, but that difficulty can be taken in hands at the same time that the whole question of Irishising Galway College can be taken in hands.  When this Assembly was set up here it was decreed that all statutes passed should be translated into Irish.  What an extraordinary variety of subjects have been discussed in this House, what a complex network of legal technicalities have passed into law, and yet men, because they were sincere in <Col N="687" /> what they did, not that they had any specially high qualification in University education, or anything else, quite ordinary officials, were able to get down to these questions and were able to translate all these terms into Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney wanted to make a lot of capital out of Deputy Tubridy's point about Latin phraseology. I submit that the professor of medicine is lecturing in Latin most of the time.  When dealing in these terms he is speaking Latin, and if the whole business of Galway College were by a wave of a magic wand transformed into Irish tomorrow you might have 99 per cent. of the technical terms and phrases in the medical text-books transferred straight away into Irish.</P>

      <P>If a great many more of them were in Greek they would be easier to manage, and if Deputy Tierney would devote a little of his attention to tracing the roots he might give valuable assistance in translating them.  If you get a staff here in Leinster House capable of translating into Irish everything that passes here and covering every term no matter how difficult in all these Acts in the past seven years surely we are not so despondent or despairful of the National University that we do not realise that with the students and the under-graduate body solidly in favour of this course, as undoubtedly in University College, Galway, they are, and with the majority of the professors Irish-speakers, and with the facilities you are going to give in the form of additional financial aid, no person can, from a detached view point, doubt that in a year or two we shall get over this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want this amendment to be passed at once, because it will be difficult to open this question again. If this amendment is defeated and if appointments are going to be made to Chairs or Lectureships in Galway before this question can be reopened <Col N="688" /> again irreparable harm will have been done.  Whatever justification there may have been in the past for appointing persons who could lecture through English there will be no justification whatever in the future.  It will be said when this thing was passing through that the tolerant majority in the Dáil gave this loophole and let us take advantage of it.  Furthermore, there are three different bodies mentioned here&mdash;the Senate, the Governing Body and, I believe, the Academic Council&mdash;who will have something to say to it, and between these three bodies, who may or may not take up a weaker attitude upon the language question than is desirable, you may be sure this loophole will be taken advantage of to appoint persons not competent to do the work in Irish. I strongly urge the House to insist on passing Deputy Fahy's amendment. I believe it will not injure the standard of university education. On the contrary, I believe it will get us out of the position that we are in at present, sending persons to Berlin, Paris, Rome and to Geneva who are not able to speak the Irish language. How long is that going to continue?  Let us, in God's name, put a stop to it here and now and say definitely having done such good work in primary and secondary education we will put a fitting crown upon it by setting out definitely to-night to establish a Gaelic University.</P>

      <P>I could not help feeling that if Deputy Derrig had been consistent he would have delivered his lecture in Irish, and if <Col N="689" /> he had I might have believed that it was relevant to the amendment. Only in the last three sentences did the Deputy speak to the amendment at all.  As I understand the amendment, it is definitely to affirm the principle that, provided a professor knows Irish, it does not matter whether he knows anything about the subject he is going to profess or not.  They are to appoint the man with the best knowledge of Irish without reference to whether he is the best man to teach the subject of mathematics or history or any other subject.  Bernard Shaw once said that professors of Greek are privileged; few of them, he said, know Greek, and none of them know anything else.  Now we are in Galway. We have the situation where all the professors are to know Irish and are to know nothing else, if Deputy Fahy's amendment is acted on.  You might have a professor of mathematics who did not know the difference between the integral and the differential calculus.  He might be an excellent man.  Perhaps he would be.  I do not know the difference myself.  I do not profess to have a great knowledge of mathematics.  You might have a professor of history who mixed up Wolfe Tone and Smith O'Brien.</P>

      <P>Is that really going to be for the good of the Irish language?  There are large concessions made to the Irish language in this Bill.  But surely it is not going to help the language if you are going to say: &ldquo;Provided you know Irish you can profess any subject whether you are the best man for it or not.&rdquo; It does not affect the situation that Deputy Derrig mentioned.  He said that the existing professor in surgery can give clinical instruction in Irish.  This Bill does not affect any existing professor.  It only refers to new appointments.  It lays down that, if a man who is a good man in his subject knows Irish, he should be given a preference.  Is not that enough?  Is not that reasonable <Col N="690" /> enough without adding a proposition which, with all respect to Deputy Fahy&mdash;I do not want to offend him &mdash;does seem to me to be a perfectly ridiculous one, one that will make the Irish language not respected, but laughed at in academic circles throughout the world.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Cooper has read Section 3 at all.  It is a rather strange thing for the Deputy to be talking about the section if he has not read it.  If he reads the section he will find that it runs like this:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, the Governing Body of the College, or the President of the College (as the case may be) when making an appointment to any office or situation in the College to appoint to such office or situation a person who is competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language....</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that he must be competent to discharge &ldquo;the duties thereof.&rdquo;  Therefore, it is not a question at all of appointing anyone who may know the Irish language to a Chair the subject matter of which he is ignorant.  The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such appointment.&rdquo;  Who is to determine that?  Is every appointment to be a question for the court? If that is to be so, then it means that as regards every decision of the Senate in making an appointment there is to be an appeal to the courts against it as far as I understand it. I think that is a highly undesirable situation.  I am confident that nobody will be appointed by the governing bodies mentioned here who is not fit to discharge the duties of the Chair, who is not fit for the position, and who can discharge the duties in the first instance through the medium of the Irish language.</P>

In that case a definite, permanent appointment cannot be made, and I think that such an appointment ought not to be made. To appoint at this stage to positions in Galway College people who are not competent to discharge their duties through Irish is, to my mind, going backwards.  Now is the time in which we have to make a definite stand if we are really serious about making an Irish college of Galway at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Appointments to Chairs like engineering are not being made every day.  The value of having a definite instruction given in this Bill that the appointment of persons who are competent to discharge the duties of the post through Irish are to be made means that notice is being given to native Irish speakers in the University to prepare for vacancies that are likely to arise.  If the Dáil does not do that, there is no incentive whatever to native speakers to prepare themselves. They will feel, in some cases at any rate, that instead of a knowledge of the Irish language being an advantage it may be held to be a disadvantage, and that there will be some people who are going to classify them as third rate or second rate. As far as we are concerned, in any case, we have definitely made up our minds that it is necessary to make a stand on this question at some stage. Deputy O'Connell, I think, told us that he is a member of the Governing Body of Galway College.  Therefore we may take it that his attitude is <Col N="692" /> going to be typical of the attitude of a number of members of that Governing Body, members who, in the first instance, will be responsible for making most of those appointments. That attitude is going to leave out definitely in any decision the claims of Irish.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as far as we are concerned, our opinion is that the time has definitely come when a stand should be taken on this, and that whatever inconveniences may arise as a result of it, it will be well worth facing them on account of the results that are likely to accrue.  If we are to go weakly at this and allow the question to be shelved, as it has been in a number of other cases, then there is going to be no definite progress made.  We have heard Deputies here talking about text books as if no lectures can be delivered without text books.  Some of the best lectures that have ever been delivered have been lectures based on the individual professor's own attitude towards his subject, and it is quite possible for any person who knows Irish at the present time to deliver his lectures on technical subjects through the medium of the Irish language.  We were also told that there are no dictionaries available.  Very often students of subjects have to know foreign languages&mdash;have to make them up&mdash;in order to get certain information that is only available in those languages.  That is not going to be prevented in the future.  Where it is possible to have lectures in the Irish language, especially in University College, Galway, which is so close to the Gaeltacht, it ought to be made a definite rule that the people appointed are capable of discharging their duties through the medium of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I want the Deputy to make one thing clear in his speech which to me he did not make clear, and that is his way out.  The Deputy suggested that substitute or temporary appointments might be made. Any appointment, whether it is a temporary or substitute appointment, is an appointment, and if that <Col N="693" /> is what the Deputy suggests as a way out I maintain that the amendment is still wrong.  Perhaps the Deputy did not read the section?</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into personalities, but the term &ldquo;way out&rdquo; was used long ago in Irish politics.  I do not want to make this a matter of politics.  I am much more interested in the Irish language than that.  The term was used before I heard the term &ldquo;weigh out&rdquo; after a race.  &ldquo;Way out&rdquo; was used by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can add anything to what I said before. It seems to me that we must have belief in the governing body, for although the President and the Senate are mentioned, the governing body will make the main appointments. It is their influence will determine the appointments.  I believe the Senate has an unwritten law with respect to the governing body that, unless there is grave reason to do otherwise, the main appointments are made from a selection of three sent up by the governing body to the Senate.  I think the Senate appoints the first name on the list sent up by the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the attitude of the governing body is important in determining the future of Irish in the college.  Knowing what the attitude of the Government is, knowing the attitude of the majority in the Dáil; knowing that the college has already been more generously treated than it otherwise would have been because of the desire that it should work for the Irish language; and knowing that it is promised further support if the college will do its best in this matter, we believe that the governing body in these circumstances will decide to do the best they can, and firmly hold to the decision to do the best they can for Irish.  I am perfectly satisfied that <Col N="694" /> the governing body, in the circumstances that exist, whatever may be the opinion of individual members, will recognise that not only the interests of the country, but the interests of the college, demand that they should go ahead in this matter. From all I learn I believe we are safe in taking that point of view, that the governing body will do what it can.  If we do not believe that any inducement, any persuasion, any legislative provision will make the governing body determined to do its best, we would have to go further in order to make sure of the position than the amendment suggests.  You might force the college to leave positions vacant or appoint only Irish speakers to them, but you cannot make the governing body use its influence in the college.  A great deal will depend on matters more than mere selection.  Deputies have said there are many Professors in the college competent to lecture in Irish through Irish.  I do not know whether they have so far been encouraged to do the work through Irish.  It is important that those capable of doing work through Irish should be utilised.  I think it comes down to this: that we should try and get the right spirit into the college. It may be that different motives will actuate different people.  Some people are interested in making the college go ahead, and others will take the point of view of general interest in the movement, but we must get the people in control of the college right.  It is not much good to try to tie them up too much.</P>
    <P>I have personally given a good deal of consideration to it, because I have been approached from different angles by interested people who know the position in the College during the interval that has elapsed since the introduction of the Bill, and I have come to the conclusion that it is by a method of inducement and appeal that we can hope for progress.</P>
    <P>The alternatives that Deputy de Valera suggest would not be helpful, I think, because rather than leave a Chair vacant for a considerable <Col N="695" /> time we would probably have people appointed who were not competent in the long run.  If a candidate did not turn up who was competent in Irish and the alternative was leaving the Chair vacant, we probably would have somebody who was not very competent in the subject put in in the particular circumstances. I think that would be bad for the College and bad for the Irish language.  Deputy de Valera says that unless we adopt the amendment there will be no inducement to native speakers to specialise and prepare themselves to fill Chairs or to lecture on various subjects.  That inducement exists already.  Certain people have been appointed in the University College, Galway, for the purpose of lecturing in Irish&mdash;people perhaps who would not have been appointed otherwise, for the positions <Col N="696" /> would not be there.  I believe that will be so in the future, and that it will be additionally recognised that there is a need for people who can lecture in Irish, that people who have Irish may find that it is a very distinct advantage to them if they would specialise and prepare for these positions.  I think we can get the good effects that could be got without the amendment, and perhaps get more.  I have come to the conclusion that unless we are prepared to take over the whole College, and that the Government should appoint the Professors and have a different system altogether, it is better for us to depend on the college and have some belief that they will carry out the national policy.</P>
