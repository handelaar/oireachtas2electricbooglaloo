      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state (a) what was the total liability alleged against the defendant in the case of the Revenue Commissioners v.R.J. Duggan; (b) what sum have the Revenue Commissioners accepted in satisfaction of their claim; (c) on what grounds did the State forego the balance of claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald (for Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a)  The unpaid duty in respect of which proceedings were taken by the Revenue Commissioners against Mr. R.J. Duggan amounted to £187 1s. Od.</P>
      <P>The proceedings were not, however, taken to recover this duty, but to recover penalties for failure to pay the several amounts included in the total sum mentioned and for other offences against the law relating to the duty on bets.  The total of the penalties sued for was £42,500.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Revenue Commissioners have accepted a total penalty of £9,000, together with £187 1s. Od. in respect of duty outstanding and £650 to cover the costs of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>(c) The Revenue Commissioners were advised by their counsel and by the Attorney-General that if the cases were tried to a conclusion the total of the penalties which they would recover would not exceed £9,000.  The award of penalties would not carry an award of costs, which cannot be recovered by the State in Excise cases; nor would it involve payment of the duty outstanding. The settlement, therefore, was an advantageous one from the revenue point of view.  Furthermore, the settlement of the case obviated the piling up of a considerable bill for irrecoverable costs and the expenditure of the time over a long period of a large number of officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware of the proposed curtailment of the postal service to Sherkin Island, Baltimore, Co. Cork; whether he has taken into consideration that by this proposed cutting great hardship will be caused to the islanders, as the boat which transports the mails is the only means of communication which they possess with the mainland, and that accordingly the islanders will be marooned and unable to obtain medical attendance when required, or to make their livelihood; and whether he will see that the existing service is retained in view of the very small expense involved, the islanders being willing to call for their letters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald (for Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's information is incorrect in <Col N="1516" /> this case.  It is not intended to curtail the daily boat service to Sherkin Island.  The only alteration proposed, so far as Sherkin Island is concerned, is that delivery of correspondence to the residents will only be made on three days a week.  On the remaining non-post weekdays, their correspondence may be obtained by the residents on calling at the post office on the Island.</P>

      <P>The house of James Crowe, Gooldscross, Co. Tipperary, was searched under warrant on the 7th March, 1928.  The object of the search was to locate butter stolen on the 6th March in course of transit by rail.  The box of butter was tampered with between Cashel and Gooldscross and suspicion rested on Crowe who is a porter at the latter place.  This was the only occasion on which the house of James Crowe was searched either in this or in any previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána approached Mr. Richard Colgan, Glebe Street, Ballinrobe, merchant, and informed him that he <Col N="1517" /> would lose his licence to deal in firearms if he did not dismiss from his employment an assistant named Jas.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of a search on the 5th November last, members of the Gárda Síochána found in the possession of Jas.  Burke treasonable documents which showed clearly that he was an active member of the local Irregular organisation.  Burke was arrested and returned for trial in custody. At Castlebar Circuit Court, on the 31st January last, he refused to plead, and was found mute of malice.  He was, however, acquitted. Burke was a shop assistant employed by Mr. Richard Colgan, a registered firearms dealer.  The local superintendent approached Mr. Colgan, and informed him that, notwithstanding the acquittal, he did not consider it proper that Burke should have access to large quantities of ammunition, and if Mr. Colgan retained Burke in his employment, the superintendent would report the facts to the Minister for Justice for such action as might be considered necessary.  Mr. Colgan asked that time should be given for Burke to obtain other employment, and the superintendent agreed. Shortly afterwards, Burke secured another situation in a drapery store. I consider that the Gárda Síochána acted quite properly in the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1, which is as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before line 29, Section 2, to insert the words &ldquo;neither the expression `periodical publication' nor the word `book' shall include a journal, book, or other publication which is certified by the Board to be published bona fide for the information or instruction of members of the medical profession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is one which I promised Deputy Sir James Craig to insert in the Act in favour of the medical profession.  It omits from the category of books or periodicals that are to be censored books or periodicals of a purely medical character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>In page 2, lines 29 and 31, to delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; to and including the word &ldquo;deprave&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;suggestive of, or inciting to sexual immorality or unnatural vice or likely in any other similar way to corrupt or deprave.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> This is the definition of indecency which I think was fully argued in the House on the Committee Stage. I think it is an agreed definition.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from the fact that the number on the Board of Censors has been increased from five to nine.  The amendment enables the Board to function, notwithstanding one or two, but not more than two, vacancies.  I think that that expresses the views of the House during the earlier proceedings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 35 to 61 inclusive, and in page 4 to delete lines 1 to 6 inclusive and substitute therefor the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act to the Minister to the effect that a book or a particular edition of a book is indecent or obscene or advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement, the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Board shall consider every complaint referred to them by the Minister under this section and for the purpose of such consideration shall examine the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint and on the completion of such consideration the Board shall make to the Minister their report on such complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  When considering a complaint referred to them under this <Col N="1530" /> section the Board may have regard to all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the literary, artistic, scientific or historic merit or importance of the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint,</P>
    <P>(b)  the language in which such book or edition is printed or produced,</P>
    <P>(c)  the nature and extent of the circulation which, in the opinion of the Board, such book or edition is intended to have,</P>
    <P>(d)  the class of reader in Saorstát Eireann which, in the opinion of the Board, may reasonably be expected to read such book or edition, and</P>
    <P>(e)  any other matter relating to such book or edition which appears to the Board to be relevant.</P>
    <P>(4)  When considering a complaint referred to them under this section the Board may communicate with the author, editor, or publisher of the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such complaint and may take into account any representation made in relation to such book or edition by the author, editor, or publisher thereof.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Board may at any time make to the Minister a report in respect of any book or any particular edition of a book although no complaint in regard to such book or edition has been referred to them by the Minister, and in considering the making of a report under this sub-section in respect of a book or particular edition of a book the Board may have regard to the like matters and communicate with the like persons in relation to such book or edition as they are by this section authorised to have regard to or to communicate with when considering a complaint referred to them under this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> (6)  Whenever the Board under this section makes a report, assented to and signed by at least seven members of the Board, stating that in the opinion of the Board the book or the particular edition of a book which is the subject of such report is in its general tendency indecent or obscene and should for that reason be prohibited or that in the opinion of the Board such book or edition advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such miscarriage and should for that reason be prohibited, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a prohibition order) prohibit the sale and distribution in Saorstát Eireann of such book or of such edition of a book.</P>
    <P>(7)  A prohibition order made under this section in relation to a book shall, unless it is limited to one or more particular editions of such book, apply to every edition of such book whether published before or after the date of such order save such (if any) editions thereof as may be excluded by an amending order from the application of such prohibition order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is really a new, substituting section dealing with books and it takes the place of the old Section 6. It is very much in the terms of that section.  There is only one thing new in it and that is that it enables the Board of Censors to initiate proceedings themselves.  I undertook to insert that in Committee.  I admit that I am not very enamoured of it, because it puts the Board rather in the position of being both judges and accusers, which is not a very happy one.  I promised it as a sop to Cerebus, to try and save my Associations, but while Cerebus took the sop my Associations have gone.  It appears to be the view of the House that it should be inserted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever a complaint is duly made under this Act to the Minister to the effect that the several issues of a periodical publication recently theretofore published have usually or frequently been indecent or obscene or have advocated the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement or have devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of sensational matter relating to crime, the Minister may refer such complaint to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> (2)  The Board shall consider every complaint referred to them by the Minister under this section and for the purpose of such consideration shall examine the issues theretofore recently published of the periodical publication which is the subject of such complaint and on completion of such consideration the Board shall make to the Minister their report on such complaint.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Board under this section makes in reference to a complaint a report, assented to and signed by at least four members of the Board, stating that in the opinion of the Board the issues recently theretofore published of the periodical publication which is the subject of such complaint have usually or frequently been indecent or obscene and should for that reason be prohibited or that in the opinion of the Board such issues have advocated the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement and should for that reason be prohibited or have devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of sensational matter relating to crime, and should for that reason be prohibited, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a prohibition order) prohibit the sale and the distribution in Saorstát Eireann of any issue of such periodical publication published after the day on which such order comes into operation.</P>
    <P>(4)  A prohibition order made under this section in respect of a periodical publication in respect of which no such prohibition order has previously been made shall, unless previously revoked under this Act, continue in force for three months from the day on which it comes into operation and shall then expire.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 11, before sub-section (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister shall cause the register to be printed, published and made available to the public in such manner and at such times as he shall think proper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That amendment was suggested, I think, by Deputy Thrift on the Committee Stage, and seemed to receive general assent.  The reason for it is that it would be impossible for persons to know whether they were or were not committing an offence in selling books or having books in stock unless the Register were available for them.  They would not know that they were committing any offence in bringing books into the country unless they knew what books were actually prohibited.  I think I pointed out another reason on the Committee Stage, that where a censorship has been found necessary a list of books has always been kept.  One can see a list of the books that are not allowed into Canada or Tasmania.  The &ldquo;Index&rdquo; publishes a list of prohibited publications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments 8 and 9, which stand in my name, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 48 and 52, Section 11 (4), after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert in each line the words:&mdash;&ldquo;who shall have satisfied the Minister in manner to be prescribed by regulations that he requires to make such inspection for a <i>bona fide</i> purpose connected with the administration of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 11, to insert before sub-section (5) two new subsections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall not be lawful for any person save the person or persons duly authorised by the Minister to publish or cause to be published to any person whatsoever a copy of the register or of any entry thereon or the contents of the register.</P>
      <P>(6)  Every person who acts in contravention of the foregoing sub-section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 and in the alternative to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding six months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of these two amendments is merely to prevent the publication of prohibited lists in newspapers or to prevent newspapers from having wholesale access to the list of prohibited publications.  I think it is very undesirable that there should be published in the daily Press a list and particulars of prohibited publications.  The object of these two amendments is to provide against that.  I think it is necessary that these amendments should be inserted if we want to keep the prohibition close.</P>

      <P>I am entirely in sympathy with the object which Deputy Ruttledge has in view.  The same view was expressed on the Committee Stage by Deputy Little.  I have considered the matter very carefully since then, and I am not sure that these provisions could be carried out at all in practice, because I think you may take <Col N="1537" /> it for granted that the Press will not publish a long list of books that are simply obscene in their character, as it would be an advertisement for those books.  I think we may safely trust the Press not to do that. We have no control over the Press outside this country.  We could not prosecute the Press outside this country at all for doing it, and I do not think there is any danger of the Press of the country publishing a list of that nature.  On the other hand, I think it is very important that the Press should know, and should be able to comment upon, a decision of the Censorship Board. There should be an appeal, as it were, from the Censorship Board to the court of public opinion.  That is, if the censors have allowed in a book which should not be allowed in, I think you cannot prevent the Press from commenting on it.  On the other hand, if a book is prohibited which ought not to be prohibited, you cannot prevent the Press from commenting on that.  You must leave a good deal to the common-sense of the Press itself.  In addition to that, if a paper presses it too far it might get itself into the danger zone.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that in some particular cases the Press should have the right to criticise.  Probably the kind of book that the Press would consider it necessary to deal with, would be a book of a doubtful nature and probably for that reason it would not do very much harm.  At the same time, one has always to look at it from the point of view of the Press as a trade.  The Press has to meet severe competition, and if one paper makes a news item out of that list, which, after all, is a very interesting item, and publishes it, other papers will also publish it.  It is really in the interests of the Press to make it part of the law that they will not be allowed to publish the list in toto, and, further, I think we should have in this Act some means of protecting ourselves against the external Press publishing such a list.  If we have not got power in <Col N="1538" /> the Act, I imagine that a paper publishing, in the face of the law, such a list, could be put on the banned list.  I think it is really only fair to the public generally to let them know clearly what is the intention of the law and not to leave it as something which has to be discovered later, when someone has committed an offence against it, and to make it perfectly clear that such a list cannot be published in an Irish paper or in papers coming in.  At the same time, fair comment on some new book would be quite allowable.  After all, this particular class of legislation is very like a certain type of police work.  It is open to the Press to publish certain things at present which occur in the police courts but they usually do not do it.  It becomes even simpler for them when it is dealt with under the Act, when it is clearly laid down that they are not allowed to publish certain facts dealing with certain types of crime.  I think in this case we ought to make our stipulations as clear as we have done in the other cases.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much difference between amendments 7 and 8.  I should like to point out that amendment 9 might be taken, if carried, to make criticism of any single act of the Board of Censors, either for or against a book, impossible, because it would be impossible to criticise a book unless reference was made to the fact that a certain book had or had not been excluded.  I quite agree with the view put forward by the Minister. I think we might have confidence that the Press would act in a reasonable, rational way in reference to this publication, and would not try to make capital by publishing a general list of obscene books.</P>

      <P>While I sympathise with the point of view of Deputies Ruttledge and Little, I think we are perhaps slightly losing sight of the main purpose of the Bill.  The main purpose of it is to prevent these harmful publications coming into the country.  In order to do that you <Col N="1539" /> will have to have a widespread knowledge of what are considered to be harmful.  There are, I suppose, some 3,000 to 5,000 small newsagents all over the country.  There is also a certain number of booksellers&mdash;I am sorry to say not a very large number. The only real way by which these people will inform themselves will be by the Press.  We cannot imagine every little shop which sells a few newspapers taking in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; regularly.  Much the quicker way to get them to stop ordering these papers and to save all the trouble to the postal and customs authorities and the Gárda, that will be caused by widespread seizures, will be to inform them by the quickest and easiest machinery of what books and papers have been banned, and the quickest and easiest machinery in this respect is most certainly the Press.  All of them read some daily or weekly paper, and all of them can thus inform themselves in such a manner, and cancel their orders without delay for what is not allowed to come into the country. That being so, I think the harm that Deputy Little foresees is less than the advantage of the quick distribution of information.  The suggestion that Deputy Little has made, that you might publish part of the list and not the whole, is really no safeguard at all.  You would get round that by publishing the whole of the list and leaving out one publication, probably one with a foreign name.  You could get round it by publishing the list in a series of instalments.  I hope I am not misunderstanding the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my misunderstanding was not intentional.  I was not trying to misrepresent him.  Even so, the difficulty would still arise.  Assuming there was a pornographic paper which wished to do what <Col N="1540" /> Deputy Little feared, it might, if it chose, select one book weekly.  You could not restrain the paper from making some comment on the contents of the book.  I think, on the whole, that publicity is a greater enemy of pornography than any amount of hushing up.  What we have all feared and must fear is what one might almost call a sniggering circulation, from pocket to pocket, behind one man's back to another man, or possibly even, I am afraid, one woman to another woman, of the kind of publication we are trying to get rid of.  You must in the long run trust the people.  The best way is to let the people know what the Censorship Board considers to be harmful.  Ultimately, I think public opinion will be on your side and not on the side of the offending publication.</P>

      <P>There is another little point that has been possibly overlooked, and it is this: suppose this list is published in this country, the books will not be available in this country.  If it does any harm to any persons, it will be to persons outside the country or to persons in this country who go outside the country temporarily and who decide that they will spend whatever time they are out of the country reading indecent literature. These are a small number of persons. After all, if people are very anxious to discover what are indecent books, there is no difficulty in finding them. If you want to find them, you will find them without going to any Censorship Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Alton, that the publication of the list would be an advertisement.  An advertisement means something published in the advertising columns of a newspaper. I think if they said such and such books have been censored by the Board of Censors this week you could hardly call that an advertisement. I do not think you could satisfy a tribunal that that was an advertisement.  However, there are certain powers for making regulations under this Act.  If it turns out in practice and in working that newspapers are giving gratuitous advertisements to these books, that the way in which the Press is dealing with them is such that it is really encouraging their sale then an ad hoc regulation can no doubt be worked out to deal with the particular evil which has shown itself in working.  But I do not see how we can do anything at the moment to forestall what is a possible evil and which may never arise at all.  I ask Deputies to look at the matter in that light.</P>

      <P>With regard to what the Minister has said about encouraging sales, I should like to have the position cleared up as far as newspapers are concerned.  Assuming a newspaper gets a book to review, and that it reviewed it favourably in its columns, would that be interpreted by some legally-minded person as &ldquo;encouraging sales.&rdquo;  Many things in some of the sections of this Bill may not react as the Minister desires, and as we all desire, but the case I have in mind is the case of a newspaper asked to review a book.  If the newspaper reviews that book favourably, and afterwards if the book is put on the register of prohibited publications, how does that newspaper stand in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly safe, because it has done nothing after the book is put on the list.  If the book had been put on the list of prohibited publications first, and then the newspaper wrote a eulogistic article in favour of it, then the paper might be in danger, but if it reviewed the publication favourably and subsequently the book was put on the list of prohibited publications, the paper would not have committed any offence.</P>

      <P>With regard to this amendment, I should like to say we are all very jealous of the inviolability of the Post and the secrecy of the Post.  I would like Deputies to give more consideration to this particular section of the Bill.  Does it mean that we are going to set up another censorship in the Post Office, and the postal officials will have authority to open parcels or papers or packets addressed to people in this country?  I can see very easily that if this is passed such a practice may creep in, and it might very easily be used for political purposes.  It might be that people's correspondence would be opened.  I am not suggesting that people's correspondence would be opened by this particular Government, but rather by future Government.  I want to know how we stand as free citizens in a free country.  I feel in direct antagonism to this section.  I want to stand over the secrecy of the Post, and to feel that my correspondence as a citizen of this State is not interfered with, and that the correspondence of other citizens of this State is not interfered with.  I claim the same right for every other individual that I claim for myself.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this section and to make sure to safeguard one of the greatest privileges we enjoy&mdash;namely, the inviolability of the Post.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Anthony wishes to carry out the views that he expressed, that in all circumstances correspondence in the post should be regarded as secret, and should not be touched, then he will have to repeal the Post Office Act of 1908.  But I may inform the Deputy that it is looked upon as a serious offence to send indecent matter through the post, and any alteration of that law I would, myself, most strongly oppose.  What Section 13, as it stands, or as it would stand if the amendment were carried, does is nothing more than to apply automatically, as it were, to those prohibited publications the orders which otherwise would have to be made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or some other Minister, for the stoppage of objectionable matter going through the post.</P>
      <P>Of course a whole lot of things have to be stopped in the post.  For instance, lotteries are illegal.  Lottery tickets are stopped in the post. An order has been made that lottery tickets are to be stopped; letters addressed to persons who are known to be running private lotteries are stopped, and the money which they contain is returned to the senders. It is precisely the same way with regard to these books and publications. They will be opened and dealt with in the same manner as lottery tickets are at the present moment.  I do not see that you are opening the door widely to abuse.  I think this is simply utilising the existing procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This takes out Section 16 of the Post Office Act, 1908, from Section 18.  The reason of that is that the definition of indecent which this Act contains might not be altogether in keeping with the actual wording of that particular section.  Besides that, the words in Section 16 of the Post Office Act are very wide.  It is undesirable when you amend an Act which is part of a code like the Post Office Act of 1908 that it should be amended by a little section which might easily be passed over in an Act of this nature.  It is one of the general principles in making law easy for those who have to study the law that you should not amend very much by reference; you should amend by reference as little as <Col N="1548" /> possible.  Section 16 of the Post Office Act is quite strong enough without this definition of indecent. As a matter of fact, it would rather weaken it, because it would be arguable that under Section 16 of the Post Office Act, as regards certain of these particular types of appliances now stopped in the post as indecent articles there might be more difficulty in stopping them.  The definition of indecent is more applicable to books and periodicals, and is framed for them, but it is not so suitable for what are described in that particular section of the Post Office Act as indecent articles.</P>

      <P>For the provision of housing, Bills have been passed and moneys voted by the Oireachtas, including, under these Bills, £850,000, and £1,000,000 made available in 1922.

Of that number, 10,717 have been, or are being, erected by private persons or public utility societies, and 7,417 have been, or are being erected by public bodies.  The sum of £200,000, which it is proposed to make available by the Bill now before the House, provides for, approximately, 3,550 houses, so that with the moneys provided under this Bill the total number of houses provided since 1922 will be 21,684.

The amount of reconstruction that was done under previous measures was pretty small.  Generally speaking, the houses that it was proposed to reconstruct were situated in unsuitable or congested areas and the original form of construction did not lend itself to reconstruction. The first object of the 1924 Act was to induce the owners of tenements in Dublin or elsewhere to convert these into flats, but no material progress was made in that direction, and it is considered that the money available by the local bodies would be more satisfactorily put into new houses.  So that one of the differences between this Bill and the Bills that went before it is that reconstruction has been dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another change in the Bill is that the remission of rates by the local authorities in the case of houses built by private persons and utility societies assisted by State funds is made mandatory&mdash;that is, the partial remission of the rates for twenty years.  The third difference is that the size of the grant made available to private persons, utility societies and local authorities is reduced. With regard to the matter of the reduction of grants, the giving of State Funds to the assistance of housing arose originally because of the fact that certain classes in the community have to be assisted in some way by public funds of one kind or another if they are to be provided with sanitary houses, and so that there would not be over-crowding, with the insanitary results that arise directly from over-crowding.  An estimate was given of the number of houses required for the working classes in 1919.  I am informed that that estimate was a generous estimate because the local bodies understood that there was a large sum available for houses, and for that reason the estimate supplied by the local authorities was pretty generous.  In 1919, that estimate was altogether put at 40,000 houses.  If these houses could be provided at a cost of £300 <Col N="1550" /> per house, the total capital sum would be £12,000,000&mdash;a very considerable sum of money.  The financial aspect of the problem is so great that, apart from other reasons, the State cannot bear on its shoulders the burden of solving this particular problem, particularly where there does exist or is supposed to exist, as far as the Central Government is concerned, machinery in the local authorities which could be more adapted for the purpose.  At any rate to give very considerable State assistance to the building of houses for an indefinite period would be unduly to keep up the cost of house-building. It would, no doubt, solve the problem if that State assistance were given, but it would solve it by saddling the community with very considerable sums of debt and, as I say, it would still keep up the cost of building and, therefore, create an interference that would re-act in future years on the provision of houses to meet the ordinary wear and tear, because, there would be annually a number of houses required to be built in order to meet the normal wastage.  So that too great State assistance at the present moment would saddle us with debt and would make the cost of house building continue to be unnecessarily high.</P>
    <P>However, steady progress has been made since 1922 in the reduction of building costs.  Building costs here may fairly be compared with building costs in Great Britain, but if the house problem here is to be solved the present building costs must be reduced.  Fairly substantial reductions have taken place since 1922. That position has been assisted very much by the State.  That was done, in the first place, in 1922 by making very considerable grants towards the building of houses.  The State grants at that time were to the extent of two-thirds of the total cost of the houses.  Grants of such magnitude were only countenanced from State Funds because of the extraordinary circumstances of that time. Building operations had stopped in the country for a very substantial period.  Machinery had to be oiled <Col N="1551" /> and assisted to get into motion again.  In 1924, in order to induce the particular capital lying in the hands of private persons to fall into the building arena&mdash;in order to induce this capital in the hands of private persons to be put into building &mdash;State grants were made available to private persons to build houses. In 1925 a reduction in the amount of the grant given to private persons took place.  A further reduction is now made in the grants.  In the case of a three-roomed house, in 1924 a private person was given a grant of £60.  In 1925 he was given a grant of £45 for a three-roomed house. Under the present arrangement, it is proposed to give a State grant of £45 for a three-roomed house&mdash;same as under the Act of 1925.  The reduction in the grant under the present Bill is in respect of the larger class of house.</P>
    <P>However, by suitable withdrawing of the amount of State grants given to private persons, we are getting down to a normal situation.  We are passing to the normal stage when we take it that State grants will not be made available to private persons building at all, but the reduction is being made in such a gradual way that, having assisted private capital to flow into housing, private capital will still flow into housing without any great jar by the stoppage of State grants to private persons just at this particular time.  A very substantial contribution, too, has been made to the reduction of housing costs by the work that has been done in arriving at the most economical type of house.  Much work has been done by the Local Government Department. In the first place, they made a very careful examination, particularly in respect of the local authorities, to see that the most economical use is made of the site. The design, secondly, is very fully examined to see that all unnecessary and uneconomic factors have been eliminated.  In the same way, on the form of construction, thickness of walls, windows and roofing, a considerable amount of thought has been <Col N="1552" /> brought to bear in the Department, so that to private persons or local authorities building the greatest possible amount of advice is given so that unnecessary expenditure be eliminated in this matter.  In the same way, a considerable amount of elimination of expenses in connection with professional fees has been brought about.  These are the contributions of the State to the reduction of costs in housing.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the position of the private person, under the measure that is before us now, normally, the public purse ought not to be opened to assist private persons to build houses.  There is a definite difference between the communal responsibility for helping in the provision of houses for the poor and the responsibility that exists, or may exist, communally in respect of the provision of houses for the non-poor.  There are very strong grounds why, with the problem that is before us, such public monies as are available should be devoted exclusively to assisting the building of houses for the poor, but such is the state of the building trade at present, after the period in which building practically stopped in the country, that the trade is only now getting on its feet; such is the position with regard to the amount of capital that can be made available for housing generally that it is considered still desirable, to entice private capital to come into housing, to assist private persons.</P>
    <P>Under the 1924 Act, a private person building a three-roomed house got £60; building a four-roomed house, he got £80, and for a five-roomed house he got £100.  Under the 1925 Act, that was reduced so that the £60 for a three-roomed house became £45, the £80 for a four-roomed house became £60, and the £100 for a five-roomed house became £75.  What is proposed now is that a flat payment of £45 will be made to a private person building a house whether it is a five-roomed, a four-roomed or a three-roomed one, once it comes within the space area laid down in the regulations prepared <Col N="1553" /> by the Local Government Housing Department.  There is a flat grant of £45, plus a remission of a certain amount of rates for twenty years.  As far as the remission of rates goes, in a rural district with a house of £6 valuation, where the rates are 10/-, the grant as given to a private person through a reduction of rates alone, is £21.  If we add to the £21, being the present value of that reduction, the £45 grant which he gets, that is £66 in all.  £66, then, of grants or assistance from public monies is 15.2 per cent. of £400, if the house built is a £400 house.</P>
    <P>In the case of a town area, if your valuation is £10, and the rates £15, the value of the remission of rates from the local authority would be £52 10s. to that type of house&mdash;a £10 valuation house in an urban district. Take a city area, where a house is being built by private persons at a cost of £1,000.  The valuation is £28 and the rates 15/-; the value of the assistance from the local authorities towards the building of that house is £147.  Adding to that, £45, the State grant, such a person building a £1,000 house is assisted to the extent of 19.2 per cent. of the cost.  In spite of the reduction to 45 per cent. for a private person, very substantial assistance is being given under the present Bill both from the State and from the local authorities to private persons building houses.</P>
    <P>In the case of public utility societies, they have been in receipt of the same amount of grants as local authorities&mdash;that is, for a five-roomed house, £100; for a four-roomed house, £80, and for a three-roomed house, £60.  It is now proposed that a flat grant of £60 be given to public utility societies, the same as local authorities.  The idea in giving greater assistance to public utility societies is in the first place because the formation of public utility societies helps to strengthen private persons who join these societies and get their houses built through them.  It is, perhaps, more easy to get credit and to get houses built at a reduced cost when a <Col N="1554" /> number are being built together.  Just as it was possible at one particular time to get industrialists to build houses for their own workers, it is felt that the fostering of public utility societies may, at a time when industrialists are not apparently prepared to do anything in the way of building houses for their own workers, give other industrialists or local authorities&mdash;who, for one reason or another, do not want to engage directly to too great an extent in providing houses for the working classes&mdash;machinery by the operation of which they may do a considerable amount to meet the housing shortage.</P>
    <P>Now, in the case of local authorities, the grants available to them were £100 for a five-roomed house; £80 for a four-roomed house, and £60 for a three-roomed house.  It is now proposed to reduce those grants to a flat grant of £60.  One of the outstanding reasons for the reduction of these grants generally is that there is a limited amount of money available for this particular class of work. Such money as was put into building plans up to this was put in in the way it was put in because of the special circumstances with regard to the building trade, and with regard to the availability of capital.  There have been complaints then on all sides that the class of houses being built has not been a class that has been satisfying the main and the important need.  That has been recognised all along by the Executive Council, but the stimulation of the building trade was only possible, in our opinion, in the way in which that stimulation took place.  Owing to the stimulation of the trade, the reduction in building costs and the facts that the trade was, to some extent, put on its feet again, we are now getting into a position in which we can divert the monies available to a greater extent for the provision of the class of houses that will suit the lesser-paid workmen and meet the need that is most crying for houses. Therefore, the reduction of the present grants to local authorities, while being, to some extent, measured <Col N="1555" /> by the reduction of costs in building, is also intended to induce local authorities to concentrate on, say, the four-roomed house, so as to meet the very special need of the lesserpaid working classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the costs on which these reductions were based, in May, 1926, in respect of a scheme of 104 five-roomed houses in the city of Dublin, the cost per square foot was 12s. 7½d.  In September, 1928, approximately two years later, in respect of the same class of house, the cost per square foot was 10s. 9d. You have a reduction of 14.6 per cent., involving a reduction in the total cost of that class of house, which was 844 square feet, of £77 7s. 4d.  As far as the reduction in the grants now is concerned, there is a reduction of £40 as compared with that reduction of £77 7s. 4d. In Cork, in May, 1926, in connection with a scheme of 148 houses, of which 18 were five roomed houses, the square foot measurement of the houses being 896, the cost per square foot was 12s. 9d.  Two years later, in May, 1928, in connection with 152 houses, of which 16 were five roomed houses, the cost per square foot was 9s. 6d., a total reduction of 25.5 per cent., or a reduction in the building cost of a house of that particular kind of £145.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether that was due to the fact that it was an English contractor who built these houses?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of facts in so far as building costs are concerned.  I do not want to deal with the manner in which these facts actually came about. But actually, between May, 1926, and May, 1928, in Cork there was a reduction in building costs of 25.5 per cent., involving a reduction in the cost of a five-roomed house of £145.  The present State reduction is £40 as against the reduction in Cork of £145.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a four-roomed house in Cork the reduction between May, 1926, and May, 1928, was from 13s. 2d. per square foot to 9s. per <Col N="1556" /> square foot, a reduction of 29.1 per cent. of the total cost, involving a saving of £134 on a four-roomed house.  The State reduction in this case is £20 as against that reduction in Cork of £134.  In Limerick in April, 1927, where a scheme of 14 four-roomed houses was carried out, the cost per square foot was 13s.; in April, 1928, one year later, it was 11s. 8d., being a reduction of 10.2 per cent., or a total reduction in costs in the case of a four-roomed house of a reduced standard, of £38 6s. 8d.  The reduction in the grant to Limerick under this particular Bill, in respect of houses of this class, is £10 as compared with a £38 reduction in the year I mentioned. In the case of Tuam the cost per square foot, in respect of a number of houses there, was reduced between October, 1927, when it was 9s. 2½d. per square foot to 8s. 3d. in January, 1929, or a total reduction of £27 10s. 7d. in the case of a reduced standard four-roomed house. Under the present provision in regard to grants to local authorities, the reduction is £10 as against a reduction of £27 10s. 7d. in respect of the building cost of the houses.</P>
    <P>There have been definite and substantial reductions in the cost of material in the same period.  There has been a considerable amount of demand that local authorities should be given loans from the Local Loans Fund on fairly long terms if they are going to be expected to make good the housing shortage for the working classes that exists.  For many reasons, it is not proposed to open the Local Loans Fund at present to give assistance to local authorities in this particular way.  The first is the price of money at the present time, taken into consideration with the cost of house building.  If, simply because they were assisted by State grants, local authorities plunged in any way into housing at the present time, with the cost of housing what it is, and the cost of money what it is, we feel they would be unnecessarily saddling themselves with a debt that could easily be avoided, and that they would be helping to keep up the building <Col N="1557" /> costs to a point to which building costs ought not to be kept up.</P>
    <P>There is another point that helps us to come to that conclusion; it is the very small extent to which local authorities are prepared to cooperate in meeting the cost of providing houses that are necessary in their areas.  If the wants of local authorities in the matter of house shortage are to be satisfied, then we want a very thorough examination of the situation locally.  If the State were to shoulder in any large way the cost of making good the house shortage, then wants would be magnified; there would be carelessness in the matter of pressing down building costs, and there would be a want of responsibility in the matter that we hope will not be there when local authorities are brought to shoulder, in the way in which we feel they ought, the responsibility of helping in this important matter.  We have seen cases in which local authorities when, say, dealing with grants out of their road funds, wanted to pay the workers higher wages out of monies received from central sources than the wages they were prepared to pay to their own employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want the local authorities to be fully satisfied, satisfied economically, and not unnecessarily to keep up the cost of <Col N="1558" /> building or place a heavy debt on the taxpayer or ratepayer, the local position must be fully put under the microscope.  Housing shortage has spread from one end of the country to the other.  The position of every urban district must be put under the microscope if the real wants of any particular town are to be met in the matter of housing.  The economic position of the town, whether it has declined or grown; the position of the workers from the point of view of rent capacity, the possibility of getting low building costs by the machinery available in the town&mdash; all these things require the greatest possible scrutiny, and that scrutiny must be done by local representatives. I suggest to Deputies that we have not seen as much of that careful scrutiny and responsibility in outlook on the part of local authorities in the matter of housing as we want to see, and which we must see, if we are going to get the credit facilities which must be available if this problem is going to be tackled.  Having got those facilities in the proper way, we are not going to build up towns that are in a state of change for the worse and leave unassisted towns which are spreading because of economic forces and which require to be assisted in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at one particular aspect of that, it will be seen.  I think, that some houses&mdash;four-roomed, reduced standard houses&mdash; were provided in Tuam at an all-in cost of £359.  Take the case of Tipperary Town.  In 1919, it was estimated that 514 houses were required. Since then 48 houses have been built.  Let us say that 450 houses are required in Tipperary and that it is possible to get four-roomed reduced standard houses at a cost of £300.  The economic rent would be 9/4½ if the money were available for 35 years at 5¼ per cent. If the tenant was able to pay that economic rent, there would be no necessity for a State grant or subsidy. If we want to give houses to tenants at 5/- a week the yearly loss would be £11 7s. 6d.  If 450 houses <Col N="1559" /> were built, the yearly loss would be £5,118 15s. 0d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that it would cost £300 each to build 400 houses?  It would work out more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking a case which cost even £300.  If you build 450 at £300 each, and if you are going to rent them at 5/- a week, the annual loss will be £5,118 15s. A penny in the £ in Tipperary produces £48 7s. 3d., and the total loss to the rates can be made up by the payment of a rate of 8/10.  That will give you, in Tipperary, without grants from anyone, 450 houses, costing £300 each, at a rent of 5/- per week, the tenant also paying the rates.  I think Deputy Corish suggested that they could be built for less than £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>For every £10 reduction in the cost of the houses, there can be a reduction of 6½d. on that rate of 8/10, and for every 6d. in rent that you get over 5/-, there can be a reduction in the rate of 1/-. A Commissioner was appointed in Tipperary three years ago.  In his three-year tenure of office, he reduced the rates by 3/6 in the £.  The wastage which there had been in administration would, if put into houses, provide 185 houses, even if they cost £300 each and were rented at 5/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister assuming that because the Commissioner succeeded in reducing the rates, the rate previously enforced was due to the fact that money was wasted by the Council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that explains the Minister's attitude towards housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take the case of Ennis.  In the course of three years, the Commissioner reduced the rates from 16/- to 10/-, or 6/- in three years.  That tidying-up there, that <Col N="1560" /> 6/- in the rates had not, perhaps, been spent in any particular way.  It went in odd pieces of maladministration here and there.  Supposing houses are going to cost £300 each and are going to be rented at 5/- a week, and also that Ennis required 450 houses, that 6/- in the £ reduction in rates would provide 270 houses.  Local authorities must, therefore, stand over their problem and examine it if there is going to be a sound basis of credit on which to solve the housing question.  In the same way, money that is being spent in this particular way locally in inefficient administration has to be looked at.  We have to see whether, without cost to the ratepayers and without much more expense than 6/- in the £, the housing wants of urban authorities cannot be provided, without the expense falling on the State at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the matter were made a local authority responsibility entirely, the position would be faced in a much more responsible way, and we could get down much more to what the real requirements are and how these requirements should be provided. In the meantime, as I say, because of the cost of housing, the cost of money, and because of the fact that we want local authorities more thoroughly to examine the problem that lies before them, it is not thought opportune or possible to open the Local Loans Fund to local authorities to meet their housing costs at present.  When you compare the reduction that has taken place in the cost of housing within the last two or three years with the amount of the reduction we are making, and the fact that we desire local authorities to build smaller houses than they have been building up to the present, it seems to me that the present Bill ought not to stop in any way the activity of local authorities. As far as Dublin, Cork and other cities are concerned, they can raise their own money, and have been raising their own money.  There is nothing at all to prevent these places from going fully ahead.  It will be seen in the case of Cork and in the <Col N="1561" /> case of Dublin that the reduction that has taken place in house building is very much greater than the reduction in the grants that have been made in respect of these places.  I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have thought from the speech, or at least, from the length of the speech, made by the Minister that at long last we had got what we have been promised for the last four or five years, the Government's full and comprehensive policy for dealing with the problem of housing, instead of having before us a Bill which is a step back in every way.  The Minister, realising, I suppose, that he had a bad Bill to put before the House, thought it necessary to give to the House a lot of figures, some of which may be of some use to the House but most of which, in my opinion, are of no use whatever.  Of course, like the solicitor in the Petty Sessions Court who has a bad case, he resorted to the old trick of abusing those whom, apparently, he looks upon as rivals, but who should be his friends&mdash;the local authorities. Most of the Minister's speech, particularly the latter part of it, was directed towards the inefficiency of local authorities.  So far as I could gather, the test in the Minister's mind of efficiency in local authorities is the lowest possible rate. Apparently that is the reason why we have reductions taking place nationally, such as have been shown to us in the Estimates for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, this is a very disappointing Bill.  It is a Bill which will put a premium on the building of three-roomed houses, houses that should not be built in this country and in which families cannot be maintained as they should be maintained. I know that I shall be met with the reply that a three-roomed house is better than one room in a tenement in Dublin or in Cork.  I agree, and so far as I am personally concerned, I want to see houses built three, four, five, or six-roomed houses, but I suggest it is not desirable that we should aim at building <Col N="1562" /> three-roomed houses in this country. If you have cannibals, for instance, you will not cure the position by making them semi-cannibals, if there could be such a thing.  That is what the Minister suggests.  The effect of this Bill will be that people who are anxious to get grants will build a three-roomed house and will get their £45 just the same as if they built a four or a five-roomed house.  There may be something to be said for that in so far as it affects the City of Dublin, and in the absence of something better I would be prepared to give assistance and approval to a large scheme for building three-roomed houses in the suburbs of Dublin if by doing so we could get people out of the tenements but only as a temporary measure.  We have heard a lot of talk about local authorities. I want to say to the Minister, if he does not know it, as one who has had a little experience, that if there is one matter in which local authorities all over the country are intensely interested and to which they devote most of their time, it is this question of housing.  I want to say that it is not fair and it is not right that the Minister should try to blame local authorities for not making more progress in the building of houses.  They are not in a position to do it, and the Minister knows that quite well. You cannot build houses if banks will not lend you money for a period longer than ten years, and the Minister knows that.  It seems to me that where the Minister makes a great mistake in this matter&mdash;and that is borne out in his speech&mdash;is that he and his Department are looking at this question of housing as a local and not as a national question.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned here we say it is not a local question and we say it cannot be solved by local authorities no matter how efficient they may be or how hard they may work.  At the same time it is the duty of the State to supply that housing deficiency and to help to meet that deficiency, if we are going, as the Minister suggested we are going, to arrive at a normal state of affairs.  If we were at normal, I <Col N="1563" /> agree it would be the policy and the duty of the local authorities to maintain the supply of houses.  The Minister gave us some very interesting figures regarding reductions in the cost for a couple of years.  I think those figures would be even more interesting if the Minister had indicated how the reductions came about, what was responsible for the reduction and I would have been very interested to hear from the Minister what was responsible for the very substantial reduction in Cork city in two years.  It seems to me that this Bill if passed&mdash;and I suppose in the absence of a better one we will have to agree to it with whatever amendments we can induce the Minister to accept&mdash;will be of very little use outside the city of Dublin and the city of Cork.  It will be of practically no use whatever to local authorities. I do not believe that local authorities can possibly take advantage of this Bill.  It will not be of much use in the rural areas, because the person building a house there does not want to build a three-roomed house.  Most houses which have been built under the previous Acts and the Principal Act have been four and five-roomed houses.  I would very much prefer that the Minister would give £45, as is in the Bill, for a three-roomed house and £60 or £70 for a four-roomed house, even if he only gave the same amount for the four-roomed and the five-roomed house; I think it is very desirable that there should be a substantial increase on the amount granted for a three-roomed house, so as to induce people to build a better type of house than a three-roomed house.  If that were done, I believe you would get those houses built.</P>
    <P>There is another flaw in the Bill, which was also in previous Acts, that the Minister has withdrawn the grants formerly given for the reconstruction of houses.  That is another step in the wrong direction, because these grants were availed of to a considerable extent.  So long as they were being availed of, houses which were useless were <Col N="1564" /> being put in a condition in which they could be used by people to live in, and I think the Minister might have continued the grants.</P>
    <P>To come back to the general question.  In 1922, the Provisional Government raised a loan of £1,000,000; it was one of their first Acts, and that money was given to local authorities for housing.  That was the first effective and, I might say, the only really effective step taken by the present Government with regard to the building of houses.  I am not suggesting that that grant got more houses built for them than they got subsequently built, but it was the first time that they showed they had an appreciation of the great necessity for houses.</P>

      <P>The only time if you like.  If the Minister will allow me, I am coming to another point. I know the complaint I am going to make will be quite familiar to him, because we have to make it not only in respect of houses, but in respect of many other things.  Since 1924 we have been told year after year that the Government had a big Housing Bill on the stocks, that it was in course of preparation, and that it would be before the Dáil any day.  Then we were told by the Minister for Finance, I think, in his Budget speech of last year or the year before, that the Local Loans Fund would be opened up for housing, that local authorities would get long-term loans, and that, incidentally, the unemployment problem would be solved.  To-day we are told, according to the reasoning, if you can call it reasoning, of the Minister for Local Government, that the Local Loans Fund will not be opened for that purpose, nor will the Government's comprehensive housing policy be produced until building costs are back at the prewar figure, until wages are brought down to the figure which appeals to the Department of Local Government&mdash;27/11 for a broken week. The Minister referred to that in the <Col N="1565" /> course of his speech, and told us that we were faced with public bodies that wanted to pay more wages out of the grant than they were prepared to pay out of the rates.  I should like to ask the Minister if he can tell us where that happened.  I could give him the names of many councils, in fact nearly all county councils and urban councils are paying considerably more out of the rates by way of wages than his Department allowed them to pay out of the grant.  When they wanted to bring the wages paid out of the grant up to the wages paid out of the rates, the Department refused to allow them.  The Minister knows that quite well.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather from the Minister's speech, the position is this: the Government have been telling us that they are not going to do any more than they have been doing to encourage the provision of houses because of the high costs of building; that they were not prepared to do any more until costs came down substantially. But now that the cost of building, according to the Minister himself, has come down, he presents us with this Bill and tells us they are prepared to do much less now than they were prepared to do five or six years ago.  If this is the only contribution we are to have from the State for providing houses, then the 40,000 shortage will not be made up not only in the lifetime of the present Government but in the lifetime of any Deputy, and the only way in which I can imagine the housing problem eventually being solved is that emigration will make the population so small that in time the existing houses will be sufficient to meet the needs of the depleted population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of one mind with Deputy Morrissey in his description of the Bill as a most unsatisfactory one.  I do not think that anybody seriously interested in this very pressing and grave problem could see anything in the Bill that could give any hope, as Deputy Morrissey said, that in the lifetime of any Deputy a solution would be found for this grave problem.  It is, to my <Col N="1566" /> mind, postponing a solution to Tibb's Eve.  It is certainly disabusing anybody's mind of any hope that may have lingered there as a result of the pronouncements made in this House and outside at different times by Ministers as to what was going to be done by the Dáil at an early date to bring the housing shortage to an end.  The Bill is merely trifling with an issue that is too grave to be trifled with. The Minister told us that 18,134 houses had been or are being built as a result of grants made under the various Acts since the Principal Act was introduced.</P>
      <P>It was last October, I think, that the President, in moving the Second Reading of the 1928 Bill, told us that the total number of houses erected, or in course of erection, under these various Acts of 1922, 1924, 1925, 1926, was about 14,000, and he said the Bill he was then speaking to would provide for an additional 2,500 houses, making 16,500 new houses in all to be built, or in the course of being built, since 1922. The Minister to-day tells us that 18,134 houses have been built, or are being built.  There seems to be a discrepancy in the figures given by the President last October and the figures given by the Minister for Local Government to-day.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinterpreting two sets of figures.  The figures mentioned by the Minister for Local Government exhaust the total grant, including those on the stocks at the moment.  That would mean dealing with the houses constructed or in the course of construction, those up to and including the 1st April of this year.  That is the figure of 18,134.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter very much, but there is a discrepancy somewhere in the figure.  This Bill, we are told, will provide for an additional 3,500 houses.  I hope that 3,500 houses will be built as a result of the Bill, but I have grave doubts about it.  As Deputy Morrissey said, the local authorities will find it difficult, if it is at all possible, to raise money to build houses.  It may be done in Dublin and Cork, but in few other places will it be possible, if in any other place, to raise money to provide the additional sums that will be required to build houses with the grants now offered.</P>
      <P>On the figures as given to us by the President last October, I have calculated that in the last seven years an average of 3,357 houses have been built.  On that figure, it would take another 20 years at least before the 60,000 houses estimated some years ago as required for the whole of the Free State would be built, and that is not taking into account any increase that may naturally arise in the demand for houses over the period of 20 years. Twenty years may not seem a long time to take to solve such a problem, but, in my opinion, it is too long. To put it at a moderate figure, it is 10 years too long.  Even taking the state of the finances of the Free State at the present moment into account, in my considered judgment, it is certainly 10 years too long to take to build the houses necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody in the country, taxpayer and ratepayer, who has any idea of the seriousness of this problem, would agree, seeing the problem is so urgent, that we would be doing a good thing for the country as a whole in bringing forward proposals here to end that problem perhaps in 5 years and using the money of the State to do it.  This Bill makes available a sum of £200,000. That will not go very far in helping to solve the problem, and £50,000 along with it would be required, at least, in the next five years in Dublin <Col N="1568" /> city alone, to do anything like what would be adequate to meet the need of the next five years, at any rate, for housing the working classes and the poorer classes in Dublin.  We would want at least a quarter of a million for the next five years available for the city of Dublin in order in any way adequately to tackle the problem before the citizens of the capital.  In my opinion, the Free State Government has neglected and shamefully neglected the city of Dublin so far as the question of housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was reading the other day a report which I have here of a gentleman who was then&mdash;I do not know what he is now&mdash;Chief Engineer of the Local Government Board, Mr. P.C. Cowan.  In that Report, published in 1918, presented to the Local Government Board, and published and sent down to the Dublin Corporation, this gentleman, who is an expert, said that Dublin city then required 16,500 houses and, in addition, that 13,000 existing houses should be reconditioned or rebuilt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

I have not got any words of his own with regard to the housing needs of that time.  I have not looked for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Cowan estimated that all that would be necessary if the poor of the city of Dublin were to be decently housed. Now, the number of houses built in the city of Dublin, both by the old Municipal Council and by their successors in the eleven years since 1918 numbered 3,214 out of 29,500 that were stated to be necessary by the then Chief Engineering Inspector <Col N="1569" /> of the Local Government Board. That will give those of you who are not already aware of it some little idea of what the housing situation in the city of Dublin is, and Dublin is seriously increasing its population, especially its poorer population, since 1918.  These 3,214 houses have been built at the rate of 420 a year; that is, in the last seven years they have been built at the rate of 420 houses a year.  I have a list somewhere here of the number of houses that have been built each year in the city of Dublin by the municipal authorities.  Judging by this Bill, the Minister is satisfied that notwithstanding the grave and urgent need there is for houses in Dublin without at all going outside Dublin&mdash;and the problem is almost as serious in Cork, Limerick and other places as it is in the city of Dublin&mdash;that 420 houses a year are sufficient to provide for the needs of the population of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At that rate, providing houses for Dublin City alone would take 60 years, and that would not take any account of such increase as might take place in the population of Dublin during that period.  I do not know who it was who estimated some few years ago that 60,000 houses were necessary in the Free State.  I came across that figure somewhere.  I have never been able to trace it.  It may be a slight exaggeration or it may be an underestimate. At any rate, I think 50,000 would not be an over-estimate of the number of houses that would be required to house the people of the Free State.  Taking into account the houses that have been built or that are being built as a result of the grants that have been already made under different Acts here, I believe, remembering the need there is for housing, that the State would be only doing its bare duty by providing grants at a much higher rate than is at present proposed in order to enable the 30,000 houses that I estimate, at any rate, would be required to be built during the course <Col N="1570" /> of the next five years.  If such a number as 30,000 houses were built in the next five years I do not think that that would solve the problem, but I believe that a solution would then be in sight.</P>
      <P>I believe that if that problem is to be settled it must be tackled in some big way like that, and this House must face it.  It is a very urgent and pressing problem&mdash;one of the biggest problems with which the Dáil and Government are faced. The Government is not facing it. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, frequent promises were made in recent years that this matter of housing would get serious consideration. We were told that the Bills were on the stocks and that experts were working on them.  We were told that a big Bill would shortly find its way into this House, a Bill which would face the problem in a national way and which would put forward a reasoned contribution towards the settlement of this question.  That may come some day, but judging by the speech of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health it will not be in our time.  The Minister has flatly turned down any suggestion that this problem ought to be treated as a national problem. He is trampling on any hopes that may have existed in the minds of anybody that the Government were going to face this problem in a big way and provide the money for the work out of the national treasury. I believe it is in that way the Government ought to provide the money.  It should provide it at a much more generous rate than is set out in this Bill here in order to help to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there are difficulties in the way and one of these difficulties is the cost of building.  It is said that the higher cost of building seems to be shared equally between the building contractors and the ordinary operatives.  That is a matter that I have not investigated.  I do not know on which side the responsibility lies.  I do agree that the cost is high.  I agree that that is so if we compare the cost to-day with the <Col N="1571" /> pre-war cost.  If the Minister's figures showing a reduction in the cost are correct, that is very satisfactory, and it is one of the things that will help in the solution of the problem. I think that another way should be found of lowering the cost and of speeding up the rate of building, and of bringing in, say, five years' time, the question within measurable distance of a solution. That way, to my mind, would be by the Free State Government taking its courage in its hands and telling the people of the country how urgent and pressing this problem is; telling them the necessity for its early solution and of the need for the setting up of a housing authority, a Board or Committee, call it what you will, and providing that authority with funds so as to enable it to give grants, say, at the rate of £100 a house for a four-roomed house.  I would urge also grants for three-roomed houses, because there are small families in the country. There are certainly small families in Dublin who are living in one room, and they would be better off in a small house, say a three-roomed house, than in one large room in a tenement.  It is agreed, of course, that three-roomed houses are not the best type of houses for people where the families are fairly large.</P>
    <P>I think the Government should take its courage in its hands, face the problem and find the money.  They had that matter in mind at one time evidently, because some time ago they promised a £15,000,000 scheme. I am glad Deputy Rice is here.  He will tell us about that scheme and what happened to it in the course of the last twelve months.  He said eleven months ago that the Government were considering a scheme which was going to cost £15,000,000, and that this scheme was going to solve the housing problem.  I had better quote his own words. Deputy Rice, who was Chairman of the Committee, said: &ldquo;With regard to the report of the Unemployment Committee, they recommended that the Government <Col N="1572" /> should undertake a continuous housing programme at a cost of £15,000,000 spread over ten years. That was a definite problem.&rdquo;  Here is the relatively more important part of the statement: &ldquo;The Government have given an undertaking to me that they would take up this great programme the moment this election was over.&rdquo;  Of course, provided he was elected, but he has been here for the last eleven months and what has become of the great programme, the great housing scheme that was to cost £15,000,000?</P>

When he did talk he talked in a reasonable way, and he told you that you let down the poor.  &ldquo;The Government have given an undertaking to me that they would take up this great programme the moment the election was over.&rdquo;  We have had another election since, and at that election similar promises were made, or at least promises in somewhat similar terms.  Of course a burnt child dreads the fire, and any statements that were made were made in a <Col N="1573" /> general way about all that they would do for housing.  Probably twelve months hence Deputy O'Higgins will be in the same unfortunate position that Deputy Rice now is in, of having to stand over statements of that kind and not be able to produce the goods.  Deputy Rice talked of the £15,000,000 scheme, and he said that the Government promised him that they would undertake a big programme. Whoever gave him the undertaking must have had a £15,000,000 scheme in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government were men of courage, and if they had an interest in the poor of the Free State or the poor of Dublin to whom they were addressing those remarks eleven months ago, they would have made some serious effort to bring forward a Bill to meet the problem.  Instead of that they bring in a Bill for a paltry £200,000.  That will go a very small way towards erecting the 30,000 houses that are necessary in order to house the poor of the Twenty-six Counties.  That is not good enough.  It is a most miserable spirit and it is not the spirit in which to tackle this great problem. It is not the way in which it should be tackled.  I suggest to the Government that within the next five years they should raise a sum of £2,600,000 a year.  That would be £13,000,000 in five years.  Of that amount they should give one-fourth, £3,250,000 or thereabouts, in grants.  That would be £650,000 a year.  I know, and I think every Deputy here knows, where £650,000 could be saved without grave disadvantage to the country.  The Minister for Local Government talked of inefficiency and maladministration amongst local authorities.  He showed where money could be saved by the local authorities in order to build houses.  There may be some, and no doubt there is and there has been maladministration amongst local authorities here and there, but I do not think you would find in the history of any local authority in Ireland a greater waste of money than has gone on in the last seven years here or that you <Col N="1574" /> will find going on in various Government Departments to-day.  I am satisfied that if any Deputy here, who takes the housing problem seriously, were given power he could, out of the amount annually expended by the Dáil, save £650,000 a year, and in that way could provide grants that would in five years help to erect 30,000 houses, the minimum number necessary.  Until something of that kind is done, until a national authority set up for that purpose is given charge of this question of housing, you will be simply nibbling at it as the Minister proposes to continue to do by this Bill; you will be nibbling at the problem until Tibb's Eve and we will be going from bad to worse.  In fact, Dublin is going from bad to worse although there has been a certain amount of building done in the city.</P>
    <P>A great many Deputies here know Dublin as well as I do, but I can say from some recent experiences that I doubt if ever the housing conditions were worse than they are in some places.  Even within a stone's throw of this very building you will get housing conditions of the worst type, and you will find families of four, five and six living under conditions that would be a disgrace or a shame to any Christian country or any Government. This is not a trifling matter.  I know it is a difficult and a hard thing to get money, and perhaps the cost of housing to-day is greater than before the war.  But the problem is even more urgent now than before the war, especially in Dublin. In the northern and southern portions of the City there are conditions existing which are not due, perhaps, to housing alone but to poverty.  Outside the City, where there are families in a position to pay a reasonable rent, they cannot get houses and they are living in conditions that would be a disgrace to savages.  The people themselves, thank God, are decent, good-living people, and the things that might happen do not happen, but it is not due to those in charge of the housing that those things do not happen.  It is <Col N="1575" /> not due to those on whom the responsibility of Government lies; it is not due to those whose duty it is to remedy these evils that these things do not happen.</P>
    <P>I urge that this Bill be reconsidered and that the Government take their courage in their hands and provide money without increasing the estimates that have been introduced.  If authority were given to a small Committee of this House to go through the estimates, money could be found.  The Minister said that money could be saved under the local authorities.  That may be so.  No doubt it can be saved in places where money is loosely spent.  Money is loosely spent here and money could be found to do as I suggest&mdash;to build 30,000 four-roomed or five-roomed houses inside the next five years.  That would do something to end the problem.  It would not end it completely, but the end would then be in sight.  I do not agree with the Minister when he says the State cannot bear the burden of solving this problem.  I think it is the State's primary duty to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>The poor of the country are in such a state and the problem is so urgent that in no other way will a solution be found.  If you wait for private contractors to build houses for the really poor who need them in each city, town and village and in rural parts of Ireland, you will wait a long time, because it is not an economic proposition.  Therefore, it is a job for the Government and the nation, and the nation will have to bear the cost of it.  I would be prepared to go so far as to suggest that a State housing authority should be set up.  I look on the problem as so serious that I suggest such an authority should be established.  Not alone do I suggest that the burden ought to be borne by this authority, be it a State housing authority, a Board or a Committee, but I would authorise the Board to do the work, if necessary, by direct labour.  Deputy Good will not like that, I know.</P>

      <P>I am sure you do not. I doubt if Deputy Good or any other citizen of Dublin will see a solution of the problem on the lines laid down by the proposer of the Bill.  I would certainly go so far as to give authority to that Board when it is set up to do the work by direct labour, if necessary.  I would even go further and authorise them to take control of and erect factories so as to provide materials for building, say cement factories, saw-mills, ironworks and foundries.  I would do that, believing that we would do better for our poor citizens by speeding up the building of houses.  This appears to me, at any rate, to be the urgent problem at the moment, and in no other way can it be solved than by some big effort on these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could induce contractors and the public utility societies as a result of the increased grants, I would propose, if I had my way, that increased grants should be given.  If we could get a guarantee from contractors and public utility societies that the necessary number of houses would be built in that time by giving, say, £100 a house for four-roomed houses and £120 or thereabouts for five-roomed or six-roomed houses, then it might not be necessary for the housing authorities that I would give the power to to do the work by direct labour, but unless I could get a guarantee that the work would be done and that 30,000 houses would be built in five years, I would set up such a housing authority and get experts, both contractors and workmen representing both sides and people who do not belong to either side, on such a Committee. I think I would be able inside Dublin itself within a brief time to select a number of men provided <Col N="1577" /> they be given the money necessary to be able to do the job inside five years.  I believe it can be done by a Government that has all the material in its control.  It has certainly credit enough, I think, to raise £13,000,000 in five years and to put that money to the building of the number of houses necessary.  If, as I think can be done by a building authority of that kind, that number of houses could be built, surely a Government ought to be able to do it.  They have already at their disposal professional men who are expert in that kind of work.  I am sure there are many employed by the Department of Local Government. There are inspectors that go around to examine into housing schemes.  Some of them&mdash;I do not know any of them&mdash;I imagine, have been long years in the employment of the Government and ought to have had very considerable experience in that time.  They should be able to produce&mdash;probably they produced before now&mdash;designs for housing that would be satisfactory and they would be able to see that the work was properly done.</P>
    <P>I do not know, if the big 30,000 scheme were launched, whether you would have enough professional men to superintend it, but they can be got.  If the Local Government Department or the Board of Works or both combined have not got them, there are plenty of men outside who would be available for such work.  I believe there are plenty of workmen also idle.  In the 1918 Report of Mr. Cowan, he said in his opinion 1,600 houses could easily be built in Dublin in a year.  Now, as far as local authorities are concerned, there are only 420 houses a year being built in Dublin in the last seven years. Therefore there must be a considerable number of men connected with the building trades unemployed.  It is no use stressing the fact, which is apparent to us all, that if we were solving the housing problem in that way, we would be also helping to find a way out of the difficulty of unemployment.  A great many of the houses that have been built during <Col N="1578" /> the last seven years by the use of the grants that have been given have not been built for the poorer classes who need them most.  However, the building of houses, perhaps, has relieved the strain, and it is well to see houses of any kind being built, but there is a very urgent and grave problem so far as the poorer classes are concerned.  I have probably talked too much already on that subject.  I will not repeat, but anything that can be done, and anything the Minister proposes in this Bill to direct more attention in future to houses for the poorer classes, is going in the right direction to meet the serious complaint I make.  Neither he nor the Government have any realisation of the grave nature of the problem.  If they had they would not try to fool us and the country with the miserable Bill they are introducing.</P>

      <P>I could not help feeling, as the Deputy who has just sat down was speaking, that it is necessary for us to throw our minds back when dealing with this problem to get some indication as to why its solution at the moment is so difficult. I am sorry that this problem of housing appears to me, from the speeches made, particularly from the last speech, as likely to become a political problem.  I think it would be very unfortunate for the whole country if this problem of housing were to become a political problem. If the last Deputy who spoke did not intend that it should become a political problem and that it should be dealt with practically on the lines he suggested, I would like to see him figure out what the burden on the <Col N="1579" /> tenant, the taxpayer and the ratepayer would be as a result of his proposals. Now, if we are to get some indication as to why this problem is a pressing one at the moment, let us throw our minds back to 1914.  I would ask the Deputy, who has had some experience in housing, by whom was housing done in pre-war days, to what extent did the Government pledge its credit, and to what extent did local authorities pledge their credit for housing?  If he will throw his mind back, he will find that as regards the State practically nothing was done; as regards local authorities, the percentage of houses erected by them was exceedingly small.  Still we had sufficient houses. Why?  Because housing then was an economic proposal.  The tenant could afford to pay the interest and sinking fund on the house he occupied. The position we are faced with to-day, in this State, is that housing is not an economic proposal. Every Government ought to try and ensure that its line of policy will be such as to help to get it back on economic lines.  If that be the view which should be taken by a State in this problem and if the Deputy will work that out and compare it with his proposal he will find that his proposal is going to burthen the Government, the local authority and the tenant with a heavy load, because money is exceedingly dear at the moment and he wants to capitalise while money is high, with the result that he is going to put a burden on all these bodies for the next fifty years until these loans are paid back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is his solution, as a result of mature consideration.  I hope in the solution of this problem we will have a little more common sense&mdash;I do not want to be offensive&mdash;than was embodied in the speech we have listened to.  The suggestion we have listened to is no solution at all.  As far as this generation is concerned, it is going to burthen it for all time with a heavy load.  The duty of the State if it is to try to get a problem of this character on to economic lines will be to distribute its contribution <Col N="1580" /> equally between the different seetions affected.  My objection to this Bill is one which I have expressed on previous Bills in this House.  There is practically no difference between this Bill and its predecessors.  It is modelled on the lines of the Bills of 1925, '26 and '28.  My objection is that these Bills are only helping one section of the community, the section that can afford to pay for three-roomed houses, of which there were very few erected; those who can afford to pay for four-roomed houses, and the still better-to-do, who can afford to pay for five-roomed houses. Those are the classes of the community that all these Bills, one after another, have been helping as if there was no other section in the community to whom it was the duty of the Government to give assistance. What has any of these Bills done to help the unfortunate slumdweller? I asked that question when we were considering the Bill of 1928. I pointed out exactly the same difficulty. You are going to help the well-to-do tradesman who could afford to pay ten shillings, fifteen shillings, or seventeen shillings a week rent, because those are the economic rents of those houses under this proposal.  How many of the poor in the slums of our city, or in the other cities of this State, can afford to pay rents of that magnitude? None of them, with the result that they are to-day left in their slums just as they were ten years ago while the more well-to-do are being housed at the expense of the State and at the expense of the taxpayer. That, to my mind, is a mistake. I have urged the case of the poor in the slums on this Government in order that something might be done, and I was hopeful when we got this Bill that we should see in it that something really was being done.  I admit it is an exceedingly difficult problem, but it is a duty we owe to that section and we ought to face it.  From that point of view, I am disappointed with this Bill because it does nothing for that particular section.</P>
    <P>There is one difference and one <Col N="1581" /> important difference between this Bill and its predecessors.  As the Minister has pointed out, under the Bill of 1925 a local authority who erected a three-roomed house got £60; a four-roomed house, £80; a five-roomed house, £100.  The defect in that Schedule was, as those who have got practical experience of housing know, the larger your house is the cheaper is the cost per room. Consequently, that proposal put a premium in favour of the five-roomed house, also in favour of the four-roomed house, as against the three-roomed house.  The result of all those Bills has been that we have had a larger number of five-roomed houses, a lesser number of four-roomed houses, and a still smaller number of three-roomed houses.  I am glad to note that in this Bill no distinction is made between the three-roomed house, the four-roomed house, and the five-roomed house. From that point of view this Bill is an improvement on its predecessors. But there is in this Bill still what, to my mind, is an objectionable feature. I have yet to learn from the Minister why a utility society or a local authority should get more by way of grant than the private individual. The Deputies will notice that under sub-section (a) of Section 3 of this Bill a private individual erecting a house will get a grant of £45 from the State, and under sub-section (b) a utility society, or a local authority erecting the same class of house, gets a grant of £60.  I would like the Minister to point out why the local authority or the utility society should get more than the private individual who probably is prepared to put his own money into that house.  One of the difficulties of housing is, particularly while it is an uneconomic problem, that we are burdening the local authority, on the one hand, with heavy loans for housing, and we are burdening the State, on the other hand, with heavy liabilities for housing, and the man who is prepared to put his own money into his house is burdened.</P>
    <P>In other words, the utility society <Col N="1582" /> and the local authority get a grant in excess of what he gets. Why that should be I cannot fathom.  In fact, if it were the reverse of that I could see the reason for it, but why we should be anxious to handicap the private individual and encourage the utility society and the State is one of those problems which I would like the Minister to explain.  What is the position on the other side to-day? Out of the million houses erected since the Armistice, nearly half have been erected without State assistance of any kind.  They have been erected by what we know over here as the speculative builder, the private individual, and where there is no handicap put upon him on the other side he has provided half the houses.  I would like to see that individual encouraged instead of discouraged here.  A very large number of houses here could, and would, be provided through the speculative builder and through the investing public, investing in the products of the speculative builder, without any State assistance, if that individual were encouraged. Such an individual, however, has been handicapped and shut out in favour of the utility society and the local authority.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us why.  Let us develop this point a little further. Under this Bill, the local authority gives to whomsoever builds a house a sum equivalent to the amount of the State grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can explain the difference.  The local authority is empowered, under this Bill, to give a grant equivalent to the State grant.  As the Minister points out very properly, it need not be up to the amount, but it is empowered to do it.  Let us look at the position of the private individual in comparison with the utility society or the local authority under this Bill.  First <Col N="1583" /> of all, a private individual gets £40 of a grant from the State.  The local authority is at liberty, if it so desires, to give another £45, and then there is another section in the Bill which has been in all the Acts since 1925, whereby the local authority can give a grant by way of loan to the owner or builder of a house equal to double the amount of the State grant.  That, in the case of a private individual, would be £90, so that the private individual, from all sources under the Bill, assuming that he gets the maximum benefit from all these parties, gets £180.  The public utility society or local authority gets £60 from the State, possibly £60 from the local authority, and can get £120 by way of loan, or a total of £240 as against the £180 for the private individual That represents a grant of 33? per cent. more to the utility society than to the private individual. In other words, the man we want to encourage in order to get houses built without being a burden on the ratepayer, the taxpayer, or the State is handicapped under this proposal to the extent of 33? per cent.  That is one of the things which I would like the Minister to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point with which I would like to deal very briefly.  It has been mentioned by you, sir, in your speech and by other Deputies that our object should be to build five-roomed houses.  As to what house a man should occupy depends entirely on the amount of rent he is capable of paying.  According to the authorities and to your statement, sir, it appears that we are to legislate for people who want these pretty houses, pretty pictures, quite irrespective of their capability to pay for them.  I am sure all Deputies here are well housed.  I doubt if there is a Deputy in this House who, if he had the ability to pay, would not prefer a better house than the one in which he finds himself. The economic factor settles the size and position of the houses that you and I have to occupy, but that is no consideration when we come to this question of housing out of State grants.  The State says: &ldquo;My dear <Col N="1584" /> man, your family is so-and-so, and you ought to be in a five-roomed house.&rdquo;  That is quite irrespective of the question whether that man can pay for a five-roomed house.  That, however, does not bother the Labour Party or the Government.  They say:&mdash;&ldquo;That is the house that you ought to be in.&rdquo;  Let us examine that for a moment.  We have had that system in force for nearly ten years.  We have taken these poor people who are anxious to bring up their families respectably and put them into five-roomed houses because there was nothing else they could get. They were not long in those five-roomed houses when, like all of us, they found that the rent of such a house was more than they could pay without sacrificing the interests of their family.  What had they to do? They had to proceed to sub-let.  This matter is common knowledge to all who have experience of the housing problem.  They proceeded to sub-let the rooms in those large houses and they were getting as much as 10/- a room.  I know several cases in which they got in excess of 10/-.  When they got 10/- for one room the attraction was so great they proceeded to let other rooms.  Not very long ago a man told me that living a few doors from him in a five-roomed house there were three families with 28 children.  Is that solving the housing problem?  Is that the solution you are going to put forward?  Is that helping those who are in limited accommodation at the moment?  It is only extending the slum question.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to the economic fact and provide houses that a man is able to pay for, and there are a great many who cannot pay for three-roomed houses at the moment. When we have reached agreement on the fact that we are providing houses that people are able to pay for, we will have gone a good way towards clarifying the situation and enabling us to deal with this problem. The Minister has rightly pointed out that a Government can only do a certain amount in the solution of this problem.  You, sir, have rightly pointed out from your <Col N="1585" /> experience on local authorities, that local authorities can only do a limited amount towards the solution of this problem.  I am anxious that what the State can do and what the local authority can do, should be wisely done.  If we are going to proceed along the lines on which we have been proceeding, I am afraid we are not going effectively to deal with this problem.  As I said, I would like that what the State and what the local authorities can do should be wisely done.  That brings me back to the claim of the slum dweller.  The problem of the slum dweller, as I have already stated, is a difficult problem from many points of view, but that is no reason why we should shirk it.  I would like some undertaking from the Minister that some effective steps will be taken to probe that problem and that some proposal for the solution of that particular aspect of it, will be put before us within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I am sorry we have not got in our City in connection with the housing problem.  That is what is commonly called a town plan.  The reason I mention it is that there are positions suitable for houses and positions which are also unsuitable for houses.  I came in touch with a scheme during the last week which to my mind was placed in a most unsuitable position, from the point of view of housing.  It was a site that obviously should be retained for industrial purposes.  It was within a few hundred feet of a deep water berth, and it adjoined what I expected in a few years would be one of the most important thoroughfares in our City.  Another objectionable feature was that it was close up to a large gas works and not, from any point of view, a desirable position for a large housing scheme. Nevertheless, it was proposed to put it there.  When one came to inquire into the cause of acquiring that particular site, because it was an important, valuable site from the industrial point of view, one found that it was proposed to pay approximately £4,000 an acre for it.</P>

We are not so deficient of open spaces here that we are absolutely forced to put houses in these undesirable positions.  I would like to see when we come to consider these proposals in connection with houses, and to spend large sums, that they should be considered in connection with the city's development, not taken casually on individual merits, but taken on with the larger question of city development; in other words, taken in conjunction with the information that a town plan or a city plan would give.  I did not throw out this suggestion in any hostile spirit, but as an assistance to those who are anxious to deal with this problem effectively.  We are spending large sums through the State, and through the ratepayer, and, as I said, we want to get the best results, and I do not think we can get the best results except we consider this expenditure in connection with the larger question of city development and city planning.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for the President to jibe.  I remember the time when the argument the President is using now would not go down very well with him when, in the Dublin Corporation, he was advocating the erection of more houses.  I think he ought to bring something else to bear on this important subject besides jeering remarks and sneering at people when they speak. This Bill, coupled with the speech of the Minister for Local Government, is to my mind, a confession of impotency on the part of the Government and of inability to solve this question.  The Minister has gone out of his way to abuse local authorities. He has told us that local authorities have not given this matter the scrutiny required, that they should use a microscope in so far as the housing problem in their particular area is concerned.  As Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, local authorities have been doing all they can in an endeavour to solve the problem. They have been trying to carry on. They are well aware that what they have been doing is just trying to link up, so to speak, just marking time, because of the fact that the Government have repeatedly promised to do more than they have been doing for housing.  I do not think any local authority, or any individual, was prepared for this Bill.  It certainly will not bring us any further in solving the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that a certain number of houses have been built since 1922.  Nobody would give the Government more credit for what they have done than I would.  There <Col N="1589" /> is no question but that they have stimulated house building and have done a great deal for it.  But how many of these houses have come into the possession of people who require houses most?  It would be very interesting to know how many of these houses have been built by local authorities, and how many by private individuals?  In that connection, I should like to answer the question put by Deputy Good to the Minister?  He says he has yet to learn why a local authority should get a larger subsidy than a private individual.  I think it is quite easy to answer that question.  Local authorities, so far as I know, do not use that grant as a profit to themselves, but they give the benefit of it to the tenant or to the person buying the house.  I have yet to learn that any private speculator has done that, or is thinking of doing it.  My belief is that the intention of the Government in giving this subsidy was to relieve the tenant or the person buying the house from the person who built it, and I believe the Government are doing something in the right direction when they give a local authority a larger grant than a private individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government gave us what he considers to be the reason why the Local Loans Fund is not open for house building. He states that it will be necessary for things to come back to normal before that fund is open for that purpose.  I do not think anybody here will live sufficiently long to enable that to be done, if that is the state of affairs.  The Minister quoted figures to show that the cost of building has gone down for the last three or four years, but it has been going down very slowly, and not to the extent that we should like to see.  If the Minister is going to wait until things get back to what they were in 1914 or 1915 before any money is advanced from the Local Loans Fund, then housing will be in a very bad way indeed.</P>
    <P>I am going to ask the President, if he cannot see his way to permit of money coming from the Local Loans Fund for the actual building <Col N="1590" /> of houses, that he would at least consent to advance the money to local authorities by way of loan for the clearance of sites and things of that kind.  Anybody who has any experience of building knows that it costs anything from £30 to £40 per house, in many cases, for the clearance of a site, and that in itself is a great handicap upon building. There are many cases where people, especially local authorities, acquire large pieces of land on the side of a road.  It would not be an economic proposition to build on the side of the road.  It is necessary to make avenues down the field, and the President knows, and the Department of Local Government know, that it takes a great deal of money to develop such a site and to lay down sewerage, water mains, and things of that kind.  I ask the President at least to recommend the Department of Finance to open the Local Loans Fund to permit of loans to be given for that particular purpose, at any rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said that the position as regards house building was becoming normal.  I cannot for the life of me see what particular application &ldquo;normal&rdquo; could have to this situation. The position as far as the unskilled labourer is concerned is infinitely worse than it was five years ago.  It is absolutely necessary, as Deputy O'Kelly said, that the Government should apply themselves, through the medium of a national housing association, to examining the housing problem properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government complained that some local authorities are not giving this matter the scrutiny that it requires. That may be.  But with the amounts that they have at their disposal it may not be possible for them to view it from the particular aspect that the Minister wants them to view it. In view of that, would it not be desirable that the Minister and his Department should get into touch with the local authorities, with a view to conferring with them as to <Col N="1591" /> what is required, and what would be necessary in order to do something in a big way?  The Minister criticises the local authorities.  The present local authorities are now almost a year in office, and they will go out at the end of another two years, and new ones will come in.  Is this going to go on year after year?  Is it not time for the Government to make an effort to find out where the local authorities are wrong, if they are wrong; to bring them together in conference with a view to finding out how they can best apply themselves to the provision of houses for the people?  The problem is here no matter what the cause, and it is the Government's duty to find out the cause.  If the Government consider the local authorities can discover the cause, it is their duty to ask the local authorities to find out the cause.  I do not think that any local authority would resent such interference. They are interfered with in things of lesser importance than housing.  I do not think it is fair for the Minister for Local Government to hide himself behind such an accusation as that in so far as housing is concerned.  If there is anything wrong it is his duty to find it out, and the only way to do it is to bring together representatives of the local authorities in a conference in Dublin and to hear what they recommend in order to solve this housing problem.  It has been very discouraging for some of us who have tried to carry on during the last three or four years.  In fact, in some cases where these matters were raised we did try to make excuses for the Government, telling people that the Government were bound to do certain big things that had to be done, in our opinion.</P>
    <P>The net result of the application of this Bill, which I presume will be passed, on housing in the various areas in the country will be very serious.  Take the matter of the building of four-roomed houses.  G.1 type, which is known in the Local Government Department, and which are costing to the country an <Col N="1592" /> average price of £300, with £80 grant and ten years loan.  The economic value of that house works out up to now at 12/8 per week. Under this Bill with that ten years' loan the rent will be raised to 13/10 per week, so that the economic result of this Bill, if we are to go ahead building houses of that kind, will be an increase in rent of 1/2 per week.  Surely it is not going to solve the housing problem for the Government to bring in a Bill the effect of which will be to increase rent instead of reducing it.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see how any local authority is going to take advantage of this Bill.  It was certainly as much as they could do to provide money for the past five or six years in order to take advantage of grants given under other Acts. It was a marking-time process.  No bank in the country to-day will lend money for a longer period than ten years.  In a great many centres, banks will not lend money for any period.  If the President or the Minister for Local Government will tell anyone who has to do with local authorities where they can get money to build houses, or what institution, in the country, is prepared to lend money to local authorities to build houses the Bill may be worth something.  But there is very little use telling local authorities that the Local Government will give £60 grants towards the building of houses if the local authority cannot find the other £240.  The Bill is merely eye-wash.  It is absolutely impossible for the local authorities to provide any money to build houses for the people who want them&mdash;the unskilled labourers and those who are worse off in the Irish towns to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill I think it is advisable that we should confine ourselves to whatever principles it contains and not go into the consideration of points which are properly Committee Stage points.  The matters which anyone speaking on this Bill should deal with are, I think, the following: The extent of the housing problem, <Col N="1593" /> the difficulties in the way of the solution of that problem, the actual solution itself, and how far this Bill goes towards providing a solution. I notice that the Minister in his introductory speech did not deal with a single one of these four points.  He dealt with a number of minor points which really do not seem to be very vital to the discussion. The same applies to the speech of Deputy Good and to the speech of Deputy Morrissey.  Deputy Good did, of course, attempt to give some idea of the extent of the housing problem in 1913, but even in that he was hopelessly and outrageously wrong.  He said, of course, that in 1913 there was very little State assistance given or very little assistance given by the local governing bodies to private builders; that all the work was done by private builders and, he added, still we had a sufficiency of houses.  I would ask him to examine the figures given to the Committee on the relief of unemployment, of which Deputy Rice was chairman, and he will see himself that in 1913, no more than to-day, was there a sufficiency of houses.  In 1913 there were 73,973 people living in single rooms in tenement houses.  The number in 1926 had gone up to 78,934.  There are now in Dublin 4,824 tenement houses, of which 1,744, or 36 per cent. are, in the official phrase, unfit for human habitation and incapable of being rendered fit for human habitation.  There are 2,149, or 44.5 per cent., again in the official phrase, so decayed or so badly constructed as to be on the border line of being unfit for human habitation. The number of tenements unfit for human habitation has increased by 14.8 per cent. since 1913.  There are now 26,000 people in Dublin living in such places.  I think most Deputies will agree that the existence of these conditions constitutes a social menace which would justify drastic measures being taken to end them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember during the discussions upon the Housing Act of 1928 I made some reference to the futility of introducing Bills for the censorship <Col N="1594" /> of publications while, at the same time, we permitted conditions such as do exist in Dublin to continue. The President took advantage of those remarks to make a very rhetorical reference to the morality of the Dublin worker and the Dublin poor, and no doubt he was, to a very large extent, right in what he said.  I would like the President, however, to examine paragraph 10 of the Report of the Committee on the relief of unemployment. In that paragraph there are quoted a few sentences from the Report which was published in 1913 and which had reference to the conditions existing then, conditions which, as I have shown you, have become worse since.  Not merely have the actual physical conditions become worse, but there has been a general loosening of moral ties in consequence of the Great War and the conditions following it.  So long as these conditions exist, the social menace which they create will exist. You cannot expect flowers to grow on dung heaps.  In fact, that is what you have in Dublin&mdash;dung heaps on which people are living. Perhaps the members of Cumann na nGaedheal who have a particular fondness for a particular phrase would prefer if I say there are sewers in Dublin in which 26,000 people are living.  If these sewers breed sewer rats it is only the natural sequence.</P>
    <P>This Bill continues the policy which the 1928 Housing Bill was introduced to wind up.  I think I am correct in that.  The policy which was followed by the Government in 1924, 1925 and 1926 was, we were told, terminated with the introduction of the 1928 Housing Bill. The main purpose of that Bill was to round off that housing policy. We were promised that a much more comprehensive housing scheme was going to be introduced.  We have not seen it.  I hope we will hear something about it to-day.  The President said something about the offer being still open.  What offer, and when or to whom was it made? What are the details of the offer? I hope the President will find time, <Col N="1595" /> during the course of this discussion, to tell us.  The policy contained in the previous Acts and which is continued in this Bill, the policy which the Government has been following up to this, is remarkable for the fact that it is obviously incapable of dealing adequately with the problem. Under it a sum of £1,900,000 was expended on grants to private individuals, public utility societies and local government bodies.  Some 18,000 houses were built, or are in course of construction, according to the Committee, of which Deputy Rice was Chairman.  There are still 30,000 houses remaining to be built. That was the estimate which they arrived at.  They based that estimate for Dublin City on 15,000 houses, following the evidence given by the Dublin City Commissioners. They were still less sure of their estimate for the rest of Ireland, but, roughly, they said that 30,000 houses was a reasonable figure in addition to what had been built up to the date at which the Report had been published, that is, February, 1928.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 33 of the report they say: &ldquo;It is apparent that the capital expenditure involved in a very early solution of the housing problem on the basis of the present cost of building is entirely beyond the financial resources of the country,&rdquo; and they added: &ldquo;The continuance of these contributions, even on an extended scale, cannot itself bring us within sight of a solution.  The policy which the Government had adopted&rdquo;&mdash;the giving of these building grants to private individuals and local bodies &mdash;&ldquo;resulted in but little amelioration of the tenement problem in the City of Dublin.&rdquo;  The policy which the Government has been following merely stimulated building to an extent to enable it to keep pace with the growth of the demand.  We have not yet been able to get up on the arrears that were there when this Government came into office.  The housing conditions which make Dublin almost unique in the civilised world still exist.  In fact, I do not <Col N="1596" /> think there is any other city in Europe in which one-fourth of the entire population are housed under conditions of a similar character, with the people living in single rooms in tenement dwellings, the majority of which are unfit for human habitation or on the border-line of being unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>The Committee on the Relief of Unemployment gave us their considered view in paragraph 35 of their report.  They say: &ldquo;If the problem is to be solved in the present generation this can only be done by (a) a drastic reduction in building costs, and (b) the provision of housing loans for local authorities on terms which will enable them to build and let houses at rents which will not throw an intolerable burden on the taxpayers or the ratepayers on the one hand, or on the poorest tenants on the other hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What have the Government done to reduce the cost of building?  Certain figures were produced to-day, but these figures to us convey nothing.  They may prove something to the Minister.  We would like to have some more information than he deigned to give.  If you take the housing scheme in 1926 and compare the costs per foot with the housing costs in 1928, and show that one was less than another, you prove nothing unless you show that the other conditions were identical, that the one scheme was as efficiently managed and conducted as the other and that the various elements which would go to increase or decrease costs were identical in both cases.  The Committee on the Relief of Unemployment recommended that a joint conference of master builders and building operatives should be held for the purpose of considering the best means of reducing building costs and substantially increasing the units of output.  That joint conference was set up.  Deputy Rice was again Chairman of it, and it has apparently proved abortive.  We want to know from the Government is the matter going to be left there?  The introduction of this Bill would seem to indicate that the Government are <Col N="1597" /> prepared to leave the matter there, that in consequence of the failure of that conference the housing policy about which they spoke during the by-election last April, when Deputy Rice was elected to this House, was abandoned and that the old policy is to be continued even though the Government have admitted that the old policy was not well suited to deal with the situation and could not bring us within sight of a permanent solution of the whole question.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am not correct in saying that the conference proved abortive. No report has been issued.  If Deputy Rice intervenes in this debate, perhaps he will tell us if we are to expect a report and if the conference is still in session.  Certain proposals stated to have been submitted to that conference by the building trade unions were published in the &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; on December 8th last. Letters from the Master Builders' Association, in reply, were published in the daily Press some time later over the name of Mr. Ernest Thompson. In the leading articles of the &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; in the same issue in which the proposals were contained, it was stated that these proposals had been in the hands of Deputy Rice for just two months and that no meeting of the conference had been called to consider them.  Does that position still continue?  Has the conference been called together since for the purpose of considering them, or are we to take it that it has been allowed not to terminate, but merely to dissolve without anything definite having been done?  We, however, cannot leave the whole question of the solution of the housing difficulty to stand in mid-air like Mahomet's coffin, just because Deputy Rice's Committee has apparently proved abortive.  The members of this House have got to face the question.</P>
    <P>Two specific points were raised by the Committee on the Relief of Unemployment&mdash;the question of the reduction of building costs and the question of the provision of loans on suitable terms to local authorities. We have got to face these two questions here.  What is the reason of <Col N="1598" /> the high cost of building?  It has been suggested both inside and outside this House that the high cost of building is due to the fact that the amount which has to be paid in labour for the construction of a house is higher here than in England. Whether that is due to higher wage rates or lower output I cannot say.  The suggestion has been made. I note in the &ldquo;Irishman,&rdquo; which is, I think, the official or semi-official organ of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A section of it?  As I was saying, I note that in the &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; the building unions retaliate by saying that the experience of their members who go to England is that they have to work less strenuously there than at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They state also, if it is true, as alleged, that the labour cost in connection with house-building here is higher than in England, that it is probably attributable to defects in organisation and management, the smaller scale of building operations on this side of the water, and they state also that they will guarantee that labour in this country will give at least as good a return in house-building as is obtained from labour in England if the jobs are organised in a similar manner, and if the general facilities for efficient work are equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is an answer to the argument with regard to labour cost.  We have to look, therefore, for the high cost of building in other directions.  Is it true, as is stated by the editor of &ldquo;The Irishman,&rdquo; that unreasonable rates are being demanded for building materials; is it true that there is inefficient organisation in the building trade here, or is it true that the smaller scale operations which are carried on here make the economical purchasing of supplies impossible? If any single one of these possible explanations of the high cost of <Col N="1599" /> building is the true explanation, then I think there is an unanswerable case for Governmental intervention.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the Housing Bill of 1928 the President, replying to some point made by Deputy Briscoe, said: &ldquo;I suppose he never heard of the Housing Facilities Act of 1924. Did he ever hear of Section 9 of that Act?  Did he ever hear or make any enquiries as to whether any application had been made to put that section into operation?  If he did not, I will tell him no person ever applied to have it put into operation.&rdquo;  Section 9 of the 1924 Act gave the Minister for Local Government power to purchase from those engaged in the manufacture of or trading in building materials, supplies and other appliances required for the construction of a house.  Section 8 of the Act gave him the right to order an enquiry into the cost of building materials and, if he found the cost excessive, to fix maximum wholesale and retail prices.  It was not necessary to have somebody applying to have the powers given by those sections put into operation.  The President appeared to think that he had dismissed the matter by pointing out that no one had, in fact, made such application.  We want to know why the Government did not, of its own initiative, put the powers of Section 9 into operation if it is true the high cost of building in this country is due to any one of the three causes mentioned: unreasonable rates for supplies; inefficient organisation of management, or the impossibility of economical buying owing to the small scale of operations carried on.  If it is necessary to have an application made, in what form should the application be made?  Will it satisfy the President if I make that application here and now across the House?</P>

There has been even a reduction in <Col N="1601" /> the cost of government, but it does not follow that the cost of government is what it should be.  Neither does it follow that the cost of building materials is as it should be.

      <P>Certainly he leaves us under that impression when he compares conditions in 1913 with what they are now.  He seems to imply that if the local government bodies and the Government got out of the business altogether and left it solely to the speculative builder, the housing problem would disappear owing to the erection of the number of houses required, but now he does not appear to wish to stand over that.</P>

      <P>We recommend, as Deputy O'Kelly informed the House, that the problem of erecting the number of houses required should be undertaken by a Housing Board, financed and controlled by the State, with power either to engage directly in the task of building houses or to operate through local government bodies, or even through private individuals as their agents.  We think that Board should be empowered to acquire compulsorily such buildings, land, plant, mines or quarries as they think necessary for the efficient carrying out of their work, and their work should be the construction of 30,000 houses within a fixed period of time.</P>

      <P>It does not matter one iota whether we are committing an economic solecism or not.  The fact remains there are 26,000 people living in Dublin in houses unfit for human habitation, and in houses which are incapable of being made fit for human habitation.  Let us keep that in the forefront of our minds. It is a much more serious national menace than the one that President Cosgrave referred to last week, and one which would justify much more drastic action in solving it.  The duties of such a Housing Board as we suggested would be the development of the production of building materials within this country.  We are interested in finding the solution of the housing problem, not merely to supply a social need, but also because it offers one of the most hopeful avenues of finding a solution of the unemployment question.  We import about £1,200,000 worth of building materials every year, practically every single item of which is capable of being produced at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a mínute.  At present a very small proportion of our requirements is supplied from within the country.  I <Col N="1604" /> noted that at a Local Government inquiry into an application by the Dublin City Commissioners for a loan of £450,000 for the purpose of erecting working class lodging houses in Dublin, held in December last, the City Architect stated that the proportion of the cost of imported materials had been computed to be 83 per cent., leaving only 17 per cent. for native material.  The principal items on our import list in respect to building materials are cement, slates, paints and colours, paper hangings, builders' woodwork, glass, sanitary ware, and bricks. Every single item on that list could be produced at home.  We have all the mineral deposits.</P>

      <P>I will seriously consider it.  A certain market is practically all that is required to insure production within this country, and the bulk of our requirements in building materials would be provided immediately such a Housing Board as we recommend proceeds to operate a programme designed to ensure the construction of the number of houses required and working continuously over a fixed number of years.  It is not possible, in a discussion of this kind, to go into matters in great detail.  The Bill which is before us is a rotten Bill, but despite the fact that it is a rotten Bill the Government knows it will pass through this House unopposed, because the alternative to it is nothing. It is, in fact, emblematical of the Government's bankruptcy in policy. If there were any substance in all the talk they indulged in during the last year with respect to the housing problem they were to carry out we would not have this Bill before us now.  Talk undoubtedly is one of the main difficulties in connection with this problem, because it has kept people from applying their minds to it for the purpose of finding a solution in the belief, in consequence of the talk they heard from the Cumann na nGaedheal platforms, that a perfect solution had been already discovered and was filed in the office of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> Before concluding, I would like to ask the Minister if he will tell us why the recommendations of the Committee on the relief of unemployment, contained in paragraphs 45, 46 and 47 of the Report, were not given legislative effect.  They were: &ldquo;That Local Authorities should be given increased powers in regard to tenement houses (a) to enforce sanitary conditions, (b) to reduce overcrowding, and (c) to insist on premises being kept in proper repair.&rdquo;  The second recommendation was: &ldquo;That Local Authorities should be given powers to compel owners to clear derelict sites and, on their failure to do so, that the Local Authorities should be empowered, after due notice to the persons concerned, to enter on and clear the sites, the cost of such clearance to be made a first charge on the value of the land.&rdquo;  If that matter be relevant to this debate I would like to know why legislative effect was not given these proposals even if the main proposal was ignored.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good, in his introductory remarks, suggested that the House might treat this matter as a national and not a political question.  I welcome, in a sense, the speech of the last Deputy who spoke&mdash;Deputy Lemass&mdash;because he seemed on the whole to have treated the matter as a national question. I do not know whether his conversion is so recent as to be the result of Deputy Good's suggestion or not, but certainly he is one of the Deputies who needed conversion on this subject.  Deputy O'Kelly talked about the by-election last year in North Dublin.  He referred to a speech that I made on that occasion and gave a quotation from a newspaper report which was about from twelve to twenty lines long of a speech which lasted half an hour. On that occasion, as Deputy O'Kelly knows perfectly well, and on every occasion on which the subject was spoken of, the recommendations of the Committee as to a conference in order to solve the housing problem was referred to, and one subject was <Col N="1607" /> never referred to without the other. The intentions of the Government as regards this matter were always mentioned as subject to agreement on the part of the building operatives and the employers.</P>

I had not the advantage of hearing Deputy Rice speak, and all I could read would be what the Press gave of his speeches.  I never saw any contradiction or explanation of that quotation. I would be glad to have Deputy Rice's explanation now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly is perfectly well aware that in the course of an election a speaker who speaks for half an hour, unless he happens to be as prominent as Deputy O'Kelly, will get about twelve lines in the newspapers.  The Press has not room for reports of all the speeches made at an election, especially by persons who are not prominent. If Deputy O'Kelly had been making the same speech he probably would get a column.  As this matter has been introduced and discussed here to-night, let me refer to the paragraph in the Report of the Unemployment Committee dealing with this particular matter&mdash;the recommendation that there should be a continuous programme of house-building:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in order to enable the Government to judge the feasibility of such a continuous programme, an immediate conference, to be presided over by a neutral chairman, should first be called together between the Master Builders and the representative of the different sections of the Builders Operatives to consider and report on the best means of reducing building costs and substantially increasing units of output.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that Deputy Lemass was an offender in treating this as a political matter and not as a national <Col N="1608" /> question, and, as I said, I welcome his conversion, if his speech means that he is converted from his former attitude of mind, because no person was more active in representing to the public that the by-election of 1928 was won by misrepresentation than Deputy Lemass.  Let me inform Deputy Lemass that before that conference was ever summoned and since this Report was issued, and it was known that the conference was to be summoned, Deputy Lemass's Party issued leaflets in the by-election poisoning the minds of the operatives with regard to this conference and suggesting to them that it was all a fake, and that there was no intention that anything should come of it.  That is, I suggest, treating this national problem as a political problem.  The Deputies made use of this as an election cry, but the public do not seem to have paid a great deal of attention to it, because with their combined forces in the last election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass is very anxious to know what happened as regards this conference.  I think Deputy Lemass has a very fair idea as to what happened.  Let me say this about it, that neither side to that conference has put forward a contribution that would justify the Government in undertaking a huge programme of building.  Deputy Lemass quoted paragraphs from the Unemployment Committee's Report <Col N="1609" /> on this matter.  There is one paragraph he did not quote, and I would like to draw his attention, and the attention of the House, to it.  It is paragraph 36 of the report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have already adverted to recognition of the moral duty of the taxpayer and the ratepayer of bearing their share of the burden. There is an equal moral duty and an equal responsibility to the nation on the part of those engaged in the building trade to make their contribution to the provision of houses for the poor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is it seriously suggested by the Deputies opposite, in the first place, that the Government should undertake a programme of building 30,000 houses at present building cost when no contribution such as is outlined there has been made up to the present time by those engaged in the building trade?</P>

As far as I understand, it is only in Dublin City that they hope to come to an understanding.</P>

      <P>I am not attempting to throw blame on either party to this conference.  I know the difficulties on both sides.  Neither am I attempting to apportion blame between them.  I only say that they have not produced that contribution we hoped for, and I invite Deputies opposite to explain to us where the money is <Col N="1610" /> to be got to carry out this programme. If you want to borrow a huge sum of money for a building programme, the people who have money to lend will want to know how you are going to spend it.  Does any Deputy believe that anyone with money will lend it for expenditure on a scheme of building where two-thirds of the rents would be regarded as uneconomic and where people are paying, in fact, twice the economic value, and the ratepayer and the taxpayer have to make good the difference?  Is it suggested that the country or any corporation lending large sums of money to finance schemes of this kind would not take that into consideration and turn it down no matter what the credit of the country may be?  It has been suggested by Deputy Lemass that a contribution was made by the workers and that I held them up for two months.  So far as I am concerned, so far as bringing that before that conference between the master builders and the operatives is concerned, not in the next two years would I bring it forward.</P>

      <P>I will tell that later, if Deputy Anthony will have a little patience.  The success of a conference of this kind must depend on the good-will of both sides and on their avoiding subjects of recrimination, because no conference of the kind, having regard to the unfortunate former relations of the builders and the employees, would last half an hour if matters of recrimination are to be introduced.  We saw, even in the House to-day, between such good-tempered representatives of the two sides as Deputy Anthony and Deputy Good, that they were inclined to get into a controversy if the Chair had not stopped them.</P>

Here is one paragraph in this document, and I invite the House to consider what the effect of it would be on that Conference when it re-assembled:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of the men engaged in the building industry not more than twenty-five to thirty per cent. at any time in recent years have been employed in building houses for the working classes.  This is an important consideration in view of the demands made by the employers for concessions from the Building Trades Unions.  It would appear that under cover for the urgent need for houses for the workers and the lowering of their cost they aim at lower wages and longer hours on building works in general.&rdquo;</P>

It certainly appeared in the public Press not long ago, and, if desirable, I think it could be arranged that it could be circulated to Deputies by the organisation which issued it, at very small cost.

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>And deal with it in that way.  I would ask Deputies to consider a proposal of this kind in connection with the recommendation of the Unemployment Committee that the building operatives <Col N="1612" /> should make their contribution towards reducing the costs.  They make their contribution towards reducing the cost by putting forward what can be described merely as a proposal that the State should nationalise housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that Deputy Good has made a statement that proposals were put forward by the builders in conference, I think it is only fair to the other side to say that, in my opinion at all events, it was not a contribution within the terms of the recommendation.  I say that the operatives did not make a contribution within the terms of the recommendation. I do not intend to inflict the document on the House, but that is the substance of the proposals in it.  It is also suggested that by buying material in large quantities you will reduce the cost.  That is a selfevident proposition, that if you buy in large quantities for a great scheme you will necessarily reduce the cost.  But is that a contribution from either the builders or the building operatives towards a reduction in the cost of building?  I say it is not.  It is one of the results of the ordinary laws of supply and demand. If you buy in large quantities you will buy cheaper than if you buy in small quantities.  A proposal of that kind is not a contribution by the people who put it forward towards a solution of the problem.  I would ask Deputies who have spoken on this matter, and Deputies generally, to regard this problem in the way that Deputy Good suggested, namely, as a national problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the attitude of Deputies opposite towards this problem for the last year has not been <Col N="1613" /> helpful towards its solution.  The representatives of the Labour Party here gave me all the assistance they could.  They tried in the most earnest way to get something done and to get agreement to try and provide a reduction in costs.  They have not succeeded up to the present.  I have not succeeded.  Perhaps Deputies opposite, instead of making election speeches on the housing problem, would apply themselves to convincing the operatives and the builders to do something that would put us on the way towards a great programme for reducing the housing shortage.  Deputy O'Kelly spoke of building 30,000 houses in five years. If he had gone into the matter with any particularity he would know that it is out of the question, unless you import labour, as you have not a sufficient amount of skilled labour in this country to build anything like that number of houses in that period.  Deputy O'Kelly also referred to the building of houses in Dublin, and spoke of 450 for a period of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>420.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not putting it quite fairly from the point of view of the Government and the City Commissioners. If you take the last four years you will find that the figure, instead of being 420, is at least fifty per cent. more than that.  I would remind Deputies that at present the sites are ready and the ground has been prepared for over 1,200 new houses in the city of Dublin.  I appeal to Deputies, instead of making election speeches to try and do something which would assist in a cut-and-dried scheme being put forward.  There is no use in talking about giving the same output as in England.  We want a substantial reduction in costs, which will enable this poor State to solve the problem. I would earnestly ask Deputies to do that, and to try and get something from the two sides by way of contribution.  Then they could present to the Government their proposal that these 1,200 houses should be completed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Bill itself, I would be inclined <Col N="1614" /> to agree with the criticism of Deputy Morrissey on the grounds that the Bill encourages the building of small houses if that were put forward as a permanent policy, but it is, as a matter of fact, purely temporary. In Dublin the citizens could do with a much larger number of small houses.  There are a great many families who cannot afford to pay the rent of five or four-roomed houses.  There are a great number of small families who can be suited with three-roomed houses.  Therefore, instead of condemning the Bill from that point of view, I would be inclined to commend it, because it will provide houses for those who cannot pay rent for the bigger houses which have been built in recent years.  There is another criticism which I would like to make in regard to the Bill, and that is that it makes no distinction and gives no advantage to active local authorities who are carrying on the work of building.  It puts them in the same position as the inactive ones who are doing little or nothing in that respect.  I suggest to the Government that a distinction should be made in that direction, and that, if a local authority puts on a special housing rate applicable only to that particular subject of house-building, the Government should give an increase in the subsidy in order to encourage local bodies to put on a rate.  If, for instance, in the case of Dublin, the Commissioners put on a special housing rate of 1/6 I say that they, or anybody doing it, should get an increase in the amount of the subsidy under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this Bill not because, it is a good Bill, but because in the absence of something better I find that I have to support it.  I agree that a building programme of any magnitude will require money.  The money must come from somewhere and, in the final analysis, the taxpayer will have to foot the bill.  It is partly in that spirit that I approach the whole question under discussion.  In the first place, I find myself in disagreement with Section 1, the definitions, under <Col N="1615" /> which nothing is allowed for reconstruction. I have in mind many parts of Cork Borough where there are disused military barracks which, with very little expenditure, could be made into decent dwellings for working class people and others. That is, in my view at any rate, a very grievous fault in the Bill.  I would pass to another phase of the question touched upon by two Deputies to-night, namely Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Lemass.  I was really glad to hear them re-echo some of the things which I said on a former occasion in connection with housing and unemployment, in regard to environment and the moral effect of environment. These are not the words they used. We have been here for the principal portion of the Session, and for many days previous to it, discussing a Censorship of Publications Bill.  In my view, though I know it will not find many supporters in the House, I think that the housing conditions and the tenement system&mdash;herding together dozens of people in tenement buildings&mdash;are more conducive to immorality, and everything like it than the tons of immoral literature imported into this country week after week.  That is my own view and I am glad to see it is partially shared by other members of the House, influential members of the official Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that much more encouragement ought to be given by way of grants to local authorities to build houses for the working class. So far as a three-roomed house is concerned, I would much prefer to see larger houses because of the reasons I have mentioned.  We know that in this country the average family goes well beyond five or six, and that a three-roomed house is not at all adequate for the proper accommodation of a man, his wife and three or four children, particularly if some of these children are grown up.  However, as somebody said in the course of the discussion, a three-roomed house is far better than one room in a tenement and I subscribe to that idea.  I do not want to start <Col N="1616" /> off at this juncture by making any political capital out of what Deputy Rice said at one election or another. I do realise this at any rate, that Deputy Rice acted as Chairman of this Committee.  If I were in the same position I would find myself in the same difficulty as that in which Deputy Rice finds himself now.  I will say this to those who were inclined to be critical of Deputy Rice and his attitude, that Deputy Rice had a most difficult position. He occupied a most difficult position right through the proceedings.  He had to try to find accommodation as between the building operatives and the building employers.  In that connection I want to say that so far as the building operatives are concerned there appears to be in this House, as indeed all over the city, an idea that there is only one part of Ireland that matters, and that is Dublin.  I want to let this House know, and to let Dublin know also, that there are other parts of the Free State besides Dublin and if you have such terrific difficulties in Dublin, let them be discussed in some Dublin Chamber, but not in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We are well able to discuss our difficulties in Cork.  We do not want any nonentities to tell us what we will do in Cork.  It has become more apparent to me every day that you have your difficulties in Dublin just as we have in Cork, but these Dublin difficulties obtrude themselves too frequently in this House.  My conception of this House is possibly a higher conception than that of some Dublin Deputies.  I look upon it as the national legislative assembly.  Dublin Deputies are liable to look upon it as the Dublin City Council.  With that view I disagree. I would like to refer to a matter with which Deputy Good is more conversant and in which he is more interested than many people, namely, the contribution made by building operatives of the Free State, described some time ago as the Dublin building operatives.  I want to say that the proposals made by the Dublin <Col N="1617" /> building operatives were acquiesced in and subscribed to by the building operatives throughout the Free State.  These proposals were submitted to the Unemployment Committee of which Deputy Rice was Chairman.  They were at least a contribution. It was news to me to-night when I heard for the first time from Deputy Good that the master builders&mdash;a term that I dislike to use because I do not like the word &ldquo;masters&rdquo;; my experience is that many of those who call themselves &ldquo;masters&rdquo; are not masters of their profession or craft&mdash;had made a contribution and that that contribution was not accepted by Deputy Rice as any kind of decent contribution at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the contribution made by the building operatives is concerned, I think perhaps it is time that a little light was thrown on the matter.  These proposals have got a certain amount of publicity, but in my view they have not got sufficient publicity.  It would be just as well to remind Deputies in the House, when we have heard such a lot about Dublin and the position so far as tenement buildings are concerned, that in the County Borough of Cork there were in April, 1926, 5,537 persons in families occupying oneroomed dwellings, and 14,738 persons in families occupying two-roomed dwellings.  That will show that, relatively, the position in Cork is something like what it is in Dublin so far as housing accommodation is concerned.  I would direct the particular attention of Deputy Good to one paragraph in the proposals submitted by the building operatives. One paragraph suggests that economies would accrue by the ability to purchase materials in large quantities, of standard sizes, designs, and qualities.  We all know that in standardised houses one design, one set of builders' quantities, and so on will obtain, and in the view of many people interested in this problem, great difficulty is found, and a great expense is incurred, in buying from the builders' providers, not to talk at all of the builders' profits.  I ask <Col N="1618" /> any Deputy, what is his experience? I shall relate in a few words my own experience in Cork.  I have known many people who started in the building industry.  They began as carpenters, masons, or something of that kind.  Though they continually protested that there were no profits in building, after a few years what did we find?  Ninety-nine per cent. of these people blossomed out into what one might call country squires with houses in the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good is a fairly wealthy man and cannot be losing money.  I could point to builders in Dublin and Cork who made so much money that they should be able to retire after ten or twelve years.  As I have suggested, the building operatives have at least made their contribution by way of a number of suggestions to reduce the cost of building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They suggest buying on a large scale and cutting out such people as the builders' providers, very largely at any rate. They suggest that bricks should be ordered by the million, and that by so doing the price could probably be brought down to compete successfully with concrete.  They also suggest that slates from Irish quarries might be utilised if large contracts were given for them. Then we come to another proposal, that the building of working-class houses throughout the Saorstát should be entrusted to a national housing trust.  Of course, we are up against vested interests there.  It is a case of private enterprise versus State enterprise.  Naturally, that is a thing that Deputy Good would not subscribe to, even though by doing that we would be able to house some thousands of families in decency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The genesis of these proposals is that a trust should be formed, that it should have national backing, that building should be taken up on a national scale, and that by adopting these proposals you would be able to cut out many middlemen's profits.  Of course, it is not in the nature of things that this should be acceptable to the master builders of Dublin or Cork.  If Deputy Good, and those associated with him, will put their proposals in black and white, just as the building operatives did, then we will have something to discuss, and Deputy Rice will not be in the peculiarly bankrupt position that he found himself in so far as this Bill is concerned.  It was news to me and to many others when Deputy Good said that the builders had already sent in some suggestions.  We have not seen them.  I do not even know that the building operatives have seen them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals that were submitted to Deputy Rice were not in any way secret.  I am quite sure Deputy Good must have seen them.  The surprise to me is that any Deputy representing the building industry can stand up and say that he will endeavour to solve this problem, that he knows that an evil exists which is not conducive to morals in the city and country, and that he will not even make a decent contribution to it.  Are the master builders prepared to do with less profits in the same way as the operatives are prepared to give an even better output under decent conditions&mdash;properly organised conditions? It is all contained in one paragraph which has been already read: &ldquo;Comparisons have been made as to quality of work and output between the building trade workers in Ireland and those in Great Britain, to the disparagement of the Irish workers.  On that subject the trade unions can point to the fact that when their members go to <Col N="1620" /> work in England they find they are required to work less strenuously than in Ireland, and when they return to Ireland to take up work here the energy strain is decidedly greater.  If it is true, as is alleged, that the labour cost of house building is higher here than in England, it is probably attributable to defects in organisation and management.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good speaks about wages being 8/- per week higher than in England.  How is it that an English contractor can come to Cork and pay the highest rate of wages&mdash;a higher rate of wages in some trades and crafts than Deputy Good pays in Dublin&mdash;and that that English contractor can take a contract at £10,000 less than Deputy Good could do it?  It shows that the English contractor is willing to do with less profit and is content to get rich less quickly than most of the Irish master-builders.  That is the solution.</P>

      <P>I wish that Deputy Good and Deputy Anthony would go and fight their quarrels out elsewhere. I was very much disappointed in this Housing Bill.  It is a Bill which has been carefully and ingeniously framed for one purpose, and that is, to prevent those who have to find the money getting any benefit whatever out of it.  They are to get no benefit out of the £1,000,000 that is to be spent.  I, as a member of the Cork County Council, found that we had to deal with hundreds of disappointed applicants who came in looking for grants for <Col N="1621" /> reconstruction purposes in the last few years.  There is no reconstruction section whatever in this Bill. We find that the unfortunate farmers who have to live, practically, in hovels and who expected some assistance, at least, in the shape of some portion of a grant for the purpose of reconstructing their houses and making them habitable, will get no benefit whatever from the Bill. The same proposal was very ingeniously framed under the previous Housing Acts, whereby the reconstruction sections would only apply to houses reconstructed within a mile of a town of so many inhabitants. Unless this Bill is amended in such a manner that the Minister will not know it, it will be of no use whatsoever. I come down to the question of labourers' cottages.  We have in Cork some incomplete schemes under the Labourers Act, and we have a very large number of acre plots on which we hoped, under the new housing scheme, to be able to build labourers' cottages and let at something like a fair rent.  Now we find, under paragraph (d) of Section 3 it is stated: &ldquo;Any local authority erecting one or more houses in pursuance of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883 to 1919, in accordance with the scheme approved by the Minister, a grant not exceeding £50 in respect of each such house.&rdquo;  Then we turn to sub-section (4) of Section 5, and we find that the Board of Health, which would be the body that would have to deal with that matter, are specifically prevented, because it states that the local authority must not include the council of their own district in the County of Dublin, or a board of health and public assistance or a board of public health.  The board of health can only get from the county council a sum of £100 as a loan towards each house.  Paragraph (b), Section 5, states that a local authority may &ldquo;make to any person or public utility society to whom a grant is payable by the Minister under the Act in respect of a house situate within the council area of the local authority a loan not exceeding twice the amount of such grant.&rdquo;  The total amount of the <Col N="1622" /> loan from the county council would be £100, and the total amount of the grant would be £50.  I do not think there is any Deputy in this House who would state that you could build a labourer's cottage at present for £150.  I do not believe you could, so that this Bill is going to be absolutely worthless for the rural population; it is going to be worthless to the people who are to find the money.</P>
      <P>It is generally admitted that 23 per cent. of taxation comes from the farming population.  Seventy-three per cent. of this £1,050,000 which is to be devoted to housing has to be found by the farming population, who are going to derive no benefit whatever under the Act.  I do not think that any member of the Executive Council is going to allege that you could build a labourer's cottage for £150, considering that it is estimated that it takes £1,500 or £1,700 for a Civic Guard barrack.</P>
      <P>Then we had an attack by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on the local authorities. He made a rather amazing allegation, namely, that local authorities were prepared to pay a higher wage out of grants than they were prepared to pay out of rates.  That is a very amazing allegation, considering that we have stacks of correspondence in the County Council office in Cork in connection with these grants from the Minister's Department stating that such and such a grant is given under the usual conditions, namely, that preference in all such work is to be given to members of the National Army, and that the maximum rate of wages paid under this grant must not exceed 29/- per week.  We have stacks of correspondence of that description. The wages paid by the County Council of Cork at present to its road workers is 35/- per week, but the maximum rate under the grant is 29/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy wants to be exactly accurate he would have to develop that a bit. The wages are of a particular type. They are fixed in respect of work done under grants given before a <Col N="1623" /> particular date.  In relation to the grant given now in respect to road work, there is no condition in regard to wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The other grants have disappeared.  During the last four years, on each occasion that we got a grant it was specifically stated in the form the maximum wage to be paid was 29/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not since we came here to keep you straight.  Previous to our entry here that condition was laid down, and I think the Minister has said that the cost of living has decreased since he insisted that under the grant the wages should be 29/- per week.</P>
      <P>This Housing Bill is absolutely useless to the agricultural community, which has to provide 73 per cent. of the money.  The reconstruction scheme under which farmers could reconstruct their houses and put them into a decent condition is cut out, and, as I pointed out, reconstruction in the previous Acts was specifically confined to houses within a mile of certain towns and villages and with 700 population.  If the farmer who has to find the money is to be specifically deprived of any benefit under the Bill it is no wonder that we see representatives of the cities coming in here fighting for the spoil.  I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully the amount which is available in respect of labourers' cottages, especially having regard to the estimate laid down by the Board of Works of £1,500 and £1,700 for Civic Guard barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, as I think that housing is probably the most important problem that has to be solved in this country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> Bad housing is one of the principal causes of many diseases such as tuberculosis and other diseases like that, which are only too prevalent at the present time.  The conditions under which a very large number of people have to exist in this country are certainly nothing short of deplorable. This is not, and it ought not to be, a party matter.  It ought to be a matter which the combined parties in this House ought to endeavour to solve, because it will never be solved when parties endeavour to score off each other, and when one party blames the other for conditions which undoubtedly exist.  I believe that a grant of £45 for a three-roomed house will undoubtedly cause a large number of houses to be built.  I would like to mention that it is extraordinary how the public fail to grasp the fact that this grant is a free grant and not money that has to be paid back. The public seem to think, when they are applying for this, that it is money that they will have to pay back.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building of houses by public bodies, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has prescribed plans for a certain class of house.  The design I intend to allude to is C.L.17 and C.L.21.  The Westmeath Board of Health recently had plans prepared in connection with an endeavour to build some labourers' cottages in Westmeath.  The engineer's estimate for these houses was £330 plus £10 for fencing.  In other words, these houses will cost £340.  Even with the Government grant of £60 the cost of these houses would be in or about £300.  There is no prospect whatever of building houses that would cost about £300 because the rent of these houses would be 5/- or 6/- a week, whereas the present labourers' cottages are rented at only 1/- a week. In agricultural and, possibly, in town areas where these houses would be built there is no hope whatever of getting any such rent as 5/- or 6/- a week.  I would like the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to tell us whether that particular <Col N="1625" /> estimate given to the Westmeath Board of Health is excessive or whether houses can be built at a very much smaller amount than £340.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that there is nothing in the Bill in connection with the reconstruction of houses in rural areas because that is one of the greatest necessities at the moment. Any person who goes through the country can see these houses&mdash;if you like to call them houses&mdash;propped up in order to prevent them being blown down by the wind.  The people living in these houses are not in a position to do anything with them. I know the amount of money that would be required in order to make any kind of a grant towards the reconstruction of these houses would be enormous because, unfortunately, there is such a large number of them. It is really a matter in which I hope the Minister will endeavour to do something in the future.  If another Housing Bill is brought in I hope that something will be done in that direction.  There is no doubt at all about it that even £10 would, in many cases, go a long way to prevent a house from falling in.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, even though I am disappointed that there is not a larger amount of money put up.  I believe it is one of the prime necessities of the country at present.  No matter what problems we have to face, the housing problem in the country and the problem of endeavouring to do away with the slums in our cities and towns is one of the most pressing.  I believe the solving of that problem will go a long way to save the country the enormous amount of money that is at present spent in an endeavour to stem tuberculosis and other diseases which are mainly caused because of the fact that people have to endeavour to exist in houses that are not really fit for human habitation. I believe that if improved conditions could be brought about in connection with housing we would have fewer deaths from influenza, tuberculosis, and many other diseases which are at present playing so <Col N="1626" /> much havoc amongst the people of the country.</P>

      <P>There is one deficiency in this Bill, inasmuch as those who had applied for grants under previous Housing Acts and had not been able to secure them, by reason of the fact that the sum available had been already allotted before their cases had been reached, are overlooked in the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one particular matter that I feel should have been included in some specific way. I refer to houses in the poorer parts of the country that are in need of reconstruction.  Some years ago the Congested Districts Board tackled this problem in a very practical and capable way.  They allowed small sums, sums that at least induced the people to improve not the dwelling-houses alone, but out-offices and farm buildings.  They improved these houses when they got a small sum of money and improved them very much.  As far as I can see, no provision has been made in this Bill, nor in previous housing schemes, to encourage such improvement in the poorer districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the present scheme will help considerably to solve the problem of improved housing conditions, it is only capable of touching it in a very small way considering the immensity of the problem. Deputy Shaw referred to what he regarded as a regrettable factor&mdash; that the community did not realise that a certain sum of £45 was available <Col N="1627" /> as a free grant.  I do not think that it is really fair for a member of this House to speak of any sum of money granted in this way by the Dáil for a national housing problem as a free grant.  The Minister has again and again been trying to explain here that there is no such thing as a free grant.  The money voted here is money that must be collected from the people, and the people who really contribute the most of it&mdash;the farming community &mdash;have a specific grievance, inasmuch as they are likely to derive the least benefit from it, as they derived the least benefit from the previous Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>What to my mind is of primary importance in an undertaking of this kind&mdash;and I realise how important it is&mdash;is that the solution of these housing difficulties should be dealt with in a big way.  I always like to stress that the primary factor in any undertaking of the kind is that the economic conditions of the country should keep pace with any improvement in the matter of a housing scheme.  There is no use in trying to drive a coach before the horses.  In the same way, endeavouring to drive forward a progressive scheme of housing, unless side by side with it you have economic improvement in the country, is an impossibility.  Building houses for labourers down the country at the rate of £300, and charging a weekly rent entirely out of proportion to their wage-earning capacity, is not an economic proposition, nor does it go to improve the condition of the workers.  You may build houses for them, you may point out you have built so many houses in each county, you may tell the labourers you have erected so many houses for them, but it is not the labourer who will be found to occupy them but the more well-to-do person, whatever trade or department of business he may be in.  You will find in the country at the moment very few labourers in the cottages built for labourers. You will find living in them people <Col N="1628" /> for whom they were never intended. Similarly, you have houses built under the ex-service men's housing scheme and they are not occupied by ex-soldiers.  In Leitrim they are not occupied by these people.  They are built in localities where there are not many labourers and they are occupied by retired business men or retired officers of one army or another.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying that you are tackling this problem in a serious way or that you are giving this money as a free gift.  It is merely additional taxation on the people.  There is no use in saying you are using that taxation for the practical purpose of improving the conditions of the people you have in mind, the labourers, unless side by side with that you put forward some scheme to provide work for the labourers and so enable them to pay the rent which, necessarily, because of the cost of building, will be fairly high.  You are leaving the responsibility on the local authorities to take advantage of this scheme.  You might as well whistle jigs to a milestone as to ask a local authority in the country to undertake the responsibility of a housing, or any other, scheme, that will involve at the present moment one fraction of a penny on the rates.  The reason for that is that the economic situation in the country is gauged by the local authorities much better than by the Ministers here, and they realise how impracticable it is to tax the ratepayers further to the extent of even a fraction of a penny for a housing scheme unless there is side by side with that an improvement in the economic condition that will make the scheme possible.</P>
    <P>If some section were introduced into the Bill making provision so that the people in the rural, and particularly the congested areas would have facilities for improving farmers' houses and out-offices, such as was carried out under the scheme in operation some years ago when the Congested Districts Boards were functioning, there is no doubt that the scheme would be really beneficial. <Col N="1629" /> It would supply a want that exists to even a greater degree than in the slum areas in the city.  The conditions in some congested areas in regard to housing and in regard to the out-offices attached to farms are as deplorable as you can find in any city in the Free State.  I think the Government do not realise how important is that factor; otherwise I believe that in their endeavour to secure better housing accommodation they would have made some provision to deal with such conditions as I have referred to.  I desire to emphasise the very serious position in the country in regard to housing.</P>

      <P>The discussion that has taken place on this measure impresses me as if it were designed not to give any aid or assistance towards solving the housing problem as a difficult proposition.  When I was in America last year I had an interview in the Ministry of Labour with quite a number of leaders of Labour in America.  Practically all the principal Labour leaders attended at the office and, if I might put it in a single sentence, their summing up of the situation in America, as far as they were concerned, and as far as business generally was concerned, was: &ldquo;You cannot get out of an industry more than the industry can afford.&rdquo;  Now, examining that particular statement in the light of the problem we have here, the question is: What can this industry of building afford?  It affords at the moment employment to the operatives and to the master builders, and the problem, if there be a problem at all, is very much a problem for those two parties to that particular industry.  Those who are most concerned in it are the masters and the operatives, and upon them, to a very large extent, depends whether or not the housing problem, as it has been described, or the housing difficulty, as certain people put it, is ever going to be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the merest nonsense to say that money can solve the housing problem, and those who persist in saying that money can solve the <Col N="1630" /> problem know they are talking nonsense. It cannot and will not solve the problem, and if it be tried to solve the problem in that particular way it will present other serious difficulties, difficulties which it will take a much longer time to surmount than the time limit of the most pessimistic prognostications in regard to the solution of the problem in accordance with the policy that we have adopted.  Eight or nine years ago the house which could be built at the moment for £500 cost £1,000. If one were to cash in at their face value the statements made here this evening the solution of the housing problem should have been started at that time.  It was a pressing problem, a very much more pressing problem then than it is now.  If it were then started, what a nice prospect we would have before us with the cost of money at a high rate of interest, and building costs at a rate at which they were never known before, and probably will never be known again, saddled on the people?</P>
    <P>We are charged with certain things, principally by the Opposition, who seem to regard&mdash;in fact, most people seem to regard&mdash;this question as a stick with which to beat the Government.  During the last seven years one can observe in the cost of building a regular and a marked reduction.  I have mentioned 50 per cent. as between 1920 and to-day.  From 1924 down there has been a marked reduction in cost, and it was just as important and as imperative on us to have begun in 1924 the five year programme mentioned this evening by Deputy O'Kelly as it is to-day.  Would it have been good business?  Would the people whom Deputy Maguire has spoken about feel anything easier if they had saddled on their backs twice the present National Loan with one-half or one-quarter the value to show for it?  When Deputy O'Kelly mentioned this evening that this question was so important as to warrant the expenditure in the City of Dublin of £2,600,000 per annum for five years, with a State contribution of 25 per cent. towards it, what was the problem <Col N="1631" /> he was putting before us?  He was going to build 30,000 houses at a cost of £540 a house and the State contribution was to be approximately £135.  Somebody would have to find £405, either the man coming into the house or the municipality. Supposing we took him at his word and saddled the municipality with the same cost as he is prepared so lightly to saddle the taxpayer in the country, what would the position be?</P>
    <P>£3,250,000 for five years would amount to £650,000 per annum.  What is the rate to be struck in the City of Dublin to meet that liability?  Over 11/- in the £1.  Having done that, having saddled the taxpayer in this country with £3,250,000, having saddled the ratepayer in the City of Dublin with the same amount for the same period, what is the position with regard to the letting of the houses?  Taking him at his own figure, there is £270 to be paid.  They are paying for it over a period of 35 years, and taking the anuity at £6 13s. 4d., it will be found to be a pretty considerable amount, going up very close to £20 per annum.  Add to that the rates, the cost of collection, the insurance and repairs, and you have not got a sum very far away from 10/- a week. This is a great national solution for housing, having got 50 per cent. of it from the taxpayer and the ratepayer. Now you know that is all moonshine, and the next solution is, in the same breath, fix up a housing board, hand over the baby to someone else whom we can blame for it. If it should ever happen through any accident that we should come into power, they are the people we are going to saddle with the responsibility for solving the housing question. During the last seven years, with the Bill which I should say this time twelve months would practically absorb the £200,000, we will be able to show 20,000 houses, at a cost to the State of £2,050,000, and those who are particularly interested in the taxpayer can ask themselves has there been value got for that <Col N="1632" /> £2,050,000.  I believe there has.  I am not at all satisfied whether we could have got better value, but not by any of the so-called ready-made solutions we have heard here this evening. That has been the contribution we are asking the taxpayer to pay. What are the ratepayers to pay in respect to the big contribution from the Government?  Are those who are prepared to criticise us in connection with our solution of the housing problem for the last seven years prepared to go to the local authorities and say the Government is doing its bit?  It is up to the local authority to do the same.  The only Deputy whom I heard this evening put forward that solution was Deputy Rice, and he has made a study of this problem. He is not interested in the mere political side of it.  He is not interested in scoring off political opponents.  This particular problem will not be solved on public platforms or by endeavouring to solve it by the getting of a national housing board.</P>

      <P>I will certify that if other Deputies had done as much to find accommodation as Deputy Rice we probably would have it settled.  There is a burden to be borne in this particular problem. Who is to bear it?  There are only the two persons in the community, the taxpayer and the ratepayer. They are very often the same individual. Having solved the housing problem, taking the most elaborate estimates of the number of houses required, assuming it is double what was estimated at the time the convention sat here in Dublin in 1918 or whatever time they sat, my recollection is that they required 27,000 houses at that time.  We will double the number and make it 60,000 houses.  Assume there are seven persons in each one of the families to be provided with houses.  You have 400,000 people concerned.  Let it not be lost sight of that there are 2,900,000 people to be taxed to provide for the 400,000 people and those <Col N="1633" /> who will not get the houses are at least entitled to ask that value should be got in respect of this service.</P>
      <P>That has been one of the main planks in our policy during the last seven years and no one can deny but that considerable improvement has been effected during these years. In the same way Deputies are disappointed that the local loans are not open in respect of this service. Now anybody who has examined the financial situation for the last month or six weeks will know that this certainly is not a good time to borrow. Money is tight and dear.  That is certainly not the time to borrow, and the cost, if one borrows at present, must fall on the man who is going to get possession of the house.  When we say we can borrow money to solve this problem we can only borrow it if it can be shown that real value can be got for the money.  That is the problem to be solved, and political speeches will not solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have found fault with this particular measure because it did not go far enough, because the same sums of money were not provided that were provided formerly. The first housing effort was £1,000,000 of a free grant in the proportion of £2 to £1.  I have already told this House on many occasions that of the 94 local authorities in this country at that time, only something like 74 of them accepted that offer.  The other 20 did not consider that they were getting value in getting £2 for £1 and putting 1/- on the rates.  Some of them are, I suppose, in the same frame of mind still. Later in the 1924 Act the sum which was laid down was £100 for a five-roomed house, £80 for a four-roomed house, and £60 for a three-roomed house.  The Bill which followed that reduced the sum by £5 per room. This Bill is on much the same lines, following the reduction in the cost of the provision of the houses and easing the burden on the taxpayer. I wish that those who are so concerned in connection with the housing situation in Dublin had examined their consciences before they took certain steps, some seven or eight <Col N="1634" /> years ago, because their activities at that time shook the foundations of quite a number of premises in Dublin, and made the problem much more difficult of solution.</P>

      <P>Any complaint made was that there were no reconstruction proposals in this Bill.  Deputies seem not quite to understand what is meant by reconstruction. Reconstruction does not simply mean the repair of a house.  It means, in respect of a pretty considerably sized house, that it would be capable of being adapted to house a larger number of families than it formerly held.  For example, one of those houses in one of the Squares, with a little readaptation, might be let out into flats and so house three or four families where formerly it held one. In the same way it was hoped, at that time, to reconstruct certain military barracks, and to make them available for accommodation.  The total number of cases in which reconstruction took place during the four years was 837, and of these, 300 dwellings were in reconstructed military barracks.  If there had been reconstruction proposals in this measure it would not follow that a farmer's house needing repairs or anything of that sort would come in under the scheme.  If one deducted the 300 dwellings which were reconstructed in the case of military barracks, the other 500 cases were just as expensive on the State as the housing scheme in Cork, where there would be a 100-house or a 150-house scheme; or in Waterford, where there would be a 20 or a 30-house scheme, and so on through the country.  It was an expensive service and one which in the present circumstances we are not justified in continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass read out a portion of this report in which there was an extract given from the report of the <Col N="1635" /> Local Government Departmental Housing Committee of 1913.  I remember the time when the Committee held this inquiry and when it reported. I am speaking from memory. The recommendation of that Committee was that 14,000 houses were required.  As far as the reference to morality is concerned I would recommend the Deputy to pursue his inquiries in this direction and to go back to a still more distant period, the period in which the Corporation of the time sought to have the Plunkett Street and the Coombe area dealt with as an insanitary area, look up the evidence of the parish priest of that district, which was probably the most intense slum area in the city of Dublin, and see the tribute he paid to the morality of the people.  The conditions there were much worse than anything that now exists in the city of Dublin.  There is nothing in that statement which discloses immorality.  But the point with regard to that is, if there be the dangers that are involved there, there ought to be an effort on the part of everybody to have them remedied. The question is: Where are those efforts to come from?  The Government can bring parties together. They can bring them into a room and get a chairman to preside over them; they can exhort them to find accommodation, but they cannot make them do it.  There must be a sense of citizenship there, and there must be an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem.  There must be a real sense of citizenship.  We cannot do more than make an exhortation and point out the need for it.  If I was a cranky individual on either side, listening to the speeches made here this evening, I would say as long as you have people whose simple solution of the housing problem is more money from the taxpayer there is no necessity for us to come to an accommodation.  The money in respect of housing would be much more easily got by local authorities if there was not such a gap between the actual value of the house when constructed and the cost <Col N="1636" /> of making it.  Deputies know, when complaining that banks will not lend money, that the banks are simply doing what individuals would do if they were asked to lend money in the same circumstances.  There is no great difficulty, if there is a sound proposition, in getting the ratepayers of a town to take portion of a loan if it is going to help in a difficult period.</P>
    <P>My general opinion of the discussion that has taken place here this evening is that every person has selected some difficulty in this matter. One says there is no return from the operatives; another says there is not enough money from the Government; a third says there is mismanagement on the part of the builder; a fourth says the money is not cheap enough; a fifth says the only way of solving it is by salting the taxpayers of this country.  It certainly is not creditable to this Dáil, and it is not going to solve the housing problem.  No housing board is going to solve it.  If we mean business in connection with this matter, there ought to be more pressure put upon both the principal parties to this industry.  The industry cannot afford more than is in it, and the people of the country expect, when they put in such a huge sum of money as £2,000,000 in seven years, that there ought to be better results even than what we have got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters in connection with this question, not, perhaps, dealing directly with the Bill, but mainly with what the President has just said, that I would like to comment upon.  He has ridiculed the suggestions that have been put up by every Party in this House, both here and elsewhere, for a solution of the housing problem.  We all admit there is a problem.  There is no question about that.  I was waiting anxiously to hear from the President his solution of the housing problem.  He, more than anyone else, being charged with responsibility, ought to be in a position to make a contribution towards the solution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> We have heard no solution from him. If the solutions which have been suggested are to be criticised or ridiculed, the least we ought to expect from the President, who ridicules and criticises them, is his own solution of the problem.  We have not heard it. He started off his speech by making a statement which I, in any case, do not agree with.  He talked of the two parties involved in the question of housing, the builders and the builders' operatives, and stated these were the two bodies principally concerned. I totally disagree.</P>
    <P>It is the people in this country who want houses who are most concerned in the problem and not the builders or the building operatives &mdash;neither one nor the other.  If the President is taking up the position that it is possible for these two parties to hold up the building of houses, I for one do not agree.  Like Deputy Rice, I do not know where the blame should be placed in this matter.  I do not agree with the President that one or other of these bodies, or both of them together, should be allowed to stand in the way of a national solution of a national problem.  With regard to what has happened in connection with this Conference, we have heard statements made by one side and the other.  We have heard to-night for the first time that the builders as well as the operatives at, what Deputy Cassidy, I think, called, this purely Dublin Conference, put up proposals.  We do not know what they are.  Perhaps Deputy Good could tell us whether they were put up after or before the suggestions were put forward by the other side. I do not wish to discuss the proposals put up by one side or the other, but we have had it from Deputy Rice that the contribution made by either one side or the other was not, in his opinion, a contribution within the recommendations of the Unemployment Committee's Report.</P>
    <P>I have very great respect for Deputy Rice, and have a high opinion of his judgment, but, with all respect to him, I do not think <Col N="1638" /> that it is, or ought to be, the case that he and he alone in his own judgment, ought to be in a position of saying that these proposals were not contributions that ought to be considered towards the solution of this great question.  It all comes back to this, that Deputy Rice is the pivot of the whole building problem in this country.  That is what it really comes to.  The builders put up proposals which, in their judgment or wisdom, they thought were contributions to the solution of the problem. The workers, on the other hand, put up proposals which they thought were contributions.  Deputy Rice has stated in this House that in his judgment&mdash;and it has not gone beyond his judgment&mdash;neither of the proposals was such as would be of any use towards solving the problem. I suggest to the Government that it is not right that the matter should be left at that stage.  I will not say any more than that.  I think that the responsibility is with them.  I put it that it is up to them to find a solution and, if one side or the other to this conference is not in a position to put up what they, as responsible people, consider to be a solution, it is for the Government to find a solution and put it before the House, irrespective of what the workers or builders think to be right or fair.</P>
    <P>You will always have this negotiating and manoeuvring for position which goes on at conferences of this kind.  I do not think that it was fair of Deputy Rice to read out the statement with regard to portion of the proposals put up from the workers' side unless he was in a position to give us the general atmosphere&mdash;for instance, what caused them to think that what the master builders were after was an actual worsening of their working conditions and a reduction in their wages.  The President told us what he discovered in America.  There are others of us who happen to have been in America, and one thing we did not find anywhere in America as leading to a solution of the problem was a reduction of wages or a worsening of the conditions of service in regard <Col N="1639" /> to operatives.  If the President made inquiries he would have found that there was such a thing as rationalisation, or something like it, not alone in the building but in other industries in the States that led to more and better work being done without any reduction as regards workers' wages and conditions. Quite the contrary.  The President talks about the difficulty of entrusting the solution to anything in the nature of a national board or a national building trust, and he objects to handing over the baby to any such body.  When, however, it was a question of the provision of another commodity, such as electricity, there was no such objection on the part of the Government. When electricity had to be produced on a national basis we handed over that baby to a board, or trust, and we do not think that the country is going to lose by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as sure of it as I can be of anything.  I suppose Deputy Good would have the same objections to a national housing trust as he has to the Electricity Board and that his reasons for those objections would be the same.  I cannot understand the attitude of the President in regard to this matter.  With one voice he tells us that the mythical fifteen millions about which we have been hearing for the last three or four years can still be got, and in another voice he tells us that it is not a good time for borrowing.  Which is it?  Will he tell us what he and the Government understand by an economic basis for borrowing these fifteen millions? When do they hope to get down to it?  The President says that the cost of building has been going down at a pretty rapid rate for seven years. When does he hope to reach the point at which it will be down sufficiently far for him to announce his comprehensive policy, if he has one? I took it that there was something like that in his mind, especially from what the Minister for Local Government <Col N="1640" /> said when he gave it as one of his reasons&mdash;I think it was rather an extraordinary reason&mdash;for not opening the Local Loans Fund and giving money to local authorities to encourage them to build more rapidly.  He gave me the impression that if that were done it would keep up the cost of building, as there would be so much building going on. Am I to infer that the policy of the Government is that the less building there is the more likely is the cost of building to come down?  That seems to be extraordinary reasoning, but that is what I gathered.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with those who say that this ought not to be made a Party question.  Deputy Good and another Deputy fell into the common mistake of saying that it should not be a political question.  That is a misunderstanding, in my opinion, of the highest meaning of the word &ldquo;political.&rdquo;  These are the people who apparently think that politics mean only one thing in this country. It should not, however, be made a Party question.  We should all do what we can to try and find a solution. We ought to have from the Government, that is charged for the time being with responsibility to the people of the country as a whole, a better contribution than we have heard up to the present as to what their solution of the problem is.  We have here a Bill which is, admittedly, merely a temporary measure.  We seem to be getting further and further away from that comprehensive building scheme about which we heard so much during the past year or two.  If they have not a solution let them say so, but if they have such solution, I hope that before the debate closes we will hear from the Minister, on behalf of the Government, what their solution is.  They object to handing over the baby to a board, but they are really handing it over to an unauthorised body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are putting the blame on the conference of builders and workers. It seems to me that that is the position that is taken up by the President. I do not know whether I understood him properly, but he said <Col N="1641" /> that it was a problem for those two bodies who were the most concerned with it.  It seems to me that he is handing over the problem to them and is waiting for their solution.  If that is not so, let us hear from the Minister, on behalf of the Government, what their solution is for dealing with this national problem, which is of very great importance. If their solution is better than anything that has been suggested from these benches, I will be prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Morrissey opened the debate to-day he spoke of the Minister as not looking upon this question from a national or broad outlook.  Most of the speakers who followed him welcomed his statement that this problem should be looked upon from a national or a non-Party standpoint. Nevertheless, I notice that practically all the speakers who spoke to-day of the housing problem have confined themselves practically to the housing problem as it exists in the urban areas.  I take it that this Bill is brought in for the purpose of relieving congestion and improving housing conditions generally, but it refers, or it practically comes to that, to the housing conditions of dwellers in the towns, especially Dublin and the bigger towns.  The rural population, to which this Act and every Housing Act should apply, are the rural slum population in the West, along the coast&mdash;fishermen and those who live by the sea in the western counties of Galway, Donegal, Cork, Kerry and along the seaboard.  There is nothing in this Act which can be of any value to them, or nothing in it which follows up the promises made by the Government in the Gaeltacht debate and since, in the various replies made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing conditions at present in the Gaeltacht are worse, I believe, than in the towns.  I have heard Deputies refer to the number of people they have seen in two and <Col N="1642" /> three-roomed houses.  Some Deputies have said that a three-roomed cottage is not a fit house for a family in town.  I know that in my area, along the western coast, and the Minister knows it, too, there are houses where there are from 10 to 17 persons living in one room.  This Bill will in no way facilitate a solution of the housing question in these areas to which I refer.  Some time ago questions were asked here as to the policy the Government were adopting in the improvement of housing conditions in the West.  One answer was that houses were already being built in the congested areas by the Land Commission. Since that reply was given here I have travelled through the West of Ireland and I have not seen, except in the case of the wild cat scheme in the Cloosh Valley, any houses built by the Land Commission or any other Government Department. The Minister for Fisheries, replying to a question of mine here, stated that the heads of the different Departments were conferring with a view to reporting on the conditions and on the steps to be taken as regards housing.  That reply was given to me before Christmas.  I believe that Conference of the heads of the Departments was held, but whether any report was drawn up or whether the Government acceded to their demands, I do not yet know.  What I do know is that conditions as regards housing in the West are as bad as, if not worse than when the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, who is responsible for the Bill, travelled through Connemara and he knows the conditions as well as I do.  He knows that the C.D. Board, which built houses, roofed houses, and built stables and out-houses for the congested people, was done away with and that nothing has been done to set up in its place some body to deal with the urgent and pressing problems that the Gaeltacht Commission undertook to relieve.  It may be said that this grant of £45 will be of some value in roofing a house.  I do not know that it can be <Col N="1643" /> used for roofing; I do not think it can; but it might be said that it would be of use in rebuilding in the West.  This grant of £45 will be of no value to the people in the West, who cannot afford to purchase materials and erect houses on the off-chance that the £45 will come along later.  What the people are anxiously looking for is some scheme whereby a loan or a grant could be given, even if the grant were not so big, or even if a loan could be given by the Land Commission on the same conditions as loans were given by the C.D. Board.  That would satisfy the people so far as the housing question is concerned.  The materials will not be given to these people by the importers in the towns until they produce cash for them.  For that reason these grants have not been availed of, so far, by the people in the West.  Other Acts brought in here, on the same principle as this, were not utilised by the people in the poorer districts in the West except perhaps by shopkeepers and rather well-to-do people.  None of the congested people, who dwell along the shore and who have families of seven, eight or nine living in one room, availed themselves of these grants so far, and will not avail themselves of this Bill.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will let us know whether any further steps are to be taken to improve housing conditions in the West and whether the Report of the heads of Departments has been printed or whether it will be acted upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the passing of this Bill because it singles out a great and noble profession for penal treatment by the application <Col N="1644" /> of compulsion.  I suggest that compulsion has never had the authority of the people and that the major portion of the people are absolutely hostile to compulsion being applied to this profession in this particular way.  I object to the passing of the Bill because it is harmful to the legal profession and harmful to the Irish language.  Fifteen Deputies in this House have had the courage of their convictions to stand up and say that this Bill was a harmful Bill which should never have been introduced. They have offered determined opposition to the Bill and I do say, that even if this Bill passes, the service which these 15 men have rendered to the country is not to be lightly passed over.  Had this Bill passed in its original form the city of Dublin would have lost much by its passing.  We would have, in the first place, lost the great Law Schools which every citizen of the country should be proud of.  We would have the great Law Schools of the country practically destroyed.  We would have had a serious financial loss imposed upon the citizens, especially the citizens of the city of Dublin, and we would have suffered also a serious loss of prestige by the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was rather surprised at the hostile opposition given by certain members to this Bill and referred to the amount of hostility shown to the Bill.  Is the penalisation that this Bill undoubtedly imposes likely to foster enthusiasm for, or help the propagation of, the Irish language in this country?  If one were to regard the statement of the Minister for Finance on the one hand and the statement of the Minister for Justice on the other, I think that the answer to the question, and to the surprise expressed by the Minister, would be contained in the statement that the Minister for Justice has made.  The Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;It is only by the co-operation of the Bar and only by the co-operation of the solicitors that this Bill can be made a working success.&rdquo;  Only by co-operation! Does the Minister for Finance expect the co-operation of <Col N="1645" /> the legal profession in a measure such as is now being passed through the House?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said if the Incorporated Law Society was to be so foolish as to try to thwart the intention of the Oireachtas it would be an easy matter to deal with them. While we have one Minister pleading for the co-operation of a great profession, a profession that has always done its duty to the people, and to the State, we have the other Minister, on the other hand, with this plain threat of what will happen should the Incorporated Law society stand up for the rights of the profession which it represents. How can co-operation be expected from any body of men under circumstances such as these?  I do believe that that speech, and the speeches of those who stand for this Bill, will have very harmful reactions in the country.  I suggest that recent events in this city have shown some of these harmful reactions.</P>
    <P>References were made here to the teaching profession.  Is it not a fact that even the teaching profession itself, upon which the future of Irish so much depends, is hostile to the measures at present being adopted? I suggest that even amongst the highest educationalists in this country very grave differences of opinion exist as to the advisability of compulsory Irish.  With all respect, I do suggest that the Irish language should not be made the shuttlecock of Party politics.  The Irish language is the common heritage of all Deputies, whether they come from the black North or from the South.  The men from the North are equally entitled to claim that heritage as their right as the men from the South.  The Irish language, as far as one can look at it dispassionately, quietly and without prejudice, has been reduced to the level of a bribe for those who are seeking jobs in this State.  Under present conditions, the Irish language is practically the passport to every Government Department.  If you cannot propagate the Irish language <Col N="1646" /> without the aid of this bribery, without holding out corrupt measures for its propagation, I suggest that the future of the language is gravely imperilled.</P>

      <P>I will say this: we have a principle involved in this Bill which is permeating steadily through every phase of the activities of this House.  We have here the principle of compulsion from the first letter of the Bill to the last.  I am surprised to see Deputy Davin supporting this Bill, who would not have the same principle applied to young men of fifteen joining the trade union to which he belongs.</P>

      <P>If this principle of compulsion is to be applied to the great learned profession of the law, it is only reasonable and equitable, as Deputy Hennessy said, that it should be applied to every profession and every walk of life in this State.  It should, in the first instance, be applied to this House.  I think when we come to take a vote upon the application of it to this House, that instead of having 110 votes in favour of compulsion we shall have 110 votes condemning compulsion.</P>

      <P>The framers of this Bill did not state that the standard of knowledge set for those engaged in the legal profession under the aegis of the Bill is an absolutely impossible standard.  If a man in the legal profession, under the Bill as it now stands, is to qualify for practice at the Bar, his standard of knowledge must be such that he can conduct the business of his clients in the Irish language.  Does anybody realise what standard of knowledge a lawyer at the Bar would require for the carrying out of such duties as this?  Does anybody realise that in the existing vocabulary of Irish the standard is impossible?  Does anybody realise that at present we are coining words every day to fit in with new words that we are meeting as we go along?  We have been referred by the Minister for Finance to the standard in the teaching profession.  I say that there is no comparison between the standard set in the teaching profession and the standard set in the legal profession. The standard in the teaching profession and the standard in the legal profession are as widely apart as the poles.  If, under the Bill, a high standard of Irish had been required from those entering the legal profession, and it finished at that, not a single member of the legal profession would have objected. They would have been prepared to accept the Bill as part of the national programme of this country&mdash;to welcome the Bill and accept that standard.  But here we are set a standard that it is absolutely impossible to attain.  Precedents have to be quoted, case law has to be quoted, many legal terms have to be quoted, and a barrister getting on his feet before a Judge will have to coin these new terms out of the depths of his own imagination in order to comply with the standard in the Bill.  That is not an exaggerated statement.  The terms he will use will be purely imaginary terms.</P>

      <P>When one considers, <Col N="1648" /> in connection with the work of this House, the difficulties that exist and the time taken in turning the various measures passed through this Assembly into the Irish language, one can realise the task that you are asking the legal profession to undertake under this Bill.  I cannot understand why there should not be equality of treatment for every section of the community, why the legal profession should be selected for this special treatment.  I have proved and demonstrated in this House on a former occasion that there are quite sufficient speakers of Irish in the legal profession to deal with any legal business that may arise in which Irish is necessary. The standard of knowledge laid down by this Bill is an unjust standard; it is a tyrannical standard; it is, as the Incorporated Law Society put it, an absolutely impossible standard.  If this Bill were introduced fifteen years hence it would be in ample time.  This Bill is fifteen years before its time.  The next generation would have been ample time for the introduction of this Bill.  If the Bill were introduced then the primary and secondary schools would have turned out their various quotas of Irish-speaking units, and there would be an equal chance for all.  As the Bill stands at present, five per cent. of the population of the whole country will be able to avail themselves of it and the remaining ninety-five per cent. will be practically debarred from doing so.  We are told by some Deputies supporting this Bill that this standard had been adopted by every other country in the world. That was purely a general statement. There has been nothing but generalities in support of this Bill. Not one genuine logical argument has been put forward to support its passing.  I remind those who make those statements that they ought to look at Wales; no such standard exists there.  Let them look at Belgium and they will see that no such standard exists there.  The great farce of this Bill is that we are denying the right of Irish students to go to the Bar to practise unless <Col N="1649" /> they prove that they have a competent knowledge of the Irish language. We deny them the right to practise in their own country while, under this Bill as now framed, Scottish and English students, who have practised at the English Bar for three years, can come over here and practise when they like.  So that we have a Bill giving preferential treatment to people across the water.</P>
      <P>Some speakers from the Opposition Benches went so far as to say, &ldquo;Penalise the legal profession; they deserve it.&rdquo;  Are there not far greater and much more important consequences involved in this Bill than the mere fact that 800 or 1,000 lawyers are forced to acquire a certain standard of the Irish language that this Bill demands?  This Bill when it leaves this Dáil will have done far more to perpetuate partition between the two branches of the profession in Northern and in Southern Ireland than any Bill that has ever passed this House.</P>

      <P>Northern Ireland, to the great regret of the King's Inns in Dublin, set up a separate Bar. Certain causes led to that, but it was one of the most regrettable things that ever occurred to the Bar of Ireland. But instead of removing that barrier, this Bill tends to perpetuate it.  I suggest that there should be some little reason actuating Deputies. I suggest that there should be fair consideration for those who oppose a measure of this sort.  If people have the moral courage of their convictions, and stand up and oppose a measure of this kind, because they believe it is harmful to a great profession and to the interests of the Irish language, which it is intended to serve, surely they are entitled to get credit for the honesty of the statements they make, for the honesty of their beliefs and for honesty in their opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> This Bill will have reactions outside this little southern portion of the country.  There are those who speak against this Bill, who look forward to the day when Ireland will be the geographical unit it properly is and should be, but the passing of this Bill will be no aid to the bringing about or the arrival of that day. Of course, we had some very eminent patriots standing up in support of the passing of this Bill.  It was a glorious day for Ireland that this Bill should pass through this House.  Deputy Hugo Flinn was very proud to be in his place when it was carried by 110 Deputies to 15. The citadel of the King's Inns had fallen, and the forces of nationalism in all their might were marching victoriously to new victory.  The whole forces of nationalism were arrayed against reaction.  We had on the one hand as the standard-bearer in this great fight a distinguished lawyer and we had on the other hand Deputy Hugo Flinn.</P>

      <P>There are in this Bill principles that will be very harmful to the future of this country.  I do not regard the passing of this Bill from the same point of view as those Deputies who are singing their songs of victory.  I say this Bill will do lasting harm to the legal profession, which has always done justice to the country and to the citizens of the country.  I want to say further that this Bill will do the greatest possible amount of harm to the Irish language itself.  If this Bill set out to do anything which was equitable, no opposition would be offered by me to its passing; but this Bill singles out one of the greatest and noblest professions in the country to penalise it <Col N="1651" /> for no purpose whatever except to catch votes for certain Deputies.  I ask the Dáil, even at this last hour, to have some reason, and to consider one thing in this Bill, and that is the standard of knowledge it sets up&mdash; an impossible and unthinkable standard, and a standard which can only do harm instead of doing good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this Bill because it savours too much of compulsion and dictation, and that compulsion and dictation are intensified by some of the speeches made in support of it.  Threats were used. Names such as &ldquo;anti-Irish,&rdquo;&ldquo;anti-national,&rdquo;&ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; are applied to those who are opposed to the Bill.  Personally, I resent threats.  I strongly resent being called anti-Irish or anti-national.  Speeches such as these are not arguments; they only show weakness.  As far as Deputies Conlon and MacFadden are concerned, I believe they are sincere in their convictions, and that they honestly believe they are taking the best steps to promote the Irish language. I respect their convictions because I believe they are honest, but from my point of view I am fully convinced that by promoting this Bill they are doing a bad day's work for the language and a bad day's work for the Free State.  I love my country as much as any member in this House.  I was born in Ireland, I have lived all my life in Ireland, and all my interests are in this country. I would like to see this country politically honest, peaceful and prosperous. If it is the view of some people that a person in that position is anti-Irish and anti-national, then I make them a present of their opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which this Bill was introduced almost creates a precedent. For instance, before the Censorship of Publications Bill was introduced there were reports issued and various associations were consulted. The Game Protection Bill, which we are promised in a short time, will not be dealt with in the same manner as this Bill.  The Game Protection Association will be consulted, together with several other <Col N="1652" /> interests, in order that a Bill may be drafted that will be useful and workable. Not so in the case of this Bill dealing with the legal profession. That profession is most vitally interested in this matter.  Is the spirit in which this Bill was introduced and supported in this House the spirit that will tend to unite Irishmen? Before this Bill was introduced there was no consultation, no <i>rapprochement,</i> with the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar.  Why then blame the legal profession for the attitude they have taken up?  If I were a member of the Incorporated Law Society, because of the manner in which this Bill was introduced and because of the speeches made in this House in support of it, I would treat it with defiance.</P>
    <P>Between solicitors and barristers there must be some 1,300 or 1,400 in the legal profession in the Free State.  I believe the vast majority of these men are good Irishmen.  I am sure the brains, education and training of the members of the legal profession are as high as the brains, education and training of the average member of this House.  Yet you do not consider it worth while consulting them.  Have you any reason for thinking that members of the legal profession are not good Irishmen, and when they differ from you in a matter they consider of importance to their profession, what right have you to call them anti-Irish, anti-national, reactionaries, etc.?  I say you have no right.  It is simply intolerance and petty interference with an honoured profession.  Prussianism, if you like to call it so, is not the spirit in which Irishmen should meet one another.</P>

An páiste atá 15 bliana d'aois, tá sé ag foghluim na Gaedhilge le sé no seacht de bhliantaí agus muna bhfuil Gaedhilg mhaith agus a shaith Ghaedhilge aige, bhal ní scoláire é agus ní dhéanfar dligheadóir as choidhche.

      <P>I tried to intervene in this debate at an earlier stage but was not fortunate enough to catch the Speaker's eye.  Perhaps it is just as well because much that I would have liked to have said has been said with greater eloquence and greater force by other speakers, perhaps, as far as I know, by the last two, Deputy Clery and Deputy Mongan.  However, there are one or two observations that I would like to make.  In the course of this debate which has taken rather a wide range, there were appeals made, by more than one speaker, to an ideal that all of us, Irishmen, cherish, the hope of an ultimate unity.  This was expressed in splendid language and phraseology of which I am not master.  We were reminded of historical parallels.  We were reminded of that great motherhood which had the power in the past as she has still the power to amalgamate foreign and heterogeneous elements into herself. That was a note that I think struck a responsive chord in the hearts of every one of us.  It certainly was a note that appealed to me but I could not reconcile that with other remarks, warnings and threats, indeed with language that almost amounted to sneers and gibes at those who differed from the speakers and ventured to express <Col N="1657" /> opinions which they conscientiously held.</P>
      <P>It is the first time since I have been in the Dáil that we have been recommended to speak with bated breath, with whispering humbleness, to gag ourselves.  I am not going to listen to that warning because I do not believe that it represents the opinion of the Dáil.  It is no good our coming here and not expressing openly what we think.  I know that in an ideal State there should be no lawyers at all, but as the Free State is only approximating towards perfection&mdash;I gathered that from the criticisms of the Government&mdash;we have to have lawyers, but it seems now to be contended that lawyers should have no opinions or at least should not express them.  It seems, too, to be resented that we have tried to express the views that we know are held and conscientiously held by two great professions in this country.  I am not more intimately acquainted with the technicalities of these professions than any other member in this House but I do know members of the profession and I know they are as good Irishmen, I will not say as myself, but as any other Irishman here, and I know they would not speak so forcibly if they did not believe that the views which they are advancing and desire to be expressed are views that are good for the country.  I did find it&mdash;and it was with some pain that I found it&mdash; hard to reconcile these professions of mutual toleration, these aspirations for mutual understanding and toleration, with the advocacy of methods which, to say the least, were intolerant.  Indeed, one speaker went so far as to be frank and call them coercive and penal.  That is one point I would like to bring before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think you cannot speak with two voices on this matter.  There are certainly two voices speaking in many of the speeches.  As regards the argument by which this Bill has been urged, I suppose it is idle at this hour to point out the usual line of argument, which runs briefly: Irish is a good thing, therefore compulsory <Col N="1658" /> Irish is a good thing.  That argument involves a gross, flagrant and glaring fallacy; I can see no way of justifying it.  It is, as I said, idle now to stress it, and it is possibly equally idle to state that we, who protest here against compulsory Irish, are not protesting, are far from protesting against the revival, preservation and encouragement of Irish by any reasonable, by every equitable means.  I say it is idle to make such protestations as that now, for the Minister for Finance has discovered that we do not know what we say, or else that we do not mean what we say.  He has said categorically&mdash;I think I am quoting correctly&mdash;that when it comes down to hard facts, the man who does not know Irish nearly always is out to kill it.  In other words, we who have stated that we are in favour of the legitimate encouragement of Irish are either self-deceived or are deliberately deceiving the Dáil.  I do not know whether the Minister was really serious when he made a statement of that sort.  I do not know whether he really believes that intelligent men can so deceive themselves or that decent men can go out and so deliberately deceive others.  I do not know whether or not he would be willing to subscribe to that as a general proposition.  Does he believe that every person in the Dáil who does not know Irish hates it and is out to kill it?  If so, I have listened to the speeches on this Bill, and one thing I noted is the number of speakers who declared themselves supporters of this Bill and, in the same breath, deplored their ignorance of Irish.  There was one speaker who had a wider acquaintance with natural history than I have got who talked of bunny rabbits and tenacious molluses.  He told us of his desperate attempts to learn Irish.  He outdid the spider in his determination. The spider tried seven times and succeeded in the seventh.  I think it was thirty times he tried. He is a strong supporter of the Bill, and he does not know Irish on his own admission.  There were others who admitted the same.  Are we to assume that they are out to kill <Col N="1659" /> Irish?  Perhaps that is the meaning of this Bill, that these Deputies are out to kill Irish.  Well, I am not going to be a party to that deep-laid conspiracy.</P>
    <P>I am going to vote against the Bill and save Irish.  I hope Deputy Mongan will count that to me for righteousness.  I have talked of bad psychology.  I do not, to be serious, admit that the Minister for Finance's psychology is much better, but I think that it is a poor Bill that hobbles along to the Report Stage on two crutches of bad logic and worse psychology.</P>
    <P>Turning more particularly to the Bill, there are just two points I would like to stress; one I mentioned on the Second Reading.  I drew attention to a point to which the Minister for Justice drew our attention, that this Bill involves an entirely new principle.  His words are: &ldquo;In this Bill Irish is made compulsory for persons who have received no Government money in the course of their education, and who are not asking for any Government employment or any payment out of public funds.&rdquo;  That the Minister for Justice characterises as a new principle. To me, it appears to be evidence of a complete lack of principle. The work of these two legal institutions is to educate in law, and I, who have something to do with education, know the importance of having the cobbler stick to his last. They know something about the law, and you are turning them now on to educate in law and in Irish.  The result, certainly for some time, will be that their students will know neither law nor Irish.  You are not making any provision for the teaching of the new subject.  The teaching of this subject, with the standard set in the Bill, will be a tedious and arduous task, and will involve very considerable cost.  I think decency demands that some provision should be made for the discharge of this mere monetary liability.  The promoters of the Bill, who might be excused at the initial stages for overlooking this fact, have not made any <Col N="1660" /> mention of that difficulty.  They have not indicated their desire to come to the help of those institutions in that matter.  The new principle seems to me to let anybody call the tune and the piper can pay himself.  I think I am right in stating that were a similar Bill promoted in another place, it would be at least followed by a White Paper giving an estimate of the probable cost of the operation of that Bill.  I think it would be well that the promoters of the Bill would reflect a little seriously on what that cost is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I would put it really under three heads.  It is going to cost them too much as regards their law school, for even now, in this amended form of the Bill, I see that students will be driven or at least encouraged, if they are going to be called to the Bar, to go across the seas.  I am sorry for it.  But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there are some &mdash;possibly those who have legal aspirations more than others&mdash;who are governed by materialistic motives, and I do see them going across to be called to other Bars and perhaps, after three years, coming back here. There is nothing to prevent them being called to this Bar.  I see our legal classes passing and I see a corresponding decay in the quality of the teaching, because large classes mean competition, better teaching and more efficiency.  I do see a certain decay in the quality of your jurists. Your jurists have made a great name for themselves in the past in many countries across the seas as well as here.  I do see that the quality of the Bar will not be what it was.  It will not be recruited now in the same way.  You have done much, by this Bill, to destroy the pride that barristers and solicitors have in the traditions of their profession and I do not see that you have got any corresponding advantage. But the biggest cost of all, and I am very serious in this, is the loss in confidence and in good will, the belief that we here can understand one another and not suspect one another, the belief that the one thing we all should try is to bring <Col N="1661" /> about a thorough-going, far-reaching, ultimate and permanent unity.  I think we will all differ from one another in minor respects, but there is no reason why we should not all be joined together in certain basic principles and I think you are going a long way to delay the attainment of that ideal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flinn said that Irish might be one of the cements to join together all the heterogeneous elements that would compose the nation in the future.  I am paraphrasing his remarks.  The real cement that binds a nation together goes deeper than any externals like language, dress, physical features or matters of that sort.  The real cements are mutual understanding and mutual good-will.  Those are the things we should work for.  Language, I will admit, might, under those conditions, contribute very materially towards that common end.  But language coupled with compulsion will not be a cement; it will be an acid, not an acid to test our nationality, but an acid that will corrode the very roots on which the union of the future should grow.  I am sorry.  I do realise that this Bill was born of enthusiasm, that the intentions of its initiators were of the best. I think that they see eye to eye with me in more respects possibly than they realise.  I am a little old, and am using the knowledge that years have given me to put these views before the House.  I think the Bill is a mistake.  It will have far-reaching and disrupting consequences.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> I do not think that anybody on this side of the House would desire that in any vote on this Bill, or on any similar measure, it should be understood that we are out to give adherence to any proposition that would make for ill-feeling or for disunion in this country.  We are as anxious as any party in Ireland to see that nothing should be done but that which would make for goodfeeling and a national sentiment that would help in uniting instead of disuniting our people.  The matter of the language, however, is to us a basic, fundamental thing, and it was certainly pleasing to me to hear Deputies, like Professor Thrift and Professor Alton, say that they stand for the language, that they are in favour of it, and that they want it to spread, prosper, and be spoken. I would, however, say that that is a new attitude on their part.</P>

      <P>It is a new attitude if the Deputies speak for Trinity College.  When Deputy Thrift spoke the other night on this subject, and said that neither he nor the University for which he spoke had ever done anything hostile to the Irish language, I listened with amazement, because I remember&mdash;I was much younger then&mdash;the Intermediate Education Commission of 1899 and the University Commission of 1902.  I remember reading carefully the evidence offered by the representatives of Trinity College, Dublin University, at the Intermediate Commission in 1899.  After I heard the speech of Deputy Thrift, I wondered if I were dreaming, especially when I heard his statement that the University for which he speaks had never done anything in opposition to the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">

      <P>I have the Deputy's words here.  He said: &ldquo;I do not oppose and the University for which <Col N="1663" /> I stand has never opposed the fostering of the Irish language.&rdquo;  I went home, and it took me a good while to find the documents which I knew I should have.  I stayed up late and found them.  I got some of the evidence.  I have not got it all, but these are authoritative extracts from the blue books.  I find Dr. Mahaffy, Dr. Atkinson, and even Dr. Gwynne attended the Intermediate Education Commission, and with all the influence they possessed, and with all the strength of language that they were masters of, protested against Irish being allowed on the programme of the Intermediate. Was that fostering Irish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Gwynne, I believe, has changed his mind since then, but I found this piece of evidence: &ldquo;Dr. Edward Gwynne, S.F.T.C.D., said: I suggest that Celtic, by which term modern Irish seems to be indicated, should be struck off the list of subjects.  The other languages find their place on the list, I take it, for (1) practical utility, (2) their value as educational instruments, or (3) the interest of their literature.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say: &ldquo;These grounds cannot be alleged in favour of modern Irish.  In this respect it appears to me that modern Irish has little to recommend it.  I do not deny the high interest and value of the Irish language, that is chiefly of old and middle Irish.&rdquo;  Dr. Gwynne was then satisfied that Irish should be studied perhaps by students for the Intermediate, but as a dead language.  That opinion was reinforced by Dr. Salmon at the University Commission of 1902, where he deliberately and definitely stated that he wanted Irish studied as a dead language and nothing else. We want Irish as a living language, and we want to have it made the national language of the country.  If we can get unity, understanding, and friendly co-operation on that basis we will go as far as we can to meet those who up to the present have differed from us, but it must be on <Col N="1664" /> the basis that Irish as a living national language, as the language of Irishmen and Irishwomen, is to be spoken in this country and fostered, even at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt what Deputy Alton says about Dr. Gwynne's views now.  I think he is quite right as to Dr. Gwynne's views now in regard to Irish.  I will pass this document on to the Deputy if he desires to read it.  These are extracts from the evidence given at the Intermediate Education Commission in 1899.  I have also extracts from the evidence given by Dr. Gwynne three years later.  Dr. Gwynne, Dr. Mahaffv and Dr. Atkinson, as I have stated, gave evidence in 1899 before the Intermediate Education Commission where they were the spokesmen of Trinity College.  I want to say this in regard to Dr. Gwynne, that at the Commission on University Education, which was set up to inquire into university education in general, having in view the possibility of setting up a national or Catholic University, as was talked of at that time, Dr. Gwynne again gave evidence and, after a three years' interval, the evidence which he gave was <Col N="1665" /> entirely opposed to that given at the other Commission.  He wrote an essay on the value of Irish that would be a credit to him or any other Irishman.  I want to say that on his behalf.  Further, I would like to say from what I heard&mdash;I have not the honour or pleasure of knowing Dr. Gwynne&mdash;that ever since then he has done his part in fostering Irish and I heard he got very little support in that respect in Trinity College.  I heard that from people who ought to know what they are talking about.  When I bring this matter forward it may appear to some to be unwise to go back so far, that it is not wise to rake up these things, but, after all, if it is the means of getting those who are competent to speak for Trinity College here to declare that the point of view, as represented as official on behalf of Trinity College and expressed in evidence before these two Commissions, has now changed it will probably have a very good effect and my raking up of these things will not be without good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Atkinson and Dr. Mahaffy went so far as to say, in 1899, that &ldquo;there was no literature in Irish, or that anything that did exist could not be put into the schools.  It was filthy and obscene.&rdquo;  These are their own words, Dr. Atkinson's words quoted by Dr. Mahaffy.  Perhaps it will not help further to go into that matter, but I would like, if there is to be any understanding on this matter, to know exactly where we are and where we stand, and whether those who are opposing compulsory Irish for lawyers, as it is represented to be, are opposing it first of all because it is compulsory, as they say, or because it is Irish.  I think we will want something very definite and very clear in the way of a statement, especially from the gentlemen representing Dublin University, in view of their past, in view of the past as set out in the printed record. When these gentlemen stand up here and say that they want Irish to spread, that they believe that Irish should be fostered, it is right that <Col N="1666" /> one should examine into and analyse what they say and their right for making statements of that kind in opposing a Bill of this character, because there is no evidence that they have helped voluntary Irish.  There is not one Irish speaker from Trinity College amongst their Deputies. There is no public evidence, that I know of, that one could put against this evidence here as a change in mind and heart on behalf of those who represent Trinity College.  That is what I would like to see and what I would welcome, and welcome publicly, whenever it does come.</P>
    <P>I have heard more than one speaker on behalf of Dublin University claim that they had a Chair of Irish in existence in the University for I do not know how long, some couple of centuries, and that that was and is evidence of their good faith with regard to the language. On that matter I looked up Dr. Douglas Hyde, who should be an authority.  He is a distinguished graduate of Trinity College and a very distinguished advocate for Irish.  I found, when I was looking over this for evidence, another pamphlet.  It is a reprint of an article written by Dr. Hyde and published in the &ldquo;New Ireland Review&rdquo; for December, 1899.  He says here&mdash;these are Dr. Hyde's words, not mine: &ldquo;Trinity College has now made before the Viceregal Commission, through the mouth of some of its most distinguished professors, a sweeping attack upon the Irish language and literature, and, by implication, upon the Irish race. It is thus openly taking up a position which will necessitate, on the part of Irishmen, some very plain speaking.&rdquo;  I am doing a little plain speaking which I hope will do a little good.  He says here again: &ldquo;Yet Dr. Mahaffy appeared from Trinity College before the Commission and gave the very strongest evidence possible against the Irish language and everything connected with it.&rdquo;  I do not think it is necessary to quote from Dr. Mahaffy's own words.  If anybody wishes that they should be quoted, I can quote <Col N="1667" /> them&mdash;the evidence given by Dr. Mahaffy, Dr. Salmon, Dr. Atkinson and even by the late Dr. Bernard against the teaching of Irish as a living language in the schools.  &ldquo;Dr. Mahaffy appeared from Trinity College and gave the very strongest evidence against Irish and everything connected with it.  It was not even ordinary evidence, but a long-drawn out scoff, in which he told the Commissioners that he knew, on the authority of experts, that where Irish literature was not religious it was silly, and where it was not silly it was indecent.&rdquo;  These are the words of the official spokesman.</P>

      <P>I can repudiate it certainly to this extent that it is quite at variance with the action of the college as a college on every occasion I recollect.  The action of <Col N="1668" /> the college as a college was one that might be understood by remembering that the Chair of Irish, to which the Deputy referred, has been always held by an exponent of modern Irish.  That might help him to understand the position.  Any opposition that has come from the college as a college has been to compulsion in the matter.</P>

    <P>We must now see why it was that almost the only people in Ireland who gave evidence prejudicial to the slight amount of encouragement offered to the Irish language by the Intermediate Education Board were these Professors of Trinity College, Dublin.  &ldquo;Trinity College,&rdquo; writes Dr. Mahaffy, &ldquo;to which some of the critics of this movement belong, not only contains the best theoretical students of Irish in the country, but maintains a Chair to promote the study of modern Irish.&rdquo;  Now, this &ldquo;Chair to promote the study of modern Irish,&rdquo; what is it?  On this point I feel rather reluctant to say anything, because I myself was a candidate for it when it became vacant some years ago.  It was then, however, that I discovered the true facts of the case, and they are wholly inconsistent with the claim put forward by Dr. Mahaffy.  I would not mention them at all were it not that now again, for about the twentieth time within the last few years, I find Trinity College not above dressing itself in borrowed plumes and very meanly pretending to the world that she possesses, as Dr. Mahaffy once again tells us, &ldquo;a Chair to promote the study of modern Irish.&rdquo;  She does not; if the word &ldquo;Chair&rdquo; carries with it any real academical meaning.  The Chair she possesses is not one founded for the study of the Irish language and literature, but is one which was founded by a proselytising society for the &ldquo;Scriptural education of Irish Roman Catholics <Col N="1670" /> through the medium of their own language.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I thought that was necessary, and that even on the question of Irish for lawyers it would not do a bit of harm to have a heart-to-heart talk on this subject of Irish. Some Deputy, I think it was Deputy Cooper, mentioned the National University and the fight which took place in 1910-11 to make Irish compulsory. He said he knew some graduates of that University who had to take Irish as a compulsory subject for matriculation but who now did not know Irish&mdash;I am not quoting his exact words&mdash;or, if they did, they never used it.  I do not want that state of affairs to continue, if it be true of the National University.  I should <Col N="1671" /> like to see Trinity College put its best foot forward and show the National University what it can do.  I should like to see an improvement in the National University in regard to Irish.  I do not think they are doing enough for Irish.  I think that this Bill will help both Universities to march with the times in that direction. I do not want Irish to stop at matriculation&mdash;I do not want those who have learned Irish in order to matriculate to drop Irish as soon as they have got their matriculation.  I want to see Irish used and spread, and that is one of the reasons I support this Bill, and one of the reasons why I should like to see Trinity College take up this question of Irish. I should like to see Trinity College take up the Irish language in a serious way and enter into competition with the National University.</P>

    <Title>Question on Adjournment. - Settlement of Betting Tax Prosecution.</Title>
    <P>Motion made and question proposed: &ldquo;That this House do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion I wish to call attention to a matter that I raised by question in the Dáil to-day.  It might not have been necessary to raise it on the adjournment if the Minister for Finance, to whom my question had been addressed, was in his place at the time. In answer to my question which appeared upon the Order Paper and had reference to the case of the Revenue Commissioners v. Duggan, the Minister for Defence, who replied on behalf of the Minister for Finance, said that the amount in respect of which proceedings originally began was £187 1s. 0d.  He said that the proceedings were not taken to recover this duty, but to recover penalties for the failure to pay several sums due, and that the Revenue Commissioners accepted a total penalty of £9,000, together with £187 1s. 0d. in respect of the <Col N="1672" /> duty outstanding and £650 to cover the cost of the proceedings, and that the Revenue Commissioners were advised by counsel and the Attorney-General that if the case were tried to a conclusion the total penalties that could be recovered would not exceed £9,000, and would not carry an award of costs.  I asked as a supplementary question if the Minister would state (1) whether the defendant was charged with a criminal offence, (2) whether or not the proceedings were terminated by a settlement out of court, and (3) if so by what authority the State were enabled to settle a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>With regard to the figures&mdash; taking newspaper reports for what they are worth&mdash;it was stated that 93 summonses were issued against Duggan; whether these were for mistakes or criminal offences, they were taken, at any rate, as offences under the Betting Law.  As the law has been laid down under the Betting Act, the usual penalty is £500 inflicted by the District Justice for each offence, and the minimum penalty to which it can be reduced by the District Justice is £125 for each offence.  I cannot follow the figures on that basis. If there were 93 summonses issued I cannot follow the figures as given by the Minister for Defence to-day.  He said that, assuming that a £500 penalty could be imposed in each case, the total would be £46,500, and even on that basis £9,000 was neither a fair nor reasonable settlement.  If you reduce that sum to a quarter, that is, if there were extraordinary mitigating circumstances, if the case was such that a person was ignorant or was a person who had only just started, having got a licence, and had no knowledge of the Betting Act, and no experience, and was in a small way of business, was absolutely ignorant and absolutely honest at the same time, it might then be possible to have the amount reduced in a case where such mitigating circumstances would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming all these circumstances were present in this case&mdash;perhaps they were; perhaps all the people <Col N="1673" /> connected with the case were very different from what the public know they are&mdash;it would be entirely different. Perhaps that was so.  Perhaps the man concerned knew nothing of the Betting Acts, was in a small way of business, was likely to make errors, and so on, and, therefore, from that point of view he might be excused and the penalties might be mitigated to one-quarter. But assuming that was so, then the amount would be £11,625, that is, assuming the figures I got from the Minister for Defence are correct. He said that there were 93 summonses issued, so that the maximum penalty in that case would be £46,500 and a quarter of that would be £11,625.</P>
    <P>It is a rather strange coincidence that as far back as the 28th of February certain Deputies on these benches received communications. One was from Northampton and it stated that a settlement was being attempted at that time and that the offer had got as far as £5,000.  There were also rumours and suggestions in the air that if a settlement was arrived at certain people on this side of the House would not try to expose it.  This information and these communications, naturally, would not have been taken much notice of by Deputies on this side of the House recognising that there was a criminal offence and that it was rather difficult in most States to compound a felony.  I know that in revenue losses it is possible for the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at a settlement between the parties and that it is very often done.  For example, in income tax cases where the liability is a civil liability and, also, I believe it is possible under the betting laws where the Revenue Commissioners sue for sums or find that duty has not been paid, but where they find there is no attempt at fraud, they do very often arrive at a settlement and accept certain payments in cash.</P>
    <P>The answer given to-day by the Minister for Defence on behalf of the Minister for Finance does not convince me, because we have only to <Col N="1674" /> look round the country to find glaring cases where unfortunate people are doing time in jail for much less serious offences.  There was a case in Waterford of a Mr. Eastwood who happened to be a few days late in making his returns, and against whom the State could not prove any fraud, or anything else, except that he had made a mistake through ignorance of the law or, perhaps, was negligent, but the State were not able to prove any dishonesty.  He was fined the usual £125.  He asked for time and leave to pay by instalments, but that was refused.  While in negotiation afterwards he offered £50 down, but the answer of the State was to arrest him and take him from his home.  There was no answer to the offer of the £50 as to whether they would take it or not.  If we compare the circumstances of that case and the Duggan case, then what I have stated about mitigating circumstances does not apply so far as the public knows the facts in the latter case.</P>
    <P>Everyone is conversant with the big business done by the individual concerned in the Duggan case, and knows that it was not to-day, or yesterday, that that business was started.  We are not concerned with him as an individual.  The point of view with which we are concerned is the attitude of the State to this particular case and to similar cases throughout the country.  It was an extraordinary thing to find the Minister for Finance answering a question to-day and saying that counsel and the Attorney-General advised that this was a fair settlement.  Does the Minister for Finance ask the House to believe that counsel and the Attorney-General had not all the papers before them before these proceedings were started?  If my recollection is right these papers were seized and all the documents were taken out of the defendant's office, and it was on them the prosecution was founded.  Do we take it that when the Attorney-General advised 93 summonses he had not got the correct information?  Do we take it he looked so casually at the papers and advised so recklessly that 93 summonses <Col N="1675" /> should be taken out where he should not have advised that number? Did the Revenue Commissioners, having got all the documents, examine them carefully, and finding several cases in which they could succeed, issue summonses on each of these cases?</P>
    <P>When this criminal offence has been compounded, does the Minister seriously ask the House to believe that counsel and the Attorney-General advised him it was a very good settlement?  We have heard from time to time here a lot about good settlements, sometimes even with more vehemence and stronger language than that.  Can the Minister point to any precedent for this? Remember, this was a criminal offence and if anybody infringed the laws to such an extent as to make himself liable to have 93 summonses against him&mdash;in other words, to have 93 charges flung against him&mdash;it might reasonably be considered whether that individual, whoever he was, should or should not be allowed to continue to hold his licence.  After the State took from him £9,000, with certain provisions as to costs and certain provisions as to debts and duties outstanding, they allowed him to retain his licence.  That also, strange to say, was mentioned in the correspondence which started last February in the negotiations going on in certain quarters with regard to this settlement.  Will the Minister state when these negotiations with regard to the settlement started?  Will he state whether these were taken up direct with the Revenue Commissioners? Will he state whether certain officials in the Revenue Department were opposed to any truck in the way of settlement?  Will he state if the peculiar circumstances of the time, such as the North Dublin by-election, had anything to do with it?  If not, can the Minister, by any precedent that has arisen heretofore, justify it?  If he does not justify it, will he take some action with regard to people who have been harshly and unfairly treated and who have acted innocently in several cases throughout <Col N="1676" /> the country, as in the case in Waterford where a man was put to jail, while other persons who were in a bigger way of business and able to bring influence to bear have got off in this way?  Is it because of the position and surroundings and the influences that certain people are able to bring to bear that these people are to be put in the position of being able to get out of their difficulties and get out of criminal offences while other people, unfortunate small bookmakers, must do a term in jail?  Is not that the position?</P>
    <P>I would like to have an explanation from the Minister, an explanation that will deal with the definite points that I have raised with regard to the attitude of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General, in the first instance, advised these proceedings, and he afterwards advised that the Revenue Commissioners could not succeed in them.  Seeing that the Attorney-General had all the papers of the defendant, he was in a position to prove the case. Secondly, is it the belief of the Minister, on the advice of the Attorney-General, that he could not have succeeded in these ninety-three summonses? If so, in how many was the Minister advised that he would fail?  If the Minister was to succeed in a number of the summonses, on what grounds did the Attorney-General advise the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners that there were such mitigating circumstances that the District Justice would be bound to take cognisance of in reducing the fines from £500 in each case to £125?  Is it not only in cases where there are very mitigating circumstances that that discretion is exercised by the District Justice?  In view of all that, will the Minister state when and in what particular case such a precedent has been established, and whether in the future the practice is to be resorted to of bargaining where cases, in which criminal offences have been committed, have been taken into court and have been at trial for days before the District Justice, and <Col N="1677" /> then a settlement is arrived at outside the court, without any reference being made to the District Justice in the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The action of the Revenue Commissioners in compounding this case was taken under Section 35 (1) of the Inland Revenue Regulations Act, 1890.  I will read the first few lines of the section:&mdash;&ldquo;The Commissioners may, in their discretion, mitigate any fine or penalty incurred under this Act or any other Act relating to inland revenue, or stay or compound any proceedings for recovery thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite a common thing in any cases of fraud on the Revenue, if the Revenue Commissioners see fit, to compound and accept a penalty without bringing proceedings in court. That is done in connection with almost all classes of revenue cases.  It is perhaps the commonest procedure of all in connection with income tax cases; in connection with Excise cases it occurs, and it has occurred in connection with cases under the Betting Act.  The Attorney-General did not advise that we would not succeed in these cases, though he was satisfied that in certain of them it was most probable we would not succeed.  In certain others of them he felt assured that we would succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the grounds for believing that the penalty would be mitigated, I would like to refer the Deputy to the Citroën smuggling case which is, I think, reported in this evening's papers.  That was a case which at one point it was proposed to settle.  It was a case which the Revenue Commissioners were prepared to settle for a specified sum.  The defendants, or whichever particular group of defendants were dealing with the matter, were prepared to give £2,000 less.  The settlement broke down, and the result of the Justice's decision is that, I think, the revenue has lost substantially through the failure to get a settlement. If the Deputy will look at the reports of the revenue cases where we have these minimum penalties with power to mitigate, he will find <Col N="1678" /> that it is more usual than otherwise for the penalties to be mitigated.  It is extremely common, where there are considerable numbers of cases, for mitigated penalties to be imposed. It may well be argued that these are the type of cases in which there should not be mitigation.  Yet experience shows&mdash;I do not know exactly on what grounds Justices act&mdash;that where there are large numbers of cases, and where there is consequently a liability for the total penalties to reach a somewhat staggering sum, the Justice mitigates. The counsel who were concerned in the case, and also the Attorney-General, were consulted in the matter. We are satisfied that £9,000 was certainly as much and probably more than we would actually recover if the proceedings were continued to a finish.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I did not do more than assent to the cases being settled.  I have never so far taken the line that I would force or bring pressure to bear on the Revenue Commissioners for the settlement of any cases.  This matter was dealt with in the normal way. There was no pressure of any sort for a settlement from me.  I was convinced when I heard the matter fully discussed that the balance of advantage to the Revenue was in effecting a settlement and in obtaining the sum of £9,000.  I think that is all I need say in connection with the case.  I do not know whether Deputy Ruttledge has any professional interest in the matter because that would explain his feeling strongly about it.  I am advised that if no settlement had been effected litigation would have continued for years ahead and the noble profession to which Deputy Ruttledge belongs would obtain a great deal of money out of it, a great deal more than the Treasury could obtain.</P>
