      <P>asked the President whether the Report of the Committee on the grievances of British ex-Servicemen had been considered by the Executive Council; and, if so, whether any representations have been made to the British Government on the subject referred to therein, especially on the subject of rents and housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Committee on claims of British ex-Servicemen covers a wide field and deals with a variety of subjects upon which complaints have been made.  Some of these complaints have been made against the Government here; but it would appear from the Report that, in the opinion of the Committee, the more important claims have reference to matters, such as the provision of houses under the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust and the rents charged thereon, with which the British Government are mainly concerned. Many of these matters have already formed the subject of correspondence with that Government, and copies of the present Report have been forwarded to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to Deputy Cooper, who asked a question on the Deputy's behalf on 21st ultimo, the volume of business engaging the attention of the Government at this particular period of the year is abnormally large, and they have not <Col N="1014" /> yet been able to complete the detailed examination of the Report which is necessary to enable them to determine what further representations could usefully be made to the British Government on these matters.  The whole question is, however, being thoroughly examined by the Departments concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Executive Council find time to give a detailed examination to this Report, will they bear in mind the opinion expressed by the Committee that a minimum of 10,000 houses is necessary to meet even the most modest demands of the British ex-Servicemen, and that only 262 houses have yet been built by the Trust?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Executive Council also take into consideration the question of the rents at present being charged and the recommendations of the Committee on that point, as this is a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which representations only could be made&mdash;it is not a matter over which the Government have any control.  These matters, of course, will be the subject of consideration, and most of the report, as far as I have been able to judge, is taken up with that particular question of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is proposed to revise the scale of remuneration to branch managers from April 1st next; and further, if the new scale involves the reduction of these officers' salaries by amounts varying from 20 per cent. to 50 per cent; and if he will state the reason why these reductions are considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1925 a new basis of remuneration was adopted for branch managers.  It was not applied at the time to branch managers appointed before the setting up of the Saorstát, whose basis of remuneration was left unaltered pending experience of the new scale.  Vacancies occurring in the interval were, however, filled on the 1925 scale.  33 branch offices are at present staffed by managers paid according to the 1925 scale, and 44 according to that in operation under the British Government.</P>
      <P>Experience has proved that the offices can be efficiently staffed on the 1925 scale, and that, subject to some adjustments, it operates satisfactorily. By comparison the remuneration of branch managers under the system adopted by the British Government was shown in a number of cases to be excessive.  It resulted generally in the payment of substantially more than an efficient branch manager in an office of about the same size and importance received on the 1925 scale; in one or two cases of almost 50 per cent. more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of last year adjustments in accordance with the terms of their original appointments became due in the case of a number of branch managers on the old scale. These adjustments would have involved substantial reductions in pay; indeed, the remuneration of branch managers had always been subject to considerable and undesirable fluctuations. The occasion was then taken to prepare a new scheme of payment which will be simpler and much more stable than any previous scheme, and will reflect with more accuracy and <Col N="1017" /> fairness the relative work and importance of the various offices.  The 1925 scale will in some instances be improved and the anomalies found by experience to exist in it will be remedied.  The minimum salary will be remedied.  The minimum salary will be increased.  I have examined all the instances among the pre-Treaty branch managers where the remuneration will be reduced, and have satisfied myself that the new scale represents reasonable payment for the work of the office concerned compared with that of other offices.</P>

Railway Co. have refused to supply wagons to facilitate Newry merchants who desire to import via Greenore coal and flour formerly shipped direct to Newry, and if, in view of the fact that the Newry canal will not be reopened for traffic for another six months, he will make representation to the Railway Company in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there has been no refusal to supply wagons.  The only difficulty that has arisen is in the accommodation for steamers in excess of 300 tons capacity at Greenore when the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company's own steamer is in berth.</P>
      <P>The Railway Company state that during recent weeks four coal steamers for Newry merchants have been discharged at Greenore into wagons provided on the quays.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I regret that the Volume of Estimates is not in the hands of Deputies. The reason for that is that there was some special scrutiny given to the Estimates this year in the Department of Finance, and a delay of a week or more took place before they could be sent to the printers.  I was, however, able to furnish uncorrected proofs of the Estimates to the Leaders of the different Parties, and I will be able to have the Volume in the hands of Deputies before the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill.  As Deputies are aware, the Vote on Account will provide enough money to the various Departments to carry on until the 1st August, which is the date by which, under Standing Orders, the consideration of Estimates should be completed and the legislation necessary to implement the Votes should be passed.  During the past two years it was not possible to give consideration to the whole of the Estimates before the 1st August.  In one year a large number of Estimates were passed without consideration, and last year a second Vote on Account was taken.  I hope that this year no such difficulties will arise.  I do not propose to make any statement now in connection with the Vote on Account, except to suggest to Deputies that, if possible, the discussion should be confined to some matters of general policy.  It would not be possible for Ministers to deal with details on this Vote, and it would not be making the best use of the time of the House to go into details in connection with any particular Estimate.  I suggest to the House that it would be desirable that the opportunity should be availed of for discussing matters of general policy rather than matters of detail.</P>

      <P>The White Paper which has been issued in connection with this Vote on Account lets us know that the total net Estimates for the year 1928-29 were £22,966,000 odd, but for the year 1929-30 we are asked to believe that the actual expenditure will not exceed £21,141,000.  When we contrast the Estimates which are put forward for the year 1929-30 with the swollen <Col N="1026" /> Estimates which preceded them&mdash; Estimates, say, of thirty-six or thirty-seven million pounds put forward in some of the earlier years of the present Government's administration &mdash;we naturally assume that there has been a certain change of policy, and we ask ourselves what is the impression which a contrast between this year's Estimates and those submitted by the Minister for Finance for last year is designed to give?  I know of few things more affecting in literature and life than the spectacle of a spendthrift endeavouring to reform. It is quite obvious, from the White Paper which has been issued and from the obviously inspired statements which appeared in the Press about the great efforts which the Minister was making to secure economies in public services, that the citizens of the Saorstát and, I presume, the voters in Dublin City North are asked to contemplate a strong man, not exactly struggling with adversity, but a strong man resolute to secure for the citizens of the State the greatest possible economies that can be secured in the public services.  That is a very affecting spectacle, and it is one that is calculated to appeal to the commonsense of every individual citizen and elector, but before we accept that at its face value I would like to take a general view of the Estimates, and examine them in some particulars. Unfortunately, the Appropriation Accounts are not yet in our hands, and we are not able to get that close comparison between the Estimates and the preceding expenditure which would give us a guide, or a standard, whereby we might consider this Vote on Account.  Because the Appropriation Accounts are not in our hands we have, or at least I had, in making an examination of the Estimates, to turn to the Appropriation Accounts of 1926-27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go in detail into every Estimate, but I have selected the Public Services and endeavoured to arrange them into groups.  I endeavoured, for instance, to take those Votes which would properly be submitted to defray the expenses of the Central Government.  I took <Col N="1027" /> those Votes as one group; those which deal with Law, Police and Justice as a second group; and Finance and Revenue as a third group.  In that way I have gone down the list and endeavoured to form some idea as to what the actual expenditure of these groups of services in the year 1929-30 will be as compared with the actual expenditure on the same groups which took place in the year 1926-27. I would like again to emphasise at this stage the pose which has been taken up by the Minister and the Government.  Years ago we could fling our millions broadcast.  It was necessary that the channels of patronage should be wide, and that every possible element of support that could be procured in the country should be bought or suborned. Now we are faced with a different story.  The spendthrift has come to reckon with the moneylenders, and the debt charges, which were infinitesimal in the year 1924-25, have gone up year by year, until in this current year they amount to something like £1,600,000; and if the signs and portents are to be borne out by events, they will for the year 1929-30 amount to something like £2,200,000.</P>
    <P>Now there has got to be, if not a change, at least the appearance of a change, and the Minister is resolutely bent on securing economy.  Let us go through the Estimates, take the groups as I have taken them, and see how far these boasted economies of his are going to be realised, and how far he has taken proper steps to secure their realisation by insisting, in respect of each department, that the cost of it must not be exactly commensurate with the ideas, sometimes the ambitious ideas, formed by the heads of these Departments as to their relative importance in the scheme of things, but rather with the capacity of the State to pay its way.  We will take the services that might be properly chargeable to the Central Government&mdash;the Governor-General, the Oireachtas, the President's Department, services of that type, white elephants like Haulbowline, and a <Col N="1028" /> few other things.  I find that the actual cost of the Central Government group of services in 1926-27, as calculated from the Appropriation Accounts, amounted to £2,408,759. Consider, however, those same services on the basis of the Estimates for 1929-30, with which we have been furnished.  The overhead charges, which one would think every endeavour would be made to reduce, so far from being, in the opinion of the Minister, likely to be less in the year 1929-30 than in the year 1928-29, are actually more than they were in the comparatively extravagant year 1926-27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy states that there are more Deputies drawing salaries.  Does the Deputy suggest to the people that because he draws a salary that is a sufficient explanation of the figures I am going to quote?  The actual cost of something like twenty-three services, ascribable to Central Government, in the year 1926-27 was £2,408,759 but the estimated cost of these same services for the year 1929-30 is £2,589,719, so in that one particular group, where every effort ought to be made to secure a reduction, instead of having a reduction, the Minister actually comes to us and says: &ldquo;I ask you to pass an estimate for the services included in that group which will provide for an expenditure greater than it was in the year 1926-27.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the second group&mdash;Law, Police, and Justice.  It has been the boast of this Government that they have restored law and order in this country.  That boast has been repeated on many election platforms. I think the fact that they were able to say that, apparently has been responsible more than anything else for the electoral support which they have secured.  If they have, in fact, fulfilled their boast, if they, and not a change, possibly, in the attitude and the mentality of the great bulk of the people, have been responsible for the change from 1923-24 to the conditions existing in 1928-29, then <Col N="1029" /> surely if they were zealous custodians of the public purse and if the Minister did properly discharge the duties of his office, he would refuse his sanction when the Minister for Justice came to him asking for an increased expenditure on the services relating to Law, Police and Justice.  He should refuse to sanction such an increase.  What has the Minister for Finance done?  He is responsible mainly to the Dáil for these Estimates.  They come to the Dáil with his imprimatur.  Going through the group dealing with the Office of the Minister for Justice, the Gárda Síochána, the General Prisons Board, the District Courts, the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office, and Dundrum Asylum, I find that whereas the actual cost in the year 1926-27 was £2,431,000, for the year 1929-30 the Estimate is £2,529,000.  Again, we have in that particular group of services an increase of £94,000.</P>
    <P>We come now to one in which there has been a slight change and apparently a change for the better.  Education is one of the services which no one wants to restrict or curtail in any way, provided we get value for the money.  I am sure there is no person in this Dáil or in the country who will grudge the maximum expenditure on educational services, provided we get value for the money.  I find that in this particular group of services the Minister in 1926-27 actually expended £4,594,300.  Next year he proposes to spend £4,851,530.  There is, as between these two years, a proposed increased expenditure of £250,000.  We do not quarrel with that.  What we do quarrel with is that in that particular group of services, out of the increase of £257,000, no less than £194,000 is to be swallowed up in the Office of the Minister, so that for the enlargement of the educational services there only remains so far as the actual citizens of the country are concerned, apart from those who form the bureaucracy, something like £87,000.  Out of an extra expenditure of £257,000 <Col N="1030" /> the amount that the school teacher or the school-going child gets is something less than one-third.  The rest is swallowed up in the Office of the Minister for Education.  The next group is that of Lands and Fisheries.  In that group I have included expenditure upon fisheries and expenditure upon the Land Commission.  I find that in the year 1926-27 the actual expenditure upon these two services was £751,000, and for the year 1929-30 the Estimate is £753,500.  I think in regard to the Land Commission we can say in view of the ultimate financial settlement, which was arrived at by the Minister for Finance and the Chancellor of the British Exchequer, it has become largely a rent-collecting agency for England.  To a large extent, therefore, its services to this country are unremunerative and undesirable from the point of view that it collects from land annuitants in Ireland something like £3,400,000 odd for transmission to England each year.</P>
    <P>To that extent, the expenditure upon the Land Commission is something that we are not prepared to endorse or to agree to.  But it might be held, and the figures do give some indication, that the extra expenditure on this particular group &mdash;some part of it, at any rate&mdash;is going to be absorbed by the Department of the Minister for Fisheries. You will notice that there is an extra expenditure on the group of something like £2,000.  But included in that extra expenditure for the year 1929-30, I find that the item for salaries, wages, allowances and superannuation in the office of the Minister for Fisheries has gone up from £22,000 to £28,237.  It is, in short, a repetition of what happened in connection with the Vote for Education, that instead of more money being spent actually among the people for promoting the benefit of the people in the activities of these Departments, we find that by far the greater proportion of any increase on services like this, where an increase might be justified, is going to be swallowed up by the office of the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> Now, I take the group relating to Agriculture and Forestry.  In the year 1926-27 there was spent upon the office of the Minister for Agriculture, upon forestry, by way of agricultural grants and the beet sugar subsidy, £1,916,000.  This year it is proposed to spend less than that&mdash;£1,902,000&mdash;and you will note that in this case, as contrasted with the other two groups, there is actually to be a decreased expenditure upon agriculture and for cognate purposes.  But you will be surprised to learn that, while the total expenditure upon the agricultural group of services is being reduced by £14,000, an increase in the expenditure on the office of the Minister of £41,664 is contemplated.</P>
    <P>If we tot up what these services actually cost for the year 1926-27, as compared with what the Minister estimates they are going to cost during the year 1929-30, we will find that practically there has been no reduction in the Estimates; there has been no reduction in the general cost of these services; the taxpayer has still to pay the same, and, in addition, has also to pay the debt charges, which are increasing each year.  They have already risen from £1,082,000 in the year 1926 to £1,529,000 in the year 1928-29, and next year will be something like £2,200,000.  The Minister, we understand, at the present moment is looking with a certain amount of concern to the close of the financial year.  We do not know whether the fears and forebodings of the Minister himself and of the Press are going to be fulfilled, but it certainly looks as if this year the milch cow of the taxpayer will begin to run dry.  We have come to the point where we have got to consider whether we can go ahead increasing the burden on the taxpayer, first of all by borrowing &mdash; by borrowing, as one newspaper has suggested, to meet the deficit for the current year&mdash;or whether the Minister himself is going to take some steps to secure that economy which he pretends to be zealous for.  If he decides that he will take what seems <Col N="1032" /> to him the easy way out, and if he decides that he will proceed with the Estimates upon the basis on which they have already been submitted to the Dáil, then this House must take responsibility for the inevitable consequences of that.</P>
    <P>If the Estimates go through in their present form; if this Vote on Account which you are asked to give to-day, which in giving will commit you to an acceptance of the Estimates which are shortly to be in your hands, then you are undoubtedly voting to enable the Minister next year to raise, by borrowing, whatever deficit will accrue.  If you do that the inevitable consequence must be an increase in the debt charges; and, arising out of that, because the Minister will not take steps to secure economies in those non-essential services where economies can be secured, there must be a restriction of the social services of this State.  I have said before in this House that, whatever else we may do, we cannot afford to allow the standard of living of our people to fall below the standard of living in the Six Counties or in Great Britain, because, if we do, the inevitable consequence will be to increase emigration, and further to deplete the manhood and womanhood of this country, the principal source of our wealth.  In view of that fact, and because this is the first occasion that the Dáil has of passing judgment upon the spending policy of the Government during the coming financial year, I ask that, in discharge of its principal duties as the zealous custodian of the public purse, the Dáil should refuse the Minister this Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Our complaint against the financial policy of the Ministry as shown in this White Paper will be a repetition of our complaint in previous years. Economy is practised; the Estimates are reduced by one and three-quarter millions; but when we come to an examination of the details; when we come to an examination of the methods by which this reduction has been secured, we find that the items which have been <Col N="1033" /> most heavily dealt with are items which would be calculated to give the greatest measure of employment to our people, or that it is the social services that are generally attacked. Deputy MacEntee referred to the Land Commission, and I was rather surprised to hear his statement in that connection, because I am sure he must have forgotten that a very considerable portion of the money voted for the Land Commission last year, and in previous years, was devoted to the improvements of estates.  This was a side of the Land Commission's work which has proved to be exceedingly useful, especially in the congested areas, and it has given a good deal of employment to people who were in need of employment, at the same time as it has improved the estates which have fallen into the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I think if Deputy MacEntee, when he has an opportunity, looks into the details of this Estimate, he will find that the £200,000 reduction in the Vote of the Land Commission this year is almost entirely taken up by the reduction in that special activity of the Land Commission&mdash;the improvement of estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Deputy MacEntee referred to an increase in the Education Vote, but he will find in Primary Education a decrease of £15,000, and in Technical Education a decrease of £8,000, and in one particular item, on a matter which has been brought before this House on many occasions, and which has also been mentioned in public, the necessity for building schools, instead of making progress there has been a backward step, and there is a reduction of something like £25,000.  Then we have a reduction in Unemployment Insurance, and we have again to complain that there is no Estimate for relief schemes. All these things go to show that the main economies, apart from the Army, where there is a big economy, are under the heading of what might be loosely classed as social services. We have a big reduction in the Post Office Vote, amounting to £192,000. I wonder if I would be justified in assuming that the greater portion of <Col N="1034" /> that will be attained by curtailing services of the Post Office, especially in rural areas.  Perhaps we will hear from the Parliamentary Secretary a defence of that change in attitude.  I remember a time when he was very loud in his complaints, and also his colleague, Deputy Gorey, against a curtailment of postal services in rural areas.  He had our sympathies then.  We heard complaints from him then, and from many others, that the farmer practically has to carry the whole country on his back, but when it comes to giving services the farmers and the people in the rural areas always seem to be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacEntee that it is important&mdash;nay, essential&mdash; that the social services here should be kept on a level with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but I do not think that Deputy MacEntee can keep calling out for economy, and more economy, and at the same time be insisting that the social services shall be kept on a level with those in Northern Ireland, unless he is prepared to show us quite clearly how both these things are to be effected at the same time. A vote for this motion would be an endorsement on our part of the financial policy of the Ministry and its attitude towards social services generally, and that is an endorsement I am not prepared to give. There are one or two questions with regard to general policy that I think are of importance, and that I might raise now, and ask the Ministers concerned what their attitude is.  The first point I will raise&mdash;I am glad to see the Minister for Local Government in his place&mdash;is the position in regard to house-building. I need not go into the necessity for more houses.  That is understood, but I would like to have from the Minister before this discussion is closed a clearer indication than he gave on the last day on which he was replying to a question as to what his policy is.  He has promised new legislation. Can the Minister give any indication as to the lines that legislation will take?  I do not want him to go into details, but can he give <Col N="1035" /> the House any indication as to what will be the form of the assistance that will be given, and especially what will be the position of the many people who had applied for grants, who complied with the conditions, but who found in the middle of February that the grants were all exhausted. In the Vote for the Minister's Department there is an increase under the heading of &ldquo;building.&rdquo; Will the Minister say whether that increase refers to, or is intended to cover, his new proposals, or with legislation which has already been passed?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see&mdash;I congratulate the Minister on the fact&mdash;that the Local Loans Fund has been increased pretty substantially.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what is the exact object of the increase. Is it intended to give loans to Corporations and public bodies in connection with building, or if not, what is the object?  I think the country will look to the Minister for a more detailed statement of his policy with regard to house-building during the coming year than he has given up to the present.  In connection with that matter, there is the position with regard to tenants.  We have been promised legislation by the Minister for Justice.  I do not know whether the Government fully appreciates the importance of this matter.  No indication has been given, so far, whether or not the increase of Rent and Mortgage (Interest Restriction) Act will be continued after June or not.  If not we will have the position that all houses at present controlled will be then decontrolled, and house-owners will be at liberty to take advantage of the great scarcity of houses that exists, and that must exist for a considerable time.  There is evidence that preparations are already being made by house-owners to take advantage of the termination of the Rent Restrictions Act.  Notices are being served on tenants in many places, and they are being asked, if they want to continue in occupation after June next, to pay rents that are double, treble and in many cases <Col N="1036" /> four times the amount being paid by them.  That is a serious position, and an especially serious position in the city of Dublin, and I would invite Ministers, if it were for nothing but for the sake of the election being fought in North Dublin City, to help the voters in that constituency to make up their minds one way or the other, by giving some indication as to whether or not they will confine their legislation merely to the Report of the Town Tenants Commission, because I need hardly mention that the Report of that Commission does not deal with the main difficulty, which comes from the scarcity of houses.</P>
    <P>The tenants all over the country are anxious to know whether, after the 30th June, they will be left entirely at the mercy of the house-owners; whether there will be any control, and whether the house-owners will be at liberty to charge any rents they wish?  Even if the Report of the Town Tenants Commission were put into operation, and the machinery set up which it is expected will be set up, we can take it for granted that that machinery would take some time to get into full working order.  In the meantime, the tenants would be in a very bad way.  I hope that the Minister for Finance, or some member of the Executive Council, will throw light on this matter.  Every Party in the House, I think, will agree that this is a question which is causing very great concern, not only in the city of Dublin, but in many of our small towns and villages throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the newspaper heading, &ldquo;Substantial reductions proposed in the Estimates for the coming year,&rdquo; I certainly was very glad.  I said to myself that at last they had been coerced a little bit by the rod of public opinion, but when I got the White Paper and looked through it, and examined how and under what particular items reductions were effected, I felt exactly about it as Deputy MacEntee and Deputy O'Connell.  I found that the lines along which we felt very large expenditure could be saved were avoided, with the exception alone of the Army.  With regard to the Army, we see it is not proposed to effect anything like substantial reductions in the expenditure on it. Even in the case of the Army, we are very far away still from the amount of expenditure which we think it right should be incurred on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering our conditions, and the purpose to which the Army can be put, we think, as we have said here on many occasions, that we will not have arrived at anything like a satisfactory state in connection with the Army until the expenditure on it is well under £1,000,000&mdash;certainly not more than £1,000,000.  Our old friends the Civic Guards, the Governor-General, the expenses of the Oireachtas, all these are still not diminishing, but actually increasing, at a time when we know that there is general distress in the country.  I read in the newspapers that in Belfast a Committee which carried out investigations found that there were 2,000 families in that city suffering from acute distress, and 1,000 in practically a starving condition.  I believe that if an investigation of the same type were carried out in the City of Dublin, it would be found that conditions were not very much better.  Some time ago I was speaking to a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, who have had an opportunity of investigating the <Col N="1038" /> conditions here.  That was about three or four months ago; and I was assured that at that time the conditions were worse than they had been at any time in the memory of the particular man who gave me the information. He was a man on whose word I could place great reliance. He had been engaged on this work for many years during a long lifetime, and he said that the conditions were then worse than they had been at any time in his memory.  I believe that if an investigation were carried out in the City of Dublin, we would find something of the same kind as was found by the Committee in Belfast.</P>
    <P>When such conditions obtain, I think it is altogether wrong for us to come here and make them worse. These conditions are being made worse by taxation, which industry and the people generally cannot bear.  I see no evidence that the Ministry at all appreciates that particular fact.  We find that the expenses of the machinery of bureaucracy, as Deputy MacEntee called it, are going up.  In connection with the particular item that Deputy O'Connell spoke of, the Land Commission, when I saw the reduction in that figure I asked myself what items exactly did the reductions cover?  I came to the conclusion, from a hasty glance at the rough Estimates that some of us have got, that they were on these particular works that Deputy O'Connell referred to.  That means, of course, taking away employment in various parts of the country, and making conditions worse than they are.  I also thought that it meant a further slowing up of the process of vesting land.</P>
    <P>We have had complaints here on many occasions already of the grave injustice that has been done to tenants whose land has not yet been vested.  How far this reduction is going to be used as an excuse for further delay it is difficult to determine. We think there is no reason in the world why a definite date should not be fixed out of hand for the vesting of all land.  We would like to know from the Minister in <Col N="1039" /> charge what he proposes to do about that.  Is he going to leave the matter in the condition in which it is at present?  Several years have elapsed since the lands were purchased and since really the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; should have been fixed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell practically challenged us to point out how it is that we can stand over any reductions, seeing that we do not want to diminish the social services.  Time after time we have indicated the particular items in which we think substantial reductions could be effected. We have mentioned the Army.  We think that another half million pounds could be taken off the Army expenditure.  In regard to the Civic Guards, we believe that the cost could be reduced by nearly half.  We believe that half the force, with public opinion properly behind it, would be able to do all the work that is to be done.  Last year the amount for the Governor-General was £27,000, and it amounts to the same figure practically this year.  With regard to the Oireachtas, we have indicated how in regard to both Houses substantial savings could be effected.  At one time, I think, we estimated that over £40,000 or so could be saved.  I ask whether all these savings could not be effected without in any way interfering with the social services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we consider raising our social services to the level of those in Great Britain, let us compare our taxable capacity with that of Great Britain.  I do not think we should have any standards outside our own.  We have to live our own life in our own country, and we have to have social services up to the highest level we can afford.  We may be able to have social services far in advance of the social services in Great Britain, but if we take our taxable capacity at 1.5 per cent., which I think was the authoritative figure given&mdash;last year it was <Col N="1040" /> pointed out, I think, by Deputy Ruttledge when speaking on this particular Vote that it was 1.5 per cent.&mdash; it would mean taxation in the Twenty-Six Counties of about £12,000,000.  What have we here? We have over £21,000,000 for the Supply Services.  We cannot afford that.  I think the Labour Deputies will admit that there is a limit to which we can go even in the social services, and if we go beyond that limit we are going to do damage to the community as a whole.  Whilst I say that, no reduction in existing social services should be brought about except after the most careful examination, and reduction rather in the administration of the services than in the benefits to individuals.</P>

      <P>Might I be permitted to explain?  Rightly or wrongly, I took Deputy MacEntee to say he was anxious to have our social services raised to the level of those in Great Britain.  In the course of my remarks I asked how that could be done and at the same time bring about the economy the Deputy's Party wanted.  I may have misunderstood the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our attitude is that we want to maintain the social services at the highest point our people can bear.  We do not want to have any reduction in those services if it can possibly be avoided.  I say a reduction in any of those services should be undertaken only as a last resort, and should not be undertaken so long as there are opportunities of saving in other directions and no harm is done to the community. That is our attitude.  We believe reductions that will bring down taxation to something like what the people could bear could be effected without injuring the social services.  That is in general terms. When talking of these services, what we have to bear in mind is the relative taxable capacity of the people here.  From the point of view of taxable capacity, we are not able to bear as high a burden of taxation as England bears.  We should come down to £12,000,000, which is not <Col N="1041" /> likely.  We were laughed at last year when we said there was a possibility of reducing the total taxation by £3,000,000.  The Minister for Finance has reduced it now, and in the way we wanted; while they laughed at us last year, he is going to reduce it this year.  He might say in reply that some of the items would naturally reduce because they lapsed during the period.  That is quite true, but by looking ahead and bringing in a type of legislation which would diminish the cost of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, which would get rid of the burden of the Governor-General, and by legislation or administrative action which would diminish our expenditure further on the Army and the Civic Guards, I believe that the figure we mentioned in last year's Estimate would be within reason.  I I believe there is room still on nonsocial services for a reduction of another £1,000,000.  I could get figures to prove that, but, unfortunately, I have not had time to work out the details on the lines we had before. What I have said now has been already said by other speakers in the same terms.  The new point I am anxious about is in connection with the Land Commission.  I want to know: is it proposed to take any definite steps to right the grievance of people whose lands have not yet been vested?</P>

      <P>Looking at the Estimate as it appears on the White Paper, I see that in the economies the Minister is introducing he attacks the services that a humane Government would consider it desirable to increase.  Looking down the list of services in which reductions are being made, one finds such items as hospitals and infirmaries, primary education, technical instruction, reformatory and industrial schools, improvements of the estates under the Land Commission, posts and telegraphs, and in contradistinction to that one finds an increase, no matter how little, in services that could do without an increase, such as the office of the President, the Oireachtas, External Affairs, and <Col N="1042" /> rates on Government property.  The increase in these departments may be very little, but it shows a policy. It shows that in the matter of the improvement of estates, where much-needed employment was given, and on which useful work was carried out, the Minister has divided the amount that was given in the improvement of these estates by two, which simply means that half the amount of work will not be done, and that the unemployment which he knows is rampant in the country will not get any relief in that direction. In the Department of Posts and Telegraphs there has also been an immense effort at what is called economy by savings.  I was endeavouring to look up the speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not sufficient time to look them up in full; otherwise I would be in the position of making some very valuable quotations from his speeches.  I find that at one time he was advocating an extension of these services.  These are services that can scarcely be considered as services out of which the State should make a profit.  They are services necessary for the people &mdash;utility services&mdash;and revenue should not be sought for in the sense of making a profit on such services. They are very useful services from the point of view of the Farmers Party, which Deputy Heffernan told us yesterday was revived, and which I welcome back as a political entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would like to know why expenses are incurred in certain directions while services are cut down in other directions.  I do not know whether I am on the border line of disorder if I ask the Minister for Finance who financed the pamphlet issued by the Incorporated Law Society against the Legal Practitioners Bill.  I find there was an amount of money given to the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;an amount <Col N="1043" /> to the extent of over £300.  I just wondered whether that money was used to get out the pamphlet inflicted on every member of the Dáil during the week.</P>
    <P>The general policy, as far as I see at the moment, is that the Government have attacked services of a most essential kind, highly important social services, and services which any humane Government would consider it desirable to increase rather than to cut down.  It has increased certain services which might easily be cut down, and has cut down services which are really essential.  Many services that might be attacked in the interests of economy have not been attacked. Take, for instance, the Department of External Affairs, which shows an increase, the President's Department, rates on Government property, and other items of that sort. I suggest that if we are to have any economy practised it should be practised on such services as those I have now mentioned, and not on the services which are necessary for the masses of the people, for the relief of unemployment, and for the very necessary work carried out under the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with other Deputies on these benches in protesting against reductions in Votes which in the past provided very useful work in the country.  It is very significant that the Minister for Finance, who is also nominally the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in addition to reducing Votes for arterial drainage, for the Barrow drainage and for new buildings under the Board of Works, is also taking responsibility for a very large cut in the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs.  The reduction amounts to £192,120.  I speak subject to correction, but I understand the policy for the coming year is that in every area where there is a postal delivery from a sub-office, and where the existing facilities give a daily delivery, the six-day deliveries are to be cut down to three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> I am very sorry that Deputy Heffernan has left the House.  I hope it is not for the purpose of forgetting the speeches he made on this matter two or three years ago.  If he looks them up he will be very sorry for the responsibility he has to shoulder here in trying to father this Estimate. The reduction made here hits the farming community to a greater extent than it hits any other section of the people.  I will be glad to hear from Deputy Heffernan the grounds on which this reduction was made.  Many of the postmen who will be affected by this policy, if this is the policy, are at the moment earning an average allowance of 25/- a week.  If these postal services are going to be cut down to half, that will mean that the remuneration, the pittance or allowance, will be only 12/-.  That will have the effect of forcing many of the postmen to look upon work under such circumstances as not being remunerative. They will be entitled, if so disposed, to reject any offer of employment under these abominable conditions, and they will automatically be entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, which will practically amount to the old rate of wages paid for the six-day delivery service.  Is that the sort of economy that the Minister and his colleague or subordinate, Deputy Heffernan, stand for?  Is that the sort of economy that the farmers of the country, for whom the Deputy pretends to speak, stand for?  I do not think so, and Deputy Heffernan will find himself faced, if and when this policy is put into operation, with many demands to visit areas in North and South Tipperary in order to justify this policy, which is quite contrary to the policy he advocated previous to the time he took up office under the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan is head of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; he is also Chairman of the so-called Economy Committee.  Are the taxpayers to understand that the reduction of £1,825,166 is solely due to the work of the Economy Committee over which Deputy Heffernan has the honour to preside? <Col N="1045" /> I understand the demand for this severe cut came as a shock to the heads of many Government Departments within the last three or four weeks.  Some of the people responsible for the supervision of large numbers of men, in Departments such as that of Posts and Telegraphs, got instructions by telephone to put into operation reductions which would, in one particular case, amount to £50,000 or £55,000 per year.  These things appear to have been done in a very hasty manner and I believe if there was more time devoted to their consideration some of the things that have been done would, perhaps, never be done.  Let us take the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I do not want at this stage to go into details in connection with the Estimates but, as regards the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary of the Department, I wonder will Deputy Heffernan either now or on the Estimates give the House detailed particulars of the work which those responsible and highly-paid officials are carrying out.  Is he in a position to justify the continued existence of these two positions and the high salaries which go with them?  The Parliamentary Secretary, if he knows anything about the Department, should be in a position to give me some answer.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of New Works there is an expected reduction for the Board of Works of £208,000.  Every Deputy can well understand how that will affect labour conditions in the areas where building operations are being carried out by the Board of Works.  I am sorry that Deputy Colohan is not here because he knows much more about the work on the Barrow than I do.  I am sure that Deputy Colohan will be surprised to learn that there is a reduction from £75,000 to £20,000 for the coming year.  He will be able to estimate the number of his constituents in Kildare who will be thrown out of work as a result of that reduction.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in this House, by way of questions to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="1046" /> for Finance, I inquired as to the reasons why the Board of Works were not making a greater effort to take advantage of the benefits of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  We were told here repeatedly that there is a good deal of delay caused by the necessary preliminary inquiries, inspections and valuations that have to be carried out before the actual drainage work can be commenced in the areas concerned.  We were given to understand last year in this House, when the discussion of this Estimate was under consideration, that a good deal more work would be carried out in the coming year than was carried out last year under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925. What is the position we are faced with at the moment?  The Estimate of £28,000, which was provided for arterial drainage work and which would give a good deal of valuable employment in rural Ireland, is being reduced from £28,000 last year, when little was done under the Act, to £22,000 for the coming year.</P>
    <P>All that goes to show that these reductions, these so-called economies, will mean that there will be a balanced Budget produced for those who are anxious to look at it, but who are not going to inquire any further.  But how many people will be unemployed in the coming year who in the past got employment through these Votes?  I am informed that the reduction in the Estimate of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will mean, as a minimum, the disemployment of 300 men from the 1st of April, and a considerable reduction in the present remuneration of about 400 additional men.  I am informed that 100 postmen in the City of Dublin are to be affected.  It is clear that in this Estimate the reduction of £192,120, which is mainly confined to work in provincial centres, is bound to affect the work of a large number of men. Whether that number is 300 or 600 does not matter very much.  The same applies to the effect that is going to come from a reduction of £200,000 in the Estimate of the Board of Works.  There is a reduction <Col N="1047" /> under the vote for the Barrow drainage from £75,000 to £20,000. For arterial drainage there is a reduction from £28,000 to £22,000.  I would like to hear from the Minister an explanation as to why he is forced to effect these reductions.</P>
    <P>There is also, as Deputy Hogan mentioned, a reduction of 50 per cent. in the Vote for the Improvement of Estates.  I have been a member of the Public Accounts Committee for a number of years.  I was Chairman of the Committee the year before last, and a member of it last year.  On two occasions we had reason to draw the attention of the responsible Ministers to the failure of the Land Commission to spend a sum of money up to the extent of what was voted by this House.  We were assured, after a discussion here in this House, that no further surrenders of money would be made to the Exchequer under this particular head.  I assumed from that statement, which was made in the House by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries, that the full sum which is provided for the financial year now coming to a close would be expended before the 31st of this month.  If that was so, and if there was necessity for spending that money for road and land improvement, building of houses, etc., then, if the operations under the Land Act of 1923 are to continue on the same scale as in the past, there is the same necessity now for the spending of this money on the same kind of useful work as there had been in the past.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister divide the figure in two?  Is this done in an arbitrary way?  It appears to have been done without any consideration whatsoever.  There was a sum of £323,000 last year, and the Estimate shows a so-called reduction of £161,000.  That so-called saving will mean that less money will be spent in rural Ireland.  Fewer men will get employment on this work in the coming year than in the past.  This will create additional charges <Col N="1048" /> upon the farmers, and I hope Deputy Heffernan will come into the House and say that those whom he represents will see to it, and ascertain what is the attitude of the Minister and the Minister's Party to this matter.</P>

      <P>I hope I shall be in order in congratulating Deputy Davin on having covered more ground at greater speed than ever before, at the same time clearing away a good deal of arterial drainage in his progress. I have not had the advantage Deputy Davin has had of seeing the uncorrected proofs of the Estimates. But I accept his statement.  He spoke of his experience on the Public Accounts Committee with regard to the Land Commission, and he called attention to the fact, which I was going to call attention to, that the Land Commission had consistently over-estimated the amount they would be able to spend on the improvement of estates.  The Public Accounts Committee stated that this should be rectified, but I do not remember getting any assurance that the matter would be rectified by spending all the money.  The assurance given was that it would be rectified by more accurate budgeting in the future; if that is the case I welcome it.  It is a sound principle, and Deputy Davin and Deputy MacEntee know it.  It is no use voting money that is not going to be used in the year.  It does not give employment.  It is no good to anybody.  It is a paper transaction and it causes unnecessary taxes to be imposed.  The same applies to the Board of Works.  Consistently, throughout a period of years, the Board of Works have been steadily over-estimating the amount of work they have to do in the current financial year.  I was so impressed by that three years ago that I put down an amendment to reduce the sub-head by £200,000.  I gather from Deputy Davin that that sub-head has now been reduced by £200,000.  The Board has found out what they can do and what they cannot do, and the Minister is not asking for money that will not be needed in the coming year.  It is not a question of employment, <Col N="1049" /> because this money was never spent.  But even if it were, the Minister has now begun to realise that economies were always popular until you began to economise.  When you begin to economise there are always certain vested interests protesting against it.  The matter of the Post Office I will leave to the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin has gone to fetch Deputy Heffernan, and is now repeating his speech to him in the hope that he will reply.  I will leave that.  I have not the details of the economies.  It is a very large economy, and I think it can be made without serious inconvenience on the telephone, engineering and stores branch, by carrying out telephone development somewhat more slowly than it could otherwise be carried out.  Deputy Hogan took exception to this Vote.  He took exception to economies in the big Votes for the Land Commission, the Board of Works, and so on.  He suggests that economies should be made in the Department of External Affairs and in the President's Department.  If you abolish those two Departments completely, abolish the Ministers, abolish the whole of the staffs completely, abolish the whole of the representation overseas, in the United States, France, Germany, and so on, you would save precisely £70,000, and what reduction in taxation can you get by the saving of only £70,000? The only really valuable economies, the only economies that will have an effect on the Budget are those made on the big Votes, the Votes that run into six or seven figures.  You must go to the big Departments if you want to get any economy that will either meet the deficit or cause a reduction in taxation.  You cannot by picking up £12,000 in the President's Department, £58,000 in the Department of External Affairs, £13,000 in the Vote for Hospitals, Charities and things of that kind, make any real economy.  Substantial economy can only be got, as I said before, by a reduction of certain services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> It would be ungenerous to criticise the speech of Deputy de Valera. Obviously he had not very much time to prepare a serious statement of policy, but he did give us some indication of where his party propose to make economies.  He selected only four items in this Vote on Account, the Governor-General's Establishment, the Oireachtas, the Gárda Síochána and the Army.  The last two are substantial Votes.  Take the Governor-General's Establishment and abolish it.  For purposes of comparison, I will only take the figures set down here.  I am taking this from last year's figures.  I want to show what Deputy de Valera would have done if the Fianna Fáil Party were in power here.  He would abolish the Governor-General's Establishment, thereby saving £6,870.  He would reduce the Vote for the Oireachtas.  Assume he would reduce it by £100,000 and only leave £17,000.  I think Deputies opposite will agree you have to leave something.  Travelling expenses, at any rate, would have to be met, and probably there would have to be some allowance for the Deputies who have to stay in Dublin.  Take £100,000 off that; take half off the Gárda Síochána.  That was, I think, the figure.  They think it can be reduced by half.  That is £804,000, and a little over.  On last year's figures, you would save just over £1,700,000. Taking that as Deputy de Valera's economies, he would have made a saving of over £1,700,000.  The Minister on last year's Budget saved £1,825,000.  I am not so inhuman as to expect Deputies to approve of the economies that have been made, but if the country is looking for effective economy, they will find the economies made by the Minister for Finance were £125,000 more than those suggested by Deputy de Valera; and the Minister's economies are only beginning, while Deputy de Valera, once he dealt with his four pet services, would find it very hard to go a little bit further.</P>

      <P>Until Deputy Cooper rose to speak on this Vote, I thought previous speeches delivered from this side of the House had left Cumann na nGaedheal speechless. I am glad we had Deputy Cooper's speech, although I must confess I found it very difficult to understand.  He started by endeavouring to demonstrate that you could not effect any real economy by taking a small piece off one Vote, a small piece off another and dealing with all Votes in that way, and concluded by demonstrating that the Minister for Finance, while dealing with the Votes in that manner, effected a bigger saving than Deputy de Valera suggested could have been saved by tackling the bigger Votes.

      <P>The actual number of Deputies in the House does not affect my argument.  It is the number of Deputies who can explain how and why they will vote in this particular matter.  I can satisfy Deputy Cooper that members of Fianna <Col N="1052" /> Fáil are not prepared to give a silent vote as apparently members of Cumann na nGaedheal are.  You are asked to vote a sum of £7,570,125.  It is not an inconsiderable amount.  It is worth while examining before you ask the taxpayers of the country to find that sum for the purposes of meeting the bill which is given in detail in this paper.  We think you should express your opinion as to whether that bill is too high or too low, or as to whether the various items on which it is proposed to expend money cannot be provided for in some other manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputies here will remember that there is not in this country anything like the degree of prosperity we would like to see.  There is, in fact, a rather considerable volume of unemployment, an amount of destitution and a periodic drain on our population through emigration. What the volume of unemployment is we do not know.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been as reticent on that matter as the Minister for Justice was this evening on the reasons for the recent activities of his police.  A census was taken in this country in 1926. This is 1929.  Three years ago, at great expense, certain information was secured regarding the occupations of all our people, and no doubt in the collecting of that information some particulars were secured as to those who were without occupation, but for some reason best known to themselves information as to the number of unemployed in the country has been withheld from the Dáil. They will tell us the Statistical Department is overworked, and that it was necessary to tell us the number of people of various religions and different professions in the different provinces and towns before they told us the number of people without work and consequently destitute in those towns and villages.  In 1926 the Government of Northern Ireland took a census and were able to make available shortly afterwards the actual figures as to the number of people without work in that area. It is extraordinary that the Statistical <Col N="1053" /> Department here cannot do the same.  I would like to suggest to Deputies that they could have done the same, but received orders from the Minister in charge to do nothing of the kind, because if the figures were made available, and if the people of the country or Deputies in this Dáil knew the exact volume of unemployment, they would not be so mute and stupid-looking when asked to pass a Vote of over £7,000,000.</P>

      <P>I might perhaps explain that it is not exactly dealing with the question as to whether <Col N="1054" /> tariffs should or should not be imposed. But you will recollect that the Minister for Agriculture yesterday went out of his way to insult and slander Irish industrialists.  It is in connection with that statement that I would like to make a few remarks this evening.  He appeared to think that any body of manufacturers in this country who availed of the machinery which the Government themselves established to have an application for a protective duty placed before the Tariff Commission were in consequence of that action entitled to be accused by him of endeavouring to serve their personal interests at the expense of the country as a whole.  He seems to think that the fact that these manufacturers came in the first place to the Government, of which he is a member, gives him a right to use any derogatory remarks he likes concerning them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had constant reference in this House to the difficulty of getting owners of capital to put their money into Irish industry.  Is there any Deputy here, or any member of the Government, who thinks that the speech which was delivered yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture will help to induce capitalists to put their money into Irish industry? The Minister is a member of the Executive Council, and when he speaks here in this Dáil he is presumably conveying to members of the Dáil the opinions and the attitude of the Executive Council upon the question to which he refers.  The Minister for Agriculture admits, of course, that it was essential that there should be more industries in this country, but he was very careful to give no indication as to what policy, if any, the Government have to ensure that there will be more industries in the country.  He spoke as if he believed that any policy of Protection would not achieve that end.  In fact, I must say he gave me the impression that he was definitely opposed to the action which the Government has already taken in protecting such industries as have been protected.  Whether that is so or not we would like to be informed. <Col N="1055" /> If the Minister for Agriculture has been given a free hand by the Executive Council, we would like some responsible member of the Executive Council to tell us.  If they are not prepared to stand for every idle word which he speaks in this Dáil, they ought to let us know. But until we get that definite repudiation of the Minister for Agriculture from some other member of the Executive Council, we will have to assume that he is speaking the policy of that Council, and that what he says all the rest are prepared to stand by.</P>

      <P>We will probably try in any case.  It is my opinion, however, that when the Government comes to the Dáil at the beginning of the financial year and asks for a sum of money on account, they should indicate to the Dáil what, in their opinion, are the prospects that during that year the people will be able to pay the taxes which they intend to impose.  Obviously, the people cannot pay the money if a large section of them are unemployed. Obviously they cannot pay the money if those who are employed have to maintain a large proportion of the population in idleness.  If the conditions which now exist continue to operate during the year, then we will find at the end of the next year, as the Minister for Finance has found at the end of this year, that it is very easy to overestimate the taxpaying capacity of the people.  We have got to take these facts into account.  I do say that we can have in this country social services as good as those prevailing in England, and we can afford to be a little generous in the expenditure of public money if we have put into operation a policy to achieve what the Minister for Agriculture talked about yesterday&mdash;the establishment of new industries in this country.  He has no policy to that end.  In fact, every proposal that is made by any Party or by any person in this country to achieve that result, is ridiculed by him and by those associated with him.</P>

      <P>This is hedging in tariffs.  He congratulated Deputies on this side of the House upon their ability to hedge.  That congratulation is a matter of particular pride to us, coming as it does from that source.  The Minister for Agriculture unfortunately spoke after another Deputy who if not a member of the Executive Council is at least very closely associated with it&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs.  If ever there was an example of hedging given in this Dáil we had a demonstration of it yesterday from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He stood up here and declared publicly that every principle for which he stood in public life, and every principle for which the Party or the group with which he is associated in public life stood, compelled him to oppose the imposition of a tariff on woollen cloth, but because by doing so he might jeopardise the existence of the Government which gave him a job he would not oppose it.  He went into the Lobby&mdash;at least he stayed outside the Dáil altogether.  The Minister for Agriculture can get lessons in hedging from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I noticed that he hedged out of the Dáil altogether this evening as soon as some reference was made to speeches which he delivered in connection with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs before he became a &ldquo;token of appreciation.&rdquo; I hope that he has gone out to read those speeches, and if it should happen in the course of his perusal of the speeches which he delivered some years ago that he should see the light once more and realise that the manly course for him to take was to come in here and say what he believes and vote for what he believes, then we are likely to have a political sensation before the evening terminates.  Of course that will never happen.  The Government are quite safe and can be sure of <Col N="1058" /> their majority so long as the farmers are represented by such hedgewhackers as the members of the Farmers' Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper apparently thinks that the duty devolves upon this Party to go through the various Estimates item by item and show where economies can be achieved.  It is not possible for a Deputy in opposition, who has not the intimate knowledge of departmental working which a Minister has, to be clear as to where extravagance is taking place or as to where economies can be effected.  But we can see on the face of this Estimate that such a reduction as has been achieved against last year has been achieved, in the first place, by the automatic termination of certain Votes, and, in the second place, at the expense of the few Government Departments which did confer some benefit on the people through their operations.  Of course, we read in the papers that a revolution is taking place in the Army, that as a result a very large number of officers have retired, and forced economies are being effected in all directions; that, in fact, apart from the battalion left to parade on St. Patrick's Day there would be, after the 1st April, practically nothing of it left. We note, however, that we are still asked to pay £1,400,000 to maintain what is left of it this year.  We are also asked to pay £1,500,000 for the Civic Guard; £1,794,000 for superannuation and retiring allowances; £296,000 in army pensions, and other big sums in respect of services which, I suggest, could very usefully be modified.  The Army, of course, is a service which has been constantly under discussion here, and perhaps it would be unnecessary to say anything further about it.  The taxpayer will contribute £1,400,000 this year, as he contributed £1,800,000 last year, and if he gets the same benefit from that contribution this year as he got last year, then he will be at the loss of that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest to Deputy Cooper, and to the Minister for Finance if he is open to receive suggestions, that before the Minister reduced the vote for the effecting of <Col N="1059" /> improvements on estates, or before he reduced the grants under the Primary Education Vote, he should have seriously considered the estimates submitted by the Army and the Civic Guard, and the various other apparently useless Departments, and have seen whether or not it was possible to leave the Vote in respect of the improvement of estates as it was, and the Primary Education Vote in respect of grants to continuation schools as it was, and secure the economy which he was so anxious to secure by reductions under these other heads.</P>
    <P>The Deputies on this side are, of course, opposed to this Vote. We voted against a similar Vote last year, and we were told that by doing so we were taking the risk of leaving the Government without money; that they would have to get money in any case to carry on, and that it was foolish to vote against the entire Vote, because that would leave them with nothing at their disposal to meet the ordinary requirements of government.  I hope that argument will not be put forward on this occasion.  It is quite obvious that if we succeed in rejecting this Vote, the important thing will not be that the Government will be without money, but that the Dáil will be without a Government, and that will be sufficient compensation, at any rate, for any inconvenience which might be caused by the fact that another Vote would have to be introduced later on.</P>
    <P>I did not rise to speak mainly for the purpose of criticising the Vote, but to endeavour to persuade Cumann na nGaedheal members that it was their duty to their constituents to explain exactly why they are going to vote for this motion.  The Minister for Finance will, no doubt, conclude the debate, and he may or may not advance certain arguments to counteract those put forward by Deputy MacEntee and others.  But Deputies opposite should realise that what the Minister for Finance says does not altogether answer for their action.  They have direct responsibility to the <Col N="1060" /> people who sent them here, and it is the people who sent them here who will have to foot the bill, not the Minister.  They will be all anxious to know why Deputies Connolly, Law, Sheehy, and other Deputies opposite, go into the division lobby and vote to give the Government a cheque for £7,570,000.  Those Deputies would, I am sure, very much resent being described, as Deputy Flinn once described them, as &ldquo;dumb, driven cattle,&rdquo; but if they are not dumb and driven, they have an opportunity now of showing it, and as I understand the entire time this evening will be given for the discussion upon this matter, they need not be afraid of unduly prolonging the debate.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Lemass, I think the House has no option but to vote this amount, because it seems to me that suddenly to cut down a number of the largest services in such a drastic way as has been suggested would mean complete disorganisation of the State.  I do, however, think that Deputy Cooper was wrong when he said that the Minister should only apply himself to large items of six figures.  &ldquo;Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves,&rdquo; is a very good motto. There are a number of small services which might very well be looked into.  We are a comparatively small State, and, on the whole, I think we are house-keeping on too large a scale.  But the Minister has recognised this, and I think we should all be very glad to see the reductions which he has proposed.</P>

      <P>I would rather give way to some members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party opposite if they wish to speak.  Deputy Lemass and myself seem to have one common ground: and that is that our hearts ache for the benighted, somnolent ignorance which distinguishes the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I do think that the two of us have devoted a good deal of time, that we might have spent more pleasantly in our own interests and avocations, in the <Col N="1061" /> attempt to dispel their ignorance and to improve their education.  As the Chair has said, it would be disorderly to say that they look stupid; I think it would, also, be unnecessary. The difficulty with this question, at the moment is, that the Government have in the past, for political and polemical purposes produced inflated Estimates which they had no intention of spending. During a considerable period, it was necessary to shock the people of this country as to how horrible the political opponents of the Government were, and for that reason it was necessary to put down huge Estimates, showing up to ten million pounds worth of compensation and things of that kind.  But as Deputy MacEntee has shown, when you come to analyse the actual accounts you find that the apparent economies disappear and the apparent and actual extravagance remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything to discourage the Government in what they are now attempting to do in trying to cut their cloth according to their measure.  If they had attempted to do that, as a gradual process, over a period of years, I should not merely be grateful to them but I should feel bound to congratulate and thank them.  We are not faced with an ordered policy of economy by a Government with a sense of responsibility to this country, with its narrow resources; we are simply faced with the death-bed repentance of men who have lived up to the limit of everything they could possibly lay their hands on; they find now they cannot lay their hands on any more.  It is the economy of the man with the sheriff in the house, with the water cut off, with the bills flowing in and with the creditors importuning.  It is the economy of men who know that on their record their position even as to the borrowing of money is bad. Good as the credit of this country is, the credit of the Government is not good.  At the very last moment, when the larder is empty, when all the visible resources are completely hypothecated, we have an economy which is purely political in purpose <Col N="1062" /> and which is completely panicky in method.</P>
    <P>I personally appreciate that there is some ground in the complaint that we, on this side of the House, have harped, and harped continually, upon a certain number of avenues of economy.  But why?  If you are dealing with a man who, you know, is overspending his income, whose condition personally is the condition as I have portrayed, and of the Government; if you go into his house and find staring you in the face obvious extravagance &mdash; champagne, chocolate, biscuits, or something of that kind; you find blatant and obviously stupid extravagance staring you in the face&mdash;and when you suggest economies in these particulars you are refused, what is the use of treating that man as a man to whom you can go and say of the smaller matters of which you do not know: &ldquo;Will you investigate and will you find out?&rdquo; It is that refusal to take obvious means of economy that makes it doubtful, very doubtful indeed, for us to attempt to ask them to investigate in the more difficult bypaths.  Personally I feel that the particular lines of economy which have been indicated from this side are lines upon which economy is blatantly obvious.  If I saw the Government attempting, not at the eleventh hour, not when the bailiffs are in the house, and not when the larder is empty, but on ordered principles before they had reached that state&mdash;if I had found them attempting to economise in these obvious ways, I would then have been inclined to believe that they themselves were willing and competent to economise in the other avenues.  But when I find them refusing, then it seems to me that it is not the education of this Government which is required, but its elimination. As far as the money of these departments is concerned, I am not in a position&mdash;I doubt if there are many people in the House in the position&mdash;to indicate the lines and the degrees in which economies could be effected.  We are not in a position to indicate the method by which they could attempt to ascertain, <Col N="1063" /> and by which we would attempt to ascertain, whether economy could be effected in these ways.  We should have accountants and experts to come in and examine what is actually being done in these departments, and what result was being got from them, and then we should be able to come to this House and tell Deputies whether or not what was effectively being done in these departments could effectively be done at a lesser price.  But if you have the obvious case of refusing economies in the things that we can see, we are bound to judge that in the things that they can hide the condition is at least as bad.</P>
    <P>Is this Government one which is competent, on its record on finance, to be entrusted with any carefully organised business like economy? What sign have they shown of business knowledge in any particular business transaction that they have touched?  A Government that could not even make a success and profit out of a bank&mdash;the one group of people in Ireland who apparently were capable of making a bank bankrupt in their hands; the people who have to their credit the finance of the sugar beet scheme; the people who have to their credit the extraordinary case of the Trade Loans; the people who could not come here to this House to-day and tell the House where the Government money that is put into industrial trusts is invested&mdash;what sort of a record have they in finance?  Is there any man in this House to-day who is satisfied with the financing of the Sugar Beet Scheme, the Shannon Scheme, the Trade Loans, the Land Bank, or the Industrial Trust?  Are these people to be trusted?  Even if they were willing&mdash;and we have obvious proof that they are not, until they are driven to it by the sheriff&mdash; are they people who are capable of being trusted as competent and capable business men to go through any one of their Departments and find how much it ought to cost to run? They have never balanced their Budget in reality from the beginning, and last year represented the breaking point.  I have no pleasure <Col N="1064" /> in looking forward to the difficulties of the Minister for Finance in relation to his Budget.  It is no pleasure to us, it is no party profit to us, to see the Minister for Finance in the position in which he is.  It is a tragedy to the whole country, and to every element and every part of it, to this Government, its successor, and to all its successors that there should have been that action in relation to finance which to-day has dried up the sources of finance and left in a country, which is still capable of being prosperous, a Government which is bankrupt both in money and ideas. There has been taken into account as ordinary revenue for this country over the five post-Treaty years and used as ordinary income an average of £1,000,000 of pre-Treaty income tax.  This was the Government who segregated recurrent and non-recurrent revenue.  That was non-recurrent revenue, but it has been used as recurrent revenue.  That is how they balanced their Budget.</P>
    <P>The Ministers are only beginning their economy.  That is not said by us, but by their supporters.  They have succeeded in a ramp, in a panic, when faced by the sheriff.  They have succeeded, according to Deputy Cooper, in the Estimates, which I have not seen, in saving £1,800,000, but they are only beginning.  Why did they wait until the sheriff was in the house to begin?  If they had started this process a considerable time ago not merely could they have a saving of £1,870,000 a year without interference with or shaking of their administrative machine, but by this time the economies amounting to those indicated by Deputy de Valera could have been added to those indicated by Deputy Cooper.  Three or four millions of money, representing tens of millions, perhaps nearly a hundred millions of money, at a price at which industry could use it, could have been let loose on this country for the purpose of fertilising and developing it.  But they are only beginning.  If they had waited a little longer they would not have had an opportunity of commencing.  To the extent to which they have begun I give them credit.  To the extent that <Col N="1065" /> even a death-bed repentance can be got from them this Government is entitled to credit for a policy of economy, but not to any other extent. They did it when they had to. They ceased to spend money when they could not get it.</P>
    <P>That is the best that can be said upon the facts for them.  It is time, and long over time, that they went, but so long as they are here in this action of attempting now, at the eleventh hour, to begin to live within their means we will help them.  We will recognise quite frankly that economies cannot be got without sacrifice, and that the advocacy of economy of a particular kind may have to be met by electoral sacrifices. The Minister for Finance is not responsible for it in the slightest degree, but this House imposed on him a payment of £175,000 last year on a particular item in relation to old age pensions.  Every member of the House in doing that consulted his own humanitarian instincts and his own electoral necessity.  That item, at any rate, lies dead and straight on the shoulders of this House.  To that extent they must not complain of a particular taxation, but there are very few expenses which have been imposed on the Minister by the House.  The sooner they get on with the job of bringing the expenditure of this country within the limits of its capacity to bear, the better for the country and the better for the cleanness of their reputation when they have gone.  I recognise that it is not going to be an easy job to advocate some of the economies that will have to be advocated, and it is a responsibility on everybody in the House who believes that expenditure is too high to share with this Government in the closing days of its life the responsibility of advocating the economies which are necessary to produce that reduction in expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>It is a matter of deep grief to me that the Farmers' Party who made such an auspicious lowering of the curtain last night, when they proclaimed that they had again come to life and were destined, apparently, <Col N="1066" /> to take an important part in the future destinies of the State, are not represented here now.  That is all the harder to understand, because the Farmers' Party, above all parties, is the one which hangs economy highest among its banners.  In the elections that have taken place from time to time down the country no party had the slightest interest in economy except the Farmers' Party.  It is very significant that a change apparently has come now, and that when the rather important matter of voting seven and a half millions of the people's money comes up for discussion, there is not, so far as I can see, a single member of that party in his seat.  This matter of economy is one that affects the agricultural community.  The matter of the working of the Departments which have a direct bearing on reproductive work in connection with agriculture is also of great interest to the farmers of the Free State. They will, I am sure, be sorry to see there is a large cut in the subsidy for the beet-growing industry this year.  It has been reduced from £274,000 to £108,000.  That, I submit, is a reduction in a source of employment and in the actual output of money&mdash;that portion of the money which we vote in this House and which finds its way in one way or another into the hands of the farmer and labourer in the country.  If that economy is to be effected, and if other economies have to be effected, economies which we have not had fully explained to us yet, but which I see in certain Departments, such as Fisheries and Land Commission, are very big economies, the House must naturally put a question to those responsible for making these economies.  The House must ask whether they are satisfied that the economies really represent an elimination of waste and a real step forward on the road to genuine economy, or whether they mean a reduction in employment and in whatever amount of money is devoted to providing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with Fisheries, because it would be futile. The amount of money that has been <Col N="1067" /> granted to the Department of Fisheries has made that Department the Cinderella of the Free State.  The Minister in charge of that Department has had the Land Commission handed over to him.  On his shoulders also has been placed the burden of building up something in the Gaeltacht which will help to keep the Irish-speaking population at home.  On his shoulders, I believe, at present is also laid the task of producing some proposals which will lead to the building up of the fishing industry and to placing it in the position it should occupy&mdash;one of the foremost assets of the Free State.  The extent to which the Government is in earnest in this matter, and the real value of its promises, may be judged from the fact that whereas it gave £41,000 last year for the upkeep of the Fishery Department, this year it is going to give £42,000&mdash;an increase of £1,000.  Yet when Deputies on this side of the House have the audacity to get up and say that Senators' salaries, the salary of the Governor-General, and the salary of every officer who is getting more than £1,000 a year should be reduced, if we cannot get money anywhere else to keep these people from eating shell-fish or smoking cabbage-leaves or tealeaves, we are told by Deputies on the other side that we are not in earnest, that something else is being done.  What is the something else? I submit that if the Government cannot find any more money than an extra £1,000 this year to tackle the problem of the Gaeltacht and the fishery industry, it were better that the Government should get out, or that it should take some bolder steps to get this money for the fishery industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has pointed out that a very important matter hanging on the agricultural economy of the Free State is also in question in the Estimates before us.  That is the question of the delay in the vesting of land in the tenants.  The Land Commission Estimate has been reduced from £719,000 to £515,000.  We do not know at present whether that <Col N="1068" /> reduction of £200,000 means that half the officials of the Land Commission, let us suppose, have had their services dispensed with.  I doubt it.  I am very much inclined to agree with Deputy O'Connell that that £200,000 represents a reduction in the employment which would be given in the improvement of estates, the making of roads, the building of houses and other works in connection with estates that lie in the hands of the Land Commission. That £200,000 therefore represents a reduction in employment.  No substitute is provided.  The schemes of the new Department are not forthcoming. The Fishery Department is not going to do anything wonderful with its extra £1,000.  What is going to take the place of this £200,000, a large amount of which would be spent in the poorer areas of Ireland, and a large amount of which would go to give employment to labourers in various rural centres who cannot find any other employment? What are they going to do? There is not alone that aspect of the question, but there is also the fact that the reduction in the Land Commission Estimate means, I believe, a general slowing down in the operations and the work of dealing with tenanted land under the provisions of the 1923 Act.  In an answer to a question put by Deputy Allen on 28th February, in which he sought information regarding the number of tenants purchased under that Act, who had been vested, he was told that since the year 1923, the year the Act was passed, 6,114 had been vested.  At the time the Land Act was introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, we were told that there were 70,000 tenants involved.  According to that there are some 64,000 tenants still waiting to be vested.  If we vest at the rate of roughly, 1,000 per year, it follows that it will take 64 years to deal with the remaining 64,000.  That is the way the Land Commission is carrying on.</P>
    <P>It would be much better, I think, to give the Land Commission and the Fishery Department whatever financial <Col N="1069" /> facilities they require in order to enable them to bring this whole question of land purchase to a conclusion, and also to try to put the fishery industry on some commercial basis such as has been attempted in connection with the dairying industry. It is quite evident that that is not being done in the one case, and that in the other case the officials of the Land Commission have nothing further from their minds than this question of how purchase should be completed.  It has been going on for generations.  Officials come and officials go; Departments come, are broken up, amalgamated, or disappear, but the Land Commission seems to go on for ever.  Occasionally a regular artillery charge of figures is hurled at us from the other side of the House, a regular mass of figures to show the amount of land that is in the different processes. Whether the experts of the Land Commission themselves understand these processes or the complications which they seem to devise as years go by I do not know.  But there are a large number of people in the country who wonder when this question of land purchase is going to be finished, or if it is ever going to be finished.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking down in the country, said that at the end of five years he could promise that every Irish tenant farmer would be the duly vested owner of his holding.  That five years has passed and we do not seem to be any nearer that.  We have about ten per cent. of the holdings vested that had to be dealt with at that time, and the other ninety per cent. still remain on our hands.  In addition to the slowness of these operations, and the fact that there is general insecurity in the country while the land question is not being satisfactorily attended to, there is being imposed upon the farmer a definite burden in this case, and if the reduction which is being made this year in the Land Commission, and in the work which the Land Commission gives, were offset or counterbalanced in some direction by giving the tenants the reduction to which they are entitled and which they were promised in 1923, then <Col N="1070" /> something might be said for that economy.  But there is no ground whatever for hoping, there is no evidence whatever to show us that these tenants are going to be any better treated now than they were two years ago, three years ago, five years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, when he introduced this great Land Bill in 1923, went very fully into the matter.  We were not here when that Act was brought in; some of us were in jail and some of us were outside; but we know that great promises were made to the electorate that this Bill was going to settle the question definitely, finally, and for all time, and the Minister had not the slightest doubt about it at the time, because we must assume that he was in earnest as to the effect of the measure.  He said that there was one great difference between each and all preceding measures for land purchase, or for land settlement, and that was that the thing called interest in lieu of rent was to be abolished, that there was to be an automatic vesting after certain facts had been disclosed to the Land Commission &mdash; very simple facts, such as the name of the tenant, the amount of land he held, and whether he was a judicial tenant or not.  After these very simple facts had been collected by the Land Commission, there was to be automatic vesting, an Appointed Day was to be fixed automatically as a matter of course, and immediately after that the tenant was to be placed on the same basis as if he were paying his standard purchase annuity.  So that instead of, as the Minister for Agriculture said at the time, the Irish tenant purchaser not having to pay interest in lieu of rent for five or seven or perhaps ten years, when he ought to be paying an annuity towards the redemption of the purchase money and towards the redemption of the obligation that had been placed upon him, he is as bad at the end of five or seven or ten years as he was at the beginning, and he has eventually to begin paying his annuity from the very start.  That bad phase of the <Col N="1071" /> old Land Acts was to be completely wiped out in this wonderful new measure, which illustrated the statesmanship and the imagination of the present Minister for Agriculture. Then, after a certain time, the Minister for Agriculture began to change his mind.</P>
    <P>The Farmers' Party, a few years after 1923, began to think that these promises were not being fulfilled. They began to see that the automatic vesting was not being made, the appointed day was not being named, and the tenants who were to secure the immediate reduction were not getting it, were at the loss of some 10 per cent. every year, an amount that at the present time comes to £80,000, I believe.  Accordingly in 1925 this whole question was raised in the Dáil.  It was raised, as was only proper at the time, and as would be most improper at the present juncture, by Deputy Heffernan. Deputy Heffernan said:</P>
    <P>A return placed at our disposal by the Ministry of Agriculture a short time ago showed that there were over 94,000 tenants coming under the 1923 Act, and of that total at the date of the issue of the return in the case of 334 only had the appointed day been fixed.  That is a very small proportion&mdash;334 holdings compared with 94,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan at that time said that there were 94,000 holdings, whereas we calculate, basing it upon what the Minister for Agriculture said in 1923, that there were 70,000. At that time the rate of progress was very small; it was only 334 out of 94,000, and there is no proof whatever that it has increased since. Then, in order to emphasise the importance of the question at the time, it was not alone raised by Deputy Heffernan, but the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, Deputy Roddy, actually handed in a motion to raise the whole question.  He was then a member of the Government Party, and there was a big slump in Government stock at the end of 1925 because the promises that had been made in 1923 were not being fulfilled, <Col N="1072" /> and the reduction that should have been granted to the tenants was not being made to them.  There were other matters also with which Deputy Roddy was not satisfied at the time, but he dealt in particular with the delay and with the general unsatisfactoriness of the Land Commission in dealing with this question.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Land Commission Estimates this year the Minister for Lands and Agriculture stated that in his opinion the Land Commission was moving rather too quickly in this matter, and he advocated a slower pace. At the time I thought that that was an extraordinary statement, and it certainly caused a great deal of uneasiness and dissatisfaction in many quarters.  There might have been some justification for such a policy in the days of the Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>Further, he said:</P>
    <P>The Minister may quote an elaborate array of figures in order to show the amount of preliminary work the Land Commission is doing.  He did quote figures extensively in the debate on this year's Agricultural Estimate, figures designed to show the amount of land that had actually been inspected by the Commission, the amount of land that had actually been valued, and the amount of land that had actually been divided, for which land purchase agreements had been signed.  These figures undoubtedly looked very formidable on paper, but after all they carried no conviction to the minds of the ordinary small landholders throughout the country.</P>
    <P>So that at that time Deputy Roddy was not at all satisfied with the way in which the Land Commission was being worked, and he emphasised his disapproval of their dilatoriness by saying that the problem was not being tackled in a really serious and determined way; that the formalities that have to be gone through before the land finally passes into the possession of the new owners are too <Col N="1073" /> elaborate, and that it might be possible to co-ordinate these processes in some way in order to speed up the work of land division.  Deputy Roddy himself has now been in charge of the Land Commission for a number of years; he is well acquainted with these processes, and in a debate a few nights ago on this question of the delay in vesting land in the tenant proprietors, he said that a great deal of the delay was due to the question of legal procedure, although when the Land Act was being introduced it was emphasised, over and over again, that after a simple statement of the particulars of the holding were lodged with the Land Commission, upon the Appointed Day there was to be an automatic vesting of the land and an automatic reduction to the tenant.  Now we are told that there are legal formalities.  What are the legal formalities?  In the first place there is the question of title.  If the Land Commission have not sufficient examiners, why do they not apply for more?  How is it that the Land Commission, which was so slow when the Minister for Agriculture was in charge of it&mdash;he who at the end of his reign in that Department actually defended it; actually said that it was better that it should go slow &mdash;under Deputy Roddy, who had such a progressive point of view, and who was so anxious to get things moving a few years ago, shows no improvement?</P>
    <P>If it is a question of legal formality, and if, as Deputy Roddy said a few nights ago, he has not been able to simplify these processes, why has he not applied to the Dáil for money to secure more examiners in title and more barristers to deal with this question?  I cannot agree that the question of title is holding up this matter of the vesting of lands.  The House knows very well, in spite of all this talk about having to go to China and Peru in order to clear up this question of title, that in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to mention only one case&mdash;and I do not say that it is a good case, but it comes to my mind&mdash;we were able to suggest and to implement in <Col N="1074" /> legislation a method by which this question of title would be taken for granted, and you would proceed by arranging that the whole matter would be entered into later on. Whether the question of title has to be settled or whether it has not, whether the Land Act has turned out to be much more complicated than it first appeared, whether this whole question of automatically vesting on the appointed day has disappeared, and whether a whole host of new complications have sprung up I do not know; but what I do know is, that whatever the legal difficulties may be, or whatever the Departmental red-tape regulations may be, there is no justification whatever for mulcting the tenants to the extent of £80,000 a year.  They deserve that £80,000.  Farming is not so prosperous at present that they can afford to give it as a free gift to the Government.  I submit that the Government has had plenty of opportunities for dealing with the whole question of title, and that that is only a sham excuse, only an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public, that that is the reason that these people are not getting the reductions.</P>
    <P>There was also a suggestion that a great deal of the work of the Land Commission during the past five or six years consisted in dealing with and vesting lands that had been acquired under previous Acts, but we never heard at all the stage to which these transactions had been brought before 1923.  I have been informed and I believe that the Congested Districts Board had a very large number of estates prepared and practically in the last stage of transfer, and that the Land Commission should come along now, claim credit for what the Congested Districts Board had completed or had almost completed, and use that as an excuse for not proceeding with the work that it was definitely stated in 1923 they were going to complete in five years, is simply not worthy of them. There are not alone judicial tenants under the 1923 Act who are losing 2/- in the £ as long as their lands are being held up in this way and <Col N="1075" /> are not vested, but there are other classes of tenants.  I am informed that in various parts of the country there are judicial tenants whose holdings were purchased from 1912 onwards who are getting a reduction of only 3/-, whereas they are entitled to 5/6 or 6/- in the £.  An example is the estate of Trinity College in Cahirciveen.  There is also the question of non-judicial tenants.  These tenants are in a slightly different position to the judicial tenants, but we on this side of the House can see no reason why all tenants should not have their lands vested and why an appointed day should not be fixed this year, or within the next few months.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, where a Bill was introduced in 1925, the Government guaranteed that they would complete the work in four years.  It is true that they have not completed it, but at any rate they named the appointed day, and now that they propose further to postpone that appointed day, they have aroused around their heads a storm of opposition on the part of every farmer who is interested in the question. But, at the time this Act was being passed in 1923 every Deputy who took an interest in the matter, who took the Minister's words at their face value, believed honestly that the appointed day was merely a matter of automatic arrangement, was a mere question of date, that the whole matter would be settled in a short time, so that not a single member of the House. as far as I know, asked: &ldquo;Should we not put a time limit on this appointed day? Should we not say to ourselves if we feel that we can complete the work in five years, that we should definitely have it in the Act that the appointed day should not be later than this day five years?&rdquo; If that had happened we would have an opportunity of going into this whole question, and the Land Commission would have had to proceed with its work on the understanding that at the end of five years it would either have to complete the work or give a full account of its stewardship, and <Col N="1076" /> a full explanation of its failure to do so.  After five years there is no explanation, there is no method by which the matter can be raised, and there is general dissatisfaction throughout the country, not confined to our Party, or to the supporters of our Party, but general dissatisfaction amongst the supporters of all Parties with the Land Commission. I put it to the House that Deputies ought to take this opportunity of urging upon the Government that they are not going to tolerate that state of affairs, that they are not going to vote large sums of money year after year for the upkeep of the Land Commission without knowing what it is doing; above all, that Deputies should say that they are not satisfied to vote such large sums of money while they know that the professions of the Land Commission, and the intentions of the legislature in this matter, are not being carried out, and that the tenants are being mulcted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this vote which has not been touched upon so far in the debate. I think it is important that it should be mentioned, because it emphasises the need for economy in a particular way.  I allude to the fact that of this vote of seven and a half millions a very considerable proportion will leave the country in the course of its spending.  I do not think that phase of expenditure has ever got anything like the attention it deserves to get.  In a normal country where the people would be living out of their own resources, it could not be anything like so serious if the Government expenditure were some thousand pounds more or less, but in a country like this, where people are very largely living on imports, it is obviously a really serious matter.  Of these seven and a half millions, it is practically certain that about four millions will leave the country directly.  In connection with this subject, not merely as it applies to Government expenditure but to general expenditure, I wonder if the Government <Col N="1077" /> are really satisfied with the present system under which our economy is carried on?  Are they satisfied that, in the shops of the country, the main exhibits are from other countries?  Are they satisfied with the support that Irish industry is getting?  How is it that, in all their pronouncements, one never hears anything half as emphatic or half as appealing as the appeal made by an Imperialist statesman in another part of Ireland recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather singular that it should be left to this leading Imperialist to make an appeal for home industry, while here, where nationality is such a big tradition, we never hear an appeal from the top.  We are being sneered at and ridiculed for talking about tariffs. We are painted practically as the enemies of the people, but no alternative system is suggested from the Government side.  None of us, perhaps, would want tariffs if it were possible to secure that home manufacturers would get a fair chance without legislative help.  It is to be deplored, I think, that the attitude of the Government is a purely negative one on this subject.  I give the Government full credit for this fact: that in connection with a lot of expenditure under the Central Purchasing Department and Post Office purchases, and so on, Irish manufacturers are getting a very big chance. Even with that, there still remain great masses of the people to be stimulated on this question.  It is surely, I think, the duty of the Government to appeal to the people not to be leaving everything to legislation, to remember that they have a duty to themselves, apart from what a government can do for them.  I believe if such an appeal were made to the people from time to time that a lot of good would ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to another matter, I think that the Government could long ago have effected a very necessary settlement in connection with a <Col N="1078" /> controversy that has been going on simply by making a clear statement of their position.  I allude to the controversy which has been upsetting education so much, and which is causing a lot of confusion in the country&mdash;the question of compulsory Irish in the schools.  We, of course, are more than satisfied with the policy of the Government in regard to the teaching of Irish in the schools.  But we do not think that the Government should be satisfied to allow to continue a controversy that is upsetting education and leading to hopes on the part of certain people that they will be able to effect a complete and fundamental change in the system of education in this country.  Nobody wants to restrict liberty, but on a question like that I think it is only fair to the minority, who are agitating for this change, and agitating against compulsory Irish, that they should be told definitely that there is not the smallest chance of their agitation being successful.</P>
    <P>In connection also with the attitude of a certain minority towards the economic ideals of the country, I think it is only due to that minority to tell them that, in that matter also, they will have to reconcile themselves to the wishes of the majority of the people; that this country should be built up as a nation and not as a mere colony or as a loose community, basing its whole system of production on the requirements of another country.  I think that question is much more serious than is generally realised, because it is leading inevitably to a hostility towards the minority that no one desires. It may be a question of opinion as to whether Parnell's dictum that Ireland cannot afford the loss of a single Orangeman could be accepted to-day.  But, certainly as far as the Saorstát is concerned, no one desires to lose a single one of what may be termed the minority. There is this to be observed, however, that if the minority is to continue to agitate that they should be allowed to act as West Britons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest then that I am hardly out of order in noting omissions on the part of the Government, omissions which are leading to a rather unfortunate state of things in the country.  I think that these questions are important enough to be mentioned.  I think that if the Government gave this matter some attention it would probably put an end to the hostility that is undoubtedly growing on the part of a number of people, as they observe what I will term again the minority being tacitly encouraged to look for a system of education and a system of economy that would suit themselves but a system that is utterly alien to the expectations and the ideals of the bulk of the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Government to give more attention to the question of encouraging support for Irish industries.  I think that no amount of legislation enforced by the Dáil would be nearly as successful in securing support for Irish industries as a genuine appeal made to the people from the top to give voluntary support to their own manufactures. In view of the terrible conditions that prevail in most country towns at present, such an appeal is, I think, more than due. The Government cannot be satisfied with the present system under which practically all our requirements, not <Col N="1080" /> merely in manufactured goods but to a large extent in food, clothing, furniture, building materials, and so on, are being imported from abroad and paid for by a few agricultural products which do not contain a big labour factor.  I am sure it would have a very good effect if, in an appeal from those in high places, it were made quite clear that everyone who was a good citizen was expected to give his support to Irish products, and that what some people are agitating for, a merely agricultural community, was not possible and would never meet the desires or requirements of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has given us another example of the peculiar method of carrying on debates in this House, a method adopted by the Government.  The Minister who is in control of a particular debate gets up and makes a short statement in which he tells the House little or nothing.  That is followed by several speeches from the Opposition.  There is absolute silence on the Government Benches.  Although we are to-day voting £7,500,000 there is no criticism either of a constructive or destructive nature from any of the benches except the benches of the Opposition.  I do not know what members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party consider their duty to their constituents.  I would imagine that they would on a serious occasion like this, when it is a question of dealing with such a large amount of money, and where they would obviously have the opportunity of doing something which would help the people, take part in the debate, but instead they remain absolutely silent.  I suppose we should only expect to be treated in the way in which we are usually treated in debates of this sort, and that at the end when no counter statements can be made explaining misrepresentations or dealing with remarks that some Minister, or one or two members of the Government, will get up and make the kind of speeches to which we have been treated in recent debates, and insult those who had spoken in the debate in a way which, <Col N="1081" /> to do justice to the Ministers, they would not indulge in in ordinary intercourse with the people.  When they get up in these debates they think it is an opportunity of wrapping what they think is a mantle of statesmanship around themselves and insulting others who are entitled to have their opinions in reference to the interests of the country seriously considered.</P>
      <P>At present, we have an enormous amount of unemployment.  We have misery amongst the farmers, and a condition of things which on a Vote like this one would imagine should draw from all Parties in this House criticism whether of a friendly nature or of the opposite kind.  One would expect that the brains of this House would be applied in this debate. The question of vesting land under the Land Commission has been mentioned.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries was present he made no attempt to answer the question raised, or to offer any hope to the farmers whose holdings have not yet been vested. Clearly the intention of the Land Act was to vest the land as rapidly as possible.  It is largely a question of administration, and if the Appointed Day were fixed the judicial holdings could be vested very rapidly, but some people contend that the Land Commission consider their work will come to an end too soon if the land is vested, and that responsibility for delay in vesting the land rests with the Land Commission. If that is the contention, it seems to me that it is the permanent officials of the Department who are controlling the Ministers in this House, and it is not this House and the Ministers who are masters of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we shall have the opportunity of hearing some of the Ministers and then some of the Opposition members speak before the debate is concluded by the Minister. It is really most demoralising to find debates carried on on the lines of recent debates.  Members on this side speak and they wait to see if some members of the Government, <Col N="1082" /> either of the Party generally or of the Front Bench, are going to meet the arguments.  Suddenly we find the Minister called upon to conclude. It is a set phrase&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister to conclude.&rdquo;  We are forced, although we received no answer to our arguments, to get up and carry on the debate in the hope of getting answers to our questions and getting the opportunity of debating the questions raised in a proper manner, and as they should be debated in a House which represents the people.  I would like to emphasise the necessity of something being done as regards fixing the Appointed Day soon.  It could be done easily in the case of judicial holdings, but in the case of non-judicial holdings and of untenanted land naturally a little more time would be required.  I hope the Government will offer not us, but the people, some hope of speeding up this matter of the vesting of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two matters to which I would like to refer briefly.  The first is a reduction of a sum of £200,000 in the Land Commission Estimate.  Unfortunately in dealing with this Vote on Account we do not know the nature of that reduction.  We shall know it later.  If it were a genuine reduction it would certainly be praiseworthy, but in connection with land I am suspicious of it, particularly in view of the policy of festina lente which is being followed in dealing with land.  The Act of 1923 obviously by its tenor, and judging from the speeches made at its introduction, contemplated the immediate vesting of the lands.  To the best of my recollection, the Minister for Agriculture stated publicly that the operations would be completed within five years.  The five years have gone by, and I would like to know what percentage of the land has now been vested.  Judging by the amount of stock floated it seems to me it will take another half a century to complete the transaction. Where a fair rent has been fixed there is no difficulty whatsoever. The majority of the small holdings <Col N="1083" /> could have been vested any day since 1923.  Section 40 puts the onus on the landlord as regards title.  Now, it is a very serious matter for the tenants.  They get 10 per cent. reduction on vesting; in addition to that, the payment of the purchase money begins only on vesting.  We have had a case quoted here where a tenant was 17 years waiting to have his farm vested, and he may have to wait another three years, so that for twenty years he may be paying interest in lieu of rent, and the time at which he begins to pay for the purchase of his farm is put back.  That is a very serious thing for the farmers of this country.</P>
      <P>It is calculated that the Land Commission makes £80,000 per annum on this.  The landlord also gains, for the interest in lieu of rent pays him much better than the 4½ per cent. he gets later on.  Whether it is the extra gain to the Land Commission or the consideration for the landlord that is causing the delay&mdash;and I think it is not the latter&mdash;we would like some explanation of it.  Of course, in the case of a non-judicial holding the price is fixed by the Inspectors and there will have to be more delay, but I think the delay is inexcusable.  I think it would be quite possible and quite feasible to have the appointed day fixed, or at least to give the tenant the advantage of the 10 per cent. reduction whether or not the question of title is definitely fixed. Matters of that nature could be definitely adjusted afterwards and the day fixed after which the tenant will get the benefit of the 10 per cent. reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the policy regarding Irish and education generally.  That will be gone into more minutely in subsequent debates, but I wonder whether the abolition of the summer courses for the teachers does in any way tend to raise the hope that the status of Irish in the schools might be reduced. There is much to be said, I must admit, for the abolition of such courses.  Very often the courses <Col N="1084" /> were not conducted as they should have been.  That was not the case generally, but very often they were not conducted as they should have been, and the money for the fostering of the Irish language might have been more wisely spent, perhaps, in certain cases.  The purpose of those courses was to train the teachers.  To my thinking, it would take two years more of such courses in order to complete the work begun, and to stop them now will do harm.</P>

In particular, I wish that all the Ministers would take the advice given from those benches frequently in the same manner as my friend, the Minister for Justice, has taken the advice which I gave him on a few occasions here.  I am very glad to notice here in the Public Works and Buildings Vote a reduction of something like £200,000 in the sum contemplated this year.  I hope that reduction is going to be carried on in connection with some other barracks besides the barracks that I mentioned here last year, which the Minister for Justice has now decided are not necessary.  I thank him on behalf of the taxpayers of my constituency for sparing us this £1,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my colleagues have dealt with the vesting of lands. I would like to hear some definite pronouncement on this matter from the Ministers opposite.  We have from time to time heard very definite protests from the farming community on this question of vesting land. I think that it is an outrageous procedure on the part of the Land Commission who have a definite <Col N="1085" /> vested interest in this matter, inasmuch as they collar apparently £80,000 out of those unfortunate tenants who are not vested but who are paying interest in lieu of rent. That money is collared for the rent, etc., and for income tax.  I think it is high time that something was done in this matter and that the appointed day was definitely fixed.  I raised the matter here last week, expecting that I would get a definite reply from the Minister or from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries.  Unfortunately, nothing is apparently further from their minds than to take steps to get rid of the burden that has been put on the farmers of the Free State by this landlord Act of 1923.  One of the reasons which were given was the delay and trouble of proving title. Under this landlord Act interest in lieu of rent is collected from those tenants, and apparently nobody has any title to collect that money.  If a landlord cannot prove title, why should these rents be collected and handed over to him?  If the landlord has not a title to the estate, why should the tenants on that estate pay him interest in lieu of rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act the onus is on the landlord to prove title.  What do we find?  We find that the Land Commission is paying the landlord for proving title and here and there down the country one of the old agents of the landlord, those old sharks, were picked out and transferred up here to prove title for the landlords and they were paid for doing that by the taxpayers.  I do not think that any other body of men in any country in the world&mdash; not even in Africa&mdash;would put up with the treatment that has been meted out to the farmers by the present Government.  Only for the fact that they have been accustomed for hundreds of years to be slavedriven they would not put up with that treatment.  The little bit of freedom and independence they got through the reign of the I.R.A. in this country was very quickly taken from them by the present Government. The tenants of estates down <Col N="1086" /> the country who were given a breath of hope and some idea that they were to get justice from their own are now left in despair.</P>
    <P>We have heard in this House from time to time speeches and declarations made about the agricultural depression.  I think that not since I came here, at any rate, nor in the last five years, was any effort made by the Government to relieve that agricultural depression.  We had very definite pronouncements quoted here to-day by Deputy Derrig.  These pronouncements were made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture when he was introducing the Land Act of 1923.  He stated very definitely that there was to be no period at which the tenant would be asked to pay interest in lieu of rent.  That speech was made by him on the 28th May, 1923, when introducing the Land Bill.  He stated that the tenants were going immediately to enjoy a reduction of 30 per cent., and, in some cases, of 35 per cent. in their rents, and that the period during which they would pay interest in lieu of rent was to be abolished.  He stated further, &ldquo;We have endeavoured in this way to avoid the delays and obstruction in the previous Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, he was going to get rid of the red tape, but apparently the landlords' interests in this country and in this House were too strong for the Minister&mdash;that is, if he had not a leaning that way himself. Though there is at present in this House a majority representing the farming interests, nothing whatever has been done to compel the Minister for Agriculture or the Government to redeem the promises made in 1923.  I will not make any allusion to the Party once known here as the Farmers' Party.  They are dead, and I do not think anybody is sorry for them.  I think the turn-about-face given here last night by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs finishes the Farmers' Union movement in this country and the Farmers' Party here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The statement made by the Minister for Agriculture when introducing the Land Act of 1923 must definitely be carried out.  I admit that the Minister changed his views very rapidly, because in 1925 he mentioned that he would rather they slowed up a little bit.  When we compare figures we find that he slowed up very effectively.  The Northern Government's Land Bill was introduced in May, 1925.  In November, 1927, 6,700 holdings were vested out of 25,000.  In February, 1929, 6,114 had been vested in the Free State under the 1923 Land Act. Of course, when the Minister for Agriculture changed his mind, when he definitely went over to the landlords' interests, and when the influences of the Land Commission were too strong for him, he handed all over to the duds of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I used any expression about a Minister of this House that was not in order, I withdraw it.  The Minister for Agriculture made a very definite statement when he was introducing the 1923 Land Act, and he left the farmers of the Twenty-Six Counties under the impression that there was to be no delay whatsoever in the matter of vesting.  He stated also that interest in lieu of rent was to be abolished. &ldquo;We have endeavoured in this way to avoid the delays and obstruction in the previous Acts.&rdquo;  That statement was made on 28th May, 1923. The Minister left the farmers under the definite impression that there would be no period in which they would be hanging between heaven and earth, as the saying is.  They were to be vested at once and they were going to get a reduction of 35 per cent. on their rents.  Those promises have not been carried out. We find ourselves dragging on from year to year.  As Deputy Derrig stated, it will probably take the Land Commission 68½ years to vest the land in all the tenants.  I see no excuse whatsoever for that.  When difficulties were found with regard to the Agricultural Credit Act, the Minister came here looking for further powers and no delay was caused here.  I am sure if the Minister for Lands and Fisheries found any difficulty in vesting, and if he came here, there would not be a single Deputy to oppose any proposal he would make with a view to hastening the vesting of land.  Of course, that would be against the policy of the Land Commission and against the policy of the landlords' agents throughout the country who are brought to the Land Commission in order to prove titles and who are paid by the State, when really the payment should come from the landlord. If the landlords have no title to an estate or cannot prove title, why should the Land Commission collect rents for them?  Whom are they collecting the rents for if the landlord is unable to prove title? Apparently it is a landlords' Government and a landlords' Land Commission that we have here.</P>

      <P>One would imagine, listening to the speech of the last Deputy, that he has a complete monopoly of sentiments on behalf of the farmers.  When the farmers of Ireland were fighting the landlords, and when they were making every effort to protect their homesteads, there are men here who stood by them and ran the danger of having their heads battered by those who were backing the landlords and the crow-bar brigade and the wielders of the battering-ram.  I may tell the Deputy that as far as his wonderful sympathy for the farmers is concerned, we, on this side, take it all with a grain of salt.  I rise to support the Vote on Account proposed by the Minister for Finance.  Last year we heard the Deputy denounce other extravagances.  This year we heard him denounce other economies. They cannot have it both ways.  It is impossible to continue a policy of high revenue and at the same time to make no attempt at reductions.  The Minister is held up here because he has selected special Votes to reduce. Deputy Lemass stated that a million of money could be saved by reducing the Army and the Civic Guards, but I wish to inform the House that the reduction of both one and the other is in the hands of Deputy Lemass and his Party, if they drop this policy of unrest, this policy of disturbing the conscience of the people all over the 26 Counties.  They have held out the hope that if they had a chance, as he said in his speech, of smashing the Dáil and the Government, they would do so.  On the face of such a statement coming from the other side, how can ever the Army or the Civic Guards be reduced?  I consider that the Minister for Finance has gone a very considerable extent when he has reduced them so far, and in face of the speeches that have been delivered in this House or outside it there is no hope whatever of making any further reductions in the Army or the Civic Guards.  As I said, let them change their policy and throw in their weight with the development of the country.  They talk of industries and all that, but those <Col N="1090" /> would get a fillip if they would only drop this policy of keeping the country in a state of turmoil with speeches in which there is no bottom whatever.</P>

      <P>Deputies to-night, in the course of their speeches, have referred frequently to the Northern Ireland Land Acts without apparently having studied these Acts. Deputy Corry, Deputy Derrig and Deputy Little referred to the benefits which tenants in Northern Ireland enjoy as compared with the benefits which tenants in the Free State enjoy at the moment.  It is quite true that in the Northern Ireland Land Act of 1925 there is a general appointed day for all estates, but in the amending Act of 1929, which is now almost law, the Land Commission of Northern Ireland, realising the impossibility of fixing one general appointed day for all estates, have provided that there shall be, as there is in the Land Act of 1923, a separate appointed day for estates.  It is quite impossible to appoint one general appointed day for all estates.  The difficulties appertaining to the estates if they come in under the 1923 Act vary considerably.  One estate may be dealt with in a comparatively easy manner, whilst another may present innumerable difficulties.  These difficulties, particularly in regard to estates in the congested districts in counties like Mayo and Galway, have been so great that a special staff of men are at present engaged in dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Corry stated that the Minister for Agriculture promised the Dáil that there would be no delay in vesting estates coming under the 1923 Act.  I do not know what the nature of the speech was which the Minister made in this Dáil but I am perfectly certain that the Minister made no such foolish statement as Deputy Corry alleges he made.  The procedure with regard to the vesting of estates is clearly contained in the Land Acts.  The Land Act of 1924 lays it down for <Col N="1091" /> every estate that certain enquiries in connection with the vesting of every estate must be made and that a certain procedure must be followed. The Minister was responsible for introducing that section into the Act and, as a matter of fact, the statutory rules that have been drafted by the Land Commission based on that very section have been approved of. These statutory rules guide the Commissioners in the procedure that operates in regard to the vesting of all estates.</P>
    <P>I indicated, in the discussion of a question on the adjournment the other evening, some of the difficulties we have got to encounter in fixing the appointed day in estates coming under the 1923 Act, but in estates in counties like Mayo, Galway and Sligo, and perhaps to a small extent in Clare and Kerry, considerable difficulty is experienced in fixing the turbary rights, in disposing of drainage maintenance rights, and in disposing of all sorts of questions relating to boundaries. Deputies should also remember that in dealing with estates under the 1923 Act no comparison whatever can be made with the estates that came under the earlier Acts of 1903 and 1909.  They should remember that the Act of 1903 was a voluntary Act, and that difficulties of that kind were mutually adjusted between the landlords and the tenants acting, I assume, through their solicitors or agents on both sides.  As a matter of fact it took years and years to dispose of some of their difficulties in connection with turbary.  In some of the 1903 Act estates it took years to dispose of these difficulties.  As a matter of fact there are turbary rights not yet disposed of and still in dispute between landlords and tenants.  There are other classes of difficulties, too, that are still in dispute.</P>

      <P>Before a holding can be vested it is essential that every single legal difficulty should be removed <Col N="1092" /> out of the way before a holding can possibly be vested in a tenant.  It is absolutely essential that a tenant once he signs his vesting agreement should have an absolutely clear and safe title to his lands, and in order that he may be assured of that safe and clear title, it is absolutely essential that every possible legal difficulty should be removed out of the way, because if you get a tenant to sign a vesting agreement without removing all those legal difficulties, without removing every cause and source of trouble, you are, as I said previously, simply vesting litigation costs and expenses in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig, I think, said that the fact that the Land Commission are not proceeding more rapidly with the vesting of holdings or estates under the 1923 Act means a loss of something like £80,000 a year to the tenants.  That estimate is absurd.  The loss at the most, if it can be called a loss, would not represent half that amount.  After all, the loss to the class of tenants in which Deputy Corry and Deputy Derrig are interested, the poor tenants, I assume, in counties like Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and other congested counties, whose rentals would probably not amount, at the very outside, to more than £10 a year, could not be more than anything from 12/- to 15/- a year. Assuming that it was possible to take some sort of legal short cut in the work of speeding up this vesting, the tenants who would gain most are the very large farmers in Dublin, Kildare and other eastern counties.  It would represent no appreciable gain whatever to the smaller tenants.  There is not, as far as I can see at the moment, any possible means of speeding up the work of vesting lands, other than tightening up the administrative machinery for the purpose of carrying out this work of vesting.  So far as the Land Commission is concerned, every possible step has been taken with the object of speeding up the work of vesting holdings in tenants acquired not only under the 1923 Act, but under the 1909 Act as well, because <Col N="1093" /> there are still remnants of estates to be dealt with under the 1909 Act, and still smaller remnants of estates to be dealt with under the 1903 Act.</P>
    <P>Every possible step is being taken to speed up the work of vesting, with the result that to-day the work is proceeding much more quickly. I can safely say that it is proceeding at least twice as fast as we were able to proceed last year or the year before. After all, I realise the needs and the difficulties of the small tenants in the western counties probably as well as Deputy Derrig.</P>

      <P>I realise their difficulties. The gain would be very small, even assuming that their holdings could be vested in them by some automatic process, and nobody has indicated how it could be done or what legal machinery could be devised for the purpose of doing it.  I have devoted a considerable amount of time and thought to it, and I am not satisfied that it is possible to adopt some legal short-cut for the purpose of speeding up the work of vesting.  It is absolutely essential for the security of the farmers themselves and the security of the State that every step in the procedure we are following at the moment should be gone through fully and completely. It is essential once a holding is vested in a tenant that every possible legal safeguard should be adopted so that he may be absolutely secure in his title to that property and that there may be no danger of litigation subsequently.  If you are going to give a tenant a secure title it is utterly impossible to dispense <Col N="1094" /> with any step or stage of the procedure that we are following at the moment in the vesting of tenanted land.  Deputy Derrig or some other Deputy referred to the fact that it is provided in the 1923 Act in Northern Ireland that some sort of compensation would be paid to the tenants in respect of the difference between interest in lieu of rent which they were paying and the annuity when subsequently fixed. But Deputies should remember that there is no comparison between the land problem in Northern Ireland and the land problem here.  The land problem in Northern Ireland is infinitesimal in comparison with the problem here.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The machinery of the Bill is quite simple.  On the appointed day the holdings will vest in the Land Commission.

The interest in lieu of rent period is abolished.&rdquo;</P>

If there is any question about title it is a question between the people who at present own the property and the mortgagees, whoever they may be. The question of charges as against an estate should cease now, and whatever charges there are against an estate should be against the stock <Col N="1096" /> or whatever is going to be held by the landlord until such time as these mortgages are cleared.  There ought to be no difficulty in this matter, but lawyers seem to be too strong for the best intentions.  The whole thing could be done in six months.

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, not to any bogus grievance, but to a very real grievance which exists in the case of some small estates and some fairly large estates, the particulars of which apparently have not yet reached the chief Opposition Party or Deputy Gorey.  There are still in this country a number of English-managed estates, or estates, in part, English-managed. As the result of the procedure of the Land Act of 1923, the happy position of landlords of estates such as these is that they are drawing not 75 per cent. of the income, as provided for by the Act, but what is, in fact, at least 100 per cent., or a little more.  Although I do not see eye to eye, from what I have heard, with the Land Commission with regard to this, I submit, in the case of these estates, where the landlord is doing nothing to carry out his obligations towards keeping the estate in repair and providing the necessary works, that these estates ought to get priority.  At all events, there should be speedy investigation and inquiry, because the tenant will not do it, as no fund is provided for him, and the fund which does belong to the tenant in fact, and which the tenant must get when the lands are being valued under the provisions of the Act, is at present going into the pockets of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> I know that there are many difficulties in connection with the administration of the Land Acts.  1903 is a long time ago, and at the end of a quarter of a century there are unfortunately disputes still unsettled under the 1903 Act, which the wit of man has not been able to settle, and under which both the tenants and the landlords are suffering very considerably. These delays will occur&mdash; whether the fault lies with the lawyers, or the tenants, or the landlords, or the Land Commission does not matter.  It is beyond human ingenuity to prevent these occurring. The instance which I gave is one which can be put a stop to, and which ought to be put a stop to.  I submit that cases such as I have referred to ought to be dealt with in special priority, and that those tenants who are in an unusual position ought to be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions were asked which I might reply to, although they were raised casually. I was asked whether the Increase of Rent and Mortgage (Restrictions) Act would be renewed or extended, or whether the legislation recommended by the Town Tenants Commission would be introduced.  It will probably be impossible to introduce a Bill based on the report of the Town Tenants Commission and, therefore, I am fairly sure that there will be no alternative to an extension of the existing legislation, until the more comprehensive Bill can be prepared.  I was asked about the reduction which appears on the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Economies are being effected in various respects in that Department.  Amongst the economies which will take place will be a reduction of deliveries in a great number of rural areas from six to three per week.  Somebody said that that was hitting the farmer. The saving which will be effected will be of benefit mostly to the farmers, because ultimately the greater part of the money raised in taxation will come from the agricultural community.  There are a great <Col N="1098" /> number of rural deliveries which are entirely uneconomic in the sense that the revenue resulting from them does not go any distance towards paying the cost.  They are uneconomic in this sense also: that the communications which are delivered are very seldom ones which will suffer in the least from a delay of one day. Where you have certain types of business communications, especially in large commercial centres, a reduction of deliveries which would mean a day's delay might have very serious consequences.  So far as the deliveries in these rural areas are concerned, it will very seldom indeed happen that there will be any disadvantage to the recipients of the communications as a result of a day's delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some reference was made to the money provided for arterial drainage and to the Barrow drainage.  So far as arterial drainage is concerned, the thing that has transpired more and more clearly during the last couple of years is that there is very little economic drainage to be done in the country.  The vast majority of the schemes examined have been schemes the cost of which is so great in comparison with the good that will be done, that it is extremely doubtful whether it is any advantage to proceed with them.  We had a suspicion before the Arterial Drainage Act was passed that most of the good drainage schemes had already been carried out, and we knew that the schemes which still remained to be dealt with were not at all so attractive, but we did not know that so many of them would be so very far from being economic as has turned out to be the case.  It is not possible to get ahead at a very rapid rate with arterial drainage.  Great care will have to be taken in the preparation of schemes and in the selection of them, if there is not to be a tremendous waste of public money. Apart from that, there are cases where schemes could be gone on with if county councils were prepared to make the contributions required.  In some cases the county councils have agreed to make the <Col N="1099" /> contributions, but in many other cases they have failed or declined. In that way, work is held up.  There is provision in the Estimates for all the work in connection with arterial drainage which it is likely to be possible to do in the coming year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Barrow drainage, the position is that a good deal of the work during the coming period will be work where mechanical appliances can be used and where the cost of labour will not be so great, consequently, while the work of the scheme will proceed as it has been proceeding, the amount of money that will fall to be expended in the coming year will not be as great as it has been in other years.</P>
    <P>There were some references made to the Economy Committee, of which Deputy Heffernan is Chairman. That Committee, while it has not presented a report, has done a very great deal of work during the year.  In addition to investigations carried out by individual members, or by groups of members of the Committee, 44 meetings of the Committee have been held.  The suggestions and criticisms of that Committee, although they have not been embodied in a report and presented to the Executive Council have been availed of in the Departments where the Estimates were being prepared and in the Department of Finance.  I may say that if it had not been for the work of that Committee the Estimates would be nothing like as low as they are, as indicated in the Table attached showing the particulars of the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>This debate, of course, has followed stereotyped lines.  We have had the usual talk of economy from the Opposition Benches and the usual fault-finding with any saving of expenditure as indicated in the Estimates.  The real difficulty in reducing taxation is the difficulty that arises in the ever pressing demands for increased expenditure.  Some people want increased expenditure under heads that can be dignified with the name of social services; <Col N="1100" /> other people want it under other heads, but the experience of anybody who attempts to reduce or control expenditure is that there is very little support for the actual work of controlling or reducing expenditure.  There is a great deal of lip service to economy and there is a great habit of attacking things that people dislike for political or other reasons in the interests of economy, but I do not feel that there is a very sincere desire for it.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to talk about reducing the expenditure on the Civic Guard to half.  That is simply and entirely absurd.  Any attempt to reduce that expenditure to anything like what is suggested, having regard to the remote and recent history of this country, would have nothing but the most serious reaction and could lead to nothing but very much increased expenditure on the police or military services in the future.  It must be faced as a fact that there is not the public respect for law or for the rights of individuals and that there is not the civic courage in this country that there is in other countries.</P>
    <P>There are countries where, if crimes like the crimes against jurors and witnesses that took place here recently occurred, there would be the strongest condemnation not from one political party only, but from all political parties, and there would not merely be condemnation of the crime but there would be encouragement to all members of the public to assist the police in bringing the criminals to justice.  There would be this feeling amongst jurors that they would suffer anything rather than be diverted from doing their duty by a handful of what somebody called sewer-rats.  We have not that civic spirit in the country.  We have people standing aside and people almost encouraging it, people scoffing at the police in their attempts to deal with these crimes, and when we have responsible people&mdash;and I include the people on the opposite benches&mdash;failing to do their duty in these matters, then we cannot arrive at such a state in this country that <Col N="1101" /> we could have a reduction in police expenditure that might be possible under entirely different conditions. But even if everybody did their duty it takes a good while to arrive at a state of affairs that would exist if we had had a different history both in the remote past and in the recent past.  No matter what anybody did, it would be a considerable time before the police expenditure could be cut down.  I do not know whether it could ever be reduced to half, considering the duties we throw upon the police.</P>
    <P>One of the items of the policy of the Government in recent years has been this: While we felt we could not reduce the numbers of the police and that we could not alter the system of policing to, let us say, the village constable system, we felt that we ought try to give the police additional duties.  Along the Border, for instance, the police have been required to do duty that would normally be done by Customs Preventive officers.  The expenditure on the Customs staff is reduced in that way.  The police spend part of their time doing customs work and are available for other work at other times.</P>
    <P>In the same way in enforcing the School Attendance Act police are employed, thus saving the salaries of School Attendance Officers, and other work is thrown upon the police.  It may be possible to throw some more of that kind of work upon them and, while not reducing the police Vote, to save expenditure in other directions.  If we were thinking of reducing the police to half the present cost&mdash;it would be utterly impossible&mdash;it could not be contemplated without taking certain duties from the police.  I know that in Dublin there are calls for more policemen for point duty.  Perhaps we could employ a different type of officer who would merely do point duty, but I doubt that there would be any great saving.  In individual districts where houses are built and where there are no police stations, like those districts on the North side, deputation after deputation has come to the Minister for Justice <Col N="1102" /> to ask for a police station and for more police patrols and all that sort of thing.  Petty crime and offences of one sort or another occur because there is no police station in the neighbourhood and because patrols are not as numerous as they should be.  In many country districts where there is very little crime there might easily be, and in some of them there would be a great deal of crime, if there was no police station.</P>
    <P>Then take the question of poteen, which is, I think, a desperate evil, and, where it exists, a most demoralising thing.  There are areas where the poteen traffic would grow to a tremendous extent if you had not a police station.  More harm possibly would be done by the growth of that poteen evil than would justify the payment of police.  Even if it was thought justifiable, which I do not, to bring about a big reduction in the whiskey duty, you could not bring about any reduction of the whiskey duty that would make the making of poteen unprofitable.</P>
    <P>There are areas where the police have to be employed for that.  In some countries there is no such tendency. It is just one of the heritages of the evils of the past here.  We have the poteen-making tradition. We have clergymen and all sorts of people who are not ashamed to have poteen in their houses, who are not ashamed to lend countenance to poteen-making.  You have District Justices who find it hard to believe that it is a serious offence.  I must say that they are better than the justices who preceded them, but there is that feeling that it is not a terrible offence.  It is consequently a difficult thing to deal with.  A reduction to half the number of the present police force would leave whole areas of the country sodden with drink and the crime that would follow the unrestricted manufacture of poteen.  I have often discussed the question of the police force with the Minister for Justice.  I have been even anxious that we should make some attempt in some of the more orderly areas of the country with the inauguration of the village constable system but, while I would be very anxious to see <Col N="1103" /> it tried in a few favourable areas and make other arrangements for the carrying out of police duties which that would involve, I am convinced that there are a number of areas where nothing of the sort could or ought to be attempted.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the sort of sweeping reductions which Deputy de Valera indicated could not be carried out at all.  As regards the Army, when the Army was costing four millions a year I succeeded in having the view&mdash;I had not any trouble about it&mdash;and I put forward the proposal which was accepted by the Cabinet that the cost of the Army must come down within two or three years to two million pounds and afterwards to one and a half millions.  Having come to the point where the cost of the Army is under one and a half million pounds, I am not prepared to take some arbitrary figure and say that we will spend no more than that upon it.  I think that the time has been reached when we should look at it in another way and see what sort of a defence organisation we want and, having made up our minds on that point, see what is the smallest defence organisation we ought to have.  Having satisfied ourselves on that we should then see how we can maintain at a reasonable degree of efficiency such defence organisation. Leaving the question of internal order altogether out of it, I am very clear that we must have a defence organisation here.</P>
    <P>I have said in the Dáil before that if there is any war situation arising at our doors, I want the position to be that there will be no excuse for and little danger of flooding the country with troops from outside.  I want the position to exist here that a very considerable force can be quickly organised, and I think it might bring calamity on the country if there were no means of bringing to the colours quickly here a substantial defence force.  It might lead to a military occupation which would otherwise be avoided, and a military occupation might lead to all the affairs and interests of this country being really <Col N="1104" /> handled and controlled without regard to them.  I do not necessarily say that anyone is going to attack us, or that anyone may be regarded as an enemy towards us, but I think, with international morality in its present state, if this country is to have as much security as it ought to have, that there should be a defence force.  Whatever people of different parties may think with regard to the use of a defence force for the mere work of police support, I think it ought to be possible in a reasonable atmosphere to hammer out some scheme of national defence largely, in my opinion, based on the militia or territorial system.  There may be differences in detail in regard to it, but there would not be fundamental differences of opinion.  If we are to do any good with such defence force, I believe that the question must be faced in that way, and, having got down to under one and a half millions as the cost of the Army, it is no use saying that it should cost one million one hundred thousand pounds or one million two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, or nine hundred thousand pounds.  It might be that a quite satisfactory system of defence could be maintained for a lower figure, but I think we must work it out.</P>
    <P>There are people who are very fond of talking about the taxable capacity of the country.  It is difficult to determine what is the taxable capacity of the country, and I do not think that comparisons with the wealth of another country are any great guide to us.  In a British despatch about the public debt, a suggestion was made, based on a speech delivered in the Dáil, to the effect that the taxable capacity of the Saorstát might be taken as one and a half per cent. of the taxable capacity of Great Britain.  I do not know whether that figure could be questioned very much, but even if we were to accept it, it does not constitute any proof that we could carry on our public services for twelve millions or that we ought to try to carry them on for that sum.  I think that the taxable capacity of a <Col N="1105" /> country depends not merely on the wealth of the country, but on what is being done with the money raised in taxation.  It might well be advisable in some cases to increase taxation if the use of it was going to be of sufficient benefit to the country. In any case, certainly, if we begin to calculate the taxable capacity of the country on the same basis which led to the conclusion that we should spend only twelve millions on our public services, we would have to decide that that calculation was on a wrong basis somehow, because we could not carry on on twelve millions. Two or three of our services would go far to absorb twelve million pounds.  When you consider education alone&mdash;and I do not think that less money can be spent on it&mdash; and when you remember that it costs four millions, when you add to that old age pensions, you get nearly seven millions.  Add to that amount the grants to local authorities&mdash; about £2,400,000&mdash;and you have over nine million pounds for three headings alone.</P>
    <P>I think nobody can get anywhere with that argument.  It is merely something in the nature of a cheap line of newspaper or platform argument to talk about the taxable capacity of this country.  I think we must see whether particular services are value for the money, in the circumstances that exist here, and do our best to decide in that way whether we can cut off this expenditure or abstain from another expenditure, having regard to all the circumstances. No party will find that the cutting down of expenditure is popular.  There are one or two items, which people advocate more for reasons of politics than for those of economy.  I take the argument which we hear from time to time with reference to the Governor-General's establishment as having no real relation to economy and as being merely a political argument.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the people who want a different sort of State here had their way, whoever occupied a sort of titular headship would have some such establishment and would be a <Col N="1106" /> source of some such expenditure.  I do not think that it can be avoided. Countries very distant from Europe might find it possible to avoid things that we should not avoid in the national interest.  In my view a country like New Zealand might avoid things which it would not be in the public interest to avoid here. As a matter of fact if the political situation were different and if there were agreements of a certain kind which do not exist at the moment, I believe it would probably be in the national interest to spend more in connection with the establishment of the Governor-General than is at present spent.  I say that because of the tendency that exists for people to be attracted out of this country and have their affections attracted from it by certain activities on the other side.</P>
    <P>I think nobody can ignore the damage that has been done to this country in the past by what I might call the migration of wealth, by families who have made money in the country not staying in the country, carrying their title to wealth and property out of the country with them, and carrying on their expenditure in other countries. I believe, of course, the language policy that has been carried out will in a generation or two do a great deal to rectify that.  I believe it is due to the extreme extent to which the denationalisation policy has gone and that the general policy will rectify it.  Nevertheless things like the particular work that might be done on a greater scale in different circumstances by the holder of an office like that of the Governor-General, would have their effect in counteracting things like that.  We cannot assume that all the States in the world, or nearly all of them, are extremely foolish, and that because of such things a good deal of the expenditure that is incurred in most places is wasted.  I do not think it is wasted expenditure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the demands to abolish the Seanad, I think again there we have a sample of the political demands which are trotted out when there is any talk of economy. <Col N="1107" /> I think, while some Deputies may doubt it, that the existence of a second House which can hold up measures passed in time of excitement, or passed, if you like, in a particularly partisan spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit for the sake of argument, but not otherwise, that the members of the present Seanad nearly all have the views of one Party, but taking the long view and looking, not even five years ahead, but ten or fifteen years ahead, I think that there are real advantages in having a Second Chamber. Minor economies might be effected in both the Dáil and the Seanad if some reductions in numbers were made, though I would not like to see the Dáil reduced to a small House.  I think there might be a loss of efficiency and a loss of representative character following on a great reduction in the number of members of the Dáil.  Perhaps if the membership were reduced to 125 or so, no damage would result, but these things do not give us any economy. They are not considerable, and I do not really take them very seriously as suggestions for a campaign of economy.  I think that suggestions in regard to the main things, like the Army and the police, are not the result of any real consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the suggestions in regard to these two items are merely political proposals put forward in the name of economy.  It is very difficult to get substantial economies without losses which perhaps go a considerable way towards neutralising the benefits of these economies.  You cannot get economy without bringing about unemployment in certain directions, and that unemployment represents some loss in itself.  We thought it desirable to go as far as we reasonably could in preventing increased calls upon the tax-payer, because while by raising taxation and continuing expenditure for relief schemes or other schemes advocated here, we could give employment, Deputies must realise that while you can <Col N="1108" /> easily see the employment that is given as a result of the expenditure of monies raised by taxation, there is likely to be something nearly approaching a corresponding amount of unemployment caused by the levying of taxation, but that unemployment is so diffused that it cannot be pointed to definitely in the way in which employment provided as a result of taxation can be pointed to.</P>
    <P>In some respects the reductions which appear in the Votes are really the result of closer estimation. In other cases they represent a cutting off of definite services or a reduction of the speed with which certain things might be done.  They do, to a very considerable extent, represent in the main real reductions in expenditure and not merely adjustments in estimation.  I am satisfied that at the moment it is very necessary in the national interest to do what can be done towards preventing any increased burden being thrown upon the tax-payer.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong for Deputies to suggest that there has been any spendthrift attitude displayed by the Government at any time.  When the Government first took office, they were occupied with a task which did not leave a great deal of leisure for a close scrutiny of expenditure, and undoubtedly things slipped in the first years which would not have slipped if the Government had been free to give its attention to normal work; but there was never at any time any deliberate swelling of expenditure, and there was never any orgy of patronage such as I think Deputy MacEntee suggested.  I think that it can certainly be claimed that there never was a Government, in the circumstances in which the present Government found itself placed, that did so very little in the way of giving rewards to people who had rendered political or politico-military services.  Practically nothing was done, and that required a very good deal of firmness, because undoubtedly there was a good deal of pressure towards some partial adoption, at <Col N="1109" /> any rate, of the spoils system which exists in certain countries.  As soon as there was any restoration of order, the Civil Service Regulation Act, which is a very rigid instrument, very much more rigid than the Order under which they work in Great Britain, was passed.</P>
    <P>There has been a consistent attempt year by year to cut down expenditure. Where expenditure has increased it has largely increased as a result of special efforts that were made to obtain increased production, or to give increased employment. Things like the Arterial Drainage Act, apart altogether from any expenditure that followed on arterial drainage, involved an increased staff for the Board of Works; building and housing programmes involved increased expenditure; things like the Shannon scheme involved increased expenditure and threw work on the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce; expenditure was incurred and a staff was required for the working of things like the Trade Loans Guarantee Act; expenditure was required for sugar beet, for the Barrow drainage scheme <Col N="1110" /> and for all these other schemes.  I do not think that we need be sorry that any of these efforts were made; and if any good, reproductive schemes are submitted to the Government in the future they will be as ready as they have been in the past to undertake them.  But they feel that in the case of any expenditure which is not directly reproductive, though it may be beneficial in many ways to the community, they ought to hold their hand as far as possible and give an opportunity to the economic recovery which has begun to proceed.</P>

      <P>In view of the answers which I got from the Minister for Local Government to questions which I put him with regard to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;livelihood&rdquo; in the Dental Act, I am forced to oppose this Vote out of the Central Fund, and I would like the House to understand the position in which I find myself.  On page 815 of the Dáil Debates, 18th July last, when the Dental Bill came back from the Seanad for final acceptance in this House, I particularly asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was responsible for the Bill in both Houses, this question: &ldquo;Does that mean that it will allow the Dental Board to have a certain discretion and that the 10 years would include the apprenticeship years?&rdquo;&mdash; and the answer I got from the Minister was: &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  I quite understand that the position is that once an Act leaves this House, and is put to a Department, or to different people to work, they must, of necessity, translate or interpret each word according to the exact legal interpretation, but I would point out also, that if any person feels himself aggrieved with regard to the interpretation of such word, and goes to law the Courts will decide the interpretation according to the sense in which that Act was passed&mdash;according to the sense in which the word was supposed to be interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not believe that the Minister intended that young men who are excluded from sitting for the examination should have to go through that course, and to put that expense on their shoulders in order to have their positions clarified, and I would ask the Minister to do the easy and the simple thing, and do what I believe was intended by him &mdash;to allow such men who could <Col N="1114" /> ordinarily prove that they were ten years engaged at dentistry, but of which ten years a certain number of years was at apprenticeship, to sit for the examination.  I do not ask nor suggest to the Minister that they should be given the right to be on the dental register.  At the time this Bill came back from the other House the Minister was well aware of the position, and there are Senators who also understood the position as I understand it, who were interested in this Bill when it was going through.  We all understood that apprenticeship years would count, that if a person could prove that he was engaged at dentistry for ten years he would have a right to sit for the examination, and if the examiners found him competent they would pass him for inclusion on the dental register.  Now, the position is that the representative of the Dental Board with whom I have been in touch, with whom Senators have been in touch, states that they cannot possibly interpret this word in any other way than the way it has been interpreted.  That may be so, but on the other hand what was the sense of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in giving the answer he gave to the question I put him? I refer the Minister to his answer to my question on page 815 of the Dáil debates of July 18th.</P>

      <P>I spent a considerable time arguing this matter with the Board.  The official that the Board have at their disposal says that he cannot help in this.  The Minister might very well suggest to the Board that it should act according to the sense in which the Act was passed and allow such men to sit for an examination. That is all I ask.  I do not ask to have these men put on the register. I only ask that they be allowed to sit for an examination if they can prove that they have been ten years engaged in the practice of dentistry. If the Minister does not agree to that, the position will be this: that an amending Bill will have to be <Col N="1115" /> brought in to amend the word &ldquo;livelihood&rdquo; so as to allow these men to go before the Dental Board for the same examinations that are now being carried on.  If the Minister will not now agree to carry out his promise, either this House or the Seanad will be called on to do what is asked for.  It is wasting the time of the House on a trivial matter which should be carried out in an ordinary common sense way.  I ask the Minister to ask the Dental Board to construe the word &ldquo;livelihood&rdquo; in the sense in which it was intended, and in which it was passed by the House, and if he does that, so far as I am concerned, all that is required will have been done for these men, and if they fail to pass the examination nothing more can be done for them.</P>

      <P>I think it will be quite evident to the House that the bringing up of this particular point in this way is simply nonsensical and is going to lead nowhere. Sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Dentists Act indicates the conditions that must apply to persons, other than those that are in the Third Schedule, who want to sit for an examination. It is explicitly set out that, in the first place, &ldquo;he was a citizen of Saorstát Eireann on the 1st January, 1928&rdquo;; and in the second place, that &ldquo;his principal means of livelihood during the whole period of ten years immediately preceding the passing of this Act was the practice of dentistry in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;; and thirdly, that &ldquo;he was not guilty at any time of any crime or conduct which, if he had at that time been a registered dentist, would have caused his removal from the register.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>After considerable discussion in the Dáil and in the Seanad the Act was passed through, indicating in the clearest possible words that a person's principal means of livelihood during the whole period of ten years must have been the practice of dentistry.  No comment by a Minister or by a Deputy, and no implication in any discussion that took <Col N="1116" /> place, could obscure the perfectly clear words that are in the Act.  A person might be an apprentice and might not be deriving his means of livelihood from that apprenticeship, or he might be an apprentice deriving his means of livelihood from that apprenticeship.  Everything hinges around the fact that the Act requires that his &ldquo;principal means of livelihood&rdquo; should have been the practice of dentistry.  The Deputy is fully aware that this matter has now passed entirely into the hands of the Dental Board.  If he wants to do anything in this matter, there is nothing for him except to introduce an amending Bill changing the law in a way that he can substantiate and support by the bringing forward of definite evidence that there is an injustice contained in it, by requiring a person to have had dentistry as his principal means of livelihood for ten years.  The Deputy, I submit, cannot bring forward the case of any man in which dentistry was his principal means of livelihood for ten years who has been turned down by the Dental Board. Therefore, I submit, that raising the matter in this particular way is not a practical way of dealing with any injustices that there may be in the situation.  It is simply a kind of beating the drum about it.  There is only one way in which the Act can be amended, and that is by the introduction of legislation to do so.</P>

      <P>Then it is only for us to introduce an amending Bill, for the Minister knew from the discussions in the Seanad and in the <Col N="1117" /> Dáil that we were interested in having the apprenticeship period included.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Deputy will put a question in the way that it will be properly understandable.  The Deputy said it was well known to me that the two Houses were in favour of counting apprenticeship in the period over which the principal means of livelihood was to operate. I have no such memory.  In the Seanad I made a compromise that I would lessen the period on condition that the period of apprenticeship was not to count.  The Deputy can go back on the Seanad debates and he will get that verified.  There was a certain amount of talk here as to the period of apprenticeship, and on the question as to whether the period of apprenticeship should count.  I gave instances of people whose period of apprenticeship was given as starting at the age of thirteen.  The House laughed at the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weight of argument in the House was against counting the period of apprenticeship in the period covered by the phrase &ldquo;principal means of livelihood.&rdquo;  I think I said I had introduced the phrase, &ldquo;the principal means of livelihood,&rdquo; as the phrase suggested to me by the draftsman as one that would not cover the apprenticeship period, for that period would not, according to ordinary understanding, mean that a person was gaining his livelihood during the apprenticeship period.  That is not a phrase that would cover ordinarily the apprenticeship period.  My recollection definitely is that the House understood full well when passing that phrase that it was a phrase that would afterwards have to be interpreted in one case by the Minister for Local Government and later by the Board.  I think it is not fair to take that question out of the <Col N="1118" /> columns of the Official Debates and omit the context, and not bear in mind the debate which took place the day before.  I think the whole context clearly shows that the Dental Board was going to have a discretion in the matter.  It was explained that the interpretation of the phrase would lie with the Dental Board.</P>

      <P>The Minister is getting near the point I was coming to. He says a certain amount of latitude was allowed in one particular case. I have in mind the case of a young man who was much older than thirteen when he started his apprenticeship, and who received 10/- a week during his apprenticeship.  He is debarred by the interpretation now given by the Minister.  If I can produce evidence of that to the Minister will he deal with such a case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Superannuation and Pensions Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is twofold.  As Deputies are aware, provision was made in the Superannuation and Pensions Act for the granting of pensions to former members of the R.I.C. who had been dismissed or who had resigned in consequence of their <Col N="1120" /> national sympathies, so that they should receive pensions approximately equal to those they would have received if they had continued in the R.I.C. up to the date of disbandment. In the actual administration of it men who had served only two or three years were not awarded pensions, the view being taken that the sacrifice they had made was not greater than was made by ordinary civilians in large numbers.  Very few of the men who resigned stated they resigned because of their national sympathies.  In the great majority of cases they said they resigned for family reasons, or to take up other work, or something of that nature.  That was quite natural, because the men who resigned were subject to a great deal of danger. If we were satisfied, after examination, that by their previous or subsequent conduct they resigned really because of their national sympathies we did not pay much attention to the reasons they gave for resigning.  A Committee was set up to deal with these cases before the Act was passed.  That Committee, amongst other cases, had passed some twenty-one men who had actually succeeded in retiring on the ground of ill-health and getting gratuities from the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Act was being passed it was believed these men would be entitled to pensions the same as others, but when the Act was being administered advice was received from the Attorney-General, on the question being raised, that the men who retired on medical grounds were men who had neither resigned nor been dismissed, and consequently were not entitled to pensions.  This Bill is to enable pensions to be paid to these men.  What happened in the case of those men is that they went off on leave and succeeded in inducing friendly doctors to give certificates on grounds which were not justified. They received grants of from £30 to £200 or £300 from the British Government. They were a little more cautious, shall we say, and were paying a little more attention to their own interests than the men who said <Col N="1121" /> they had resigned for family reasons or in order to take up other posts. Nevertheless, it is clear that in these cases, or certainly as regards some of them, they will be more closely looked into if this Bill is passed. Certainly in some of these cases they resigned for national motives, and they were advised that as they could get a gratuity they might as well take it.  It is proposed to pay these men pensions from the date of the passage of this Bill.  They began by getting money where others were satisfied to go without it, and if they are to be at some little disadvantage now, that is not altogether unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other part of the Bill, which provides that the widow of a resigned or dismissed R.I.C. man may be paid a pension after his death, the fact that that is now necessary is due to an oversight. The men who actually remained in the R.I.C. and got R.I.C. pensions have this advantage too, that if they die their widows have the pensions, and it is felt in the case of the resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men there should also be provision for a widow's pension.  The pension paid to a widow under the British scheme is £30.  It is proposed that it shall be paid to the widow if the resigned or dismissed R.I.C. man had been actually married before his resignation or dismissal. I think there are very few pensioners who have actually died leaving widows, and the amount of the cost to the Exchequer under that head will be comparatively small.  The total charge that would result from the passing of the Bill will be about £2,000 per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any Deputy in the House can congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  This Bill has been promised for a very long time. From time to time we have seen answers given in this House as to the introduction of legislation along the lines that are now embodied in this Bill.  As far back as 30th May, 1927, in answer to Deputy O'Connor, the Minister stated that he proposed <Col N="1122" /> to introduce legislation to amend Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  On 19th October, 1927, in answer to Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, he stated that instructions had been given for the drafting of a Bill for this purpose and that it would be introduced as soon as possible.  I do not think that the House could assume or believe that the draftsman had been from 19th October, 1927, down to the present time drafting two pages of the very simple Bill which is now before us. However, it is in keeping with the rather niggardly way in which this whole matter has been dealt with. Very definite and very clear promises were made to those men at the time they resigned, and subsequently promises were made by the late General Collins that they would be treated no less generously than the men who remained in the force. When a Committee was set up to deal with these cases, even though the Committee recommended a certain number of them, the Government stepped in and disregarded the recommendations of the Committee and refused to deal with particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember one case where there was very clear and definite proof.  That is the case I mentioned here on the Appropriation Bill on the 22nd of November last. I refer to the case of Mr. McElligott, who was what might be called the pivot or leader of these men during the time they assisted and performed the work for which they were to be recompensed afterwards. On 16th November, 1927, a question was asked by Deputy de Valera as to what action the Minister proposed to take with regard to that application. The Minister stated that in view of the changed circumstances he was prepared to reconsider the case.  Mr. McElligott, acting on the statement contained in that answer, wrote on 20th November, 1927, to the Minister referring to the answer, and stating the whole facts for the Minister so that he might investigate and deal with the case.  There was no reply from the Minister, and <Col N="1123" /> when I raised the question here in November last the President suggested that the reason why Mr. McElligott resigned was because of his activities in the Police Union and not because of political or national motives.</P>
    <P>However, since then and a few days before this Bill was introduced, Mr. McElligott has been given his pension.  At least, he has had a communication from the Department of Finance informing him that his pension has now been granted.  If the Government had intended to deal with this question in the decent, honest and honourable way in which it should be dealt with, they could have dealt with it at the very beginning instead of dealing with it as they have done.  There was abundant evidence, and that evidence was clearly put before the Minister and the Government, that Mr. McElligott was entitled to a pension.  As I stated in November last, that evidence was the evidence of people who were, perhaps, and should be considered by the Minister as being in a position to give very independent proof and very independent evidence, and who were in no way biased or prejudiced as to the conditions under which Mr. McElligott acted, or as to the reasons for his resignation and for his activities afterwards.  The Government had all these particulars before them at the time the President suggested that it was because of his activities in connection with the Police Union that he had resigned.  It is rather strange that just before this Bill is introduced the Government discover that it was not his activities in connection with the Police Union, but his national activities that brought about his resignation.</P>
    <P>This may seem a strong case, but it is not an isolated case.  There was a case mentioned here before. That was the case of Mr. Kearney, and it was a very clear case.  The only reason that could be given against Mr. Kearney as to why he should not get a pension was that he was associated with Republican activities during the civil strife. <Col N="1124" /> Rather a peculiar incident in connection with this case was that four men, apparently four C.I.D. men&mdash; at any rate, civilians&mdash;went to his house, made certain suggestions and proposed certain arrangements with him.  That matter has been raised in the Dáil already and I do not want to go into it now.  What I do want to emphasise is that the Government have not acted in that matter in the decent and honest way in which they should have acted, and they have not acted in the spirit in which the promises were given to the men by the late General Collins and others who were at the head of affairs at that time.  It has been forcibly borne in on us by deputations that a good many of these men have been in sore straits during the last few years.</P>
    <P>It must be a very difficult thing for the Minister to explain how it should take almost two years to draft a Bill, if what he stated was correct, that the Bill had been handed over to the draftsman and instructions given to the draftsman nearly two years ago.  It is not a very complicated Bill&mdash;only two pages.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, there are a few matters to which I will refer, but those matters will arise in Committee when some amendment may be necessary.  Provision is made for pensions to certain widows, but I have been informed of cases of widows who will not come in under that particular section.  That is where the deceased husband's claim has been approved by the Committee, but where he died before the pension was granted.  There are some cases of that kind.  It would be easy for the Minister to put in an amendment on the Committee Stage that would embody those cases.  The Committee that has operated already was set up under conditions that I do not think would allow the whole circumstances and all the evidence to be gone into in the atmosphere in which it might be gone into now.</P>

      <P>I suggest if this Bill is intended to be a genuine effort, if there is a genuine intention to deal adequately and honourably with those men who are entitled so to be dealt with, an independent Committee of this House should be set up to investigate all those claims. The Committee that was already at work was a Committee set up in an atmosphere of civil war, when political tension and other feelings ran very high.  If the Minister wants to deal with this matter in a way that would be above criticism, in a way that would give satisfaction to all parties and all interests involved, I suggest that the only way to secure that is to set up now, in what we may consider changed circumstances, a Committee representative of the whole House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that the Minister might consider when dealing with this question of the resigned and dismissed R.I.C.  I refer to the cases of the Connaught Rangers. There are not many such cases, and the few cases that do exist in which there is definite proof and definite evidence that they are entitled to consideration, are really in a pretty bad way.  There have been promises made from time to time that the people involved in the mutiny would be dealt with fairly and decently. So far as I am aware, the only evidence we have in that regard is that some time in April, 1925, a Mrs. Daly walked ten or fifteen miles to receive from Deputy Shaw a sum of £10, which was described in the papers at the time as a present from President Cosgrave.  She is a very old woman, and I believe she is in very poor circumstances. Possibly there may be some change with regard to the attitude of the Government as compared with what was said previously on this matter.  We are aware that Deputy Cooper, when asked a question about the Connaught Rangers in January, 1926, said that as a loyal subject of the King he believed no punishment was too severe for them. Since then Deputy Cooper has joined the Government ranks, and I do not know whether he has changed the <Col N="1126" /> Government feeling or the Government have changed him.  I do urge, in view of the promises made to these men and their dependents, and bearing in mind the few cases that exist and the hardship that was inflicted upon these men and their dependents, adequate consideration should be given to the matter by the Minister as to whether he would embody in the Bill some provision that would be satisfactory and so deal with the question once and for all.</P>
    <P>I want to state our attitude with regard to this matter of pensions. We stand for granting those pensions on the ground that definite promises were made to those men, and it is the duty of the House and the Government to fulfil those promises. But we do not take up the position that, if pensions are going to be reviewed in this country at any time, these or any other pensions should be outside review.  We want to make that position clear, and that is my feeling with regard to the matter, at any rate.  This Bill can be made a very effective Bill if the Government want to carry it out in the proper spirit.  I suggest the way to do that is to set up a Committee of the House that will investigate all these claims impartially and that will report to the Minister.  Then no criticism can be brought forward as to all the cases not having been fairly and clearly dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to support and, if necessary, to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am glad to hear from Deputy Ruttledge that the Minister has at last absolved Mr. McElligott from whatever political crimes or offences he was considered to be guilty of in the past. I believe if the payment of pensions to men who were dismissed from the R.I.C. or who resigned for reasons of national sympathy can be justified&mdash; and I think this case has been justified all right&mdash;then these pensions should, in the first instance, be paid to the people who seduced such a large number of men from their old allegiance to the Royal Irish Constabulary. I have reason to know <Col N="1127" /> something about this, because in 1918 I happened to be the Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee of the Trade Union Congress when Mr. McElligott, with other men, sought an interview in secret session so that they might explain to the representatives of the organised Labour movement at the time the reasons they were associated with this agitation, and so that they might also endeavour to secure whatever support the Labour movement could give their former colleagues to lay down their arms and not assist the British Government in the fight which they were then carrying on against those who stood for the freedom of the country.  Mr. McElligott was the leader of that body, and he was a very able leader, indeed.  Associated with him were two other men, named Maguire and Tarpey.  I understand that Mr. Maguire got a pension subsequent to the passing of the original Act.  We are now informed that Mr. McElligott has been recently granted a pension, and I hope the Minister, having absolved Mr. McElligott from whatever crimes he was supposed to be guilty of, will also deal favourably with Mr. Tarpey.  I hope that the Minister, in the generous frame of mind he now appears to be in, will call for the papers in Mr. Tarpey's case and see whether the man was or was not guilty of any particular crime other than the one that Mr. McElligott was supposed to be guilty of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, it is only fair to expect the Minister will agree that whatever payments are to be made will be payable from the date of the passing of the original Act. I hope that the later portion of Section 2 will be amended so as to make that possible.  The Minister said that the passing of this Bill will mean an additional sum of £2,000 per annum. One cannot gather from that how many men are likely to be concerned. I would like the Minister to inform the House of the number of individuals likely to receive pensions as a result of the passing of the Bill and particularly under Section 2, and <Col N="1128" /> also the number of those affected by Section 3.  I suggest to the Minister for his serious and sympathetic consideration that as regards the payment of pensions to widows whose husbands have been killed since the date of the granting of the pensions &mdash;if there is any such case&mdash;those pensions should be payable as from the date of the death of the individual concerned.  As I read clause 3 of this Bill it is quite possible that the payment to be made under it may only be made as from the date of the passing of this Bill. There are two or three very sad cases.  One in Carlow and another in Roscrea have come under my notice and I think it would be a generous gesture on the part of the Minister, if necessary to make clear where it is not clear, that such payments under Section 3 of the Bill will be made as from the date of the death of the individual concerned.  It will not involve any great additional amount and the concession will certainly be very favourably accepted by those who may be concerned. Personally I found it very difficult in some cases that have come under my notice to understand why the Department or the Minister who is really responsible has seen fit to turn down certain claims which were put up under the original Act.</P>
    <P>I will cite one case I am aware of. The name of the individual I am dealing with is Bergin.  He had short service and was dismissed subsequent to the conscription period of 1918.  The case came before the Minister subsequent to the passing of the original Act, and for reasons of which I am not now aware the claim was turned down.  Subsequently representations were made on behalf of this particular individual, and assurances were given that if evidence were produced to prove conclusively or clearly that the individual concerned was dismissed for a particular reason the case would be reconsidered. This individual, Bergin, was serving in a place called Ballinamuck, in the County Longford.  He was asked by the sergeant in charge at the time to identify and arrest certain <Col N="1129" /> people who were actively associated with the Irish Republican Army in that area.  He definitely refused to carry out that duty and was dismissed.  There is evidence in the records in the Minister's Department that that is the reason why he was dismissed.  The local leader of the Irish Republican Army and the clergymen who were in that area certified that that was the real reason why Bergin was dismissed.  Subsequent to his dismissal from the R.I.C. he received a position as a traffic porter, and he was paid one pound five per week less than he was receiving at the date of his dismissal from the Royal Irish Constabulary. He continued to serve in the railway service, and at the same time he became a member of the Irish Republican Army.  Subsequent to the signing of the Treaty he joined the National Army.  He served on the Curragh in the Military Police.  He was promoted sergeant, and later he was demobilised with a very good character.  I quote this to show why he was dismissed.  These were incidents to prove quite clearly to me, at any rate, that he was dismissed for political activities, and his subsequent activities show that they were consistent with the action he took previously.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look up the records and say why, in the case of an individual of that kind who has had only a short service and whose pension, therefore, would only be a small one, his claim was turned down.  It is a clear case, in my opinion.  The activities of the individual concerned quite clearly prove that he was dismissed for national reasons, and his record was a national one subsequent to his dismissal. The individual concerned will not starve if he does not get a pension.  All I ask is that in a case of that kind some reason should be given other than the blunt refusal which was conveyed to the individual in a letter from the Minister's Department on the 31st October last.</P>
    <P>I am not quite certain as to how many individuals are at present in receipt of a pension under the Act <Col N="1130" /> but I support the suggestion made by Deputy Ruttledge that an advisory committee&mdash;I do not say it should be a committee which should have power over the Minister in matters of this kind because I recognise at any rate that that is impossible&mdash;should be set up to investigate the claims of certain individuals or to get, in private from the Minister, the reasons why individuals of the kind I referred to have been refused pensions.  I know that the Minister can produce evidence from certain files in his Department to prove that individuals who claimed pensions are not entitled to them or that the reasons they gave are not justified.  I have seen one case where an individual got a pension under false pretences and I agree with the Minister that he can produce good evidence to show why that pension should be cancelled.  At any rate the Minister should take members of the House into his confidence, produce files and show evidence where certain individuals have genuine grievances.</P>
    <P>The individuals concerned were given very definite promises.  These were given by the late General Collins and repeated in this House subsequent to the passing of the Constitution by the late Minister for Justice in very clear language which cannot be misunderstood.  We have heard a lot recently, a great deal of agitation has been going on and there has been a good deal of noise in the Press, in support of the fair treatment that was meted out to those civil servants who refused to serve an Irish Government subsequent to the passing of the Treaty. If the conditions we have recently heard of can be given to a certain type of civil servant who refused to serve an Irish Government certainly the promises made by General Collins and subsequently repeated in this House to the men who have grievances should be kept.  These men made it possible for the Ministry to occupy the positions they occupy to-day.  A considerable section of those men were married men who came out and made sacrifices.  Where it can be proved that they made sacrifices those men should be fairly <Col N="1131" /> and honourably dealt with.  If the Government can pay pensions and expenses to people who say that they are Irishmen but who are either ashamed, afraid or unwilling to serve an Irish Government, if they have meted out a generous measure of treatment to them recently, certainly there is a better case for more generous treatment to those men covered under this Bill and certainly there is a better case for every consideration of some of the cases recently turned down under the original Act of the Minister.</P>

      <P>What made me rise in connection with this debate was that Deputy Davin mentioned a particular case and I thought it was one that I had had some connection with, but I found it was not.  It was almost a similar case in certain of the details.  To my mind it was most unsympathetic the way the Minister dealt with the claims of some of these men.  There was one particular case that came under my notice where a man had been asked to resign subsequent to the conscription business in 1918.  After his resignation he worked, and worked well, for the Volunteer movement in carrying arms from different countries to Ireland.  When that man's claim went forward it was turned down by the Committee. It would not be politic for me to give the man's name to the members here, because he happens to reside in the Six County area.  One would think that his case had received unsympathetic consideration on the ground that his resignation had taken place in 1918.  But that cannot be so, because this very day I have sent in another case to the Minister of a man who resigned six months before the Truce.  Both these men have got documents from local clergymen and leaders of the Volunteers to prove that they had been asked to resign, and had resigned on patriotic grounds, and not, as might be suggested, from fear or anything else.  They actually had documentary evidence to prove that they had made themselves <Col N="1132" /> useful to the Volunteers, and still those claims were turned down. There might be a certain amount of excuse for the latter case because the man's claim arrived too late for the Committee.  At the same time, it is very hard, especially in the Six County area, where sometimes it is not easy for these men to get a living, to see other men who served England consistently until the Treaty with good pensions, whilst these, the poor fools, sometimes have hardly enough to eat.</P>
      <P>There is also the case referred to by Deputy Ruttledge.  That is the case of the Connaught Rangers. There is hardly any need to reiterate what has been already spoken of in this House with regard to their case. I do not believe that there can be any more than four or five of those who might be considered entitled to pensions.  I do not know the exact number, but some of those men served for 15 or 17 years in the Army, and it is not easy for a man who has served in the ranks of the British Army for 15 or 17 years to come out and make a living in another occupation, especially since there seems to be a prejudice against them in the country.  I say that calmly and without any heat, because, to my own knowing and the knowing of my colleagues, there seems to have existed a prejudice against those men which was absolutely unfair, because those men had been made a definite promise.  They had been given a promise the same as resigned R.I.C. men, and that promise should have been kept, but was not kept.  Their case, to my mind, should receive a very sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill, I wish merely to support the plea made by my colleague, Deputy Ruttledge, for the mutineers of the Connaught Rangers.  There are not a dozen men in question.  They may not come directly under this Bill, but I would suggest to the Minister for Finance the advisability of putting in a clause, if necessary, in order to include them.  I suppose not even Deputy Cooper would question their <Col N="1133" /> courage in taking the action they did in India, whatever he might think of their wisdom or their loyalty.  They, by that action, sacrificed the pensions that they would now have been enjoying from the British Government. I know two of them personally, and they say they would be satisfied to get, even now, a pension on the same lines as they would have enjoyed from the British Government, to let the years during which they have found it very hard to get a living of any sort go and not to have the pension retrospective.  I think that is a very fair demand, and that nobody in this House, with the possible exception of Deputy Cooper, would object to such a pension being granted.</P>
      <P>I do not want to weary the House with details of ex-R.I.C. or ex-D.M.P. men who resigned from patriotic motives.  Definite cases have been mentioned by Deputy Carney, Deputy Davin and Deputy Ruttledge. I merely refer to the case of Mr. Moran, of Gort, an ex-D.M.P. man. I will leave the Minister to judge from the evidence he has got on the files as to whether or not he should come under this Bill.  True, he was accused of being connected with certain Republican associations, but at the time he resigned there was no condition as to the future political belief of such men, except that they should come out to aid the country in its time of need, to attain its freedom. Mr. Moran, I understand, has now made arrangements to go to America, as he cannot get a living here.  If a committee were set up to investigate in these calmer days the claims of such men I am quite certain Mr. Moran's name would be included in the list of those to be granted an allowance or pension under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join in the plea for the Connaught Rangers.  There is one of those men in the town of Fermoy.  About three or four years ago he came to me and said he was badly off.  I pleaded for him at that time, and he was taken into the National Army.  He remained there until about twelve months ago, when <Col N="1134" /> he was demobilised.  He is quite a young man, and being a shoemaker he is well able to do work for the Army.  Anyhow, he was reduced to such low circumstances that I had to plead for him in the Board of Health, and he is now receiving 10/- a week outdoor relief for his wife and three or four children.  For that reason I would support the plea for the Connaught Rangers.  In their own time and place they did their bit.  I might call them wounded soldiers in the fight, and we should not forget them.  When I mentioned this man's case to the Board of Health they told me to name the amount I wanted.  The ten members who were there, farmers and rate-payers, recognising the sacrifice that he had made for the country, immediately fell into the chorus that he should not be forgotten.  For that reason I ask our own Government that they, too, should recognise the sacrifice that those men made far away in India, remembering they were Irishmen.</P>

      <P>I was going to ask whether the Minister would not consider the circumstances of these men and say whether it would not be possible, by amending the Bill in Committee, to reopen their cases.  I am sure he is fairly familiar with the circumstances, which I would like, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to state briefly to the House.  A number of the men in question, at any rate, had considerable periods of service as temporary Civil Assistants in the Ordnance Survey.  I think in the year 1915 they were given the option of joining up or of being dismissed.  If they joined up some of them were told that they would never have to go to the front and that after demobilisation <Col N="1135" /> they would be reemployed as established officers. They refused, however, to join up, and, of course, were dismissed.  I understand that their case was brought before the Government and, in the year 1925, they were reinstated, but with this disability: In a circular issued in 1927 those of them who had served fifteen years as unestablished officers and who received a certificate from the Director of their particular branch were told they would become established officers, with the proviso that half of their period as unestablished officers would count towards superannuation. That is to say, that their fifteen years as unestablished officers would be counted as seven-and-half years as established officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are of opinion that is so, I am going to accept that.  I did not want to rule myself out of court before I got so far.  If the Minister will see what he can do in the matter, I will be satisfied.  I was asked to draw his attention to it at this stage of the Bill, and I have done that.  In connection with the Connaught Rangers, I do not know whether the Minister will need any further exhortation from all sides of the House to give the cases of these men favourable consideration.  I do not know whether he is aware of some of the instances of individual hardship which have ensued in consequence of the mutiny.  I have here a considerable file of letters, and there are one or two cases I should like to bring before him.  There is the case of P. Smith, late of 7 Windmill Lane, Drogheda, who was shot dead during the mutiny in India.  He had nine years' service in the British Army, and he leaves a father who is seventy years of age, and a sister.  I believe <Col N="1136" /> that the old man, who was deprived of his son in these circumstances, is now living in a state of destitution. I think that the consideration of this case, at any rate, should compel the Minister to see if he cannot do something to relieve the distress in that particular case and other cases like it.  There is the case of J. Hewson, of 7 Malpas Place, Dublin, who was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude and was in prison for two and a half years.  This man had ten and a half years' service in the British Army, and is now unemployed.  He has a wife and two children, and from the date of his discharge from prison he has only received seven weeks' employment on public works. There is another case of a similar kind&mdash;they are nearly all similar, as a matter of fact, and I have a long list here&mdash;the case of T. Fallon, 42 Francis Street, Drogheda, who was sentenced to two years' hard labour and was imprisoned for eighteen months.  He had twelve years' service in the British Army, is now unemployed and has to support a widowed mother who is in very bad health.</P>
      <P>I could go through the list, but I do not think it is necessary. Most of us have, at one time or another, come across some of these men.  I know that at the time this incident occurred, when the first rumours of it got abroad in Ireland, we felt that the men who had taken that action under the circumstances were men in whom all honest Irishmen might take a peculiar pride, because they knew they were men who, for one reason or another, in some cases possibly through economic circumstances, had been driven into a certain path, who had served honourably under a flag, possibly from merely mercenary reasons, and who had, under conditions of extreme danger to themselves, done everything they could to show that they were true and patriotic Irishmen, for whom every Deputy who has a spark of Irish nationality or sentiment in his heart will endeavour to raise his voice in order to secure justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is not very familiar with the people who <Col N="1137" /> would be affected by this Bill, I should like to sound a note of warning in connection with the suggestion to set up a committee to deal with applications.  So far as I can see, the time is fast approaching when there will be practically nobody in this country but pensioners. I think it would be very unwise to set up such a committee, because it would mean that the Minister would be inundated with applications not only from men who might have genuine claims, but also from men who would not have genuine claims. The Minister mentioned the cases of fourteen or fifteen men who resigned from the R.I.C. on the ground of ill-health.  They were apparently able to secure a medical certificate testifying that their health was of such a nature that they were not in a position to carry on their duties. It strikes me that some of these men resigned rather through fear than from patriotic motives.  I quite recognise that there are thousands of young men in the country who sacrificed their health, and who at present have no chance of receiving any remuneration for their services.  If we have to recoup everybody who is supposed to have rendered service during that very troubled period, we will become a bankrupt country in the course of a few years&mdash;we will have no such thing as people producing anything, and it will not be good for the industries of the country.  I am sorry to have to refer to the fact that as a result of the work accomplished by these men, in pursuance of the policy to secure freedom for this country, we have to-day a divided country, and we are not in as good a position to-day to pay these pensions as we would be if freedom had been secured for the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more or less under a disability in entering on this discussion, but I do not believe in any man who is imbued with the idea that he should be compensated for fighting for or defending his country, as I am personally acquainted with many who were prepared to go out and suffer for their country in order that freedom might be secured without any <Col N="1138" /> hope of compensation being given to them, by way of pension or otherwise. I think that the time has arrived when it is absolutely essential in the interests of the people living in the country, that an end should be put to the granting of pensions, except in cases where absolute proof is adduced that would entitle people to pensions.  To set up such a committee as has been suggested would be very unwise.  The time of the House would be occupied in discussing applications from people who were supposed to have served the country during these years.  In introducing this Bill, the Minister has gone very far to meet any legitimate claims that may be put forward on behalf of those men who resigned from the R.I.C.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that but for Deputy Coburn's speech we have had a debate very like that which takes place in connection with bog roads. I do not propose to deal with individual cases mentioned, except perhaps one case referred to by Deputy Ruttledge.  The case of Mr. McElligott was a difficult case because of his own letter of resignation from the R.I.C.  That letter was dead against him.  Nobody reading that letter&mdash;I do not know whether the Deputy has read it or not, but it was published in the &ldquo;Police and Prison Officers' Journal&rdquo;&mdash;if he had only the letter before him could come to any other conclusion than that Mr. McElligott should not get a pension. He submitted practically no evidence to the Department of Finance and, so far as I am concerned, I only obtained evidence that would counteract the effect which that letter had on my mind after I had been visited by Senator Johnson. He was not able to give me very much direct evidence himself, but he gave me information about people who could give direct evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McElligott apparently did not attach any importance to that letter of his own, and did not take the trouble to make his case, as other applicants made their cases.  The result was that we had, practically, a bald application from Mr. McElligott, <Col N="1139" /> on one side, and that letter of resignation on the other, which certainly was dead against him.  I know that letter of resignation could be explained away, just as excuses given by people that they resigned for ill-health or for family reasons could be explained away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think so. Certainly, if such documents existed they never came to the section of the Department of Finance that dealt with the resigned and dismissed R.I.C. pensioners.  As I say, the first time we got information that would really serve to counteract the effect of his own letter of resignation was when Senator Johnson wrote to me, and afterwards came to the Department of Finance, at my request, to speak to me about it, and when he told us the names of people who, he believed from evidence he obtained in connection with the Trade Union Congress, would be able to give clear evidence of national sympathy as apart from, shall we call it, Trade Union zeal on the part of Mr. McElligott.  We wrote to these people asking them to come to the Department of Finance and give their evidence, and, as soon as we obtained that evidence, which was perfectly clear, a certificate was made out in his favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister state then that the reason he <Col N="1140" /> was refused a pension was because up to that they had information that he was associated with Republican activities in the civil war, but in view of the changed circumstances he would consider the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It had not been really considered before that. None of these cases really had been gone into.  The people engaged on the Irregular side during the civil war had not their cases considered at all.  Personally, I did not look at these cases.  In reply to a question put, I think, by Deputy de Valera, I said I would consider them.  It was after that that Mr. McElligott's file was considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin and Deputy Ruttledge both suggested certain amendments in regard to the provision for pensions for widows.  It seems to me, at first glance, that these suggestions are reasonable, and I am prepared to consider them.  One of the suggestions is that pensions should be payable from the death of the husband, and the other that the pension should be payable to a widow whose husband would have got the pension but for his death before the issue of the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anything could be more useless than to set up the Committee suggested.  I do not think a more unsuitable Committee could possibly be devised to deal with the matter than a Committee of members of this House.  As a matter of fact, of the cases which the original Committee passed, a considerable number have been refused pensions because subsequent information was obtained.  For instance, people represented that they were dismissed because of some act that indicated national sympathies; but afterwards we got clear evidence that they were dismissed, either for drunkenness, or we got clear information&mdash;that is, in regard to many of those people the Committee passed&mdash;that they had not resigned because of national sympathies.  Several hundreds of cases passed by the Committee&mdash;I cannot give the exact number&mdash;were turned down by me, and, in a few <Col N="1141" /> cases, by the late Minister for Justice where he actually examined the facts.  In nearly all cases, I examined the files myself, and although large numbers were turned down by me I am satisfied that amongst the 528 who have pensions an appreciable number should not have got them.  I was not in a position, on the evidence that came up, to refuse them; still, I am satisfied that amongst these there are a considerable number who were not influenced by national motives at all but were simply taking the safe course.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not think that of the people definitely refused there were, really, any who should have been granted pensions.  People were refused, but if there seemed to be injustice done the case was gone into again and again.  All sorts of people made representations; applicants themselves have made representations, and further inquiries have been carried out.  Perhaps there are about half a dozen cases, or a little more, undecided.  Three or four more cases may have come in recently.  There may be twenty cases altogether that are awaiting decision. Leaving these out, I think everybody who is really entitled to a pension has got it.  They have not been unsympathetically considered, but we have to bear in mind that people who left the police at the time, for any sort of reason, when they saw the pensions were going came along and claimed pensions.  I do not think that they have been unsympathetically dealt with.  It is difficult to decide on people's motives.  There may be a few who resigned for national sympathy, but who neither showed any friendship with the Volunteers nor did anything nationally afterwards.  There may be people whose cases, because we looked at their conduct and could not look at their minds, we have turned down, but I think very few resigned because of national sympathies without giving some assistance, or showing some sign of friendship either before, or after, that <Col N="1142" /> would enable us to judge of their intentions.</P>
    <P>Just one other remark about the Committee.  I told Deputies some months ago that I would not refuse to consider a claim coming in even then.  I would not absolutely refuse to consider a claim coming in even now, but I would be very suspicious of such a claim, because it is much more difficult to get clear evidence now.  People's memories are more vague, and I think they could be very easily persuaded to say that they knew so and so did such a thing in 1918 or 1919.  The farther away we get from the period of resignation the more doubtful the evidence becomes.  Consequently, unless the case was very strong, I would be much more inclined to turn it down now&mdash;that is, a new case coming in in regard to which we had not evidence previously&mdash;than I would have been three or four years ago.  I would, on the whole, be really suspicious of cases coming in now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister has more or less turned down the demand of Deputy Ruttledge for a committee, would he be prepared to give in confidence the reasons why certain cases were turned down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would possibly do it in certain cases.  I think the Deputy has, in fact, been given the evidence in confidence in one or two cases. While I would not give a general undertaking, I might, in certain cases which I think suitable, give the information to the Deputy.  Supposing there were some information that was against an individual given in the course of an inquiry, I do not think that we should disclose it. Personally, I have had these cases considered by civil servants who, I think, take a very impartial attitude, and I have not often disagreed with the recommendations put up to me by them.  I have, perhaps, in three or four cases refused recommendations which were, on the whole, favourable.  I have never granted any claims unless the recommendations came from the civil <Col N="1143" /> servants who were dealing with the matter.  With regard to the Connaught Rangers, I rather forget what was the general effect of the report made on those cases by the Committee set up to consider them some years ago.  I remember it was unfavourable, and I think the view was that, in the case of their mutiny, patriotism was an afterthought and that they had no claim.  I am prepared to look into the matter again. The Committee was set up, inquired into the cases, and reported that they had no claim.  The reason given, I think, was that the mutiny was due to their treatment in India, and that their claim that it was due to patriotism was really an afterthought. I will look that up and communicate it to the Dáil at a later stage.  I would not be prepared to consent to anything in the case of the Connaught Rangers without a good deal of further investigation. If, on looking at that report, I saw any reasons to doubt that it was correct I would think it was a case for another committee, but I do not think that their case is in any way like that of the resigned and dismissed R.I.C.  As Deputy Coburn pointed out, the fact that the Connaught Rangers are in distress has nothing to do with the matter.  We gave to the ex-R.I.C. certain pledges irrespective of whether they were in distress or not.  The question of distress amongst the Connaught Rangers does not come in.  If they have a claim it should be met irrespective of personal circumstances. If they have no claim their distress is not any worse than that of many individuals who made sacrifices in this country when they were necessary. The mere fact that these men were in the British service does not mean that there is any direct obligation on us towards them.  It does not mean that they should get better treatment than those who were never in the British service, and who made sacrifices, and who are now in poverty and distress as a result of them.</P>

      <P>If my recollection serves me, when I moved the adjournment of the debate on this Bill I was endeavouring to point out to the House that this measure might be very undesirable in its consequences.  I have refreshed my memory by a glance at the official report of the debate, and I remember that the Ceann Comhairle was good enough to say that when the debate was resumed he would explain to the House what the Bill was really about.  Now I think that that is a task which should not properly have been left to the Ceann Comhairle.  After all, so far as these Constitution Amendment Bills are concerned, though he has very seldom discharged it, that is a duty which properly belongs to the President who has made himself their sponsor before the Dáil.  I remember that Deputy Flinn, in addressing the House on this matter, pointed out that this Bill was, as he described it, a pig which has been drawn from the poke in all its young and naked beauty.  I do not think that that was exactly the attitude which the President took on the matter, but I think he came to the House and, with all the bashfulness of the erring housemaid, asked us to deal mercifully with the measure because it is only a little Bill.  It is a little Bill, but I think it contains a very important principle. We are asked to confer in regard to a measure, on which the Ceann Comhairle has already adjudicated and has decided that it can be properly certified as a Money Bill, the power upon a comparatively insignificant number of Senators, first of all, to refer that Bill to a Committee, and thereby, if that body of Senators can sufficiently influence that Committee, to ensure that such measure will be held up for a prolonged period.  That can be done under this Bill by the Committee coming to a decision that this Bill <Col N="1145" /> was not, in fact, a Money Bill.  I submit that the fiat of the Ceann Comhairle of this House should be final in this matter.</P>
      <P>Article 35 does already make provision that a Bill about which a dispute has arisen, as to whether it is or is not, a Money Bill, should be referred to a Committee on Privileges. Even though that proviso is already in the Constitution, I think that that proviso is wrong, and, from the point of view of the privileges of this House, is undesirable. Therefore, I contend that we should not make it any easier for the Seanad, or any section of the Seanad, to secure or exercise powers which are already more or less conferred by Article 35.  I feel that if Article 35 were to be amended at all it should be amended in the direction of depriving the Seanad of the right to question a decision of the Ceann Comhairle of this House in relation to a Money Bill.  I think that is the only way whereby at some future period, what Deputy Cooper referred to as a constitutional erisis, between this House and the Seanad, can be avoided.  I believe that the sole purpose of the Constitutional amendments which the Government has introduced into this House is to give to the Seanad the capacity to enlarge its functions and its power under the Constitution and in relation to legislation, as those powers and functions are enlarged in the amended Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a time will come when the Seanad will seriously challenge the right of this House to absolute control in financial matters.  In any event, I do not see that even the most modest of us would concede that men, ordinary, common, everyday individuals, men not in any way greatly demarcated or distinguished from ourselves&mdash;that in any body composed of such men, elected by us, there should reside any superior wisdom.  I do not see either how even the vainest of us could imagine that our votes or our mandate could confer upon any body of individuals or any assembly a wisdom, a prudence and a judgment that are not <Col N="1146" /> conferred on the members of this House by the citizens of the State. Therefore, because neither the most modest nor the vainest among us would hold that there is inside that Seanad any greater sagacity, any greater prudence, any greater wisdom, any greater knowledge than is to be found in this House, I cannot see how we can concede to that body the right, which we hold as an inalienable right, of unfettered control over the purse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure that it is just possible that there may be some very wise and sagacious principle underlying this measure, but I submit it has never been explained to the House.  There is one thing on the face of it that damns it, and that is the fact that a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann, present and voting at a meeting of the Seanad, at which not less than 30 members are present, may so resolve that a Bill which has gone through this House, with the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle that it <Col N="1147" /> is a Money Bill, shall be submitted to a Committee on Privileges.

As I said, Article 35 of the Constitution is not, to my mind, a perfect Article.  I believe it is an Article which never should have appeared.  It is a remnant, I suppose, of the Gladstone controversy with the House of Lords as to what was and what was not a Money Bill.  I am not going to argue the question as to what Gladstone said in 1882, but, at any rate, he did not say, as this Bill says, that sixteen members of the Seanad&mdash;&ldquo;sixteen men on a dead man's chest&rdquo;&mdash;shall have, in financial matters, or in quasi-financial matters, the same power as sixteen members of Dáil Eireann, and that is, when you contrast it, when you take proviso (a) of Section 1, which says:</P>
      <P>two-fifths of the members of either House by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House of which they are members so require, or</P>

      <P>I am going to abandon that, but I would like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to look at that particular section of the Bill. But I am wondering if there could be a majority when there is only a provision that half the House may be present.  I am just wondering how there could be a majority, and how the President is going to get his majority in these circumstances.  If there was a body with 40 members, and if it was provided that there should be a majority when only 20 of these members were present, I think it would be a nice legal point for the Supreme Court to adjudicate upon whether there was a majority when only 20 members were present, and when they asked that a certain thing should be done.  And yet I think that is the effect of proviso (b) of Section 1.  Now, I may be wrong, quite possibly I am, but I think the President ought to make that point clear to the House.  There is another matter.  Supposing we get this Committee, and supposing we get three members of Seanad Eireann, three members of Dáil Eireann, and a <Col N="1149" /> Chairman, who shall be the senior Judge of the Supreme Court, what happens during the period that that Committee is being got together? During the period that it is sitting in judgment upon, as I repeat, the Ceann Comhairle of this House, and upon this House, what happens to the Bill?  Is it to be held up for the period of time in which the Seanad can hold up ordinary legislation or does the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle still remain effective, and does the Bill pass into law in the ordinary way within the specified period?  I can foresee circumstances in which a deadlock might arise in that Committee.  If we had a very grave constitutional conflict between either of these Houses a Judge of the Supreme Court might not wish to give a decision in the matter.</P>

It is very possible, in fact in my present frame of mind I believe it is extremely probable, that I do not entirely understand this Bill, but I would like to repeat, even though it does make the President smile, that that after all, is not my fault.  It was he who should have explained this measure to the Dáil, and I am beginning to believe, in view of the silence which he has <Col N="1150" /> uniformly maintained on every one of these Constitutional Amendment Bills, that he himself is in no better plight than any other member of the House: that one of the reasons why he has not, in introducing any single one of these measures, given us a single word of explanation is that he himself is incapable of understanding them.  We remember how they all came out of that miraculous dark closet, and how they were thrust upon us, and we were told that these Bills were the results of the Committee which had been set up to consider constitutional amendments, and that we were to take them from his hands, as if they were the works of inspired authors.  He has not permitted the deletion of one comma, the amendment of one line of these Bills, and, at the same time, as I have said, he has not explained a single one of them.  I admit that I am befogged as to the real effects of this Bill, but I believe that if I am befogged the President is snowbound.</P>

      <P>This Bill is based on one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee which considered some amendments to the Constitution, and it happens that this particular amendment was not objected to by members of the Party to which Deputy MacEntee belongs and of which he is such a very brilliant ornament.  If there was any doubt in anyone's mind as to the possible future leader of that Party, I think the speech we have just listened to would convince us that the tenure of office of any of his superiors is likely to be very short.  Now, the position, as far as I can judge it, is that there is a great deal of criticism of the Seanad as such by Deputies opposite, but there is no Party in this State, no Party that I ever heard of in any other State, which would require the assistance of a second Chamber more than that body over there. Three or four of the recommendations which they supported, some of which they fathered&mdash;almost gave birth to&mdash;are ones which, on subsequent reflection, they found it necessary not to agree to.</P>

      <P>This particular one was not objected to by the Deputy, and his Party has been railing at us here and questioning it without understanding it, without knowing what it is.  Every single speech I have listened to from Deputies opposite indicates to me quite clearly that they did not understand what the meaning of this amendment to the Constitution is at all. In essence, the meaning of this amendment is that where the Seanad had three days in which to object to the certification of a Bill as a Money Bill, that three days is now extended to seven days.  The other alteration which permits a certain number of members of the Seanad in a House consisting of not less than thirty members to take certain action is not a really vital consideration at all; the really vital consideration is the seven days.  A Bill passes this House on Friday.  I put it to the common-sense of anybody that three days from Friday, with Senators living all over the country, is not fair.  Anybody would admit on a moment's consideration that there is reasonable ground for increasing the number of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is meant by a Money Bill? The case has been mentioned by several Deputies on those benches who do not understand this Bill that it is an attempt to take from the Dáil certain power which it has now got.  It is no such thing.  There is no interference whatever with the power of the Dáil; the power of the Dáil remains absolutely supreme over money matters.  What is a Money Bill?  Giving the Seanad the right to object to that particular <Col N="1152" /> title being affixed to a Bill is not interfering with the power of this House.  Deputy Cooper very intelligently explained, but the explanation was not accepted as it should have been, one particular example of what a Money Bill might be.  He mentioned a case where a Bill might be introduced to reduce the salary of Senators from £360 to nothing, with a second clause that the Seanad be from that date abolished.  Now, the second item would detract from the character of the measure in so far as its title to be regarded as a Money Bill was concerned, and as I said before, if there be any Party which require a Seanad more than Deputies opposite I do not know it. They ought to consider more carefully before they announce, No. 1, that we must abolish the Seanad and, No. 2, that we must abolish the Seanad as at present constituted.  Only yesterday I received an amendment to a motion which was put down by some member of the Fianna Fáil Party some months ago&mdash;it may not appear on the Order Paper&mdash;showing that they never can make up their minds, apparently, on any subject. The Seanad is a most necessary thing for people who are in that frame of mind.  But I am not arguing about keeping the Seanad in respect of that.  I want to get into the mind of Deputy MacEntee, that rising hope of the Fianna Fáil Party, what the meaning of this measure is.  The certification of a Bill as a Money Bill is not by any means an easy matter. I have known occasions when I am positively certain the Ceann Comhairle was very much puzzled as to whether or not he could decide that a Bill was a Money Bill.  And there is a case on record in which the Seanad, in the consideration of a Money Bill, sent down a recommendation which had previously been passed by this House and which this House afterwards rejected but which it subsequently accepted from the Seanad.  I believe that if Deputies opposite had as much sense then as they have now they would have supported the Seanad in that particular view, having regard to what I have heard from them since.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> The definition of a Money Bill contained in Article 35 of the Constitution is borrowed from the British Parliament Act of 1911. Under that Act the Speaker of the British House of Commons consults two members who are nominated on his panel of chairmen.  Here there is no such consultation; the Ceann Comhairle has to make up his mind for himself, and as I have said before, there are considerable difficulties in many cases in connection with the Ceann Comhairle being able to certify that a Bill is a Money Bill, and great care has to be exercised by the Executive, in introducing a Bill which it regards as a Money Bill, to keep out of it any matter which would detract from that title or which would prevent the Ceann Comhairle from giving his certificate. I suppose it is unnecessary for me to enter into an explanation of the difference between a Money Bill and an ordinary Bill, but if I were as much disposed as Deputies opposite to occupy the time of the House I could go into that matter. I do not think it is necessary.  Deputy Flinn, Deputy Derrig, Deputy MacEntee, and, to a very considerable extent but not perhaps as much, Deputy Lemass totally and entirely misunderstood and misread this measure.  Now, under the Parliament Act in England there is no provision for an appeal from the Speaker's ruling.  Here there is and it is not an appeal which is confined to either House.  There are certain provisions in respect to this House, and holding up a measure about which there is a doubt might in many cases be of considerable benefit to the country.  I stand for absolutely the fullest and completest control by the Dáil over money matters, but if an Executive or if a Ceann Comhairle were so disposed as to get through a Bill under the title of a Money Bill which was not in essence a Money Bill I would not stand for it.  I have not heard from any of the Deputies opposite whether they would stand for that. It would appear to me that their view was that if an Executive Council, <Col N="1154" /> or if a Ceann Comhairle, acting either in common or separately, said that a Bill was a Money Bill, whether it was or not should not be left to anybody else to decide, I do not subscribe to that.  It is really a question of fact, and on a question of fact there may be a difference of opinion.  Is there any objection to the ventilation of these opinions, to having that question decided?  The question for decision falls for the consideration of three members from each House, with a Supreme Court Judge.  The power, of course, of certifying a Bill is not, as Deputies opposite would appear to have thought, or which one could infer from some of their speeches, in the Dáil itself; it is in the Ceann Comhairle. I think that now, with that very short explanation, Deputies opposite will have much greater freedom in making up their minds as to whether or not they can support the Bill.</P>

The position, as I see it, is that a Bill is certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill.  If the Bill becomes law, and within seven days the necessary objection to its being regarded as a Money Bill is received from the Seanad, a Committee is set up.  If the Committee allows twenty-one days to elapse before they give a decision, and if I am President of the Executive Council, I will forward that Bill to his Excellency the Governor-General for his signature.</P>

      <P>I remember that the President, in another connection, tried to put through in the face of the Dáil that which common sense showed was completely wrong.  It was pointed out to him on that occasion that the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; had been omitted, completely changing the purpose intended.  Yet he wanted the whole Dáil to pass it because some authority told him that it was right, but he would not go and examine it and see that the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; had been omitted.</P>

      <P>I think it is most unfair to the House that the President should try and put through a Bill like this when there is a definite objection raised to a point that ought to be met.  The President has put it that a Money Bill has to come back within 21 days.  That is all right if it is a Money Bill, but we have <Col N="1158" /> nothing to show when it has not been decided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
