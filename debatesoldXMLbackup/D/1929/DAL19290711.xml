      <P>The total amount paid by way of compensation or indemnity under the Indemnity Act, 1924, was £80,064.  These payments covered approximately 2,900 claims, and, in view of the labour which would be involved, I cannot see my way to furnish a return showing the names, addresses and occupations of the persons concerned.  The nature of the claims is generally indicated by the terms of Sections 5 and 6 of the Indemnity Act, 1924.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is with his approval and sanction that taxpayers resident in the counties of Cork and Kerry have been summoned to attend at Dublin Castle for interrogation by officials of the Revenue Department; if he will state by what statutory or other <Col N="808" /> authority these summonses have been issued and interrogations held, and if it is proposed to continue the holding of these interrogations; if he will provide for payment of the expenses and for loss of time incurred by the attendances of such persons, as they have frequently to travel upwards of 400 miles (return journey) and remain absent from their homes for at least three days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any communications which can properly be described as &ldquo;summonses&rdquo; to attend at Dublin Castle having been issued by Revenue officials to taxpayers resident in the Counties of Cork and Kerry. In certain cases in which taxpayers have laid themselves open to proceedings for Income Tax penalties a letter, somewhat in the following terms, has been sent to the taxpayer concerned:</P>
      <P>With reference to the Returns and Accounts furnished by you for 1928/29 and prior years, I shall feel obliged if you will be good enough to arrange to see me in the course of the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>You might notify me in advance of the day and time it would be convenient for you to call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious to the taxpayer in such cases, who has, of course, had previous correspondence either with the District Inspector or with an official at the Head Office, that the letter sent him is an invitation, not a &ldquo;summons.&rdquo;  It offers him an opportunity of discussing his case with an experienced and responsible official with a view to settling the matter under the powers of mitigation of penalties conferred on the Revenue Commissioners which I referred to in the course of a reply to the Deputy yesterday.  The taxpayer can take advantage of this opportunity or not as he pleases. There is no compulsion about accepting the invitation, and he can, if he chooses, leave the Commissioners to take proceedings under the provisions of the Income Tax Acts for recovery of whatever penalties <Col N="809" /> he has incurred.  I consider it entirely right and proper that taxpayers should, as a general rule, be afforded opportunities such as I have indicated of discussing their cases with a view to a settlement before legal proceedings are taken.</P>
    <P>As regards the expenses incurred by taxpayers, I gave the Deputy yesterday particulars of a case in which a taxpayer, who had laid himself open to proceedings for penalties amounting to £6,068, had his case settled on payment of a mitigated penalty of £1,357.  It is obvious that the taxpayer in question was amply reimbursed for any expense incurred by him in arriving at a settlement.  The amount of mitigation must, of course, depend on the circumstances in each particular case; but if taxpayers desire to secure mitigation of penalties, it is reasonable that they should bear whatever expense may be incidental to obtaining it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) (for Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Objections were raised to certain works included in the drainage scheme for the Rampart River, the principal one being from the Dundalk Urban District Council to the effect that interference with the bed of the river in the town would endanger the sewers and the Rampart Walk.  A public inquiry having been held, it was deemed undesirable to proceed with that part of the scheme to which the council objected, and an endeavour has since been made to provide an alternative outlet for the district.  No such outlet, however, appears to be feasible within the funds available in the scheme and it cannot therefore be stated when, if at all, the work in connection with the scheme is likely to be commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Board of Works to proceed with this work in the near future, or have they abandoned the scheme?  I also want to ask the Minister, in view of the much-needed employment that would be given as a result of carrying out this drainage work, and also the enhanced value that would accrue to the land adjacent to the river, if he would consider the question of arranging to have this scheme carried out as soon as possible?  I quite understand that objections were made by the Urban Council with regard to the danger of sewers subsiding when the river would be deepened, but I understand from the engineer of the Board of Works that he has already determined upon an alternative scheme for the sewerage drains.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that there is great difficulty in dealing with the bed of this Rampart River, and it will be necessary to try to find some other outlet for the drainage scheme.  At the present moment, it has not been found possible to discover any alternative outlet for the drainage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether any regulations have been made by his Department governing the amount of petrol which may be stored in garages, etc., situated in thickly-populated areas; and, if not, and whether, having regard to the fact that in a recent Dublin garage fire 500 gallons of petrol narrowly escaped ignition, he will take steps to limit the quantity of petrol which may be stored in such places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>Under the regulations made in July, 1907, petrol for use in light locomotives and not for sale may be kept without a licence in quantities not exceeding 60 gallons.  In other cases a licence is required under the Petroleum Acts, 1871 and 1879.  In granting such licences the local authority has regard to the quantity to be kept, the mode of storage, and the suitability of the premises.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that Mr. Patrick Leach, Curnalee, Curraghboy, Athlone, was sued by the Land Commission for one half-year's arrears of rent, alleged to have been due, the date of the summons being 25th May, 1929; if he is further aware that Mr. Leach holds an official receipt for the same half-year's rent, dated 14th May, 1929; and whether, in view of this obvious mistake on the part of the Land Commission, the Minister will see that Mr. Leach is at least paid his out of pocket expenses for attending the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings were taken through the State Solicitor for Roscommon against Patrick Leach for recovery of 16s. 6d., the half-yearly instalment of rent due to the Land Commission on the 1st November, 1928.  This sum reached the Land Commission on the 14th May, 1929, having been paid through a bank.  A six-day notice demanding payment was issued to Mr. Leach on the 1st April, 1929.  As the debt was not paid when it accrued due or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Land Commission are unable to entertain a claim for any out of pocket expenses Mr. Leach may have incurred by reason of his default.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary explain how it comes that a summons was issued on the 25th May when the man had a receipt for his rent on the 14th May? There must have been a mistake, I submit, on the part of the Land Commission.  I have here the official receipt, the receivable order, dated 14th May, and I have also got the summons dated the 25th May.  How <Col N="830" /> does it happen that an official receipt was issued on the 14th May, and that the man was prosecuted a fortnight later for arrears of rent which he had paid?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that if the case went against the man he would have to pay all expenses?  It is a most unjust case altogether.  If it is a mistake, and I think it is admitted that a mistake was made in the Department, seeing that a receipt was issued a fortnight previously, I think it is only fair that the man should be paid his expenses.  He was laughed out when he went into court. If Mr. Neilan had succeeded he would have to be paid his expenses, as he always sees to that.  Every Deputy knows that the costs in these cases are piled up against the tenant until they are much more than the rent itself very often.  This man is over seventy years of age, he had seven miles to come to court, and he had to hire a car.  He was laughed out when he asked for his expenses. I think it is only right that something should be done for him.</P>

      <P>If the tenant, Mr. Leach, had paid his rent in the ordinary way and at the ordinary time this difficulty would not have arisen.  The rent was not paid until it was six months overdue.  It was sent on when the staff was particularly busy in sending out receipts. The question of allowing costs was raised in court, and they were not allowed to Mr. Leach by the District Justice.</P>

Even if there was 16/6 arrears due, there are several cases of persons amongst supporters of the Government who owe five and six years' rent and who have never been prosecuted.  This case should have been inquired into before proceedings were instituted.  I never heard of such a case before..</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As to No. 17, when speaking on Friday, I said I was prepared to ask the House to accept the Bill.  In the meantime, I have found out that the Dublin County Council, which is concerned to a large extent in the matter, and with which, in my previous consideration of the matter, I had been in negotiation about the relief position in the county, has not been consulted in any way by the Seanad Committee which dealt with this matter, and very serious objection is taken by the Dublin County Council to the passing of this Bill. Therefore, I find myself in the position that, while prepared to pass this measure, if there was any kind of agreement in connection with it, I find myself opposed in that attitude by the Dublin County Council, and also up against administrative difficulties which the Dublin Union Commissioners would have for a certain <Col N="835" /> period if the Bill were passed. The position as far as the Union Commissioners are concerned is that if the Bill were passed they would like to have an appointed day fixed in connection with it&mdash;in other words, that its coming into operation should be postponed for a couple of months in order to enable them to make the necessary alterations which a great change in the administration of poor relief in the city would necessitate.  I was prepared to pass this Bill without an appointed day simply because of the shortness of Parliamentary time, and then let the Union Commissioners get over the matter in the best way they could, but, in view of the difficulty that has arisen with the Dublin County Council, and as I was in communication with them in connection with the putting right of this matter, and as, although we came to a full stop in our previous negotiations, these negotiations have been re-opened, I have changed my mind in connection with the matter and would not ask the House to accept the Bill as it stands.  I hope that during the Recess we shall be able to make an arrangement for the city and county which, from my point of view, and the point of view of Deputies on both sides of the House to whom I have spoken on the matter, will be more generally acceptable than the present Bill. For that reason, I should like to postpone passing the measure and not to take even the Second Stage to-day.</P>

What I ask is that the House should postpone the Second Reading until <Col N="836" /> October.  By that time I hope to be-able to say whether I can put an alternative before the House which will be more satisfactory.  If the Second Reading is defeated to-day, that finishes the Bill.  I do not wish to do that, but I do not wish to commit myself entirely to accepting the principle enshrined in the Bill.  The House should bear in mind that the Seanad set up a Committee to go into this matter of poor relief in the city and county of Dublin; and I now find that the Dublin County Council was not taken into consultation by the Seanad Committee, although this Bill is supposed to apply to the county.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to discuss this Bill, but I put it to the Minister if he has changed his mind and attitude towards this Bill brought in from the Seanad that there ought certainly to be some alternative.  If this Bill were passed to-day as originally intended, there would be machinery put into operation by which the poor, for whom the Bill is intended, could have their wants attended to during the next four or five months.  We will not be able to pass, when we resume here, whatever Bill the Minister might then introduce for a month or two, so that in all probability six months will elapse before any alternative arrangements could be made to meet an urgent situation.  The Minister knows, and everybody connected with Dublin knows the situation in the city demands immediate attention.  That fact was borne in upon the minds of those who brought in the Bill in the Seanad, and I put it to the Minister that something is immediately necessary in the way of an alternative, if this Bill is not passed here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put a question to the Minister as to the eventual repayment of this sum of £132,500.  There seems to be a misapprehension as to what the Minister said on the Second Reading. It has been reported that the Minister stated that this sum or the greater portion of it was to be borne by the users of navigation.  I find that is misconstruing what the Minister actually did say.  The <Col N="844" /> Minister did say that this is not determined in this Bill; it must be later decided.  I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that we will have an opportunity of discussing the matter before an ultimate decision will be come to as to who will repay this money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister would assure us that the money would be repaid.  We are advancing a sum for the purposes of improvement works on the Shannon and we are exempting the Shannon Electricity Supply Board from the obligation to pay interest on or to repay that money.  The Minister informed us that the question as to who would be responsible for the interest and sinking fund charges has not been determined.  Are we to take it that somebody, somewhere, sometime will be responsible for the repayment of the money and the payment of interest on it in the meantime, or is it intended that any portion of it should be charged on the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielBourke" hpid="Mr. D. Bourke Mr. D. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not ask the users of navigation to pay for the improvements in connection with this.  I know it will cripple the industries of Limerick if it is so.  I will read a resolution passed by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners last Monday:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That we have read with alarm the proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he expresses his intention that the balance of £132,000 for the proposed improvements of the navigation of the Shannon, after £20,000 has been borne by the Electricity Supply Board, should fall upon the users of the navigation of which the merchants of Limerick form a very important part.  That in view of the fact that present tolls on goods carried over the Shannon are 125 per cent. higher than in pre-war days and this new impost would mean at least an additional 150 per cent. on existing tolls which must have a disastrous and crippling effect on this means of transit, we <Col N="845" /> are anxious to know what exactly are the improvements to which the Minister refers.  We have never asked for such improvements and are quite satisfied with the transit facilities hitherto provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Bennett says is quite correct as to my statement the last day.  I made no statement, as is stated in the resolution which the Deputy who has just sat down read, expressing my intention that the payment of this money should fall upon navigation. I do not now express any intention that it will not fall upon it either.  I have not yet said that it will not fall upon the users of navigation.  All I said was that the present proposal went to this extent only, that the Electricity Supply Board would not be asked to pay the service of this debt.  Deputy Bennett has asked whether or not an opportunity will be given to discuss the matter of the repayment before any decision is taken.  At the moment, under present legislation, I am liable for this sum and cannot get rid of that liability without certain legislation effecting some change.  When the legislation comes along, of course, there will be an opportunity to discuss who will repay, with the interest, so what will happen to it eventually I cannot say at the moment.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners, in their resolution, expressed the wish to know what the improvements effected are.  They are being answered by letter on that point.  They speak of the extra charges that would fall upon them if the whole of the money had to be met out of navigation tolls.  They seem to forget always in their calculations that the upkeep of ten or twelve locks that used to cost a certain amount of money disappeared, and that they will save a certain amount of money per annum that will have to go on the other side of the bill.  As far as Section 1 or Section 3 goes, nothing is determined except that the money will not be a charge upon the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 40, to delete the words &ldquo;sixty-five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;sixty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of the House know, this is the most important section of this Bill.  It deals with the cases of 24,000 non-judicial tenants who still remain to be vested.  In to-day's &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; there is a letter from Mr. Mansfield, who has studied this question of land finance.  Arising out of that letter, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary some questions.  In the first place, could he tell us what the average purchase price was in connection with the cases in which judicial rents have been fixed or have been agreed upon?  Mr. Mansfield states in his letter, and I find the data are taken from the official report of the Land Commission, that in connection with fee farm grants the price of redemption <Col N="849" /> is 18.6 years' purchase. although the inclusive price in the Act is 15.05 or 16.21 years' purchase. according as you take the rents fixed before or after the 15th August, 1911.  I just raise that question because, at the very outset, we are met with the consideration in connection with Section 2 of the Bill whether the purchase annuity really affects the burden of the tenant.  It may affect the manner in which the burden falls upon the tenant.  What I want to get at is will the fixing of the standard purchase annuities in this section have any influence on the purchase price?  I take it that it will not&mdash;none whatever.  It does not matter very much then what the tenant is going to pay yearly.  His purchase price will still be fixed, and whether he pays 60 or 65 per cent., in my opinion, does not matter, because there will be the purchase price fixed in any case, and that purchase price will have to be redeemed.</P>
    <P>The total amount that the tenant will have to pay in a particular year, although it may affect him in the bigger reduction, would of course be to the tenant's benefit.  But it does not affect the purchase price.  Therefore I think that that is an argument in favour of my amendment.  The experience of Land Commission officials and the experience of an inspector of the Land Commission now out on pension is that fixing it at 60 would be a reasonable price.  The Parliamentary Secretary in taking the figure 65 has told us that that is the average of the annuities that have been fixed up to the present. But there are two considerations in connection with that.  The first is that as to those annuities, as Mr. Mansfield points out in his letter, the fixing of the figure at 65 would seem to affect the poorer districts more than it would affect the wealthier districts.</P>
    <P>On page 46 of the Official Report of the Land Commission, it is stated that the average reduction in respect of annuities fixed, that is, fixed by the Land Commission or fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, comes in the case of Connaught to 39.5 per cent. <Col N="850" /> and Munster, 38.9; so that although the general average is somewhat lower in the case of these two provinces it is considerably more than the 35 per cent.  In Leinster the average is lower&mdash;34.7 per cent.  In the case of Carlow, my own constituency, the percentage is 38 and in Leix it is 39.  In Longford, it goes up to 45.  That fact that in Longford it goes to 45 seems to show that 60 is not enough for the poorer districts and seems to bear out Mr. Mansfield's contention.  I have not any facts in support of this statement that the non-judicial tenants are the poorer class but it is a fact that their acreage is small and the average rental of the non-judicial tenant is £11.</P>
    <P>The effect of my amendment will be to give them an additional decrease of 1/- in the £1 as compared with what the Parliamentary Secretary suggests.  I do not see how the State is to lose because the purchase price of the annuities will still be the same.  It is merely that the yearly payment will be slightly reduced. There has been a campaign throughout the country to have even that much granted to the tenant and to have the period for the repayment extended.  Here we have an opportunity of extending the period and making the annuity as low as possible.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to refer to is in connection with sub-section (2).  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that if his figure of 65 is not accepted that it will mean a large amount of litigation.  Well, the fact that you fix it at 65, or in fact at any other figure, does not seem to prove that you would in any way affect the amount of litigation. The right is still there in sub-section (2) to the landlord or the tenant to come into court.  Either one or the other can come into court.  But if it is a case of coming into court, we say let the landlord come into court, and let us see that it will be the landlord who will have to come into court.  We can do that by fixing the price at 60.  Let us give a definite margin in favour of the tenant.</P>
    <P>One further argument in favour of <Col N="851" /> it is the history of the non-judicial rents.  The people who are called judicial tenants at present had their rents reduced at various periods under the Land Purchase Acts. First, they got a reduction of their rents of 21 per cent.  That was for the first term.  In the second term rents the reduction roughly was 18 per cent.  After they got these reductions, which reduced their old rents to 79 per cent. or 82 per cent., the 1923 Land Act gave them a further reduction of 35 per cent.  That means that these tenants who had the good fortune to have judicial rents fixed have got a total reduction of either 56 per cent. or 53 per cent. on their old judicial rents.  A great many of them have been vested and they have had the benefit of paying off the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Those tenants who have been left to the very end and whose cases have presented a special difficulty are the non-judicial tenants.  There is no proof that they are going to be vested within the next twelve months, and that they are going to have the satisfaction of paying off the purchase price by their annuity. Those tenants are now in the position that they are only to get 35 per cent. of a reduction, whereas the judicial tenants had a reduction of over 50 per cent.  I would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, if carried, would really defeat the object of the section.  The figure of 65 per cent. was arrived at by taking an average of the prices fixed by agreement between the owner and the tenant, and the prices fixed by the Land Commission. If you are going to increase or reduce that figure you will increase the number of cases in which there will be objections by the owner or the tenant, and that in itself will to a very large extent defeat the object of the section.  What was the average reduction under the Act of 1903 and 1909?  When Deputies hear the figures that I am about to read out, they will be quite satisfied <Col N="852" /> that the figure of 65 per cent. is quite a reasonable and fair figure, and will be accepted by the owners and the tenants.</P>
      <P>In the Act of 1903, in the case of judicial rents fixed after the 16th August, 1896, the average reduction was 23.9.  The average reduction in non-judicial rents under the Act of 1903 was 32.7, and the average reduction under the Act of 1909 was 35.2.  The average reduction under the Act of 1923 up to the present is 35 per cent.  With regard to sub-section (2) of this Bill, I would remind the Deputy that as the Bill stands, and as the sub-section is worded at the moment the Land Commission cannot revise standard purchase annuities unless an objection is lodged either by the owner or the tenant.  The alteration of this figure of 65 to 60 would certainly lead to an increase in the number of objections.  Consequently I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have not said a word about the financial obligations of the State.  What I am thinking of primarily is the uselessness and ineffectiveness of this particular amendment.  When introducing this Bill I stated that our object in putting in this section was primarily to speed up the work of vesting of the non-judicial holdings.  If you are going to amend this section in the manner suggested by Deputy Derrig you will defeat very largely the object aimed at.  This amendment will increase the number of objections, consequently it will mean that instead of dispensing with inspections, as we propose, it will compel us to carry out inspections on the present scale.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons for this Bill is that in the future the Land Commission do not expect to have the annuities fixed by agreement. They expect they will all go into court.  In the past they were mainly fixed by agreement.  Why should the prices fixed by agreement be the basis for the new prices?  How do we know that the prices will hold?  It is quite possible the Judicial Commissioner will increase the price.  Let him increase it, but give the tenants 60 instead of 65 per cent. so that the onus of the appeal will lie on the landlords' shoulders.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason why fishery rights already taken over and paid for should be returned, as this sub-section provides.  In connection with any fishery rights vested under the 1923 Act in the Land Commission fair compensation has been given.  It should be the policy of this House that all fishery rights in the Saorstát should be vested in the Land Commission.  I cannot see, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some enlightenment on the matter, why fishing rights already paid for should be returned to the owner.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the words: &ldquo;It is not equitable or is not advisable that such fishery or fishing right should have so vested.&rdquo; Does that give the Land Commission sufficient guarantee that the rights which they purchased and which should be vested in the tenants will be held by them?  It seems to me that there are specific cases in which the landlord has claimed that the fishing rights, as a fact, have not been vested in the Land Commission and that the specific cases which entitle him to exemption from the operation of the preceding sub-section should be stated.  I think the expression &ldquo;advisable or equitable&rdquo; brings the whole thing back again into the hands of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>

      <P>There may be cases where portion of the rights were sold or acquired under the Act of 1903 or the Act of 1909.  Others are being acquired under the Act of 1923.  If these rights were vested in the Land Commission it might have the effect of destroying them altogether.  The Land Commission might be satisfied that the landlord is using them for the best interests of the State.  Consequently, in such cases the Land Commission should have power under this sub-section to declare that such rights shall not vest in them.  I do not know of any such cases, but it is, as I have said, usual in all retrospective legislation to have a clause such as this to cover cases already dealt with.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I think I made it perfectly clear in my speech on the Second Reading that this Bill was designed to strengthen the hands of the Land Commission in acquiring fishing rights under Section 45 of the Land Act of 1923.  We discovered that owing to the use of a certain word in that section of the Land Act of 1923 &mdash;the word &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo;&mdash;that our powers in the direction of acquiring fishing rights were somewhat limited, and for that reason we introduced this Bill to carry out the Minister's obvious intention embodied in Section 45 of the Land Act of 1923; that is, that the Land Commission should have power to resell the fishing rights they acquired or acquire under the Land Act of 1923 to the tenants.</P>

      <P>I rarely see eye to eye with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am making an appeal on behalf of a number of sportsmen who are prepared to pay for certain fishing rights in the Free State.  They are not men of the wealthy class but are rather of the middle and working class, and I suggest that there is nothing to be gained by merely changing the landlords in these cases.  It is all the same to me whether I have to pay £10 to Lord Tom Noddy or to the Land Commission, but I would much prefer to see the riparian rights acquired by the Land Commission and held in trust for the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an article here written by a well-known ex-Local Government Official in which he calls attention to a Government advertisement of a farm in which it says: &ldquo;In the public Press we notice a Government advertisement that a peasant proprietor's interests in part of the lands of Bawnogue, Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow, are to be sold by auction, but the fishery right and fisheries are reserved.&rdquo; The writer goes on to say that on any part of the River Slaney anglers always had a right to go and fish and owners never objected to their trespassing upon the land.  But now it seems to be the obvious intention of the Land Commission to make fisheries a preserve for whatever <Col N="868" /> purpose they have in mind.  Is that consistent with the Parliamentary Secretary's statement?  Taking the advertisement apart from what the writer has to say, as he may have a bee in his bonnet, is it consistent with the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that it is the desire of the Land Commission to hand over all such rights to the tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was the desire of the Land Commission to hand over the fishing rights to the tenant.  The Land Commission under this Bill are taking powers, if they think it necessary and consider it advisable to do so, to resell those rights to the tenant.  The Land Commission have a discretionary power to do that.  If they are satisfied that it would injure the preservation and development of the fisheries the Land Commission have the power to reserve these rights to themselves. But there was a misunderstanding under Section 45 of the Land Act of 1923 as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;appurtenant,&rdquo; and Section 3 of this Bill explains and clarifies the meaning of &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; and gives as far as it is possible to give the power to the Land Commission to resell fishing rights wherever they acquire them under the Land Act of 1923 to the purchasing tenant if it is considered advisable in the interest of the State to do so.  I might mention that Section 4 has nothing to do with this.  It only gives the Land Commission power to declare what rights actually vest in them and what rights do not; what rights are actually sold and what rights are not sold.  Any person who wishes to dispose of those fishing rights will be in the position to know what fishing rights he actually owns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1)  the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and in default of such agreement the Land Commission shall have power to acquire compulsorily such fishery or fishery right at such price as may seem to them fair and equitable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 5 gives the Land Commission the right to purchase certain fishing rights which they consider are necessary for the proper enjoyment of the land.  Where as the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the rights might be divided up, this gives the Land Commission the right to buy them by agreement. Unfortunately there is no provision in the section as to what is to happen if there is no agreement.  For the purpose of eliciting the opinion of the House I put down the amendment. It is merely to get in the question of what is to be done if there is no agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the question will naturally work itself out in this way.  If the fishery right is not of very much value the proprietor will not have much objection to selling <Col N="871" /> it to the Land Commission.  If it is a valuable right it is hardly likely that he will come to an agreement even to facilitate the Land Commission. I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what is going to happen where there is no agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate that compulsory powers will be required for the purpose of this section. In any event, I would not consider it advisable that the Land Commission should be given further compulsory powers for the purpose of dealing with a matter which is not really their principal function.  I only know of one case at the moment to which this section would apply. In that case the landlord has agreed, as a matter of fact, to sell his rights to the Land Commission.  However, if our experience shows at a later stage that compulsory powers will be required, the Dáil can be approached to give these powers to the Land Commission.  In the light of our experience at the moment, such powers are not necessary.  I am not sure that it would be an advisable thing to give such compulsory powers to the Land Commission, considering that the safeguarding of fishery rights is not one of its principal functions, and certainly is not one of its primary functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if there are compulsory powers in Section 45 of the original Act?  Section 45 says that the fishing rights which are appurtenant shall vest to the Land Commission.  In that case, they have compulsory powers.  If they have compulsory powers to the main rights, why should they not get compulsory powers for the ancillary rights?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

Consequently, paragraph (a) of the amendment covers the point raised by Deputy Jordan. The second paragraph is a provision which was already in the Bill.  It is put into a separate paragraph by way of redrafting.  Paragraph (c) enables a loan to be used for the purpose of paying off a loan so that the first mortgage may be obtained.  For instance, in certain cases a farm is left to a son, and there would be <Col N="879" /> charges on it in favour of other sons and daughters.  In such cases the owner could not give a first charge on the land to the Corporation, no matter how small the charge might be.  This enables the Corporation to advance money for paying off the charge so that the first mortgage may be obtained.  The next paragraph covers Deputy Ryan's amendment, which we undertook to consider.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill passes I would like to direct the attention of the House to a statement made on the Second Reading by a Deputy.  I refer to Deputy Kennedy, and the statement made by him is reported in Volume 30. No. 6, col. 1960 of the Official Reports.  Deputy Kennedy is reported as having made the following statement: &ldquo;As far as I can see, the chief achievement of the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="880" /> was to give jobs to the defeated candidates of the Farmers' Party for their support of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At that stage An Leas-Cheann Comhairle intervened and said: &ldquo;The Deputy is not in order in discussing the Agricultural Credit Corporation, its personnel, or its administration under this Bill.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Kennedy went on.  This is the particular paragraph in his statement that I want to draw attention to.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I ask you, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if it is right that a leading politician in a public position who used his spleen against his political opponents is a right and proper person to be a member of the Agricultural Credit Corporation?&rdquo;  An Leas-Cheann Comhairle again intervened, and Deputy Kennedy edged away from the line he had taken.  I was not present at the debate at the time, but, in any case, if I had been present I would have thought it well first to see the Official Report before commenting on what he had said. The statement that the Deputy has made is not a statement that should be made by a Deputy of this House, and I think an expression of opinion should go forth from this House if the Deputy does not make a withdrawal of that statement.  The House should say that it is not the right type of statement that should be made here.  I want to point out in connection with that statement that the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this, that the Deputy took advantage of his position here and of his privileges as a member of this House to make an imputation against the personal honour of somebody associated with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  My understanding of the Order of this House is that it is an unwritten law that a Deputy shall not make a statement imputing charges against the personal honour of a person who is not in this House and who is not in a position to defend himself.  Furthermore, it is an imputation against the honour of a person who is not definitely named, and it remains uncertain and indefinite as to whom the Deputy is exactly referring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in view of that he should leave the matter there.  I would suggest further that he would do no good by going into the matter at this particular stage.  The point is that Deputy Kennedy made a statement which, in the opinion of the Chair, was disorderly.  The Deputy <Col N="883" /> was informed of that and was prevented from going any further.  It is unfortunate that the statement appeared in the Official Reports. But the Chair informed the Deputy that the statement made was out of order and the Deputy was not allowed to proceed further.  I do not think I can allow the Parliamentary Secretary to go into the pros and cons of the matter at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to trespass on the Chair or on the ruling of the Chair, but I just want to make a point of order, and that is that Deputy Kennedy did actually make a statement and that statement is on the official records of the House.  That statement in its present form is a direct imputation on the personal honour of an ex-member of this House.  The statement has been printed in the public Press, that an ex-member of this House is not a fit person to be on, or to be associated with, the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The person against whom this imputation was made has not the right which an ordinary citizen has against any person who makes a slanderous or libellous statement about him, and my point is that Deputy Kennedy has taken advantage of the privileges of this House to make a statement in this House which he would not have the courage to make outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on the introduction of this measure, the statutory period of three years during which the Commissioner in Trim could continue to carry out the work of the Urban District Council expired on 16th July.  The necessary order was issued for the holding of an election of the council, but no one was nominated.  The matter was then reported to the County Council so that they might take statutory steps to secure the carrying on of the Urban Council's affairs.  The County <Col N="885" /> Council, at a meeting held on 1st July, passed the following resolution:</P>
      <P>On consideration of the matter, and in view of the reluctance of the electors of the Trim Urban District to depart from the system of administration by Commissioner, it was proposed, seconded, and passed nem con:</P>
      <P>That the Meath County Council take no action under Article 7 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, to provide for the continuance of the administration of the Trim Urban District.</P>
      <P>The position in which I find myself is that, in order that the affairs of this sanitary area may be carried on, it is necessary to have statutory powers to continue the Commissioner there for another period.  There is no other way of dealing with the matter except by legislation in this House.  In dealing with a similar case in connection with Ennis, I pointed out that the people there were prepared to consider the position in general and to make representation as to how the affairs of the town should be carried on.  The matter is one which affects towns generally throughout the country. In Trim the position is that you have a population of 1,325 inhabitants, that number having been reduced by 11 per cent. since 1911, and the question must arise whether a town of that kind shall be either de-urbanised, or whether such towns must have their affairs carried on in a different way to that prevailing in the past.  There is no option at present to do anything except to continue the statutory period of the Commissioner there.  The Bill makes provision to continue the Commissioner for another period of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister why special provision is made for Trim, while in the case of Granard, when representations were made to him, similar <Col N="886" /> arrangements were not made for that town.  Apparently the reason that Trim got a Commissioner originally was because the people were not able to balance their budget.  That also obtained in Granard, and representations were made to the Minister.  I am not saying anything in favour of the Commissioner system, but what they wanted in Granard was to de-urbanise the area and bring it under the Board of Health.  I want to ask the Minister why he makes a law for Trim but does not deal with the question of Granard at all.  He tells them to carry on in the hopelessness in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say in regard to the position in Granard.  We necessarily have to deal with all these different problems that arise on the merits of the case.  What we will try and do in the case of Granard is to do the best possible thing in the interests of the local people and for the purpose of securing the better carrying on of the affairs of the area.  In the case of Trim, however, we have nothing else to do at present but to continue the Commissioner system.  The question of de-urbanising Trim may be considered, but it is quite possible that legislation might have to be passed to have that carried into effect.  From the facts that Deputies have before them, they know that the inhabitants of Ennis, the principal town in Co. Clare, considered that a change was necessary in the way in which the urban affairs might be carried on.  Now you have the people of Trim coming to the same conclusion in regard to the carrying on of their affairs.  Thus it is clear that there is a problem which has to be tackled throughout the country generally.  The policy of the Department has not been to run too rapidly ahead of the people's ideas and needs, and the position in this matter has been carefully considered; but it is much too early yet to say anything about the lines on which a solution may be sought.</P>

      <P>We disagree with this amendment.  The matter was very carefully debated from all parts of the House and the number nine was arrived at after very careful consideration. We cannot see that there is any reason now to go back on the decision we arrived at then. We think that the only reason that the Minister desires this amendment is that he is afraid he would not be able to get nine men who would be willing to act.  Really, I think as soon as the Minister finds that this provision is inserted he will be able to find people to carry out the Act. <Col N="888" /> I do not think that reason is sufficient to depart from the principle of having as wide a review of books as possible in order to prevent a fantastic or unreasonable decision being arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the House that if you have nine members you will be more likely to have a fantastic decision arrived at than if you have only five members, because naturally the suitability of your five will be greater than the suitability of your nine. The further you increase the membership of your board, the less suitable will be the last persons whom you appoint.  You naturally will appoint the most suitable person first if he is willing to act, and go on until you are driven to select persons less and less suitable.  I ask the House to accept this amendment.  I believe that a Committee of five will prove a good, workable Committee. Later on certain provisions are made as to the majority.  We will deal with those when we come to them, but as far as this section is concerned, I would ask the House to agree with the Seanad and to insert five instead of nine.  I think the only argument put forward in favour of the nine was that there would be a larger religious representation than if there were five.  My hope is that this will not be run on religious grounds at all.  It was debated here before and the House, by a majority of one, favoured nine members as against five.  That was a very slender majority, and I ask the House now to agree with what the Seanad has done.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the amendment, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (2).  The word &ldquo;nine&rdquo; deleted in line 44 and the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (3).  The words &ldquo;one or two (but not more than two) vacancies&rdquo; deleted in lines 36-7 and the words &ldquo;a vacancy&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This really rather follows from the alteration in the size of the Board. It was thought that when the Board was nine it should be able to operate, even though there were two vacancies.  Now that the Board is <Col N="891" /> to be five it is considered that it ought not to operate if there is more than one vacancy.  I think that really it is the same as the old principle.</P>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (3).  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; deleted in line 52 and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>This amendment substitutes &ldquo;shall take into consideration&rdquo; for &ldquo;may take into consideration.&rdquo;  I must frankly admit that I cannot really see any substantial difference between the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this context.  Therefore, I do not see any reason for differing from the Seanad.  I cannot see whether you put in &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; that the Board will act in the slightest way differently.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (3).  After the word &ldquo;importance,&rdquo; in line 55, the words &ldquo;and the general tenor&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was an amendment proposed by the Labour Party in the Seanad to put in the words &ldquo;and the general tenor,&rdquo; so that it will run: &ldquo;The Board shall have regard to all or any of the following matters, that is to say, the literary, artistic, scientific or historic merit or importance and the general tenor of the book.&rdquo;  I think that the words &ldquo;general tenor&rdquo; do not add very much to the meaning of the words already there.  The meaning that I think you would put upon it would be, that even though the book had not the very highest literary qualifications, or was not written with the greatest literary ability, yet, if its general tenor was immoral, it <Col N="892" /> would be ruled out because its general tenor was immoral.  I do not think the words substantially alter what is already there.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (6).  Line 23 deleted and the words &ldquo;not dissented from by more than one and assented to by at least three members of the Board&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>This amendment, I think, deals in an ingenious and rather happy way with a question which has agitated persons who have criticised this Bill, whether favourably or unfavourably, there being one school of thought which wished that there should be an overwhelming majority before a book should be censored. and another school of thought which considered that a majority should be sufficient.  It seems to me that there has been a happy compromise arrived at.  I think the result of the Seanad amendment is this: That if only three members of the Board of five express their opinion, they must be unanimous before a book is condemned.  If four express their opinion, three out of the four will be sufficient to condemn the book. If five express their opinion, it will require four out of the five to condemn the book: In other words, what this does is, it looks rather at the ones who have not condemned, rather than towards the ones who have condemned&mdash;it looks to see if there is a substantial majority, so to speak, against condemnation.  I think it ought to work out very well in practice, because, of course, in fact if you had a majority of, say, four out of five appearing all through your Bill.  the five might not always meet.  This amendment contemplates the possibility of the whole Board not meeting and the whole Board not coming to a conclusion. There are other amendments which I shall deal with in a moment which are consequential upon this.</P>

There might possibly be a case in which a member, for instance, might be in bed and might still be able to carry out the work of his post.  He might read the book and write a letter saying that in his opinion the book ought to be condemned.  That would be a complete expression of his opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 8 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (7).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  Where a report is proposed to be made by the Board under this section and either one member or two members of the Board has or have not signified any opinion (whether assenting or dissenting) in regard to such proposed report and the circumstances are such that the signification by such member or members of his opinion or their respective opinions (as the case may be) in regard to such proposed report might affect the operation of such proposed report in respect of the power of the Minister to make under this section a prohibition order in consequence thereof, a copy of such proposed report shall be sent by registered post to such member or to each of such two members (as the case may be) and a report shall not be finally made by the Board until after the expiration of seven days from such posting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 8 is to the effect that where only three members have signified an opinion, if they are unanimous the book would be condemned. But under this sub-section <Col N="894" /> they would have to communicate with the other members of the Board and wait for their reply for a week; that is, if the expression of the views of the other members of the Board could possibly affect the result.  For instance, suppose four members meet, and they are unanimous, the view of the fifth, whether he assents or dissents, cannot affect the result, and, in that case, his view would not be asked.  But in the other case, where there are three and, possibly, through inadvertence or other cause, it may be that one member of the Board who has not expressed his view might express a view contrary to the view expressed, it is simply drawing his attention to it and waiting for a week until, if he wishes, he can express an opinion.</P>

      <P>Section 7, sub-section (1).  The word &ldquo;sensational&rdquo; deleted in lines 48-49.</P>
      <P>This deals with the question as to whether a paper gives too much of its space to crime.  As it left the Dáil the Bill contained the words &ldquo;giving too much of its space to sensational matter relating to crime.&rdquo;  In the Seanad they struck out the word &ldquo;sensational,&rdquo; and I do not think it makes any substantial difference. I do not think that the Board of Censors would be very much influenced whether the word &ldquo;sensational&rdquo; was there or not.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a report is proposed to be made by the Board under this section and either one member or two members of the Board has or have not signified any opinion (whether assenting or dissenting) in regard to such proposed report and the circumstances are such that the signification by such member or members of his opinion or their respective opinions (as the case may be) in regard to such proposed report might affect the operation of such proposed report in respect of the power of the Minister to make under this section a prohibition order in consequence thereof, a copy of such proposed report shall be sent by registered post to such member or to each of such two members (as the case may be) and a report shall not be finally made by the Board until after the expiration of seven days from such posting.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be the duty of every Customs official examining the baggage of incoming travellers <Col N="896" /> to exhibit on demand a list of all books which are at the time being the subject of a prohibition order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any reasonable objection to this amendment. A Customs officer carrying out his work at the place of landing, in order that he may know what books are on the list and what are not, must have a copy of the list with him.  It would be impossible for him to carry the names of the books in his head.  If he has that list with him I do not see any harm, if a passenger asks him, in letting him see the list.  He says that a certain book is on the list and the person interested says: &ldquo;Let me verify, it myself,&rdquo; and I do not see any objection to letting the person verify, for himself, whether the book is on the list or not.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (3).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A book or periodical publication containing an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication which advocates or might reasonably be supposed to <Col N="897" /> advocate within the meaning of sub-section (1) of this section one or more of the matters mentioned in that sub-section shall not, by reason only of its containing such advertisement, be deemed itself to advocate any of such matters, provided such advertisement is inserted for reward and is not and could not reasonably be supposed to be itself an advocacy of any such matter.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to Section 16, and that section makes it a punishable offence to print or sell, etc., any book, periodical or publication advocating, or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate, the unnatural prevention of conception. These books which deal with the unnatural prevention of conception, as the House is well aware, are dealt with in two parts of the Bill.  Under Section 6, an Order can be made by the Board of Censors prohibiting their sale.  Once they are dealt with under Section 6 there is hardly need for them to come under Section 16 at all.  What Section 16 does is that it enables a prosecution to be brought in respect of this particular class of book, whether it appears on the Register of prohibited publications or whether it does not.  Now this amendment is to the effect that if there is a mere advertisement in a book or in a periodical which deals with these matters, provided that the advertisement is not in itself an advocacy of these matters, a prosecution will not lie under this section. Of course, a book with an advertisement of that nature or a newspaper with an advertisement of that nature in it can be put upon the Register of prohibited publications if the Censors think it right.  The Censors are not affected in the least bit by this amendment.  This amendment is that if there is a mere advertisement, such as a list of books or an advertisement in another book or periodical, a prosecution would not lie under this section.  That appears to me to be really very good sense, because the mere name of a book appearing in a publisher's circular in a newspaper or at the end. as we often see, of a book would not <Col N="898" /> in itself do any harm.  On the other hand, if it went beyond the question of being a mere announcement, if it were an advertisement that was also an advocacy of this practice, then it would be highly censurable.  Suppose a book dealt with birth control and the advertisement mentioned the name of the book that would be perfectly harmless.  But if it went on further and said this is one of the greatest books that has ever been written on this most important subject and ought to be read by everybody&mdash;something of that kind&mdash;that becomes an advocacy of birth control, and would not be safeguarded from prosecution by the wording of this amendment. Also you will notice it will have to be advertisement for reward.  If people are gratuitously circulating advertisements of this kind they are doing it because they think they are advocating these practices.  I think this cannot do any harm and, on the other hand, if there were a provision such as Deputy Little proposes it might keep out some of what are really desirable papers from this country, for instance, some of the big leading magazines, a big weekly.  One of the best-known weeklies might have in its advertisement columns simply a catalogue of books, some of which dealt with birth control.  Those advertisements would not do any harm, and it would do a certain amount of intellectual harm to the country if some high-class weekly or monthly magazine was kept out of the country.  It must also be borne in mind that the names of those books may be seen, still if you do not get a puff of them you will not know their contents very well, and even if you did I hope we will be able to prevent the sale of them if someone is looking to buy them under the provisions of this Bill.  On the whole, I would ask the Dáil to accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the section with the amendment which I propose in:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A book or periodical publication containing an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication which advocates or might <Col N="899" /> reasonably be supposed to advocate within the meaning of sub-section (1) of this section one or more of the matters mentioned in that sub-section, shall not by reason only of its containing such advertisement, be deemed itself to advocate any of such matters unless a majority of the Board of Censors shall have certified that such advertisement is likely in their judgment to lead to a breach of this section provided such advertisements&rdquo;&mdash;and so on.</P>
    <P>While we recognise that there is something to be said for an amendment such as is here coming from the Seanad, at the same time there is a loophole for a type of book coming in which could do considerable damage, for instance, books by certain extremely well-known writers. The very fact that the names of the book and the author are given has exactly the same effect as the words which the Minister took as an example of offending, namely, an important book by an extremely important author.  The mere advertisement of such books with such a name and the name of the author would do considerable damage.  Put yourselves in the position of, say, the State Solicitor in the country who has been shown a list in some very well-known papers.  He looks at it and has to consider whether he will incur the legal expenses of bringing this before the District Justice when perhaps the thing will be turned down.  He has actually himself to exercise his judgment in the matter. In order to relieve him of the necessity of exercising his judgment I suggest the proper thing is that he should be able to write a letter to the Board of Censors and ask: &ldquo;Do you consider this to come under the section or not?&rdquo;  And he gets a simple reply, yes or no.  If it comes under the section then he is before the wind, he can go into court and his case is made.  If not he does not bring the action at all, and time and money are saved by his not having to take such proceedings.  As to the injury done to any reputable journal, the stronger your Act is and the <Col N="900" /> clearer it is the fairer you are going to be to the reputable journals, because they will take very good care that any such advertisement which would offend in any way would not appear, at any rate, in their Irish editions. I do not think they would have any grievance.  It assists the completion of that amendment if you accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that his amendment would have the effect he thinks it would.  I think his amendment would really allow more advertisements to come in than the amendment which has come down from the Seanad.  His amendment, so to speak, is a laxer amendment, not so strict as the Seanad amendment. It should be borne in mind, as far as Censors are concerned, that if they are called to express their views then they express their views in one particular way.  They send them on and there is an order made.  Those books are dealt with and can be prosecuted altogether apart from Section 16.  They are not dealt with under Section 16.  I do not see the difficulties which will come if it is reported to a Guard and he purchases a newspaper or book which contains one of these advertisements because, of course, it is the Guards who will have to administer this particular section, not the rest of the Act.  If they see something which is objectionable they will simply bring the person into court, but I do not see the advantage of their going up first to the Board of Censors to get an expression of opinion, because if the case is a difficult case, if there is any necessity for the Guards not prosecuting, they will simply send the book up to the Board of Censors and have an expression of opinion upon it.  I think the effect of Deputy Little's amendment would be this. A newspaper, for instance, is seen with an advertisement which is an advocacy of these things.  It might have a big circulation.  It is advisable that they should be prosecuted there and then.  There should not be the delay of going before the Board of Censors, and Section 16, I apprehend, <Col N="901" /> will only be put in force in cases where it is advisable that there should be no delay in making the prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of a list of names of books. There is nothing in this section which confines its operations to a mere list, and I, for one, reading the section would not feel like the Minister for Justice that if, for instance, an advertisement ran like this, &ldquo;So-and-so's latest book, be sure and get it,&rdquo; or something of the sort, that it might be an inducement to get this book which was advocating these practices and would not itself be held to be an advocacy of them.  The example the Minister gave is the one that had occurred to me previously when we were discussing this amongst ourselves. There may be an indirect advocacy which this section would not cover, that is by suggesting to the public to get this particular type of book. It is to try and meet that difficulty that this amendment was put down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seem to have read the section.  The Civic Guard does not interpret anything.  He simply institutes proceedings before a District Justice.  The District Justice will finally decide whether it is in advocacy or not in advocacy.  It has to be decided in court.  The question as to whether a book is in advocacy or not is a matter for the District Justice.  I think that answers Deputy de Valera's point, because if the advertisement is in advocacy, either directly or indirectly, a prosecution could take place, I think, more readily than it could under Deputy Little's amendment. Suppose you get some well-known writer.  There is one well-known writer.  Suppose you take Dr. Stopes.  Everybody knows the <Col N="902" /> name.  &ldquo;Latest book by Dr. Stopes Everybody should get this work.&rdquo; Surely that is advocacy, and that advertisement in court would be held to be advocacy.</P>

Therefore, the wording of my amendment gives a wider scope of judgment than is given in the other amendment.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that this section, as it stands, deals with the advocacy in the advertisement. It is quite clear.  We all understand that if the advertisement directly advocates any of these practices it falls under the section and can be dealt with.  Suppose it does not.  I have used the words indirect advocacy.  I do not know whether they would be accepted by a court.  I am simply indicating that an advertisement could be so drawn up that it would not in itself be an advocacy, but that it would be a suggestion to get the book, as all advertisements are.  I think the court would say it is simply an advertisement for a book; it advertises a book, but there is no suggestion <Col N="903" /> that the matter of the book is of a particular type.  It is simply, like all advertisements, an inducement to the reader to buy that particular book.  I think unless some provision is made, such as that suggested by Deputy Little, by which an advertisement&mdash;to use the words we have been using&mdash;which indirectly advocates that, without apparently contravening the letter of the law, is, in effect, an advocacy, and that the Censorship Board should be called upon to say whether this particular advertisement is in effect an advocacy or not.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he is quite certain about the drafting of this amendment.  The first sentence of it certainly puzzled me when I read it first.  The relative &ldquo;which,&rdquo; occurring in the second line, might be construed to go with book or periodical publication or with advertisement. The whole sense of the amendment is turned upside down if it goes with advertisement.  I do not know what the rule is, but to the ordinary reader the thing sounds ambiguous&mdash;&ldquo;a book or periodical publication containing an advertisement relating to a book or periodical publication which advocates or might reasonably be supposed to advocate.&rdquo;  You go on to say that that book or periodical shall not be deemed to advocate any of such matters provided such advertisement is inserted for reward and is not and could not reasonably be supposed to be itself an advocacy. You could read the amendment in such a way that it could be supposed to be an advocacy.  I do not know whether that is so legally, but to a layman it appears so.</P>

      <P>As far as Deputy Little's amendment is concerned, I suggest to Deputy Little that it really does not add anything at all to the power of the Censors in the Bill.  It would be just as easy to get the Board of Censors to ban a book altogether as to give its certificate. The insertion of the words that he proposes does not really mean anything.  The power of the Censors will be just the same whether his words are there or not.</P>

      <P>I think it simplifies the machinery.  I think it is absurd to put it up to a Guard to consider coming into court when he might be scouted out of court by a District Justice.  I think it is a bad thing to ask a Civic Guard to deal with a matter like that at all.  Obviously, he should refer the book to the Censors.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy Little's suggestion delay the operation of the Guards if not prevent the prosecution?  The Guards take a lot of chances.  A zealous Guard would take the risk of not hitting the mark once or twice.  I think Deputy Little's amendment will make a Guard too careful.  He would not like to write to an august body like the Censorship Board and get a note back saying &ldquo;you are a fool.&rdquo;  He would sooner face his District Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <P>I would like to say that, to my mind, this amendment provides a definite loophole which otherwise these publications may not have for the publication of advertisements of the character which has been described.  There are certain books published, novels <Col N="905" /> and so on, which have these advertisements. In my opinion, if this amendment is carried such books will be allowed a circulation, or at least have more freedom to circulate than they had before this amendment was introduced.  Apart from the question of administration, I think that those papers which are publishing these advertisements will ban them if they feel that their Irish circulation is going to be threatened. Any weakening on that point will mean giving them the thin end of the wedge, and once a loophole is provided for them in any way to get in these advertisements, further breaches will be made in the  which the Minister is putting up.</P>

      <P>If I thought that the interpretation which the Minister has put upon it was a reasonable interpretation I would not oppose it.  If I thought, for instance, that an advertisement such as he has outlined would be dealt with as he has suggested I would be satisfied, but I do not think it would. I think it would be held that an advertisement of that kind was not in itself an advocacy of the matter at all, and it ought to be a simple matter after all to get words that would cover the point the Minister has spoken of.  It is not covered here, I hold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section stands it means that a book that advocates certain unnatural prevention of conception shall be punisable under this section.  I would like the Deputies to get out of their heads that that section has anything to do with the Censors.  For instance, the Censors might condemn a book which might not be condemned by a magistrate, and the other way around, in theory; I do not suppose it would work out in practice, but it might in theory.  Here is what will happen under this section: it will be decided as to whether an advertisement of a book does advocate and help on a particular practice.  If it is a mere advertisement of a book no court would hold that the mere <Col N="906" /> stating in an advertisement that there was such a book would be advocating that practice.  Where you could not, in a particular case, draw the line, it would be very hard to say.  I think it would be rather a pity if certain papers were kept out of this country because they simply had a list of books without in any way stating what the contents of these books were.  I think it would be a great pity that in such cases papers of that kind should be kept out of the country.  I think everybody would agree with me in that. But the Board of Censors are left untrammelled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning of the amendment is that unless the advertisement in itself can be construed as an advocacy, the fact that the book has been advertised is not to be construed as an advocacy of this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the example of the advertisement that the Minister has given us is not an advocacy of the practice.  The fact that the reader is advised to buy such and such a book is not an advocacy of the practice.  From the example that the Minister has given that would not be an advocacy, and therefore would be allowed in.  That was very much the type of one that the amendment wanted to stop.</P>

      <P>I am asking the House to give a Second Reading to this Bill, and, if it is accorded Second Reading, I will later ask the <Col N="914" /> House that all further stages be passed this evening.  This is an ordinary amending Bill to the Principal Act of 1924 which has been brought forward yearly since 1924. The only change is, of course, to extend the date within which guarantees may be given.  The old Act of 1924 limited that period to twelve months and since then legislation has been carried out by annual Acts such as this.  Last year amending legislation was introduced which is carried forward in the Bill now before the House.  Section 3 gives power within the yearly period by publication in &ldquo;Irish Oifigiuil&rdquo; to limit the time for making applications. I announced on the Vote for my own Estimate that in my view the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts had seemed to have outlived their utility.  I based that view on the fact that no new applications were coming forward.  I stated that had new applications come forward, or were likely to come forward, we would have brought in the usual legislation.  Since I spoke, three applications, amounting to a sum of about £4,000, which had been approved by the two Ministers concerned but were waiting completion of official formalities, have taken on new life.  It looked at one time as if one was going to be withdrawn, and we were told that it was very doubtful if the second one would be proceeded with.  The third was in a peculiar position.  We have now been informed that two are likely to be proceeded with.  In addition, there was a very old application which had been received by the Advisory Committee and reported on favourably but it had not at that time been accepted by me.  That was an application from the Limerick Harbour Board where there was considerable quarrelling over two projects they were bringing forward. Within the last few days a deputation has announced that they will proceed with both projects and that the application may be renewed in a new form.  Consequently, for these four cases it will be necessary to have new legislation.  I have had <Col N="915" /> notice in regard to a few other cases.  They are only in the preliminary stages and I cannot say whether they are promising or not. Of the three cases which seemed to be dead two have definitely been revived.  One was reported on long ago and no action was taken, but we were informed last week that it is likely to be proceeded with.  We have word of two others.  Since there is a chance of these coming to something I am now asking for the usual legislation to be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister announced on the discussion of his Estimate that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts in his opinion had outlived their utility we were inclined to agree because of the fact that, so far as we could see, no applications were being made, and of those that had been made none got to the stage of getting the actual guarantee. I think that the fact that the Acts appear to have outlasted their utility is very largely due to the method in which they were operated and to the mentality which the Minister and the Advisory Committee established under the Act brought to bear on the consideration of the applications that were made.  Some time ago, on the 12th April last, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce for information concerning these applications and he informed us that a total of 732 applications were made to him under Section 1, of which 124 were referred to Advisory Committees. Forty-two cases passed the Advisory Committees and were recommended to the Minister to receive the guarantee from the Minister for Finance.  In 18 of these 42 cases guarantees have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion upon the merits of this legislation on his Estimate the Minister gave it as his view that one of the reasons that the Acts had not come up to the expectations formed in relation to them was owing to the fact that it had been discovered that the banks in this country were not unduly harsh in giving facilities to industrialists here and that consequently <Col N="916" /> there was little or no need for legislation of this kind.  I take it that he has modified that view somewhat when he comes forward now to continue the Act for another year after definitely announcing that he would not do so.  I would like to know the reasons that induced him to change his mind.  Presumably, the Advisory Committee that will consider applications now pending will operate on the same principle as those established heretofore, and that principle, as we found on the results, is practically the same as that which animates a board of bank directors when considering applications for loans from customers.  I think that the reason that the Act has proved to be of such little value is that the Advisory Committees did, in fact, come to decisions in the spirit of a board of bank directors, whereas the main reason for their establishment and the reason for the enactment of this legislation was to provide some means by which industrialists, with propositions that were not likely to command the immediate attention of bank directors, would be able to secure capital for the purpose of fixed assets.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that the Minister's interpretation of the attitude of the banks of this country to industrial propositions is wrong.  I think that the view which he held as to their attitude when he introduced the first Trade Loans Guarantee Act was the right one.  I do not think that the experience of the working of the Act has given him any reason for changing his original view although he himself thinks it has.  If the banks in the country are not, to use his own words, unduly restrictive in financing industry, and if the propositions, which it is now proposed to consider under the Acts, are of a sound nature and likely to prove remunerative, then there is no need for the continuing Act, because those interested in those propositions would have no difficulty in getting the accommodation they require from some banking institution here.  It is because the Minister knows that such accommodation would not be easily <Col N="917" /> given that he is again proposing to take advantage of the credit of the State to secure for these persons the capital they require.  I think, however, in introducing this Bill to continue the existing Act for another period of twelve months, the Minister might have given us a review of the various types of cases that arose under it and the reactions of the Advisory Committee to each type of case.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, rather extraordinary that out of 124 applications which were considered by the officials of the Minister's Department to be of such a nature as to merit the establishment of an Advisory Committee to consider them, only 42 actually have received recommendations from one of these committees.  There must be available in the Minister's Department some data which would enable him to form general conclusions as to the type of case that secured the recommendation of the Committee and the type of case that was rejected.  I think it would be of considerable value to Deputies, and to those outside the House who are interested in the question, if they could be given information as to the type of proposition which was covered by the applications which were not recommended for the receipt of the guarantee by the Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>I would like also if the Minister would inform us as to the four applications which were stated to have received a recommendation from the Advisory Committee and to have been under consideration, presumably by the Minister for Finance, on the 17th of April last. Are these four cases identical with the four which the Minister mentioned now, or do they represent other applications which have been since vetoed by the Minister?  I think also he might give us information, if he has it immediately available, as to the five cases which were recommended for the guarantee by Advisory Committees but rejected by the Minister, and why the Minister thought it necessary to reverse the decision of the Advisory <Col N="918" /> Committee that had presumably gone with great care and detail into the merits of the applications.  I do not know if it is the view of the Minister that there is any likelihood of a revival of applications under these Acts during the coming year, or whether it is his intention in introducing this continuing Bill merely to provide for the four or five applications that are at the moment in the hands of his Department. Personally, I think that it is no harm to have the machinery established by the Act in existence, even if it is not availed of, in default of some better system.  It is not objectionable that the Minister should be empowered to pledge the credit of the State to secure capital for any industry which for some special reason was unable to get the capital in any other way.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that as the result of the operation of these Acts some 2,000 additional persons secured employment in the Twenty-six Counties.  I would like if the Minister could add to that information, information as to the number of hands actually engaged in concerns which received guarantees.  In other words we would like to know not merely the number of additional hands who were employed as the result of the operations of the Act, but the number of hands in employment who are retained in employment in consequence of the facilities given by the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I would be in order in raising another question on this Act in relation to the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland.  The State invested £50,000 in that Company for the purpose of facilitating the working of these Acts.  Some months ago I asked the Minister for Finance if the State had received any payment in respect of interest upon that investment during the financial year which concluded in March last.  He informed me that no such payment had been received because the Company had changed the date for closing its books from the 31st December to the 31st March. The payment, if any, should therefore have accrued to the Exchequer <Col N="919" /> by this.  I would like to be informed what it was and the actual dividend received upon the shares.  There has been a considerable number of rumours in circulation relating to the operations of that Company.  It is quite obvious from the figures published in relation to its business during the first year of its operations, that the bulk of its profits were not derived from the giving of loans guaranteed by the Minister under this Section.  In fact it appears that a considerable portion of its subscribed capital, together with a considerable sum borrowed from the National Land Bank out of money made available by the Minister for Finance, was used for the purposes of speculation on the Stock Exchange in London.  That rumour has been freely in circulation and the profits of the Company in the first balance sheet would appear to indicate that it was very successful in these speculations.  It is rumoured that it has not been so successful in its second year and that that was one reason why the accounting period was extended&mdash;in order to have an additional three months to try to recover losses.</P>
    <P>If there is any foundation for the rumours a very serious situation exists, because it is undesirable that State funds should be made available for this purpose.  Such funds would appear to be made available not merely directly by the investment of the £50,000 in the Company but indirectly by the loan given to the National Land Bank for the purpose of financing the activities of concerns under these Acts.  It would, I think, be in the public interest if the Minister could make a statement on the matter now so that rumours would be either definitely scotched or we would know exactly where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the House generally will express satisfaction that this Act is not being brought to a final conclusion, as the Minister originally stated when dealing with the Estimates a short time ago.  The new applications that have come in are a symptom that the Act may still <Col N="920" /> be of some service to the development of industry here.  Perhaps the fact that the Act is about to expire has brought some people to realise that there were some advantages to be obtained for particular industries under the Act.  I think that we are all very sorry that this Act has not proved to be the great success which it was originally anticipated it would be.  It seems an extraordinary thing to ordinary people that there should be such a large sum of money at the service of Irish industrialists which has never been properly availed of.  Even though the Act has not been a complete success, the fact, as the Minister told us, that it found employment for 2,000 extra hands is not a negligible factor, considering the state of unemployment in this country at present.  The only thing that I should like to say to the Minister is, that if he finally determines that this Act is not to remain upon the Statute Book after the period mentioned in this Bill, I hope it will be replaced, by that time, with some other method that will provide ways and means for the setting up and development of Irish industries.  The Minister has told us, of course, that if anything should arise he would come to the Dáil for long-term loans. But there is not much inducement for industrialists to come to the Dáil on conditions such as these.  In speaking on the Estimates, I suggested to the Minister the consideration of certain methods that were adopted by other countries for the development of industries with very great success, and I hope that in the time that will elapse between the passing of this Bill and its expiration the Minister will be able to give consideration to the particular ways and means which have proved a success elsewhere and see if it is not possible to adopt them with equal success here.</P>

      <P>Any other Deputy than Deputy Lemass might have spoken in the terms which he used regarding either the method of procedure under this type of legislation or the mentality of the Ministers <Col N="921" /> or the Committee who advised them, but he had the advantage during the sittings of the Economic Committee of listening to the history of the cases that had been given a guarantee of money by the Advisory Committee or, at a later stage, by the two Ministers concerned.  I am not going to go into that further, except to say that I am going to hold what the Deputy has said in storage for him against the time when I may be coming with certain of these Trade Loans cases to this House and asking that some further help should be given, or that certain other action should be taken with regard to them. I still remain of the opinion that I expressed on the last day about the banks.  It could not possibly be shaken by such a statement as that made by Deputy Lemass, that he thinks that my interpretation of the banks' attitude is wrong, notwithstanding that I have the information to go on, and that the Deputy obviously has not, arising out of all the cases which were put up to the Advisory Committee and were refused by them, and the knowledge we had as to how many previous applications to the banks had either been refused or sympathetically treated by them.  The Deputy believed that the main reason that the Act has proved to be of little value is that the Advisory Committee deals with the applications in the spirit of a board of directors.  If he means that they deal with applications in the spirit in which he imagines boards of directors of Irish banks deal with applications, then he is entirely wrong.  If he means that they deal with them as any body of directors, thinking about the expenditure of other people's money, weighing the chances, and taking the chances which they have to, in the recommendations that they put up to Ministers behind them, and who accept full responsibility for what the Committee does, he is wrong in both statements. They do not deal with them in the spirit of directors, as he interprets the word &ldquo;directors,&rdquo; because directors have not people to fall back upon to take the responsibility <Col N="922" /> off their shoulders.  I am not blaming the Advisory Committee in saying that.  They are only set up for the purposes of making recommendations. The responsibility has to be shared equally between the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
      <P>As to the type of cases rejected, I have not an analysis here at the moment.  I had a very complete analysis prepared at one time when the matter seemed to be relevant, but I have not it here at the moment. I can say, however, that, leaving out the working capital cases, the outstanding examples of rejection were based mainly upon the previous history of the applicant.  One might say that in nearly every case, outside the working capital cases, the main reason for rejection was the fact that the applicants did not commend themselves to the Advisory Committee as being people likely to run a successful business.  The conclusion to be drawn from the whole thing is, what I have often stated here, that industries are not going to be started by merely scattering money around or providing money.  One has to wait until some sort of industrial tradition, one might almost say, grows up, certainly until a little more industrial enterprise appears in the country.  Industries do not crop up by having money lavishly flowing round and hoping that people who have been in business before will be successful at a second attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list quoted by the Deputy is an old list.  The list I have before me up to the 1st July of this year shows that three applications recommended by the Advisory Committee and approved by the two Ministers are awaiting the completion of legal formalities.  Some cases were passed by the Advisory Committee, but did not pass one or other of the Ministers.  I have four cases where recommendations have been made by the Advisory Committee, but the recommendations were not accepted by myself.  I do not want to identify these cases, but I can say that, very often, the Advisory Committee sends me up applications which are provisional, or which, at any rate, are founded upon <Col N="923" /> something being done, and when I approach the applicant company or individual to see if they will accept what, for my safeguarding, the Committee recommends to be put in, they refuse to accept it, and the matter lies there.  That certainly is the case with at least one of the four. In another case, the application was founded, and was passed by the Advisory Committee because it was so founded, on a special piece of business which seemed likely to accrue to a particular firm.  The season for that particular piece of business passed, and the firm's ordinary business would not have stood the imposition of further capital liabilities upon it, and there was no chance of our recovering the money, and it would only have driven the firm deeper into the mire. The other two were for small amounts, and the reason for their being held up does not immediately present itself to my mind.</P>
    <P>The two thousand extra hands would cover most of the people employed. In eighteen cases guarantees were given, and in one of these the loan was repaid, and I am not counting it at the moment in the tot of people employed.  Of the other seventeen it can be said that eleven or twelve were either places that had closed down completely and were reopened, and, therefore, the full tot of employees comes under the heading of extra hands employed, or else had got to the point where they were closed down and were only holding a few men to keep the machinery and plant going.  In three or four cases there was experimental work going on. It looked as if there was danger ahead to the firms, but the situation was righted by the guarantee.  Of the two cases that were prominently before the public, Alesbury Bros. would be one where employment was still going on and the people were retained.  The case of the Irish Glass Bottle Company was complicated by the fact that there were previously two or three firms engaged, and all but one closed down as there was an amalgamation of <Col N="924" /> work.  I cannot give a statement as to the number of people kept in employment, as well as those counted as extra hands.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make any comment about the Irish Investing Corporation at present, as it is not relevant to this Bill.  I am not dealing with that, and I do not intend to say anything about it.  I am merely asking for the passage of this Bill, not because I have changed my mind about the banks, and because I think there are four cases which the banks, being more harshly disposed than I have previously thought they would be, would not finance and that then I am coming in.  I did say on the Estimate that, in the main, the cases financed were cases a bank would be ready to finance, and the cases which a bank would turn down were, in the main, cases which my Committee would turn down.  There are exceptions. Notably, I should say the Alesbury Brothers case was a very definite exception.  Although I believe, from my knowledge of the first three cases to which I referred, that the banks would have come in in two at any rate, and would have come in, to a certain extent, in the Limerick Harbour Commissioners' case; nevertheless, I think, just because of there being a little added difficulty which a bank might not face, and will face once there is a Government guarantee, it is well to have this Act.  The applications that I speak of as showing signs of revival may not come to anything, but, as long as they are there, I would not care to have them lapse, simply because there is no legislation to deal with them, and no money to apply to them.  Inasmuch as the Dáil, year after year, voted this sum of round about one million and made it available for this purpose, I think the Dáil is not being asked to do very much in passing this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the genesis of this Bill is pretty well known to Deputies.  By Article X. of the Treaty it is provided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of police forces and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1920 provided that claims of officers to compensation should be determined by a statutory board whose decision was to be final and conclusive.  The Treaty, itself, did not provide machinery for determining claims under Article X, but only, as it were, laid down the measure of compensation, which was to be not less favourable than that accorded under the Act of 1920. The Government determined, instead of dealing with claims departmentally, to set up a Committee, presided over by a judge, to hear <Col N="928" /> and advise on those claims.  That Committee was set up, and Judge Wylie presided over it, and it dealt with a considerable number of claims.  Although it was only an Advisory Committee the Government had to make up their mind at the beginning how they were to act in regard to the recommendations that came from that Committee, and the Government came clearly to the conclusion that in the case of such a Committee, with a judge of the High Court as Chairman, they had no alternative but to accept the recommendations of that Committee. The position, therefore, was that although the Committee was not actually a Statutory Committee, whose decisions were final and conclusive, the Government accepted and acted upon all the decisions of that Committee, whether they liked them or not.</P>
    <P>After a time litigation arose and two points were contested in the courts: (1) as to whether Article X of the Treaty, as ratified by the Constitution, conferred justiciable rights, and (2) whether the treatment of bonus in assessing compensation on the basis of a Minute issued by the British Treasury in March, 1922, before the transfer of service, was correct.  The Supreme Court here held that (1) there were no justiciable rights, and (2) that the treatment of bonus which had been adopted, based upon that particular circular of the British Treasury, was correct.  There were certain points about the bonus which were agreed upon between the litigants, and only those two other matters I have mentioned remained for decision by the court.</P>
    <P>After the Supreme Court had given its decision the litigants applied to the Privy Council for leave to appeal, and leave to appeal was granted.  That matter was discussed to some extent here in the Dáil, when the Lynham and Butler case was being dealt with.  As Deputies are aware a Bill was introduced here which became an Act for the purpose of preventing the Privy Council from upsetting a judgment of the Supreme Court here in the <Col N="929" /> Lynham and Butler case, and the view was clearly taken that in that case the Privy Council had acted wrongly in giving leave to appeal. The late Minister for Justice when he was dealing with the Lynham and Butler case referred to the Wigg and Cochrane case and said that we had accepted the view that the Wigg and Cochrane case was one which might be heard by the Privy Council.  We took that view, because, first, it was quite obvious that as the officials were British officials who had been transferred to us the British Government had an interest in them. Secondly, we were perfectly satisfied that we were treating these officers fairly, and for that reason without going very deeply into the whole question of the position of the Privy Council, we were satisfied to let the case go to the Privy Council so that the British Government who were interested in those officers, who had been their officers, should be satisfied that they were obtaining fair treatment.</P>
    <P>The Privy Council, after the hearing, delivered an extraordinary and incorrect judgment, a judgment believed by us to be baseless and incorrect, a judgment believed by the British Government, at any rate, not to carry out what was the intention of the signatories to the Treaty. The matter was referred again, under special powers which existed, by the British Government to the Privy Council.  The second board of the Privy Council which was set up confirmed the judgement of the first on new grounds.  We were no more satisfied with the judgment of the second board than we were with the judgment of the first, and we stated, so far as we were concerned, that we were not prepared to pay a single penny out of the Exchequer that we were not liable to pay as a result of the judgment of our own Supreme Court.  The whole case, therefore, was left in a somewhat unsatisfactory position, and negotiations ensued between the Government of the Free State and the British Government.  The result of <Col N="930" /> these negotiations was embodied in an agreement supplementing and interpreting Article X. of the Treaty. The effect of the agreement is that the extra compensation which certain officers retiring before March last receive in consequence of the judgment of the Privy Council is borne by the British Government. It is provided in the agreement and in the Bill that a Statutory Board be set up, a Committee constituted approximately in the same way as the Wylie Committee, with a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court as Chairman, with two civil servants representing the Minister for Finance, and two civil servants representing the staffs, that all claims and applications for compensation should be referred to that Committee, that the decision of the Committee should be final and conclusive, and that the decisions already given by the Wylie Committee should be confirmed and should be incapable of being re-opened. It provides for certain other matters which might have been in doubt along the lines which had already been adopted by the Wylie Committee.  It provides, for instance, that an officer who has received promotion in the normal course shall be entitled to compensation on his promoted salary, on the salary of his new position.  The Wylie Committee had acted on that.  On the other hand, where an officer receives exceptional treatment, his compensation will be based upon his original salary.  It provides that where the officer is required to perform duties which are not analogous to and are unreasonable compared with his duties at the time of transfer he shall be entitled to discharge terms. The Wylie Committee had already acted on the principle which is embodied in Section 14, sub-section 2, of the Bill in that respect.</P>
    <P>On the whole therefore what this Bill does is it restores us to the position, so far as the practical aspect of the matter is concerned, that existed before Judge Wylie retired from his Chairmanship of the Committee <Col N="931" /> and before the Committee ceased its operations, with the difference that the Government, which merely accepted all decisions of the Committee as binding on it and accepted them as a matter of policy, will now be legally bound to accept them.  In the course of the negotiations which led to the introduction of this Bill and to the conclusion of the agreement the Government has been in close touch with representatives of the transferred officers, and the Bill as it stands is a Bill which has the approval of the representatives of the transferred officers.  The Government regard it as a satisfactory Bill.  It imposes no principles which involve charges which were not already accepted by the Wylie Committee, and relieves us of the possibility of expensive indulgence in litigation.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the purpose of the Bill was properly explained.  I read in great detail through all the debates that took place on this particular Bill in the Seanad, and I tried to gather from the arguments, pro and con, what was intended to be accomplished by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments here, to a certain extent, go to taking away the one critical objection which we had on this side of the House.  That was that poverty itself should be sufficient to take away from people their children without their being consulted. That has been remedied and it is certainly an improvement.  If the parents do consent and if children are sent to these schools they can be discharged subsequently if the Minister is satisfied that the parents are in a position to support them.  The proposer of this Bill in the Seanad stated that one need not be fearful of the consequences of the coming into operation of this Bill, as many people would not be affected, because the industrial schools were so filled at the present time that they would not be able to take at the outside more than 200 or 300 children.  Are we introducing a Bill here to look after the poverty-stricken people to the extent only of 200 or 300 children? I contend that if we are going to go far enough to accomplish something we should make provision for the taking care of children of poverty-stricken people all over the country.  I must say that I feel in full agreement with the sentiments expressed by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power on this matter.  This is not going to meet the situation.  It is <Col N="934" /> going to alleviate, if you like, the hardships in a certain number of cases.  I for one would press that the Minister should give us some outline now as to the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we separate, there are two sins of omission with which I wish to charge the Executive Council.  I hope during the recess they will do penance.  As far back as September an interDepartmental Committee reported on the road traffic.  On the 6th June last, Mr. McGilligan, Minister for Industry and Commerce, replying for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, said that he hoped to bring in a measure to deal with the report before the end of this Session.  Nothing has been done, and these buses are doing a tremendous amount of damage.  They are killing people and making the highways impossible for the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they are detected and <Col N="936" /> charged they are confronted with very small fines.  Whenever they kill people the magistrates invariably refuse information.  No doubt the magistrates sift these cases as well as they can.  But it seems to me that it is very hard to believe that the corpse is always to blame. Except something is done to restrain the drivers of these buses there will be much more loss of life.  I see that a man was killed to-day in Bray. The other point I wish to bring before the President is that I hope during the recess he will turn over in his mind and see what is to be done with the report of the alleged grievances of ex-Servicemen.  He told Deputy Redmond that he had not time yet to digest that report, but I hope he will consider it and when we meet again that some endeavour to meet their grievances will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Murphy in what he has said about the buses, to the extent of repeating what I once referred to here, and that is the urgent necessity there is for the Government insisting on vehicles plying for hire having at least a third-party insurance. Only recently a case occurred in Milltown where a man was killed.  His widow got a judgment in the court against the owners of the bus but the bus owners had no property and the widow was unable to get compensation of any kind from them.  I think where the Department gives a licence to a man to drive a bus that if that man is not prepared for his own protection to insure his bus and to carry a third-party insurance, that the duty is placed on our shoulders to protect the public against these buses by insisting that they carry a third-party insurance for the benefit of the people who may be killed or may suffer through an accident caused by them.  I would like to press that very strongly, because at the present time there is an urgent necessity to have this matter attended to.  It is usual for the Department to make regulations and it would be within <Col N="937" /> their competence to refuse to grant licences to any bus owner who has not a third-party insurance policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I would like to refer to and I mention it rather with diffidence.  I wish to make it clear that I do not mention it for, as it were, Party purposes.  I would like to remind the President of the position of the poor in the City of Dublin who need home help.  I am not an exception as a Deputy here or as a citizen in knowing the condition of a great number of the poor of Dublin.  But I do know numbers of people, able-bodied men with wives and families, who cannot, under present conditions, get the sustenance that they should get to keep themselves and their wives and families from starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill that was before the House earlier to-day had been passed, it might have been possible to give these families the relief that is their due.  As that Bill was not passed, it occurs to me that perhaps the President could use his influence with the Poor Law authorities in Dublin in this matter of relief.  I do not know if it would be possible for the President to tell the Poor Law Commissioners to go ahead and do what is proper in giving relief to these people and their families and that later on legislation would be passed to give the Commissioners the statutory authority which they seem to lack at the moment.  At any rate I would urge that the President would consider the matter and would call in the Poor Law authorities of Dublin to seek a way out by which something might be done for these people.  Usually the various charitable societies look upon this time of the year as a time when work is more easily obtained than in the winter and as a time when the hardships are not so great as in the winter.  Therefore it appears these charitable organisations close down at this season of the year and limit very much the relief they give, so that these charitable avenues are closed to the poor just now.  I suggest that if the Poor Law <Col N="938" /> authorities get some promise that legislation would follow that would relieve them in this matter and give them the necessary statutory authority they might find a way out to meet the urgent need there is in all parts of the city at the moment for sustenance for those who are unemployed, the workless and the foodless families.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if this matter were considered irrespective of Party. I did not raise the matter in any Party spirit.  If the President would take counsel with the Poor Law authorities and give his attention to it something might be done that might redound to the credit of the Government and of the Poor Law officials.  Something in this direction is very badly needed.  If I did not feel that it was a matter of such pressing need I would not have raised it at this hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy has charged us with only two sins of omission.  I would be very pleased if there were only two sins of commission charged against me.  I think the Deputy will admit that a considerable amount of legislation has been introduced during the year, that the Dáil has been in continuous session for a very considerable time, and that even to-day quite a number of Bills were introduced which we cannot get beyond the First Stage. It so happens, as Deputies are generally aware, that the early spring and summer recess is mainly devoted to financial business, and that the introduction of financial business here in the House does not by any means represent the amount of time absorbed in giving consideration to the introduction of that business before it reaches the stage when it is brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two matters to which Deputy Murphy referred&mdash;the regulation of traffic and the control of the speed of buses, and so on&mdash;have been engaging attention for a very considerable period.  Recommendations have been quite recently before the Executive Council, and it is hoped&mdash;I do not think I would be justified in saying more than that&mdash;<Col N="939" /> to introduce in the autumn session a Bill dealing with the matter of the regulation of traffic, and so on.  I speak from recollection, but the subject mentioned by Deputy Briscoe was one of those which was dealt with in the report which was under the consideration of the Executive Council.  However, I cannot say more than that proposals are at present before the Departments concerned, and they have actually got a first hearing before the Executive Council in connection with the matter of traffic.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second matter mentioned by Deputy Murphy, a report by the Commission of Inquiry into the claims made by ex-Servicemen was made last autumn.  As I have stated already in the House, various departments of State were circularised on the subject matter of that report.  Replies have come in from all these departments with the exception of one.  I anticipate that within the next month or two we shall have a reply from that department. That is the department which is most concerned with financial business.  It would have been unreasonable to have expected a reply from that department before the financial business of the country was dealt with.  Therefore it is a matter on which I do not expect to be able to make any announcement before the autumn session.</P>
    <P>The third matter, mentioned by Deputy O'Kelly, is a matter which has engaged the personal attention of the Minister for Local Government, to my own knowledge, for the last twelve months or more.  During the winter the Minister had some sort of working arrangement with the Poor Law authorities in the city and some of the charitable organisations in the city, with a view to giving more assistance than had been the practice.  I think the Deputy will admit that the Bill that was brought forward here to-day, while it might make it legally possible for more extended operations on the part of the Poor Law authorities, <Col N="940" /> suffered from one inherent weakness, and that is, that the Poor Law authorities in the City and County of Dublin would be called upon to spend money which had not been levied in the year.  As the Deputy knows, having had experience of public administration, the rate-payer's life is but for twelve months, and the ratepayers of to-day would get an advantage which would have to be paid for by the ratepayers in the next year.  Next year's ratepayers would have to bear the cost for next year and portion of whatever cost would be incurred this year.</P>
    <P>I admit that a good case has been made by the Deputy&mdash;and a good case can be made&mdash;in respect of able-bodied persons unable to get employment. I will undertake to see the Minister for Local Government on the matter.  As the Deputy is aware, the real difficulty arises where money has not been provided for the purpose.  I will undertake, at any rate, to see what can be done and to see if provision can be made for those in need of it.  The law ought not to stand in the way of providing relief for necessitous cases. Even though the law may be against us on the point, I think that no administrator, no judge would hold that one would not be justified, even if the law did not permit, in providing relief for necessitous cases.  I am glad the Deputy has emphasised that this is not a matter that calls for political treatment.  It is one of many matters that does not call for political treatment.  It ought to be the concern and the duty of all Parties in the State to lend aid in solving problems such as it presents, and which, unfortunately, are common to humanity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether several inspectors visited and inspected and reported in favour of the acquisition of the holding of Mr. John Mansfield, on the estate of William Hopkins, Lyrogue, Co. Leix (Record No. S/2406), where Mr. Mansfield resides, and if he will state what other land he owns or occupies; whether the Commissioners have already decided to acquire these lands and disallowed the objection lodged by Mr. Mansfield; whether he can state the cause of the delay on the part of the Commissioners in dealing with these lands; whether a division scheme has so far been prepared by the Commissioners; and, if so, when same is likely to be put into operation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister replied as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission proposed to resume the holding in question and served notice on the <Col N="942" /> tenant of their intention to apply to the Judicial Commission for an order authorising resumption of the holding.  The tenant objected and his objection was heard by the Land Commission in court and allowed, and accordingly, the proceedings for resumption came to an end.  Mr. Mansfield lives in Co. Kerry.  He is tenant of holdings of 44 acres on the estate of A. V. Carden and 34 acres on the estate of Ellen Wilson, both of which are pending for sale under the Act of 1923.  He is also the registered owner of a holding of 4 acres.</P>
    <P>I considered this reply unsatisfactory, because I have been in communication for a considerable period with the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  As a result of a communication addressed to the then Minister for Lands and Agriculture, I received a reply to a very definite question regarding these lands.  I got the reply in April, 1927.  Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary told me that the objection lodged by the owner was allowed, whereas on the 22nd April, 1927, the then Minister for Lands and Agriculture sent this reply to me: &ldquo;This holding will be retained by the Land Commission under the provisions of Section 28 (6) and an objection by the tenant was disallowed by the Land Commission.&rdquo; I consider these replies contradictory and conflicting.  To me, at any rate, they are inexplicable.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the conflicting nature of the Minister's reply with the statement made to me yesterday.</P>
    <P>The lands in this case have been the subject of considerable agitation extending over a period of at least ten years.  This holding is one of two holdings on the estate of William Hopkins, Lyrogue.  There is another holding on the same estate at present occupied by a Mr. Thompson. In the same area there was other untenanted land in the name of Mr. John Duigan, but it has since <Col N="943" /> been acquired and divided.  I understand that the intention of the Land Act of 1923 was to acquire untenanted land in any area where the Commissioners or their advisers were satisfied acute congestion existed. The Land Commission inspectors&mdash;I do not know how many of them, but the Parliamentary Secretary, if he so desires, can give us the number of occasions when they visited these areas&mdash;inspected the lands one after the other.  They visited the lands occupied by Mr. Mansfield, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Duigan.  As far as I know, they reported in favour of the acquisition of the lands for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>
    <P>During the Sinn Féin agitation a number of local people were arrested and charged in the local courts. As a result of the unrest a Dáil Land Commission Judge, now functioning as a Land Commissioner under the Free State, visited the district, and after hearing the case on behalf of the people looking for the land and, I assume, after hearing the other side of the case, he decided that the land should be acquired for the relief of congestion. The individuals who were looking for a division of the land put the case in the hands of a solicitor.  I believe all the documents and all the arguments that could be put forward on behalf of the people looking for the land are on the files of the Land Commission.  After the ordinary inspectors had made enquiries from the large number of uneconomic holders, the chief resident inspector, at the request of the Commissioners, visited the area.  I was informed by that gentleman that the Commissioners intended to acquire the land.  This is also clearly indicated in the letter that I have quoted.</P>
    <P>I understand that in cases of acquisition the owner has the right to object only on one occasion against the lands being acquired.  He did object and the objection was disallowed so far as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is concerned, <Col N="944" /> but allowed so far as the Parliamentary Secretary's reply is concerned. I have been watching this case very closely.  I was born and reared in the parish where these untenanted lands are.</P>
    <P>The real reason why I have decided to follow up this case is this. Certain very influential friends of the landowners concerned have boasted on more than one occasion that they would upset the desires of the Land Commission and would see to it&mdash;so far as I can now see they have succeeded&mdash;that the intentions of the Commissioners would not be carried out in regard to the acquisition of these lands.  The landowners concerned in this and in other cases have stated repeatedly and openly in the parish and surrounding districts that a certain very influential organisation, which has its headquarters not very far from where we are sitting, was taking a deep interest in the welfare of the landowners concerned and would use all its influence in seeing that the desires of the Land Commission were upset.  In the case of Miss Winters, which I previously referred to, in the same parish the Commissioners also decided to acquire the land.  An objection was lodged and was disallowed but for some reason which I cannot understand another objection was allowed to be lodged and on the second occasion it was allowed. The same thing occurred in Mr. Mansfield's case and, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, a Deputy who takes a keen interest in another case in the same area boasted that he would see that the lands were left with the owner, notwithstanding the fact that he has two other farms in addition. I was not inclined originally to pay much attention to the statement made in some parts of the country regarding the influence of this international organisation, but from what I can see, the landowners have considerable influence in regard to questions of this kind.  I can only conclude, so far as this and other cases are concerned, that their influence has been very effective and <Col N="945" /> has been the cause of preventing the Commissioners from acquiring the land which in the ordinary course should be acquired for the relief of congestion in the area.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, I am sure, regard it as his duty to refute any allegations of that kind. I raised the question in order that he may have an opportunity of giving the House and the people concerned in cases of this kind the real reasons why the land was not acquired as originally intended.  I want to know whether the files disclose the number of uneconomic holders under £10 valuation in the townlands of Barraghaum, Lyrogue, Coolnagown, Harristown and Baurivina, which are within two miles radius of the lands referred to.  That information, I believe, is on the files; at least, it should be if the inspectors did their duty, as I presume they did, when reporting. Therefore the number of uneconomic holders with a valuation of under £10 in that area must be on the files and should be given to the House.  If the number is too small to decide in favour of the acquisition of the land I am prepared to listen to reason.  I know the area and the number of uneconomic holders that reside within two miles of the lands referred to, and I know that they are all hardworking, industrious people who would greatly benefit by additions to their uneconomic holdings.  If the Act is to be administered in the spirit in which it was introduced and passed, when sponsored by the Minister for Agriculture, I say that there is a good case for the acquisition of these lands.  At any rate, I raised the matter because I regard the reply given to me yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary as extremely unsatisfactory and contradictory.  On that question I should say that about three months ago a gentleman who is a great friend of the landowner referred to&mdash;Mr. Mansfield&mdash;stated emphatically, on an authority that I cannot put my finger on, that the lands of Mr. Mansfield would not be acquired, and that he knew that well, <Col N="946" /> and also that the same influence which prevented the lands of Miss Winters from being acquired would also succeed in this case.</P>
    <P>I want to know the date the Commissioners allowed the objection when it was heard a second time. That would give me a clue as to whether information of a confidential nature can get into the hands of landowners before it can get into those of Deputies.  I have already drawn attention to the fact that information which should be in the hands of Deputies before it gets to localities in the country leaks out. I will give this piece of advice to the Parliamentary Secretary: pull down the blinds of the Land Commission and tell the people of the country in a straightforward way that you do not intend to pursue the operations of the Act of 1923 any further.  That may, perhaps, serve a useful purpose.  It may give the Land Commission an opportunity of overhauling the Commission as a whole, and of preventing cases of the kind mentioned by Deputy Boland from cropping up again.  That is a case which shows that there is a state of disorganisation in that Department.  At any rate, be honest with the people and tell them the reasons for holding up the operations of the Act.  If you are standing for impartial administration I say that it is your duty to prevent influential friends of landowners of the type referred to from interfering with the impartial administration of the Act.</P>

      <P>This case is really very simple.  It appears to be complicated only because the Deputy failed to understand the reply which I gave him yesterday.  The Minister for Agriculture in his letter to the Deputy was perfectly accurate.  He said that steps were being taken to retain the holding.  The Deputy apparently is unaware that under the Act of 1923 tenanted land can only be acquired by, first of all, notifying the tenant of the particular holding that the Land Commission <Col N="947" /> proposed to retain that holding for the relief of congestion.  On the 6th July, 1926, Mr. Mansfield was served with notice to the effect that the Land Commission proposed to retain the holding for the purpose of relieving the congestion existing in that area.  Mr. Mansfield objected to the retention of the holding.  His objection was subsequently heard in court and disallowed by the Commissioners. On the 14th January, 1927, a notice was issued to the tenant, Mr. Mansfield, stating that the Land Commission proposed applying to the Judicial Commissioner for an order authorising them to resume this holding.  The order was granted on the 28th May, 1928.  Notice was served on Mr. Mansfield subsequently, stating that the Commissioners proposed to resume the holding.  The tenant, by virtue of his statutory right, objected to the resumption of the holding.  His objection was heard in court and was allowed.</P>

      <P>The 12th December, 1928.  The Deputy may not be aware that in acquiring tenanted land under the Land Act of 1923 it is necessary that these two stages should be gone through.  Under the Amending Act of 1927 the first stage has been dispensed with, and when we now decide on resuming land the tenant has only the right of objection on the resumption proceedings. At all events when this case was dealt with under the Act of 1923 the tenant was quite within his statutory rights in objecting at both stages of the proceedings.  It is true, as the Deputy has stated, that there has been a good deal of local agitation in connection with the farm.  In 1921, as a matter of fact, the case was heard before the Dáil Courts and strange to say, the claimants for the land on that occasion did not put in an appearance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On both occasions they failed to put in an appearance before the Dáil Court, so that the Deputy does not appear to have been supplied with very accurate information regarding the proceedings there.  It seems rather strange that if they were so keen on getting the land they failed to put in an appearance before the court in 1921.  Now, as to the reasons why the objection of the tenant was allowed, Mr. Mansfield lives in Water-ville, in Kerry.  He carries on a butchering business and in the conduct of this business he is assisted by his second son.  This farm comprises 121 acres and is worked by his eldest son, who is married and has a wife and four children.  It is his sole means of livelihood and is utilised by him primarily for grazing purposes.  So far as we can understand from our inspectors when the father runs short of cattle in his shop, the son sometimes supplies cattle from the farm in Lyrogue. The son pays the rates and rent of the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy will admit that a farm of 120 statute acres is not too much for one man.  It is true that he does not live on the farm but he has a house quite near.  There was no house on the farm and he had to go into the open market to buy one.  I think the Deputy must admit that a farm of 120 statute acres is not very large, just sufficiently large to enable a man to make a living on it.  The case has been reported on several times by inspectors.  As a matter of fact before the Commissioners gave their last decision in this case they send down an inspector to report on it specially.  It was <Col N="949" /> as a result of his report and as a result of inquiries made in other directions as well that the Commissioners decided not to resume the holding.</P>

      <P>There is no very acute congestion in that area, congestion as it is understood according to the interpretation of the Land Act.  I think the Commissioners were perfectly right in deciding, in this particular case, to allow Mr. Mansfield's objection.  After all, the farm is not by any means a large one.  It is just large enough to enable the tenant to make a living on it.  The Deputy has alleged that certain influences were utilised in connection with this particular case.  The Deputy made a similar charge in connection with another case some time ago and he will possibly recollect that he had to withdraw his charge subsequently.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Deputy, and the House as well, that <Col N="950" /> there was absolutely no influence brought to bear on the Commissioners in connection with the case. It was decided on its merits, and I think that on its merits the Commissioners were perfectly justified in allowing the objection raised by Mr. Mansfield to the acquisition of the farm.  It is one of the cases which has been investigated most exhaustively. Several inspectors have reported on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first inspector undoubtedly did recommend that the land should be retained to enable the Land Commission to make inquiries whether it was a suitable farm for the purpose of relieving congestion.  Inspectors in their subsequent reports recommended that it should not be acquired, because they stated that the son of the owner was using the land in the best interests of the country and that the farm was small enough if he were to make a livelihood out of it.  I do not think that Deputy Davin is really serious in trying to base a charge against the Land Commission on a case like this.  I think he will admit himself that the Commission would have acted unfairly if they took the land from the tenant.  I think that Deputy Davin knows perfectly well that the farm is small enough and that it is the son's sole means of livelihood.  I think he will also admit that in the counties of Leix and Offaly a farm of 120 acres is not too large if a man is to make a livelihood out of it.</P>
