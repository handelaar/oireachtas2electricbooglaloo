      <P>I desire to call attention to the very grave injustice that would be done to a small farmer or occupier who takes out a £2 licence and shoots a share of game on a Sunday and sends that game to be sold in the ordinary way with his farm produce.  Of course we are going to allow nobody to buy game except those with a game dealer's licence. We are going to hand this business altogether to the middleman, and I think that is grossly unfair.  I have in mind several small farmers in my constituency who have taken out a £2 licence and who shoot a share of game on their own and their neighbour's land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I am correctly following Deputy Corry because he seemed to be raising the whole question at issue not alone on this amendment but on other parts of the Bill, and that is: Is game to be preserved or not?  Deputy Corry talks about the small farmers and occupiers of small holdings.  There are in every county in Ireland two <Col N="362" /> or three, and in the larger counties probably more, men who devote most of their time to shooting game.  They get permission to shoot over a certain amount of land from the farmers owning the land.  Sometimes they take permission where they have not got it.  It would be almost impossible in a case where a man of that kind is selling game to prove on what land he shot it. These people go but to shoot partly because they enjoy shooting but mainly in order to fill their bag and incidentally fill their pockets.  They will exterminate game in this country unless they are checked.  We have to make up our minds to that.</P>
      <P>That will be the position if the people whose advocate Deputy Corry seems to be are not checked. I have known some of these people to be in good positions.  Very often they have a motor bicycle or a motor car, and they go around shooting. If these people are to be encouraged, then the game bird will become as extinct as the wolf or the eagle. Those people spend no money on game preservation, and you cannot have game unless money is spent upon preserving and encouraging it. Deputy Corry seems to think that particular type of person should be encouraged.  The Deputy talked last night about this being a landlord's Bill.  The only people who have preserved game and who spent money upon preserving it and who gave employment in trying to preserve it were the landlords in the past.  It is because in many districts that the landlords have ceased to do so or have left the country that a Bill of this kind is necessary.  If you are going to encourage the men who are not mostly small farmers and whom Deputy Corry is most anxious to help, you may as well not proceed with this Bill but rather repeal all the game laws and so allow game to become extinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Addressing myself to the amendment. I would like to point out to the Minister that if he resists it he really does a very substantial injustice to the people who have taken out game dealers' licences.  If the <Col N="363" /> individual who goes out shooting and who has permission to shoot over land is to go around hawking and peddling the game he has got from door to door, he has a great advantage over the man who takes out a game dealer's licence, who has to occupy specified premises, who has to pay rates and who has all the normal expenditure necessary for the upkeep of a commercial establishment. By resisting this amendment the Minister very much reduces the value of a game dealer's licence and I suppose it will not be issued for nothing and that some fee will be payable.  The Minister by resisting the amendment also makes the path of the poacher more easy.  It will be hard for the Civic Guard finding a man selling a hare or any game bird in a country town to prove that that game was not shot on land over which the man had a right to shoot game.  If that man has to sell to the game dealer the dealer holding the licence will, for his own protection, make careful enquiry, far more careful and greater enquiry than if the man were to sell to somebody who would be putting the hare or the pheasant in the pot next day.  I think the amendment strengthens the Bill and I would like the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted it might be hard on people who might want to sell duck or snipe or such birds except to a person who had a game dealer's licence.  But if the amendment were to be limited to pheasants, woodcock, partridge, grouse and hares, I think it would meet the case.  Everyone recognises that game in this country at present is practically extinct; unless something is done in some way to re-stock the country there will soon be no game left.  Persons will go out at daylight in the morning and shoot what they like, and sell what they shoot to the first person who will buy it off them.  There is no person who will be so foolish as to spend money on hatching eggs and stocking the country with game if the present conditions continue.  I <Col N="364" /> say without hesitation that pheasants are practically extinct, and so are partridges, in this country.</P>
      <P>I have myself done a great deal of shooting, but I have not fired at a partridge for the past three seasons because there were none to fire at. A Game Protection Bill is of no use when there is no game to protect. We must begin now to stop the destruction of young birds that is going on, and if we offer a reward to persons who will bring in scald crows, magpies, and hawks, and those other things that are killing the young birds it will be a step in the right direction.  The professional poachers have succeeded in leaving this country without any game.  I say that the game shooting in the country is one of the biggest assets we have got, and it is for that reason I hope the Minister will do something to meet this particular amendment.  I suggest that he accepts the amendment and limit it to pheasants, partridges, woodcock, grouse and also hares.  It might be a hardship to extend it to duck or snipe.  Snipe are very well able to look after themselves, because there are not so many people able to shoot them, and duck are migratory birds. I make that suggestion, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal object of the amendment is not to inflict any hardship on the holder of the game licence at all.  Its effect will be to prevent people who have no licence selling game to persons around the country where there can be no supervision or check.  That is where the poacher always finds his market.  He has not to come into the towns.  The poachers try to sell game about the country.  This amendment will inflict no hardship on anybody who has a licence.  The object of the amendment is to deal with the fellow who has no licence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all. He must have a £2 licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in the past was that people who had no licence or only a ten shilling licence <Col N="365" /> sold game without coming into the towns where there was a licensed game dealer.  That is one aspect of the case.  We are up against the position where we want to build up a great national asset, and in the building up of that national asset we must inconvenience people.  That cannot be helped.  If you have the foundations laid you can then afford to relax, but before there is a proper stock of game in the country you must be rigid.  Everybody who is anxious to see game made the valuable asset to the country that it ought to be must make a sacrifice. Somebody must put in the foundations, and somebody must lay down the stock, otherwise we will have no game.  Anything that will discourage people who might lay down foundation stock is bad business. I would ask the Deputies and the Minister to view this thing in its broader aspect altogether, because we all owe a duty to the country in this matter.  Game can be made a great national asset, and that is worth a considerable amount  of trouble to the country.  It is worth making a sacrifice for.  We ought to view it from that angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the general position which Deputy Gorey has put forward and on which Deputy Shaw has spoken.  At the same time, as I said last night, I recognise that there is a good deal to be said on both sides of this particular question. But I would like the House and the country to understand what the section is as it stands and what the section will do when amended, because seemingly there is some misapprehension on the matter.  The section means at present that nobody can sell game unless he has a £2 licence or unless he is a registered game dealer.  The effect of this amendment would be that a person who has a £2 licence could shoot game on his own land or on the land over which he has a right to shoot, and, according to the amendment, he could sell that game to a game dealer and to nobody else.  As the section stands he can sell that game <Col N="366" /> to anybody he likes.  That is the condition that obtains under the fishery laws at the present moment.  As I pointed out already, people who have an opportunity of shooting a considerable quantity of game very often have got clubs to which they can dispose of the game.  I can quite understand that there will be a game protection association, and that a game protection association and individual members of it might have a contract to supply a particular club or a particular hotel with game, and they would get a better price from that club or hotel than they could get if they were simply to sell it to a game dealer.</P>
      <P>This person who takes out a £2 licence, and who wanders around the country trespassing and poaching in pursuit of game would, even under this amendment, still find a market for game, though his market would be a more restricted one no doubt, because he would be able to sell it only to a licensed game dealer.  But I do not know that those persons who wander around the country shooting game get a better price by selling it to private individuals.  Supposing you take any ordinary county in which somebody is poaching I think the number of persons in it who would give a better price than a game dealer would give would be extremely few indeed, and it would always be open to the man to sell to a game dealer.  This is not a question, I think, as to whether the man who lives by shooting&mdash;the professional poacher, who is a most undesirable person&mdash;is to exist or is not to exist.  That does not arise here at all.  As I say, I recognise that there is a good deal to be said on both sides, but, on the whole, my own personal view is that it would be rather an undue restriction of the rights of the person who takes out a £2 licence if he could not dispose of the game he shoots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I am most anxious to see game preserved that I oppose this amendment.  If those people who spoke in favour of it had the interests of the game at heart they would not press it.  Take a <Col N="367" /> small farmer, the person on whom, after all, in the finish we must rely to preserve the game.  If you are going to prevent such a man who takes out a £2 licence, and who tries to sell enough game to pay for it, from selling his game to anyone but a game dealer, you will prevent him from taking out the £2 licence, but he will shoot the game in spite of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>His 5/- licence will take him over his own land, and you cannot have a Civic Guard after his heels every day.  You must make it to his interest to preserve the game. Deputy Cooper insinuated that the type of individual I was anxious to protect was not the smallholder but the poacher who has no land at all and who goes around shooting without permission from anybody.  That was an unfair statement, and I think it should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>If I misunderstood Deputy Corry of course I withdraw. But if the Deputy does not know I and most other Deputies do know that there are a good many men in the country&mdash;not a large number, but perhaps 200 or 300&mdash;who spend most of their time going around shooting and who do not worry whether they get permission or not. They are not always small farmers; sometimes they are sons of shopkeepers. I have never known the small farmer to be a bad poacher or to kill any very large number of game, but I have known men of the description I have referred to who were.  I am very glad that I misunderstood Deputy Corry, and I apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cooper can leave those gentlemen to the farmer.  The farmer will not allow everybody in to shoot freely around his holding.  Most farmers have not 400 or 500 acres on which a man can come in and shoot without their knowledge at all.  If this House is anxious to preserve game the only way it can do so is to prohibit the <Col N="368" /> shooting of partridge and pheasants for three or four years and give them a chance.  I am prepared to support that any day of the week; but I do not want to see this Bill preserving game for the rich and for nobody else.  That is what this amendment means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment, because the more difficult it is to dispose of game the better the Bill will be, especially what might be called stolen game. Game that is shot where a man has no authority to shoot, even if he has a £2 licence, is practically stolen game, and by limiting the sale of game to a game dealer the dealer will have a list of the people from whom he has purchased, so that it will be very much easier for the Civic Guards to trace where the game has been shot.  I think everything that restricts and makes it more difficult to dispose of poached game will improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the present fishery laws.  As far as I can understand the one flaw in the present fishery laws is that a man who takes out a salmon licence can net fish and can sell them, because the salmon licence permits him to sell them.  It was because of that flaw in the fishery laws that I introduced this amendment.  I fear that as long as an individual can take out a £2 licence he is at liberty to poach on anybody's land.  After all, the whole idea of this Bill is to try to preserve game.  It may mean a hardship on some people, I admit, but for the general good and for the efficient working of the Bill somebody must always suffer.  I think that if this amendment were accepted it would really strengthen the Bill, but if the Minister cannot accept it I am willing to ask the permission of the House to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 43, to delete the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; where it first occurs and at the end of the sub-section to add the words &ldquo;or by any other holder of such certificate with his permission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> To my mind, this is perhaps a more important amendment.  It offers none of the objections that Deputy Corry pointed out.  As the sub-section stands there are three classes of holders of licences who might still be exempt from the provisions of the section&mdash;the man who kills game himself, the man who kills on his own land, and the man who kills on land over which he has a right to shoot.  As it stands, all that it is necessary for a man to say when he goes to sell game is: &ldquo;I shot this game myself.&rdquo;  That offers the objection that it is not even necessary for the man to have the permission of the small or large farmer when he shoots game.  I would like it to read : &ldquo;This section shall hot apply to the holder of a licence selling game killed by himself on his own land or on land over which he has the right to shoot.&rdquo;  But if we eliminate the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; and bring about the state of affairs that I should like to see, we create a new difficulty, because the sub-section would then prevent the owner of the land, who is not perhaps a sportsman himself and who did not shoot, from selling game himself.  That is why I put down the words: &ldquo;or by any other holder of such certificate with his permission.&rdquo;  If that is incorrectly drafted, perhaps the Minister grasps the meaning of what I intend and would accept it.  Anyhow, what I do intend is to prevent a man, even if he is the holder of a £2 licence, selling game without specifying, or perhaps being bound to specify, that he had permission to shoot the game. It does not create the difficulty that Deputy Corry saw in the last amendment, because, as he said on the last amendment, perhaps the poor man or the small farmer who shot game, and who might have a few customers here and there, even by post, could not sell his game.  But this does not create that difficulty at all; it creates the difficulty that the man must only have permission from somebody to shoot somewhere.  If he has not land himself he must get permission to shoot on somebody else's land.  It only prevents a man from shooting on lands over which he has no permission to shoot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to accepting the amendment put forward by the Deputy. What this section is meant to convey is that no one can sell game except the holder of a £2 licence, and he can only sell game which has been shot by himself or by somebody who is a guest or who has been authorised by him to shoot.  Deputy Bennett pointed out that to a certain extent there might be a flaw in that which would enable a poacher legally to sell game, but as far as it goes I am willing to accept the amendment.  I would like to have it re-drafted and to bring in an amendment to this effect.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (4) the words &ldquo;nor shall it prohibit the disposal by sale or otherwise of hares killed at coursing matches.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know if the amendment as worded fits into the section, but the Deputy's idea was that it might be possible that hares killed in coursing matches could not be disposed of or sold under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from authorities on Irish coursing that in fact when hares are killed by greyhounds at coursing matches they are not sold.  It looks to me to be making the thing rather unsporting and making it a financial business to go out and kill a hare and then want the value in cash.  I understand that the Irish coursing people do not like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall sell, expose for sale, or keep for sale, any species of game during the annual close season fixed for such species of game, except for a period of five days from the date on which the close season commences.  Any person who shall sell, expose for sale, or keep for sale, any game in contravention of this sub-section shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding <Col N="372" /> three months or to both such fine and imprisonment.  Any person who shall buy any game from any person selling the same in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider the object of this amendment very important, and I think it is obviously connected with the spirit of the Bill.  As far as I can see only one objection could possibly be urged against it, and that is that it would prevent the sale of birds either killed out of season in any country or killed in season during the close season in this country; but I think such an objection is a small matter, and could not be weighed against the obvious advantage of prohibiting the sale of game birds during the close season. In the amendment I have suggested a period of five days from the date on which the close season commences, in order that stocks on hand might be disposed of.  I do not think there is any need to say any more, as the wording of the amendment shows what is really required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather difficult amendment because it is one on which there is a good deal to be said on both sides.  I think everybody would be in agreement if you could prohibit the sale to a game dealer, or the sale by an ordinary person if yon like, of game within five days.  But it is a matter of common knowledge that a great number of birds are kept for a considerable period upon ice.  For instance, a bird might be shot on 12th August and it might not be eaten until January having, in the meantime spent the time on ice.  I do not really know what attitude hotel proprietors would have towards this amendment.  Looking at it from the point of view of game preservation, and from the point of view of the epicure&mdash;if I should call a person who eats game off ice an epicure&mdash;it is undesirable.  I would have no objection to the amendment being inserted though I can see that <Col N="373" /> various persons might feel strongly against it.</P>

      <P>The only difference the amendment might make is that it might operate detrimentally towards live game that would be in people's possession as stock birds.  When the season closes might be the time when birds are imported and that might inflict a hardship.  If it meant dealing with game dead at the beginning of the close season it would be all right, but if it interfered in any way with the transit or with the keeping of live birds it would be a different matter altogether.  In that way the amendment ought to be examined very carefully before being accepted. I do not know what the effect will be.  I am not able to size up the full implications, but I think it is quite possible that it could be made very annoying.  As it reads it would mean dead or live game, and there should be a distinction.</P>

      <Col N="375" /> The object of this amendment is that persons or syndicates who have large shoots go to considerable expense in laying down birds, and they should know in what position they are right from the start.  It might be argued that there is nothing in the original section to prevent the Gárda Síochána granting permission on or after the 1st January, which is all that is really required.  But I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to this matter, and I will be quite satisfied if he will undertake to give proper instructions to the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána with regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that what the Deputy means by this is: For instance, a person is thinking as to whether he will lay down a very large stock of pheasants for a particular year, and he wants to know whether he will be allowed to shoot.  If he is not allowed he will not hatch out pheasants, or only hatch out a very few.  He wants to know whether he will put down his eggs or whether he will be allowed a day or two days' shooting.  I think as the Bill stands he can get permission.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 63, to delete the word &ldquo;April&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;March.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put in this amendment because I consider that the first of April is too late.  Large numbers of game birds and several other birds have been hatching during the month of April and in this particular season which is exceptionally dry vast damage was done owing to the wholesale burning of gorse and furze.  I do not know if the 1st March would be too early but certainly the 1st April is too late.  I would be interested to know the views of other Deputies on the subject.</P>

      <P>On this particular period I myself have got no very definite views because I do not personally know yery much about what is the correct period for the burning of heather.  These dates were inserted in the Bill after consultation with the Game Protection Association and after getting the views of various gentlemen interested in shooting and agriculture who were rather authorities.  They were by no means unanimous, but this appears to have had the greatest volume of support.  It is a matter <Col N="377" /> on which any Deputy who has views should express them.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that any burning that wants to be done can be done before the 31st March.  Very often February is a wet month.  It requires a March wind to dry up furze before it can be burned.  I should say that a date fixed before the middle of March would be too early.</P>

      <P>I am not a sufficient authority about hatching.  I think it ought to be easily ascertained from authorities, from naturalists and from other people interested in game societies if there is any game laying their eggs in the month of March.  I am not so sure of that.  I am ready to hear any authority on the matter. I do not know of my own knowledge but I know that what Deputy Brennan said is right, that a lot of burning which has to be done cannot be done before the 31st of March.  The March wind is a dry one which enables that kind of rubbish, furze and gorse to be burned. It will not burn if it is wet.  I think you might inflict a hardship on the occupiers without doing any good. If someone with authority says it ought to be I am quite ready to accept, it but in the absence of that I would not.  I think you ought to be cnreful.  I think wet grass which you want to burn cannot be burned in the month of March as a rule.</P>

      <P>To insert before sub-section (6) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every package, containing game of any kind offered for conveyance through the post or by any railway or by any other means of transport shall have the word `game' written thereon and also the name and address of the sender.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading through the section it occurred to me that the detection of game, if it is a closed packet, will be very difficult.  If the onus is put upon the sender of the game to put his name and address upon the packet and to mark it game it will make it easier <Col N="379" /> for the Civic Guards and for everybody else, and a good deal of trouble will be avoided.  It will also preserve the game, because when these packages are opened in the Post Office, or in transit, they may not be as carefully packed up as they were by the sender, and are likely to become damaged.  They may come under the provisions of the Dead Meat Bill in not reaching the market in a good condition.  I think this amendment is very necessary.</P>

      <P>I am willing to accept the spirit of the Deputy's amendment.  I think, however, the wording of it will have to be slightly altered, because &ldquo;every package containing game of any kind offered for conveyance through the post or by any railway or by any other means of transport&rdquo; is terribly wide.  If you ask somebody to bring your game home in his cart, It would come under these words.  I think &ldquo;through the post or sent by rail&rdquo; is what the Deputy means.  I see that there is some slight difficulty about it.  It will be very difficult to get the provisions known to persons sending game, and a great number of them will break the law through inadvertence for some time.  I will accept the Deputy's amendment, but I would like to have it re-drafted.</P>

      <P>He could in one way; he could pretend to the owner of the land that he did not know it was preserved and he could hold up anybody he met and demand from him his £2 licence, anybody he saw carrying a gun, no matter where he met him.  I think the section will not lead to the preservation of game.  There are many farmers holding lands on two sides of a road, and if a man is crossing from one part of his land to another a gentleman with a £2 licence could hold him up and ask him if he had a £2 licence and perhaps summon him.  Instead of leading to the preservation of game, it would lead to people turning on those who hold game licences.  It is creating a new body in the country, an addition, I might say, to the C.I.D., if individuals are allowed to go around and hold up other people for the production of their licences. It will get those who hold 5/- licences up against those who hold £2 licences.</P>

There is an old principle which goes back a very long way, when the holder of a £3 licence could demand from anybody else if he had a £3 licence, if he saw him shooting game.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.  At the same time, this is a survival of one of the worst features of the old Game Laws in Great Britain.  I welcomed this Bill on its introduction.  As the Minister drafted the Bill, I think it was fairly acceptable to every member of this House, but as we have proceeded into the Committee Stage, we find that the very worst features of the old Game Preservation Acts in Britain have been introduced.  No later than last evening, the Minister accepted the designation of rabbits as game.  It has been the boast of every Irish sportsman that Ireland was a sportsman's paradise, and that the ordinary workingman could go out on <Col N="382" /> a Sunday with his brace of dogs and course a rabbit.  Henceforward that will not be so if this Bill passes into law.  I welcomed the Bill at the very outset, but I intend to oppose it and vote against it in its next stages.  I consider that, as it has proceeded through this House, it has become most reactionary, and has harped back to the very worst features of the old British Game Laws.</P>
      <P>In this very section, you suggest what is embodied in the British Game Laws, that the holder of an Excise licence could hold up another sportsman and demand to see his licence.  I agree that it is no new thing, but it is comparatively new for Irishmen to be making their own laws, and when the Minister suggests that he is going to embody in this Bill a feature that was condemned by many English sportsmen, it is, as Deputy Corry has said, making a new C.I.D. force.  There is a good deal in that.  I do not always agree with Deputy Corry, but in this matter, at any rate, I am agreed that it is creating a new C.I.D. force.  I would ask the Minister if he has any regard for the spirit of fair play or the spirit of democracy to leave this section out altogether.</P>

For instance, if Deputy Gorey goes out on his farm with a gun on a Sunday and one of these &ldquo;jackeens&rdquo; comes up to him and demands his licence, I can imagine the reply that Deputy Gorey would give him.  I can imagine the breach of the peace that would occur, or, perhaps, the continued absence of the Deputy from this Chamber.

      <P>I do not think this section is going to help to preserve game.  It one of these &ldquo;jackeens&rdquo; comes up and demands his licence from the occupier of a holding, I know what the result will be.  The man will probably on his way home shoot whatever he may meet, whether game or not.  He will not leave much for that gentleman the next time he comes out.  I think this is creating a new C.I.D. force which would not lead to peace in this country or to the preservation of game.  It is definitely against it.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputies will approach this question apart from class interest&mdash;that they will approach it in the interest of the <Col N="384" /> propagation of game in the country. I can see that this section could be made very annoying.  On the other hand, we have to look at it from the other point of view, that the Gárda Síochána will not be sufficient to afford anything like adequate protection for game.  A number of Gárdai who have to cover a district five miles square will not be able to do it effectively.  If we are going to have game clubs, this is only the foundation for the development of such clubs.  If you do anything to curtail the powers of such clubs and individuals interested in game preservation and make it entirely dependent on the Gárda Síochána you will be doing a very wrong thing.  The section could be only made annoying in very isolated cases, because we are not breeding in this country so plentifully that type of &ldquo;puppy&rdquo; that we need be alarmed about it. We may have a few isolated cases of persons who would be annoying but these can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>We ought to approach, it in the larger aspect and do nothing to hamper the operations of the new Bill, or scheme, or both, which must be introduced to give effect to this Bill.  You must have a new scheme for the preservation and propagation of game and the formation of game societies.  You must divide the country up into small districts and anything that would bring about proper supervision, and I think this section will do that, is not the evil that Deputies anticipate.  It has not been nor is it likely to be and I think the balance of argument is altogether in favour of retaining this section, at least for a few years.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt the Civic Guard cannot possibly cope with poachers in certain districts.  I am acquainted with a certain district and apart from vermin the greatest menace to game preservation is what I might call the motor bandit&mdash;the gentleman who drives up in a motor car, leaves the car standing by the side of the road; goes for half an hour or an hour into a bog; comes back and drives away.  The nearest Civic Guard barrack is about eight miles away.  How can the Civic Guards cope with a state of affairs like that? It is impossible and it is hardly fair to expect them to do so; it would in fact be absurd.  The method provided by this section is the only method I can see whereby game can be preserved and whereby the legitimate owners of game can have some means at their disposal of coping with this state of affairs.  I do not <Col N="386" /> see how it can be abused or how it should be abused, and that is why I strongly support this section.</P>

      <P>Yes, they do, and these are the very gentlemen that would drive into a man's land and ask to see his £2 licence, and would offer a very strong temptation to a man to be left on the land for good.  I think in these cases we can very safely leave it to the occupiers of the land themselves and to the gamekeepers and to the coursing clubs to look after the game.  They will look after the game of the district without any of this new C.I.D. force trotting round after them which would only cause trouble.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy moves his amendment, I wish to point, out that there is an error in it as it appears on the Order Paper.  It should read: &ldquo;In the first column&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;in the second column.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the close season for snipe and woodcock to the 30th September.  In the case of snipe and migratory birds coming into this country for the winter season, they may not come, according to the weather conditions prevailing, sooner than the 1st October.  It is possible that they may not come until the middle of October, or even until November.  Therefore, I think it is desirable that the Schedule should be amended in the direction that I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  It is well known, as Deputy Boland has said, that most foreign birds do not come in until about the 1st October.  Snipe, particularly home-bred snipe, are as a rule very immature until late in the season.  When grouse shooting, I have seen wee snipe not able to fly. I think it is desirable that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as shooting is concerned, I do not think that this amendment is of any importance. The snipe to be found in this country can, I think, be divided into three classes.  You have first what is called the home snipe, that is the snipe that you see in August. These all leave the country about August, and I believe they migrate to Egypt.  Then you have what are called the Scotch snipe.  These have been reared in Scotland.  They come in here on their way further south, and, approximately, spend the month of September in this country.  The foreign snipe come in rouyhly about October, and spend the rest of the winter here.  As far as snipe and woodcock shooting in this country is concerned, I do not think that the amendment is of any substantial assistance, but as far as snipe-shooting in Egypt is concerned, it is a <Col N="390" /> most valuable amendment indeed.  If the Deputy is keen on snipe-shooting in Egypt, and since his amendment does no substantial harm to this country, I am prepared to accept it, though I think it would be better if the date, the 1st September, were agreed on rather than the 1st October, which the Deputy seeks to have inserted.  I should like to know from the Deputy if the 1st September would satisfy him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good amendment as far as woodcock is concerned.  I know that the opinion is generally held that home-bred woodcock do go away about the middle of August and come back very often in December.  There are a good many people who hold that opinion, and who are supported in their opinion to a certain extent by those who have woodcock ringed.  I know that happens in the Co. Sligo, though I know anything might happen in the County Mayo.  The amendment will do no harm.  It will make poaching more difficult, and will prevent the killing of immature home-bred birds.</P>

      <P>In moving this amendment, I wish to say that I know that in the month of March young hares through the country are frequently gobbled up by packs of harriers and greyhounds. I think that there is common agreement amongst sportsmen that this amendment, should go through.  As far as I know there will be no objection to it.</P>

      <P>On another amendment we discussed this question at some length yesterday. <Col N="391" /> As Deputies will see, there is an amendment standing in my name to the effect that the words &ldquo;eighteenth day of March&rdquo; should be inserted this to be the date of the close season. A similar amendment stands in the name of Deputy Shaw.  As I stated yesterday, that date has been agreed upon after discussion of the matter with the Irish Coursing Club.  Their view is that the 18th March would be the more satisfactory date.  Therefore, I take it that that date is an agreed date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>My name is also to the amendment before the House.  I take a slightly opposite view to that of Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Anthony, and of the Irish Coursing Club.  I think that this amendment, as well as amendments 41 and 42, might be taken together.  The object aimed at is that the coursing season proper should end on the 1st March, but that where the Irish Coursing Club gives permission, meetings might be held up to the 17th or 18th March.  In that case only could the open season be extended to that date. It is also suggested that permission be given to licensed harrier clubs to carry on until the 1st April.  The Committee has already disposed of a section giving permission for that.  I say that if you extend the open season until the 18th March, then everybody as well as the Coursing Club can avail of the Act.  The position will be that you will have dogs of every description, mongrels, young greyhounds, sheep dogs, terriers, and all the rest out poaching when they should not be out, because, as everyone knows, that is the time of the year when we have a lot of young hares and a number of doe hares carrying young, and when they are not able to get away.  I have seen that happen in England and in Ireland. In my opinion, the open season should end definitely on the 1st March, with the proviso that the Minister should he placed in the position to be able to give permission to the Irish Coursing Club to sanction the holding of meetings up to the 18th March or 19th March in the case of clubs affiliated with it that <Col N="392" /> apply for permits.  That would be, I think, an ideal solution of the difficulty. I think it would be the proper way to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would mean redrafting an amendment of yesterday.  However, that is only a technical point, substituting the 1st for the 18th of March in that amendment. Deputy Anthony has an amendment excepting the case where the Irish Coursing Club has received a permit, but he does not suggest from whom they should receive the permit.  That is left in the air.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Jasper Wolfe Mr. Jasper Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jasper Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and <Col N="394" /> the Seanad be set up to consider and report what amendments, if any, are required in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the Acts amending same and any other Statutes affecting the civil jurisdiction of the Courts of Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>That seven Deputies represent the Dáil on the said Joint Committee;</P>
    <P>That the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would perhaps more correctly read if the first four words in the motion were deleted, with the permission of the Dáil.  The motion deals with the courts set up by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the jurisdiction transferred to those courts, and the statutes affecting that jurisdiction.  Under the Courts of Justice Act three things were accomplished.  In the first place, the District Courts were created, and to those courts was transferred all the jurisdiction which had hitherto been exercised by the old Petty Sessions Courts, and in addition there was added a new and enlarged jurisdiction.  There was then a Circuit Court set up, to which Court was transferred the entire jurisdiction of the old County Courts, and in addition an increased jurisdiction both in common law cases and in the equity side of law.  In the third place, the Courts of Justice Act created a new High Court and a Supreme Court.  I wish to make clear that this motion is not brought by way of criticism or in opposition to the Courts of Justice Act of 1924. Quite the contrary.  I am bound to admit that that Act has been a very great success.  No one at this stage, five years after the Act has passed, will stand up and say that our District Courts are not a very distinct and decided improvement on the old Petty Sessions Courts.</P>
    <P>Time has proved to those who have had experience of how the old Petty Sessions Courts administered, how great the improvement has been, and anything in this motion must not be taken as being in any way critical of the jurisdiction <Col N="395" /> created in either the District Courts or in the Circuit Courts, which also have been a very immense success. The great success of the Circuit Courts has been, I think, due to the fact of their enlarged jurisdiction. The High Court and the Supreme Court taking them all in all are open to criticism, as such Courts always will be, and as I hope they will be, but taking them through and through our Courts of Justice to-day are in a position far stronger and more effective than they have been for generations or centuries past.  I would rather that this motion should be looked upon, as it is in fact, a necessary corollary to the findings of the Joint Committee of this House and the Seanad to consider and report upon the Circuit Court rules.  Time has, of course, shown that the Courts of Justice Act contained a great many flaws.</P>
    <P>Every statute similarly passed that I know of creating a great change has, as experience discloses, flaws that could not possibly be foreseen by the draughtsmen.  The Courts of Justice Act is no exception.  There are inevitably flaws, and the object of the Committee which I suggest is to collect together those flaws, put them into an amending Act, and have one amending Act to deal with them as the intelligence of this House and of another House, and the evidence of both branches of the profession, with such evidence as they may get from the public, and the latter evidence I consider as being of very great importance, can bring together so that we may now, five years after the Courts of Justice Act has been passed, put before this House a Bill which will put an end, at all events for some time, to the amending Bills and the attempts that have been made to patch up this Act by various amending statutes from 1924 up to the present time.  If this is not done my suggestion, and the suggestion of those who have experience of these courts, will be that you will have year after year Bills being brought up to amend the Courts of Justice Act in various details.  Year after <Col N="396" /> year you will have, as you must have if this matter is to be dealt with adequately at all as difficulties arise, an amending Bill which must and should receive consideration from this House.  The Circuit Court Rules took, I think, something like eighteen months or two years to prepare. They were submitted to a joint committee of both Houses, and by a finding, unanimous on this point at all events, they were scrapped as being inadequate and unsuitable for the courts that had been set up.  I understand that a new set of rules compiled in obedience to the findings of that committee will shortly be submitted to this House, and again I would suggest that those rules will contain matter that could be adequately and suitably considered only by a committee such as I suggest in this motion.</P>
    <P>The reports of the committee already set up did two things which critics suggest were done <i>ultra vires</i> as being beyond the scope of the authority that had been delegated to them.  They dealt with the question of the jurisdiction of Circuit Courts, and also with the present system of hearing appeals from the Circuit Courts.  It has been suggested, and perhaps not without some reason, that the Circuit Court Committee went a little bit beyond their powers which were to deal with the rules submitted to them as regards matters of appellate jurisdiction and of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts. When I tell Deputies that the majority of the committee consisted of lawyers they will recognise the danger they ran of that committee doing a little more than it was authorised to do.  I suggest that the proposed committee should get full powers to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>It will probably be suggested that this resolution is wide.  It is intentionally wide because these are matters that must be dealt with and, as I suggest, dealt with once and for all.  The Circuit Court Committee went into the question of jurisdiction and dealt with common law jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction, of the Circuit Courts as set up under the <Col N="397" /> Act of 1924.  The limit of it is £300. By majority, the committee recommended that that jurisdiction should be reduced in certain areas from £300 to £150 excepting Dublin and, of course, Cork, the question of Mayo being I think left in abeyance. I do not want to say anything in connection with this motion as to the merits of that jurisdiction, but I suggest that it is a question which requires consideration, and that there is for consideration and discussion a very serious question as to whether the existing jurisdiction or the Circuit Courts should be reduced, increased, or allowed to remain where it is.  Personally at this stage I offer no opinion further than saying that there is this very serious question, as shown by the findings of the Circuit Court Committee, to be discussed.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of appeal, for the same reason I do not want to pronounce judgment on the existing system of appeal in advance, but I do think that I am saying nothing controversial when I say that that system has hopelessly broken down in practice.  One of the worst things which I heard in this Dáil concerning the question of Circuit Court jurisdiction was the experience of Deputy Ruttledge as regards a certain appeal.  What he told us has, I think, been borne out, not perhaps to the same extent as in the instance quoted by him, but by some cases which I could quote.  Some of them indeed almost came up to the one case which he cited.  What has been found about appeals is this.  There is first of all the question of delay. That is not a matter that is open to any discussion.  At present appeals have been accumulating to such an extent that there are appeals now waiting from decisions that were given over eighteen months ago. There is no doubt that when appeals are awaiting hearing for more than a year and a half there is something wrong.  People have got judgments either plaintiffs or defendants, and now a year and a half after these judgments have been obtained they are still waiting for their appeals to <Col N="398" /> be heard.  That is a matter beyond controversy.</P>
    <P>It is also beyond controversy that the expense of the present system is at least four times the expense of the system it superseded.  In many cases it is ten times the expense of the previous system, but taking it through and through and keeping well on the safe side, the appellate system established by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which was professedly brought in in order to expedite and economise the hearing of appeals, has had the opposite effect. The delay has been beyond all reason.  The expense has been beyond all reason.  To-day an appeal from the Circuit Court is really only open to two classes of people.  One is the very well-to-do man, and the other is the pauper who is fearless and weatherproof against the consequences. There is no chance for the ordinary man in the street.  Those appeals are not being brought.  I give you what is the experience of every advocate engaged in Circuit Court procedure.  Appeals are not advised at present in many cases where they could be brought with very reasonable and strong prospects of success under ordinary circumstances.  I do not know if anybody could be got to defend the existing system of appeal.  I know that there is one class who will be affected by any changes in the present system.  There are certain members of the legal profession who will be affected financially by them.  I think I can appeal to Deputy Ruttledge and to Deputy Little in this regard, and I am sure they will bear me out when I say that in regard to appeals which they have waiting they will cause them at least five times the trouble which they had previously.  I do not think that I am giving any trade secrets away, and I think Deputy Ruttledge will bear me out when I say that all the trouble a solicitor has at present in connection with appeals is the copying of stenographers' notes.  In the old days we spent day after day, days which often should have been spent in another way, trying to dictate appeals from our own notes and get them in <Col N="399" /> at the last moment.  We have been saved all that trouble by having the stenographer's notes, and if there is any change in the system of appeals you may look on Deputy Ruttledge and myself as two of the chief victims.  This system affects people living in poor constituencies.  It affects people in seaport constituencies such as mine.  Such people are entitled to get redress for their civil wrongs.  They are entitled to get it a little cheaply, expeditiously, and near at hand, and not by means of stenographers' notes read in Dublin.  What does a person think of an appeal taken behind his back by the reading of notes which he has never seen, and probably with which he would not agree if he did see them?  That is a question that ought to be discussed and settled at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>There is also another question which I think might reasonably be open for discussion.  I do not put it beyond that.  Under the Courts of Justice Act there are ages set down for the retirement of the judges of the different courts, and one does wonder how these limits of age were arrived at and what exactly they mean.  The intellect of a District Court Justice ceases to be operative at 65.  A Circuit Court Judge has intelligence enough left to go on until he is 70, and a High Court Judge can paddle along until he is 73.  If the limit had been reversed one could understand it.  All I suggest about it is that it is a matter well worthy of consideration, particularly in a country that is already overridden with pensions.  The legal history of Ireland shows this beyond dispute&mdash; that our greatest judges were at their best at 75 years and upwards.  We had one notable example, regarding which every lawyer in Ireland who knew him will corroborate me.  The late Chief Baron Palles was the pride and admiration of all of us by reason of his knowledge of law, and we were able in another country when anything was said in criticism of our judges by the people across the water to give them a wipe of Chief <Col N="400" /> Baron Palles.  There was no answer to it.  Chief Baron Palles, the greatest of our lawyers within living memory, was at his best at the age of 80.  Certainly he was better at 80 than he was at 70, and I think it was conceded he was better at 80 than at 75.</P>
    <P>I suggest that instead of retiring at 65, and being handed over to the tender mercies of Colonel Brennan to learn golf, the District Justices might be allowed to remain in office until they reach the age of 70, and that if necessary they should get a certificate from the Minister that they were sound in limb and that they had average intellect.  There is no reason why they should be put on pension at 65.  I do not say that the suggestion which I now make is one that would be altogether popular amongst the legal profession.  It may not be popular, but it will be popular in the country, as it is a step in the right direction, and it will show that we as representatives of the people of Saorstát Eireann, when we get a practical opportunity of cutting down pensions, are going to do it.  I do not suggest that everybody over 70 or over 75 would of necessity make a very good judge, but I suggest that there are a good many, who are existing judges, who might very well hold on until they are 75, and there are a good many of our District Judges who might very well hold on until they are 70 or 75, provided that if necessary they get a certificate from the Minister for Justice that they are physically and mentally fit.  There is no reason why they should not hold on.  If they want to go let them go at 70, but if they want to hang on let them hang on, if they are fit to do it, and let this country be saved the burden of their pensions.</P>
    <P>The point I want to stress is that under the procedure created by the Courts of Justice Act at present, particularly so far as it affects jurisdiction in the case of the Circuit Courts and District Courts, there is a multiplicity of points involved that at present are in a state of doubt.  I can I believe put to a solicitor having <Col N="401" /> experience of practice in the District Courts and Circuit Courts an examination paper and give, say either Deputy Ruttledge or Deputy Little, a paper with twelve questions set out and you will get this general comment, that they could not give you a definite answer as these matters are in doubt.  I do not know whether they could give an answer or not, but for myself I would have to answer that these matters are not yet settled.  That is not as it should be.  There are a whole number of matters in doubt.  At present a matter that is gravely in doubt is how long a decree of the Circuit Court remains in force if the amount of the decree is over £50 and if the amount of the decree is under £50. Perhaps the Minister for Justice will tell us.  If he will be able to elucidate that difficulty even at this stage it would be of great assistance to a great many people.  Is there any power to renew such a decree?  That is a difficulty that arises every day in the Circuit Courts.  Some people will tell you there is power to renew under the old county court jurisdiction, but that is not attached to the new jurisdiction.  The matter is still, to put it at its best, in a state of very great doubt.</P>
    <P>Again, the question arises of a defendant being such by a person residing out of the jurisdiction.  Can he demand security for costs?  The Minister for Justice might perhaps enlighten us, because I do not know. This I do know, that an attempt has been made to solve that mystery by a committee set up to frame rules for the District Courts.  That was a Departmental Committee.  It had on it Justices and very able Justices who had all some experience of their jurisdiction and their work and I will tell you what they were able to do for us.  To give an example that will appeal to the ordinary lay mind, if a plaintiff comes across from London to sue a peasant in the Co. Mayo for £5, and if the peasant has a set-off against the London merchant for £10&mdash;that is if on the balance the man from Mayo owes nothing to the London man but has £5 coming to <Col N="402" /> him&mdash;the District Justice will, without compelling security for costs from the London man, give a decree against the Mayo man for £5 and tell the man from Mayo &ldquo;Go to London, you, and sue for your £10 there.&rdquo;  When he goes across to London he will find himself face to face, as a preliminary step, with having to put down a large and in many cases a prohibitive amount as security for costs.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is a point that occurs in a minor way every second day in this country.  We have a dispute between two men involving cross claims.  They live in adjoining townlands and they both have the same District Justice.  One of them lives in one court area and the other lives in a second court area.  The solemn farce has to be gone through of A bringing B to one court and B replying by bringing A to another court instead of hearing and disposing of the two cases together just as was done in the old County Court times.  Unfortunately it was done at the expense of the lawyers, there being only one case instead of two. It was done in that way in the old days and it gave satisfaction to everybody except the unfortunate attorney who had to combine the two cases and accept the fees that would be attached to one.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that needs immediate attention.  A remedy is overdue.  By having such cases dealt with at the one time it would save the expense of a second action and it can be easily provided that the solicitor shall get some additional remuneration, some reasonable remuneration, in view of the changed circumstances.  Money would be saved to litigants and the cost of two trials would be avoided. That is only one of many examples that could be given and it typifies the condition of things the Committee would have to consider.  Other points arise every day.  I do not know whether the point is still cleared up about a man who gets a new licence from a Circuit Court Judge.  Does he require a confirmation of that licence?  If it is not <Col N="403" /> granted at the Michaelmas Session has he to wait until a later sitting? On the other hand, would he have to get confirmation in the Michaelmas Session for what was granted him in June?  I am not at all clear on the point whether he has to come forward a second time in order to get confirmation of his licence.  This is one matter which really calls for earnest consideration on the part of the Committee.</P>
    <P>I suggest that as regards the other examples I have given, a layman would in many respects be as good if not a better judge than a lawyer. When it is suggested, as it may fairly be suggested, that this is a matter that ought to be dealt with by a Committee of experts, I say that there ought to be experts on the Committee and I believe that within the four walls of this building&mdash;in the Dáil and in the Seanad&mdash; you can find people with sufficient technical experience and sufficient ability to carry out the task allotted to them.  On a Committee so selected you will have every section of the community represented.  You ought to be able to get a better Joint Committee out of the Dáil and Seanad than by any other method that I know of.  I think that a Joint Committee set up by this House and the Seanad would be more acceptable and that their findings would be better taken by the country and by the members of the profession concerned than would the findings of a Committee set up in any other way.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that the task of the Committee would be an easy one.  It will have to deal not merely with the Courts of Justice Act, but there are at present on the Statute Book a number of sections of various Acts of Parliament that have fallen into desuetude, and are really inapplicable to the new jurisdiction.  Yet these Acts have not been formally repealed. The question constantly arises, should the requirements of those sections be still followed compulsorily even in cases where they are for all practical purposes entirely <Col N="404" /> inadequate and unsuitable?  On that account the Joint Committee in their desire to discharge their task properly will have to go over a very wide period.  The task will not be a very easy or expeditious one.</P>
    <P>The task will be thrown on the Committee of getting the opinion of those affected by those Acts from all sides of the Saorstát, from the northern limits to the southern limits, and to find put not merely what affects Cork but what affects Dublin and particularly what affects the poorer constituencies and thus try to do what I believe the Courts of Justice Act aimed at, to provide litigation at the smallest expense and with the least possible delay&mdash; satisfactory litigation, satisfactory courts and satisfactory appeals. With that object and with that object alone I propose the motion standing in my name.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have only just this point to add.  I have not discussed the fringe of the merits of the different points arising for discussion before this Committee.  I could give you, as any member of my profession could give you, scores of points that will have to be considered by the Joint Committee.  I do not want to say a word beyond that.  These are matters for the Committee's consideration and my submission to this House is that they can only be adequately dealt with by a Committee set up in the manner suggested by the motion which I have moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion moved by Deputy Wolfe.  I desire to support it in the spirit in which he has moved it.  Perhaps it will be a relief to the House to know that I do not intend to follow Deputy Wolfe either in length or detail.  The object of the Committee is perfectly plain.  The Courts of Justice Act was passed in the year 1924 and it was undoubtedly a great and sweeping revolution.  No Act of any Parliament, especially one which brings about such a change as this Act has done, can be regarded as sacrosanct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly in many respects the <Col N="405" /> Act has worked smoothly and well, but, just as certain, in other respects there have been considerable difficulties in the working of it.  I am not now going into any matters of controversy, but the fact remains that considerable controversy exists in regard to certain portions of this Act. It is to allay that controversy and to seek a remedy of matters which it is alleged require a remedy that I support the setting up of this committee. Deputy Wolfe has enumerated many of the various items which are the subject of almost daily reference in the Press.  The question of appeals, the question of delays, and other matters that he has referred to are known by everyone, laymen as well as lawyers, to be subjects which are daily considered by the general public.  Undoubtedly this Act requires revision, and it is with that object, and with that object solely in view, that I desire to support this motion.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will accept the motion in the first place, and also the spirit in which it has been moved.  Deputy Wolfe and I desire to see this Act working smoothly and working well.  It has done so in many respects, especially if I may say so with respect to the District Justices.  I think that they have shown themselves to be a wonderful success.  I think that they have carried out the jurisdiction given them in the most praiseworthy and deserving manner.  With their jurisdiction or with the conduct of their courts and their jurisdiction, I think there is very little fault to be found.  But you have the state of affairs which Deputy Wolfe has described as almost chaos.  Already the Act has been in operation for five years, and we have not yet got a set of rules for the Circuit Courts. Rules have been framed, and for one reason or another they have not been accepted.  There are innumerable instances which require to be investigated and revised.  It is with this view, and with this view alone, that I desire to second this motion, and I sincerely trust that the Minister will <Col N="406" /> find himself in a position to accept the motion as proposed.</P>
    <P>I was perhaps rather prominent in the controversy of 1924.  There were many criticisms that I and others made on this Act, some of which may have been unfounded, and which I freely admit were unfounded, but some of which I now claim were truly founded.  Amongst others was the question of the appellate jurisdiction. That would be a matter entirely for the committee to consider. I think this is a question that must and should be considered by a body such as this.  That would be the proper and the best body to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to accept the motion in the terms proposed by Deputy Wolfe. A great deal of what Deputy Wolfe said dealt with points of inquiry as to the working of the present legal system.  The Deputy drew up a catechism requesting me to answer a great number of questions.  I am afraid that I am not going to comply with any of Deputy Wolfe's requests. I am not going to answer any of his questions.  There is an admirable way in which he can get these questions answered especially if he goes to a member of the Connacht Circuit; even amongst the Munster Circuit he would be able to get them answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the view that I have already put before this House, I want to say that the alteration of our judicial system was a very big measure.  It was carried out by the then Government following strictly upon the recommendations of the committee that had been set up.  It was not by any means a committee of experts.  There were several lay persons upon it.  It was rather a conservative committee and it made several recommendations which were embodied in the Courts of Justice Bill.  The most sweeping alteration of all the alterations that were brought in was undoubtedly that dealing with the appeal system which had been set up for the hearing of cases that had been previously heard in the Circuit Courts.  There is at the moment a very large congestion, <Col N="407" /> a great number of appeal cases to be heard and they are being heard very slowly.  As the House knows, in order to deal with that question it was necessary some time ago to appoint four Commissioners. These Commissioners brought the hearing of appeals up to date, but they have again fallen into arrear. I have no doubt that that system of appeals must be very carefully examined into.  It has now been working for a certain time.  I would prefer to see it worked out for a certain time so as to be in a position to see how the matter would solve itself.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a question for an inquiry as to how far the arrears in the hearing of appeals that now exist are due to a defect in the system itself, and how far this is due to the fact that there are not sufficient judges.  That is a matter that will have to be inquired into at some time or another.  Deputy Wolfe's motion is that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad be set up.  I am willing to accept that motion.  We will see what the joint wisdom of the two Houses will produce in the way of amendments. Deputy Redmond alluded to the Circuit Court Rules.  I have mentioned the fact that a new set of Court Rules has been drafted following out as far as this committee could follow out the suggestions contained in the report of a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  These rules are complete with the exception of the schedule dealing with costs.  That is under consideration at the moment and these rules will be laid on the Table of the House in a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is the opinion of the Dáil that the Agricultural Grant should be applicable only to the relief of rates on holdings which have a minimum of fifteen per cent. of the arable land of the <Col N="409" /> holding under tillage, and that the amounts so retained be devoted to increasing the grants to holdings complying with the regulations.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a very long period.  I put it down originally in view of the very unfair rating valuation which presses very heavily on the tillage farmer as compared with the grass farmer.  When land was valued under Griffiths' valuation a very high valuation was put on tillage land.  On the 21st June, 1928, Deputy Allen asked the Minister for Finance whether he intended having a re-valuation of agricultural land or not, and the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware that a case could be made for the revision of the valuation of many holdings, some of which have decreased in value owing to the decline of tillage and the unsuitability of the land for grazing purposes, and some of which, on the other hand, have been enhanced in value owing to reclamation, drainage and other improvements.  I could not at the present time undertake to initiate legislative proposals for a general valuation, which would be a very costly operation, but consideration will be given to the matter as soon as circumstances permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that reply, the Minister himself admitted that these people are being unfairly treated, that the tillage farmers have a very unfair valuation and have to pay very high rates in consequence.  At present, the Agricultural Grant is paid in respect of all occupiers of agricultural land, whether they till or not.  The rancher, with his thousand acres and his bullocks, gets the same benefit from the Agricultural Grant as a small farmer who tills his land and employs labour.  I think the House will admit that that is a very unfair proposition.  It is unfair, not alone to the tillage farmer who gives employment, but to the nation as a whole.  The population of the country has steadily gone down the decline marching side by side with the decline in tillage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> It was my intention when I put this motion on the Order Paper to press the matter and to endeavour to get the House to agree with me that a change in this very unfair state of affairs was required by providing that the individual who does not do his duty by the nation, the individual who does not till a certain proportion of his holding and give a certain amount of employment, should not get the benefit of the Agricultural Grant.  But there are two Commissions coming.  One of them is the De-rating Commission, which, I understand, is about to be set up, which will, I take it, go into this matter fully, and the decisions of which when they come before the House, will give us an opportunity of putting forward our views, and there is the Commission dealing with a grain-growing scheme.  I think the fact that these two Commissions are about to sit renders this motion unnecessary, at any rate at present, and I beg the leave of the House to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he is aware that Donegal <Col N="360" /> Bay, with a coastline of over one hundred and fifty miles from Glen Head to Erris Head, has within recent years been depleted of white fish of every description, due to the prevalent encroachment of fleets of foreign trawlers whose operations destroyed the spawning beds; whether, with a view to protecting the rights of the fishermen along this coastline and for the benefit of the industry on the Western coast for which Donegal Bay had been a spawning ground, the Minister will take the necessary steps to prohibit all trawling in Donegal Bay within a line drawn from Glen Head to Erris Head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no grounds for believing that the waters mentioned have been depleted of white fish of every description from the causes mentioned.  I have no power to prohibit trawling within the limits suggested, but steam trawling is prohibited by by-law under the Steam Trawling Act, 1889, within three miles from Glen Head and inside a line from Teelin Head to Rathlin O'Beirne, thence to Inishmurray to Lenadoon Point, and within three miles of the coast beyond that point.</P>
