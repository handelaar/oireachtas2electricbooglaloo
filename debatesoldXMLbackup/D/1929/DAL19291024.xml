      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state the amount received up to September 30th from the admission fee of threepence charged to persons wishing to enter the mail boat pier at Dun Laoghaire, and also, the cost of printing tickets of admission: and further, if he can state whether any printing firm in Dun Laoghaire or the neighbourhood was invited to tender for the printing of these tickets.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is £543 0s. 9d. and the <Col N="192" /> second part £2 10s. 0d.  As to the third part, the tickets are required in rolls, and in view of the fact that machinery suitable for producing tickets in that form is very limited it was not possible to have the work carried out in Dun Laoghaire or its immediate vicinity.</P>

      <Col N="193" /> In four cases no estimate can be made but there is clear evidence of the existence of fraudulent irregularities for considerable periods.  In two cases amounts of £30 8s. 4d. and £4 7s. 2d. can be definitely stated as being due, but there is, in addition, in each case a further undetermined liability.</P>
    <P>(c)  In each of the first twentythree cases referred to in the first paragraph of (b) the amount of the penalty imposed was £125 as mitigated by the District Justice.  In the remaining eight cases referred to in the same paragraph the amounts of the penalties were respectively:&mdash;</P>
    <P>£500, £500, £500, £500, £250, £250 £250, and £375.</P>
    <P>In the five cases where the amounts of duty withheld have been estimated, the respective penalties were £750, £750, £500, £1,000 and £1,500.  In the four cases where no estimates can be made the penalties amounted to sums of £13,000, £2,520, £500 and £250.  In the last two cases the penalties were £645 and £625.</P>
    <P>The figures given are in respect of all warrants issued, whether executed or not.  In cases where the warrants have been executed and the bookmakers imprisoned the amounts of duty shown were the amounts due at the date of the committal of the parties to prison.  In the cases of unexecuted warrants the amounts of duty at present due are quoted.</P>

      <P>A question of order arose last evening and I must repeat that it is not possible for us to have a debate here with a view to establishing the exact truth with regard to vexed questions of history, particularly the history of 1922.  The fact that was brought to my notice last night that there are persons in the House who have knowledge of the matter at issue, makes it all the more necessary to adhere to the ruling.  Deputy Aiken having gone a certain distance, the Chair will be reluctantly obliged, if the President is the next speaker, to permit him to pursue that line.  Having thus heard both sides, it will not be possible to have any further inquest or inquiry into questions of history and other speeches must be confined to the subject matter proper of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated practically all that the Government have to say on this matter on a previous occasion, what I have to say to-day is more or less a repetition of that. Deputy Aiken, in his speech yesterday, practically repeated what he said here two years ago.  He gave the same quotations from General Collins and President Griffith then as he gave last night, and he produced no new fact in connection with this particular motion.  As I stated on a previous occasion, the method of compensation in respect to damage to property or personal injuries was provided by what was <Col N="198" /> known as the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Code.  No other legal remedy lay open to any person in any part of this country other than through that Code, and that Code was in operation subject to certain limitations that were imposed by the action of the Local Government Ministry in Dáil Eireann from 1919 to 1921.</P>
      <P>There is no use in hiding this fact at this date, that the main, the principal, and the fundamental reason for the break with the British Local Government Board, as it was called, was the operation of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Code and the refusal of the councils, the rate-levying bodies throughout the country, to strike a criminal and malicious injuries rate in respect of property damaged through military operations of whatever character.  That is a matter that cannot be denied.  It formed the basis of the Commission set up to consider local government in 1920.  And even with that recommendation, and with the acceptance by Dáil Eireann of that principle, it was with very great and considerable difficulty that the local government machinery was kept functioning throughout the country.  The local councils were first faced with the withdrawal, or the withholding, of grants by the British Government at the time.  The burden was too heavy for the local bodies to bear.  It was not alone too heavy, but it was too precipitous.  Something like £10,000,000 had been awarded in decrees for compensation up to the time of the Truce.  There is no getting away from the fact that that was the law.  There were no other means of compensating any person who lost either property or sustained personal injuries during that period with the exception of the activities of such charitable or philanthropic organisations as the White Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal remedy was in respect of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Code.  Up to the end of the pre-Truce period&mdash;the llth July, 1921&mdash; no rate-levying authority within the jurisdiction of the Northern Government attorned to Dáil Eireann.  As far as I know&mdash;and I am scarcely in a position to more than express an <Col N="199" /> opinion&mdash;no grants were withheld in respect to that area.  With the exception of two or three small bodies, boards of guardians and district councils, the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann did not exercise jurisdiction within the area of Northern Ireland.  After the Truce other bodies attorned to Dáil Eireann. It is a nice question now, viewing in 1929 what transpired in 1921, as to whether or not any councils attorning after the Truce were or were not breaches of the Truce.  I am not going to express any opinion on it. In my office as Minister for Local Government, if the Custom House authorities, as they were then known &mdash;the British Local Government Board in Ireland&mdash;had endeavoured to get councils which had attorned to Dáil Eireann to go back to them after the Truce, I certainly would have regarded it as a breach of the Truce, and I think it would have been so regarded by Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>The position that we are in, then, is this, that the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann undertook to relieve county councils from the liability which the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Code placed upon them, and it was a very serious liability.  Had that Code operated scarcely any rate-levying council in the country would have been able to fulfil its obligations in connection with public services, because once the decree was lodged with the treasurer that decree had to be paid.  If the money were not in the hands of the treasurer for payment, then subsequent moneys coming in were earmarked for the payment, and it would have been absolutely impossible to carry on local government.</P>
    <P>So the situation was until the Treaty was signed.  Subsequent to the signing of the Treaty negotiations were undertaken by the late Chairman or the Provisional Government, General Michael Collins, Mr. O'Higgins and, I believe, Mr. Duggan on the one hand, and representatives of the British Government on the other hand.  They went into various questions affecting the transfer, and not alone affecting the transfer, <Col N="200" /> but dealing with the method of payment of compensation to persons whose property had been injured or damaged, and in respect of persons who had suffered personal injuries, or their representatives in the case of persons killed.  The agreement that was arrived at in January, 1922, was subsequently published, I think, about August, 1923.</P>
    <P>The time for making a case in respect of persons who had suffered loss and who might not have been covered by this international agreement was January, 1922.  The importance of that cannot be over-emphasised. Deputy Aiken mentioned last evening that the refusal of the courts to grant decrees in the cases of some of the persons mentioned here was in the spring of 1921.  Whose responsibility was it to bring that to the notice of the late General Collins?  Not mine. And here I might say that one must advert to the fact that this is 1929, that this is the Sixth Dáil, that the Government which is in office now can scarcely be criticised, for the acts of a Government which was in office in 1922, any more than the Government which was in office in 1922 could be criticised for acts of the Government which was in office in 1921.  The responsibility, if there is any, is as much that of Deputies on the other side of the House, who failed in their duty to make representations to the responsible Ministers in charge of the Government in 1922 regarding a disability under which their friends or the supporters of the national cause were suffering from in 1921 and get it corrected at a time when it was possible to make representations on behalf of those people.  I do not know whether Deputy Aiken was a representative of any district in Northern Ireland at the time, but some members of his Party were. Whose was the duty then of bringing to the notice of the responsible Ministers cases of hardship such as this?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>And this is another rather significant feature of this whole business.  This motion is brought forward resting, as far as I can judge, on two legs, one, the case for sympathy and compensation, and, the other, an opportunity of opening fire and of throwing mud. Which of the two is the predominant one?  That is for Deputies over there to answer; it is for Deputy Aiken to answer.  But, bearing in mind only the speech that the Deputy made last night, I am inclined to the view that it is apparently one of criticism rather than one of help. There were representatives of that Party members of the Northern Parliament.  I have a dossier here of the items which General Collins had to discuss with Sir James Craig. Compensation is not mentioned at all in any one of the items, and apparently it was not brought to his notice.  Many other items were, but that was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there was a legal right in respect to persons who suffered damage to property, and that was in the courts.  There was no other.  Persons could elect to go to the courts.  In certain cases they were warned down here not to go to the courts; they were warned that if they got a decree in the courts they would not be allowed to collect the money.  My responsibility as Minister for Local Government&mdash;if that is what I am answering for here&mdash;was to see that no money was lost to the councils.  It was not to see that no person lost money.  That was a subsequent business, which would be the concern of whoever was responsible for finance after the Treaty had been signed.  The Minister for Finance at that time was the person to whom representations in respect of that should have been made.  The councils got their money back, the withheld grants were paid in full by the British Government by reason of that agreement that was made by the late General Collins and the late Mr. O'Higgins on the one hand and the <Col N="202" /> British Ministers on the other.  As far as the councils were concerned they lost nothing on the transaction. It is all very well now to appear in a pure white sheet of political morality.</P>
    <P>What was the position of Deputy Aiken in 1922, at the time when this matter ought to have been discussed? Did he lend any help to General Collins in respect of any one of these matters?  Setting up the State, taking over from the British, reorganising the business of government, and all the rest of it, were big items, but they were not too big to exclude a, matter of this sort if it had been brought to notice at the proper time. Supposing for a moment in the excitement it might have been overlooked, was there not another occasion?  There was.  At the time of the introduction of the Damage to Property Act in this Dáil representations might have been made in respect of persons who had what we will call moral claims and who had not been paid.  No Deputy, no Party, as far as I can remember, was ever approached in connection with this matter.  There are Deputies here who were Deputies in the Third Dáil, and who paid particular attention to matters of this kind, but no representation was made when the Damage to Property Act of 1923 was under consideration.</P>
    <P>In 1929 we are seven years away from the disturbances.  What was the position of affairs in 1922?  I have been looking up some of the leading articles of the daily newspapers of that time, and practically one headline distinguished the whole of them&mdash;&ldquo;anarchical conditions&rdquo;&mdash;and during those anarchical conditions, when we had got to consider the setting up of a new State, more than likely cases such as those would have been overlooked.  Whose business was it to attend to them?  How is it that in 1929 they can be attended to, but nobody could think of them in 1922, being too busy on other matters?  In 1922, by reason of the agreement to which I have referred, the Chairman of the Compensation Commission came to this <Col N="203" /> country and went to the one place where he could function as Chairman of that Commission&mdash;his office.  What did he find?  It was occupied by armed men, not under the control of any Government in this country or out of it.  To him might have been put a case, if it was so desired, that there were others than those included in the terms of reference who had moral rights in respect of property that had been damaged.  But he had no place to function.  The place where he should have sat was occupied by armed men.  In 1929 we have practically forgotten that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy read yesterday evening a letter which was issued from my office and signed by myself.  One reference that he made reminded me of an amusing incident that occurred in a play recently where some forty or fifty years hence a certain gentleman said he had seen the name of the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, that he could not pronounce it, that no one in his office could pronounce it, but that one of his secretaries was able to spell it.  The letter is dated the 13th April.  Did the Deputy at all advert to the fact, or did he think that there might have been some proceedings previous to the issue of that? There was a body called into being by the late General Collins called the Northern Advisory Committee, consisting of persons he summoned to take counsel with and to advise him as regards the situation in the North. At a meeting held in the Council Chamber, Government Buildings, on 11th April, 1922, it was plainly put to them by me and by others that it was one thing to endeavour to have local government functioning under Dáil Eireann down here, but that it was another thing up there, and I advised that they should go back and attorn to the Northern Government.</P>
    <P>As a result of that meeting a decision was arrived at that the Nationalist members of the councils should come together and decide whether they would go back and recognise the Northern Parliament. Arising out of that, the letter the <Col N="204" /> Deputy refers to was issued.  I cannot recollect every incident that happened during that rather crowded, difficult and anarchical period known as 1922.  There was another quantity&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;&mdash;of positively political propaganda in Deputy Aiken's speech last night, devoted to proving that Dáil Eireann represented the whole of Ireland&mdash;the whole of the 32 counties is probably the way the Deputy put it.  We live now in 1929, and in the light of what I have said, and in the light of the knowledge and of the information at the disposal of Deputies in all parts of the House, is it seriously stated that Dáil Eireann was the de facto and the de jure Government in the Six Counties at any time?  Did the writ of Dáil Eireann run up there?  Did it run either in a military manner or in a political manner?  I do not believe it did.</P>
    <P>There were various occasions from 1922 up to 1923 or 1924 in respect of which representations might have been made about these cases.  I am not satisfied from the Deputy's statement of the case that he really meant to benefit it.  If we examine certain portions of his speech in the light of the events of the period, was it wise for the Deputy to commit himself so completely as he did in respect of certain incidents?  Does anybody think that, after reading that speech, if representations were made either to the British Government or the Northern Government, consideration would be given to the case of Mr. McGuill?  I would not say so.  The Deputy in his extravagances went so far as to say that in answer to a question to me I mentioned that in a number of cases persons had got, by reason of the addition of the 10 per cent., more money than they had claimed.  It was the Minister for Finance who answered that question, although it was addressed to me, and the qualification he put in with regard to the word &ldquo;number&rdquo; was &ldquo;in a very small number of cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We gain nothing by endeavouring to alter or to suit to our own advantage statements that have been <Col N="205" /> made.  It is always better to give the exact words.  If they cannot be remembered, that is another matter.  The position with regard to these cases is (1) there was a time when representations in respect of them could have been made.  The Deputy allowed that to pass.  To use the language which they attribute to me, they abandoned those people at that time.</P>
    <P>Do these cases exhaust the number of persons who have claims against someone in Northern Ireland?  Is that the whole list?  Is the sum of £20,000 mentioned by Deputy Aiken a full and complete amount of the compensation that could be claimed? What is the size of the door we are asked to open?  We are asked to do this in 1929 for property destroyed as far back as 1920.  Speaking for myself I would say, in respect of pre-Truce damage, that by reason of certain amendments made in connection with the International Compensation Tribunal set up here, consideration might have been legitimately pushed and pressed upon the Government here in respect of these cases.  But in respect of the period after the Treaty had passed I do not see how, without admitting or condoning breaches of the Truce, it would be within the competence even of the Dáil to give compensation in those cases.  Three bodies&mdash; two rural district councils and one board of guardians&mdash;declared allegiance to Dáil Eireann about July, 1920.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I could give the records, but I could give the names, or post thorn to the Deputy, if he wishes.  One authority communicated with us in April of 1922, and most of the others&mdash;about twenty local authorities&mdash;corresponded after 1922.  This is, as I have said, 1929.  This damage was done in 1920.  I put it there would be very considerable difficulty in assessing damage in that case.  It might be possible to do it, but as I have said, two questions arise, (1) the difficulty of assessing the compensation, and (2) the question of how many other claims of this sort are likely to materialise, and what is the responsibility of the people here for paying the whole of that compensation. No representations, as far as I know, were made in the Northern Parliament in respect of these people.  So far as our people are concerned they have paid the damage done within the area of our jurisdiction.  No representations were made in respect of these people in the British Parliament; and I myself, on more than one occasion, suggested the advisability of putting a properly briefed and organised case in respect to these people.  Nothing has been done, and I regret that I can go no further than what I said in November, 1927, on this matter.</P>

      <P>Very well, then. The appeal for these people must be to the body of the members of the House, and we ask the members whether it is fair that these people who have suffered grievous loss should be abandoned by us.  There <Col N="207" /> will probably be a difference of opinion as to what should or should not have been done in 1922, but surely there was one time when the claims of these people should have been before the minds of the Ministers on the other side, and that was at the time when the Boundary Settlement of the 3rd December, 1925, was being signed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely when you were undertaking, on the part of the people of the Twenty-Six Counties here, to pay the cost of all the damage in the Twenty-Six Counties, it should occur to anyone making a settlement of that kind that there was another part of this country where damage of a similar character had occurred and that it was the duty of those who were making a settlement of that kind to see that these people's interests would be looked after.  Surely the President is not going to say that he was not aware any kind of damage had been done there.  I am sure he is not going to ask us to believe that he was not aware that the courts there were very unlikely, apart altogether from any actual cases that had occurred, to deal in a proper manner with claims made by people like McGuill and others who had been burned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President says he rightly distinguishes between two classes of cases, the cases before 1920.  I say we have a very definite and clear obligation as far as these are concerned. With regard to the others he says there is a difficulty in pressing these claims on account of the fact that it would appear to be condoning breaches of the Truce.  It does not matter whether it appears to be condoning breaches of the Truce or what it appears to be condoning; the fact is there.  The fact is that as a result of operations which were carried on in that particular area, houses of certain individuals who were friendly to the <Col N="208" /> administration of Dáil Eireann were burned down.  I am trying to take as charitable a view as I can of the difficulties of members on the other side during that particular period, but surely we are not going to forget the whole of the circumstances. What were they?  That certain people in the Six Counties were trying to drive those with Nationalist sympathies out of it.  They were not respecting the Truce, and if there were people in that area who made up their minds that they were going to defend themselves, were they not right?  What are we to be ashamed of?</P>
    <P>Whether you were on this side of the House or on that during that period, the action of these people in defending themselves was justifiable. We have nothing to be ashamed of, and I say that it is a shameless thing, no matter what may have been the circumstances, if we now, having these particular cases of injustice brought to our notice, stand idly by and say that those people, because they have no votes here, are going to be forgotten.  To my mind it is a clear duty to the people in the Twenty-Six Counties. They supported us.  The fact that they are not very numerous is all the more reason why we should be just towards them if not generous.  The fact, as was pointed out, that they had taken up a position in Banbridge and other places of the kind where it did take a man to stand up in those circumstances ought to be an argument for us now not to abandon those people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the history of the period.  I do not want to talk of the conditions in the Four Courts and in Beggars' Bush Barracks at that time.  Let us put that aside if you like and let any differences there may be amongst us as to the happenings of that time not blind us now to our obvious duty. I think Deputy Aiken has made a definite case of responsibility, as far as we are concerned, for compensating these people, and I appeal to the House not to act so unfairly or unjustly towards those people.  As I said there was an obvious time when <Col N="209" /> Ministers on the other side should have looked after these cases.  That was when they were taking over responsibility for damage done by the British forces in the Twenty-six Counties.  They should have made provision at that time.  They had the representatives of the Northern Government there.  That was the time obviously to make proper provision, but if that moment is lost and there is nothing to be done at present in dealing with either those in the Northern area or in Britain, then it is our obvious duty, if we cannot get other people to undertake what we regard as their obligation in that matter, to do it ourselves.</P>

      <P>I can assure you, A Chinn Comhairle, that I am not going to outstep your rulings in the matter of order by going into any historical disclosures, for the very simple reason that I know nothing of these matters except what I have heard from one side or the other in this debate.  Perhaps because of that, I hope to look at it from the point of view of the motion as it appears to me on the Order Paper. I make a distinction too&mdash;I think it has been more or less admitted by the other side&mdash;between the people in the first batch mentioned in this motion and those in the second batch. Personally, I have no hesitation in saying that any claims there may be are much stronger in the case of the first batch than in the case of those that are mentioned later.  The President said that the writ of Dáil Eireann did not run at any time in the Six Counties.  I do not think the President will say that at that time, at any rate, the Boundary was drawn.  In 1920 there was no Boundary.</P>

      <P>I was not referring to that specially.  I was thinking of the fight as a whole, that there was no limitation as to where the fight was to be carried on in 1920. The idea was wherever the foreigner could be hampered and interfered with it was to be done.  That is, at least, as I understood it.  Therefore, I do not think there is any force in that argument of the President.  I was not impressed, I must say, with the case the President put up against this claim, because it struck me that the only case was that this matter was not raised in 1922.  It may be true that it was the people on this side of the House that should have raised it.</P>

I think it was the President who said that nobody raised this question or mentioned it at all at any time.  I have here a quotation to show that there were people who raised it before 1929.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1925 when the 10 per cent. portion of the Boundary Agreement was under discussion Deputy Morrissey, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, raised the case of these people and wanted to know whether or not or why there was not some arrangement made at that time with the Northern Government or the British Government to get compensation for the people who suffered in the North.  I am sorry that we did not get the names of those people on that occasion.  We might have been in a stronger position then if we had them but we did know at the time that there were people who had suffered in the North and who, to our mind&mdash;and we stated it very plainly at the time&mdash;were being thrown overboard.  I do not want to go into this thing at any great length but I do feel that there is a moral obligation.  I am not putting it any stronger than that.  I know and the President has admitted it that people whose claims were no stronger than that did get compensation.  We set up a Committee, at the time we were compensating everybody, to deal with cases of personal injuries.  They had, as I understand, no legal claim or no right to prosecute their claim legally.  Still it was considered that there was a moral obligation to pay some compensation and a tribunal was set up to investigate their claims and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this Dáil is not the place to decide what people should be paid, who should be paid, and how much they should be paid, but I think there is a moral obligation on the Dáil to set up some kind of impartial tribunal to fix a date in which claims should be made. Deputy Aiken, I suppose, is not in a position to say that those who are mentioned in the motion are the only people.  There may be others. That was one of the President's difficulties, and I quite recognise it is a difficulty.  There may be a great many cases, but it seems to me that <Col N="212" /> there is a limitation in these particular ones, in so far as they were ones who were refused compensation because British military witnesses swore that the destruction was done by them through military necessity.  It seems to me that that would limit the number of people very considerably.  There cannot be very many of that type who would be claiming compensation.  I would appeal to the President not to stand too firmly on what he says are his legal rights, and the fact that seven years have elapsed since those occurrences.  Undoubtedly, those people suffered, and suffered very considerably.  That is admitted. There is no question about it.  I do not know how far money paid now can even compensate them, or to what extent it could compensate them for the losses they have sustained. I do say, despite the fact that there is no legal obligation, or that seven years have elapsed, that the President should give very favourable consideration to the question of setting up some kind of tribunal that would examine these cases coolly and impartially&mdash; examine all the evidence that would be available.  It could not be done here, as everybody knows.  They could see what recommendations could be made in the way of compensation. We would know, in any case, the size of the problem, and we would feel that there was no one who suffered during that time who did not get a chance to make a claim.  If their claims were just and fair, even if there was only a moral obligation on us that obligation should be met.</P>
    <P>In so far as the motion itself is concerned, I think the Deputy has made a mistake in tacking on the second portion to it, at this stage in any case.  If this motion is passed we might as well drop the first part of it.  If you are trying to get somebody to pay and you say &ldquo;If you do not pay, we will pay it ourselves&rdquo; you are not going to get anything from the British in that case.  If you are going to raise this with the British drop the latter <Col N="213" /> part of the motion until we see how we get on with them.  There is no use in passing the two things together. If the Deputy will look into it he will admit the force of that argument.  We could not go to the British saying &ldquo;Of course, we would like you to pay this but if you do not pay it we will pay it ourselves.&rdquo; That is, in effect, what the motion says.  I am prepared to support the claim for re-opening this matter and I suggest to the President that the way I have mentioned ought to be adopted.  The question ought to be gone into by a tribunal. After all, in 1925 when that boundary settlement was made there was a document with a very interesting preamble signed by the representatives of this State and by the representatives of the Northern Government and the British Government. I do not know whether the President has forgotten the terms of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell has spoken about this matter in a reasonable way.  The President indicated that we do feel that there is a difference between the post-Truce and pre-Truce cases.  I think the President indicated that we had a disposition to consider further the pre-Truce cases.  We are not giving under our Damage to Property (Compensation) Act complete compensation to anyone&mdash;at least we did not set out to give complete compensation.  In many cases we gave very much less than complete compensation, in order to prevent the bill for compensation growing too big.  We hedged round our Act with various restrictions.  We cut out, for instance, consequential damage, and there are many people in the Free State who suffered great loss and they only got compensation to a very small extent, because the material damage done to their property may have been trivial, but the consequential damage resulting from that material damage may have been very great.  They only got compensated for the material damage, and were very much out of pocket as a result.  We had time limits and other things, and certain <Col N="215" /> people failed to get compensation because, for instance, they did not come within the time limits.  So that, apart from the argument that the President has already used on the legal position, it could not be very strongly argued that anybody in the North was entitled to claim complete compensation&mdash;that the principle of complete compensation had been accepted.</P>
      <P>I think, and the President has very clearly indicated it, that the post-Truce cases are cases that we could not consider at all.  With regard to the pre-Truce cases, while not going as far as admitting that we have a moral obligation in regard to them, and while recognising the fact that the payment of compensation to residents in Northern Ireland is not exactly the same as paying compensation to residents in the Free State, because paying compensation to residents in the Free State involves the principle of spreading the liability over the whole citizens, all of whom will contribute, nevertheless there is a certain precedent, I think, for doing something in respect of pre-Truce cases in the North, and that precedent is in our repayment of the Dáil Loan.  It might be argued that the Dáil Loan was raised for the purposes of the whole of Ireland, yet we are not simply repaying 26/32, or some fraction&mdash;we are repaying in full.  If the people of the Free State shouldered a liability which was only, if you look at it from one point of view, partly theirs, it is a precedent, if we thought well to do it, for asking them to shoulder a certain measure of responsibility in regard to cases in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to look at the question of compensation for people in the Six Counties it is really full of practical difficulties.  We have the difficulty of not knowing, as the President indicated, what is the extent of the door that we are opening. I have already said that we put various restrictions in the Damage to Property Act in order to keep the bill from growing too heavy.  We refused people any compensation in respect of consequential loss solely in <Col N="216" /> order that the burden that was going to be thrown on the general taxpayer might he kept as small as possible, and if we adhered to the principle observed in drawing up that Act, we could not open the door widely in respect of these Northern cases.  Before we decide to open the door at all we ought to have some idea of what amount is going to be involved, because, while we might be quite ready to throw a certain amount on the people of the Free State in the same way as we throw on them the entire responsibility for the Dáil Loan, we might hesitate if the amount was going to be ten times that hypothetical sum.  Consequently we can hardly come to a decision unless we know roughly within one hundred per cent., shall we say, of what was going to be involved.  Then, even if we found what the sum involved in these particular pre-Truce cases was going to be, we would be up against the difficulty of investigation and of deciding what amounts should be given to individuals.</P>
    <P>Before I pass away from the question of the number of cases that would be involved.  I think the only sort of case that could be considered would be these military necessity cases as they have been called. Other people in the Six Counties have suffered great hardship, but I do not think we can, at this stage, or that we could at any stage have contemplated compensating them for their loss, because the amount would possibly have been very great. There were people, for instance, whose property was damaged in the pogroms and who got compensation which may have been very inadequate. We could not consider the question of giving them additional sums.  There were people who suffered because they were driven out during the pogroms.  We could not contemplate dealing with their cases at this stage.</P>
    <P>Looking round it as well as I can, I think there is no sort of case that we could consider except these military necessity cases, but if we found that the number of them was not going to be so great as to prevent us going on with the consideration <Col N="217" /> of them, we would have to recognise that it would be very hard indeed to assess the damage in an individual case.  Normally in these cases we have a court.  Probably, if it were not for the existence of the Boundary, if they were on our own territory, we would have a court sitting in each district.  We would have witnesses from the districts; we would have investigators with full facilities for seeing the ruins of the premises and for getting any information that accrued in regard to them and so assisting the tribunal, whatever it might be.  If we are going to deal with these cases we would have to have a very much less complete investigation and examination of them, I think, and anything that was given, I think, would be given more or less on a rough-and-ready basis as simply an attempt to alleviate distress.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much use in making any proposal to the British Government for payment of compensation here.  So far as the Free State was concerned right through the negotiations that took place with regard to the work of the Shaw or the Wood Renton Commission, both before that Commission was set up, and while it was at work, the British steadfastly refused to allow military necessity cases to be dealt with by that Commission.  And what happened in the end was the British said: &ldquo;We will allot a sum of £900,000; we will compound our liability for £900,000 and you can make any terms of reference you like, and the Commission can do what it likes, but so far as we are concerned we will have nothing to do with any payment for the military necessity cases.&rdquo;  They took up that position with regard to the Free State and, consequently, I think, it would be waste of time to approach the British in regard to these cases in the North of Ireland.  If anything is to be done for these people who suffered in the common struggle prior to the Truce it must be done by the Free State.</P>
    <P>I have been discussing this matter with the President and I would not <Col N="218" /> object to setting aside a moderate sum of money if that would suffice. If these cases which Deputy Aiken put up are all the cases he knows in his area or that exist in his area and which are pre-Truce cases I do not think, even when we take the other Border counties, that the pre-Truce cases can be very numerous, or involve such large sums of money.  I would have no objection to putting aside a few thousand pounds and setting up some sort of a tribunal that would, in the best way it could, by, as I have said, necessarily some rough and ready method, allot a measure of compensation that would relieve the hardships of people whose houses and property were destroyed in the pre-Truce period.  I think if we are to do this at all that it should be done without fresh legislation, and in an informal way by the allocation of ex gratia grants.  We feel that on legal ground there is no claim from these people.  We are not prepared to go even so far as saying that they have a moral claim, but we do say that the people who had their houses burned down in pre-Truce if they are not to get any compensation at all have had ill-luck beyond anybody else who suffered in the struggle, and, for that reason, we would be prepared to consider some help for them.</P>

I am glad they have gone that far, but I did not hear the President say that, and, certainly, the Minister for Finance in his letter to me, which I read the other night, did not say it.  The President said we seem to be concerned more with throwing mud than trying to get compensation in these cases.  I should like the President to produce <Col N="219" /> some evidence of that statement.  The people whose cases we are espousing here have made representations time and time again.  The Minister for Finance asked for details.  I gave him all the details in my power to get.  As far as I know, the amount of money necessary to cover the cases I have mentioned, pre-Truce and post-Truce, would amount to less than £20,000.  The amount of money claimed in the Courts was £21,000.</P>
      <P>Before we go any further, I want to know where we stand.  If the Government want time to make up their minds further and to get their proposals definitely into writing, we are not going to press them.  As I say, our object is to get compensation for those people who we think are entitled to be compensated by this House.  The cases are not limited to pre-Truce; they include pre-Truce and post-Truce cases of people who were burned out and were refused compensation on the plea of military necessity.  If the Government are prepared to set up a tribunal of any description to which these people can make representations we would be delighted. If they are not prepared to make up their minds to-day the debate can be easily postponed with the consent of the House, and they can make up their minds definitely and produce their proposals here in writing.  But certainly I am not prepared to withdraw my motion because it was sympathetically dealt with by any Minister.  I pause for a moment to hear what the Minister has to say further.</P>

      <P>Neither the President nor the Minister for Finance made any reply whatsoever to the case I put up yesterday for compensation in all those cases.  The President said the cases were not pressed in 1922.  What was the Northern Advisory Committee doing?  What did the Boundary Commission do?  The President asked the leader of the Labour Party very innocently was he in a position in 1926 when he raised this question to mention even one case, leaving it to be assumed that the President did not know anything about these cases.  I have on this file a thousand and one letters that were written to these Ministers, or their representatives or to people responsible to them, from 1922 to 1929.  If this justice is to be a matter of dating obligations passing out after a certain limited time, surely on that it could have been pleaded that it was wrong to compensate people who came out in 1916.  They were given pensions under the Pensions Act of 1923, seven years after the actions for which they had given service. Some of them, it is well known, gave no service for the pensions they obtained for 1916.  It cannot be said that these people did not make sacrifices.  The ruins of their homes are there to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The President did not deny any of the statements that I made yesterday, which statements go to prove the responsibility of this Assembly for the military actions which resulted in the houses of these people being burned, both in 1922 and 1923. The President did not deny, as Deputies will have noticed, that Michael Collins met the Northern representatives in the City Hall after the Provisional Government was set up.  He did not deny that Michael Collins made the statements that I quoted, nor did he deny that Arthur Griffith made the statements that I quoted, nor did he deny that Eoin O'Duffy, who was then Chief of Staff of the forces under the control of Dáil Eireann, made the statements that I quoted.  Neither did he deny that he himself sent the letter that I quoted to members of local government bodies.  Neither did he deny that the letter which I quoted yesterday was sent to the Northern teachers in November, 1923.  Neither did he deny that the officers and men of the Second Northern Division&mdash;some of them&mdash;were kept in the Curragh Camp unattested in the National Army until January, 1923, and paid.  He has made absolutely no reply to the case which I put up for the compensation of those people &mdash;absolutely none.  The speech of the Minister for Finance was as usual. &ldquo;We will give it friendly consideration &mdash; sympathetic consideration.&rdquo; The Minister never allows his sympathy to get as far as his heart.  It never gets much further than his lips, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>There is a human aspect to this problem as well as a national one, and I would like Deputies to consider this thing from the point of view of the people affected.  I know most of these people personally, the people whom the Minister now definitely turns down.  I know that these families, some of them, did as much as any family in Ireland to help to achieve the measure of freedom that we enjoy here in the Twenty-six Counties.  Surely to goodness, if we claim here that we enjoy freedom, we should be prepared to pay for it.  When there is <Col N="222" /> a battle on, it would be wrong for people to fall out of the firing line to look after wounded soldiers, but what would any man say of a company that, after a successful action, left their wounded men lying on the ground unattended to?  It is claimed that we have had a successful action here, that we represent successful forces, and yet we allow our wounded to lie on the ground unattended.  What worse wound could a man have than to be unable to support himself and his family?</P>
    <P>One of these cases I know very well, a man who, as I said yesterday, in a place where it was not very popular, went out and supported the Republican cause.  He became a representative, was subjected to great terrorism and was taken out and beaten.  The British made an attempt to murder him. He escaped in his night clothes and had to leave his wife behind.  She very narrowly escaped with her life. Afterwards, in a period for which the Minister accepts no responsibility, the British forces attempted to rape this gentleman's wife, his mother-in-law and the maidservants in the house.  Regarding this particular case, the mother-in-law afterwards had to leave this country because her son-in-law, whose house was burned, was unable to keep her. She went to America and joined her son there.  Shortly afterwards, owing to the great hardship she suffered, it was found that she was ill and dying.  I remember being in a hotel in Portland when a ring came telling me that this old lady, living out in the mountains with her son, was dying.  I went out a distance of a hundred miles into the woods to see her.  I saw her and talked with her about this case, as to whether anything could be done for her.  I left her dying under the care of her son.  When I got as far as Chicago I received a wire saying that her son had been shot dead accidentally. This old lady was then left to the care of the Irish in that district.</P>
    <P>Another family that is affected, and one that I know very well, is the Byrne family.  Their house was burned out in the period for which <Col N="223" /> the Minister does not accept responsibility. Two sons of that family, fine young men, fought with me during the Black-and-Tan war in a district where not one in a thousand was in favour of the Republican movement.  They are now in New York, one of them working in the subways and another working on the buses.  One of them was in eighteen jobs in eighteen months, trying to earn enough money to reerect the buildings that were burned down.  I believe that if the members of this Assembly do not do something it will be a disgrace to them, a disgrace to everybody who says that the Free State is free and who accepts the Free State as the be-all and the end-all of this people here in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Surely, instead of simply throwing off all responsibility we should get together and unite in forcing the Government to meet their responsibilities? Surely, if the back benchers of Cumann na nGaedheal have any sense of decency left, any sense of self-respect, they should get together and force the Government to make grants in those cases.  They should be manly enough to do that.  Surely, they have not so lost all sense of self-respect that they will allow the Government to get out of this without even attempting to make a case for their position.  I hope they have not sold their souls to that extent, but that they will get together and force the Government to do something for these people.  I will watch very carefully indeed to see whether into the Division Lobby to vote in favour of the Government will go a number of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who have been writing sympathetic letters to the people affected, both in the period for which the Minister now accepts responsibility and in the period for which he does not accept responsibility.  I hope that these Deputies will say to themselves &ldquo;After all, if membership of Cumann na nGaedheal is going to entail my losing my self-respect to the extent that I am going to do a thing that I know to be dishonourable, a disgraceful <Col N="224" /> action&mdash;then to the devil. with being a member of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I will be a T.D. of some other description.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but I do so now owing to some reports which appeared in the Press.  I would not like it to be thought that I would support the amendment if the same medical benefits were to be straight away extended to towns and country districts as outlined in the Report.  In the amendment we ask that proposals be laid before the Dáil providing for the administration of national health insurance through one society and also for medical benefit.  We, of course, would naturally hold ourselves free to consider these proposals when they come before us in order to see whether or not we could agree with them.  Deputy O'Connell yesterday spoke of a State medical service and, so far as I personally am concerned, I believe that that would be an ideal solution; but as this Bill is dealing with insured persons, I do not know whether we could really bring in an amendment for a State medical service under the Bill.  We can only deal with insured persons.  As I am not, and never have been, a dispensary doctor, I will not be taken as prejudiced when I say that generally I never found any fault with dispensary doctors, but what I say is wrong is that people who are insured and working for their living should be tainted with pauperism if they have to employ a medical dispensary doctor as at present.  It is, on the other hand, rather unfair to ask these people to pay a medical doctor in the ordinary way.  There is a difficulty which I believe could be got over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that we do not want to have overlapping by having insured people going to dispensary <Col N="230" /> doctors and also having doctors for the destitute poor.  It should be possible for a Government department to formulate a scheme that would combine both systems and prevent overlapping.  We have experience of the medical dispensary system and we know what is good and what is bad in it.  We could easily get evidence as to how the panel system is working in England. It ought to be possible for a commission, or for a Government department without a commission, to arrange a scheme that would combine the good points in both and have no overlapping.  That, of course, is approaching a State medical service but if it must be called a State medical service we are getting nearer to our ideal.  I think that the question of overlapping could altogether be avoided.  The great difficulty is that towns and cities are well-placed for a panel system such as operates in England, but there would be practically no advantage in having a panel system in country districts.  In towns with a population of 3,000, 4,000 or over people would, at least, have a choice of doctors.  That would be a great advantage under medical benefits. At present people are confined to one dispensary doctor unless they are prepared to pay.  It is possible that in most towns the dispensary doctor would be the best doctor and would be chosen by the people if they had a choice under the panel.  The fact that people would have a choice and also that they feel that they are paying for medical service which they are getting in towns would remove the stigma of pauperism which they have to endure at present.</P>
    <P>It is a different matter in the country.  In the country districts where you have only one doctor within a radius of six or seven miles, if the benefits are brought in they would not be any great advantage to insured persons because they would have to go to the same doctor in any case.  The only advantage would be that they would not be going to him under the Poor Law as at present but would be going as a right under the insurance scheme.  I do not know if <Col N="231" /> people in the country districts as a whole are prepared to pay for that right, so that any scheme that would be introduced would have to take into account the difference between conditions in the towns and cities and the country parts of this State. I would not like to be taken as voting for this amendment if that were to be considered as approving of the scheme outlined in the report. It would appear from certain reports in the Press to-day that we are by this amendment approving of the scheme outlined in the report.  It is just to make my position and the position of other members of the Party clear that I rose to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is due to national pride that we all seem to realise that none of us here would be guilty of the National Health Insurance Act of 1911, with all its faults and limitations.  On all sides, just as the persons who put that report together, we are out for the ideal.  It is not necessary for a Government to wait to know whether the ideal is feasible or practicable or whether it is money or anything else that is the difficulty. Once you are a Government you must have courage.  The rest is quite simple, and the most complicated scheme can be put together, of course subject to whatever criticism may arise afterwards.  We are dealing with the 1911 Act, and the present Bill will secure that every insured person in future will be an ordinary insured member.  There will be no discrimination, such as there was before, between exempt persons and deposit contributors or persons like that.  An insured person will simply be an insured member and in the case of women, women, on marriage will get a gratuity that is actuarially equitable.  If they come back into employment after that, they will come back as new members.  It secures that there will be very much less non-compliance, if any at all, and it secures that if good care is not taken of the finances of approved societies, the want of care can be brought home by audit, to the persons actually responsible.</P>

      <P>Outside that it deals with the sanatorium benefit and with insurance committees. The points that have been at issue in the debate are (1) that no action is taken to bring about the unification of societies, and (2) that no action has been taken about the securing of medical benefits.  Exception is taken to doing away with the sanatorium benefit as a benefit under the Act, and to the suppression of insurance committees.  The question has been raised as to the compensation to the employees of insurance committees. I said yesterday I was prepared to bring in an amendment which would give the Commissioners power to give certain compensation to employees of approved societies who were disemployed as a result of voluntary amalgamation taking place within a limited period, and that would give power to the Commissioners after that to bring about compulsory amalgamation.  After a discussion with the Ceann Comhairle in the matter I find from him that the outline of the Bill as introduced is too restricted to allow of an amendment of that kind to be brought in on Committee.  I have further discussed the matter with the Commissioners of National Health Insurance, and what I have decided is that I will take steps to put before the House immediately after the Christmas Recess a separate Bill containing proposals with regard to amalgamation along the lines that I outlined here.  I think that as we cannot get it in this Bill that is the most satisfactory way to deal with it.  I do want to make that position clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the criticism that has been levelled about removing the sanatorium benefit from the Act, we have to take to some extent the history of sanatorium benefit and the history of the development of schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis here. The Tuberculosis Act of 1908 gave county councils power to institute <Col N="233" /> schemes for the purpose of dealing with the treatment of tuberculosis cases.  When the 1911 National Health Insurance Act came to be formulated it was realised that the 1908 Act, in so far as dealing with tuberculosis was concerned, had been a failure for the reason that the entire financial burden of the carrying out of schemes under that Act was left to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the 1911 Act was being dealt with&mdash;they were not clear as to what the commitments of sanatorium benefit would be&mdash;sanatorium benefit was introduced.  Immediately after doing that and making provision for giving sanatorium treatment to insured persons, it was made quite clear that it would be necessary to make effective provision for sanatorium treatment in the case of ordinary tuberculosis patients who were not insured.  The result was that in 1913 provision was made for fifty per cent. of any expenditure by the local bodies in the case of tuberculosis schemes to be borne by the State.  Arrangements were made that the insurance committees that dealt with National Health Insurance would work in with the local bodies.  The development of the treatment of tuberculosis by the local bodies, and also the actuarial and general position with regard to the treatment under the 1911 Act, were such that in 1920 in Great Britain sanatorium benefit was removed from the Act without any reduction of the contribution from the insured person. Here the matter has continued as it is until now.  At the present moment the amount of money at the disposal of insurance committees for the treatment of tuberculosis cases amongst insured persons is £27,000 approximately per annum.  In the year 1922-23 the amount of money given by the State as the fifty per cent. share of the total expenditure on tuberculosis schemes throughout the country was £21,000.  So that whereas perhaps not as much as £27,000 was being spent by insurance committees in 1922, about £42,000 was being spent by the local bodies <Col N="234" /> on general tuberculosis schemes.  But the position here in the matter of the treatment of tuberculosis is very much improved since then.  Whereas there was £21,000 given in State grants in 1922-23 as the State part of the scheme, the actual expenditure in 1927-28 was £41,000.  The estimated expenditure during the current year as a result of the State grant is £59,000.  So that the position to-day is that while the insurance committees are spending £27,000 a year they have at their disposal between local bodies and the.  State approximately £110,000, which is being spent on the treatment of tuberculosis cases throughout the country, apart altogether from the moneys that have been spent on the building of sanatoria throughout the country.  Now, four-fifths of the £27,000 that is at the disposal of the insurance committees is actually handed over by the insurance committees to the local bodies dealing with tuberculosis schemes.</P>
    <P>The whole expenditure, with the exception of about £5,000, on tuberculosis treatment is actually being spent through the local bodies.  I think that ought to dispose of the argument that is being used here. that the throwing of this work over on the boards of health is going to place additional work on the boards of health, work that these boards are not able to bear.  In connection with that, too, if it were throwing additional work over on the boards of health, the boards of health have statutory powers that enable them to set up sub-committees to deal with that work.  Any part of its work can be devolved by the board of health to a sub-committee consisting of not less than three persons.  These persons may consist entirely of members of the board of health or members of the board of health and outside people, or that committee may consist entirely of persons outside the board of health.  So that if this were throwing additional work on the board of health there is in the board of health now machinery to deal with it.  It has been asserted that a right of insured persons, <Col N="235" /> which is absolutely assured to them and for which they have paid, is being taken from them.  That is not a fact, because the National Health Insurance Act of 1911 does not secure as a right to insured persons sanatorium treatment.  It does ensure that a limited amount of money is set aside for that treatment, but if that money was set aside, where it does not cover that treatment, then they have to fall back on other means.</P>
    <P>The position has been that a number of the insurance committees whether dealing directly with funds themselves or whether handing over their funds to the board of health, have not had sufficient money to deal with all their insured persons and what has happened is that the insurance committees have been in the position of having to discriminate between the insured persons in their area who will get sanatorium treatment and those who will have to run the gauntlet of having to pay something for it if the local body does not give them assistance under their own schemes.  Persons may be recommended for sanatorium treatment early in the year when moneys are available for the insurance committees, but towards the end of the year when the moneys are used up persons looking for sanatorium treatment have to come in under the ordinary schemes.  If you examine the number of persons insured and the number of persons not insured who are being treated under tuberculosis schemes in different parts of the country, you will see that the percentage of persons who are insured persons is very much greater than the percentage of moneys that are insured moneys as compared with those moneys that are not insured.</P>
    <P>You are not taking away from insured persons anything that they actually have at the moment. Instead of transferring them in 1920, as was the case in Britain, you are transferring them here in 1929 when the general public expenditure on tuberculosis schemes has gone up by 500 per cent. and when, apart altogether from the money, you have <Col N="236" /> more efficient methods being employed for dealing with them.  It was suggested here that transferring insured persons to the local bodies would mean taking from them privileges they had under the insurance committees.  I think Deputy Corish specially mentioned that.  He said they got butter, milk and eggs and other provisions like that through the operation of insurance committees and that they could not get those things from local bodies.  Any provision of this nature that is made under an insurance committee is provided on medical advice, and medical advice to the effect that these provisions are required can be and is given under the ordinary tuberculosis scheme throughout the country.  If there were people in receipt of eggs. milk and butter in Wexford where there is an agreed scheme between the insurance committee and the board of health, then the patients were receiving them under the board of health scheme and not under any pet arrangement of the insurance committee itself.</P>

      <P>A point, has been raised with regard to the provision of compensation for employees of insurance committees whose services are dispensed with.  Section 22 (4) (a) is intended to contain powers to deal with that matter.  In connection with that I desire to say that it has to be realised, in dealing with compensation paid to such persons, that out of 31 insurance committees in the country only 6, including 2 county boroughs, have more than £1,000 per annum to administer.  Another 6 have between £750 and £1,000.  Out of 31 committees there are at least 9 that have less than £750 a year to administer.  It will be, therefore, understood that the employees of these local bodies are all part-time, and a large number of them are persons who hold other occupations, sometimes under local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of medical benefits, apparently we all want the ideal scheme.  I think everyone realises that whatever scheme of medical benefits may come, it has to be visualised with the background of the dispensary system here.  It is suggested that the Committee should put up a scheme for giving medical benefits.  A scheme was put up, and the Committee recommended that it would not be put into force without lots of different parties being brought into consultation in order to see how the details of it could be worked out.  As I said yesterday, we have not arrived at a point when we could bring forward proposals dealing with medical benefit.  The more wasteful the administration of National Health Insurance is, the less <Col N="238" /> near you will be to the day when you can give medical benefits.  It has been explained that very great changes have taken place in the operation of the dispensary system throughout the country and in the general control of public health matters, and that until such time as we have had an opportunity of seeing the effects of this that we cannot safely bring forward proposals for medical benefits.</P>
    <P>One thing that was rather clear&mdash; I do not know whether anything that Deputy Ryan has said would cut across that&mdash;was that most people were agreed that such medical benefits as were provided in the rural areas should be provided through the personnel of the dispensary system, whether it is called a national medical service or a dispensary service, and that it was only in the larger towns that you could have anything like a panel system.  Over the greater part of the country everyone seems to be convinced that you must associate your machinery of medical service under local bodies with your National Health Insurance system, and there are very many reasons why you could not safely outline a scheme for giving medical benefit generally in these circumstances. There is one important matter that has to be borne in mind too.  It has been explained that over 75 per cent. of the people in rural areas who are insured persons actually do get the benefit of the dispensary system, and there is a large percentage in the city.</P>
    <P>But apart altogether from any percentage in respect of whom it cannot be claimed that they get medical benefits, no serious complaint has been formulated that the lack of medical benefits under the National Health Insurance scheme is a hardship to any person.  If the provision of medical benefits under the National Health Insurance scheme were a matter of urgency we would have more grounds of complaint than we have that medical benefits were essential, and in the cities, where most people say it is most essential, there are facilities for <Col N="239" /> medical benefits through organised medical services of one kind or another that do not exist throughout the country.  But we have to keep in mind the fact that there would be a stronger volume of complaint about the absence of medical benefits being a hardship on insured persons if there was any serious urgency for dealing with the matter.  The absence of any provisions to deal with medical benefits in this Bill is no reason, I submit, to delay in carrying out the economies and the improvements that are proposed.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question concerning the abolition of sanatorium benefit. Although insurance funds in the past were not adequate to provide free sanatorium benefit for all insured workers requiring it, nevertheless a certain number were able to secure it.  Would it be possible to ensure that a number of insured workers would get free sanatorium benefit under the new scheme in proportion to the State grant which each board of health will secure?  There appears to be an injustice, arising out of the fact that the worker will continue to pay the same contribution but will not now even have the prospect of free sanatorium benefit such as he had in the past.  Even if every worker was not able to get it, some were, and at least the same proportion should get it, in view of the fact that the money will now be paid to the boards of health.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last point, there is no provision in the Bill requiring local bodies to make any changes in the method of carrying out their tuberculosis schemes.  I think that there are only four or five rural areas in which insurance committees have not an agreement with local bodies to hand over to them the funds at their disposal and to have their people dealt with completely through the local bodies, so that if we take this four or five from the thirty-one, there will be twenty-six or twenty-five areas in which there will be no change.  I do not know whether the Deputy means that he is aware of particular areas where there is an agreement between the insurance committees and the local bodies, and where assistance in butter, milk and eggs is given through persons other than employees of the local bodies.  On the point raised by Deputy Lemass, it is considered that the handing over to the local bodies of the amounts, or the approximate amounts, at present paid to these local bodies through the insurance committees will be a security that the insured persons in their areas will get the same type of treatment that they have given up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the National Monuments Bill, 1929, be read a second time.&rdquo;  That the Bill is described as the National Monuments Bill rather than the more usual Ancient Monuments Bill is not without some significance. It stresses the point that the provisions of a measure of this kind should concern not merely the limited though happily daily increasing number of people interested in antiquarian learning and research but the nation as a whole.  Apart from the preservation of the national language I think there is nothing more likely to conduce to the development of a strong and healthy national spirit in the country than an informed and intelligent interest in these memorials of the past.  They stand like so many milestones and mark the advance of civilisation in our country from the remotest times down to the present day.  In fact, in some respects an interest in these monuments should have a wider appeal than the language, because the language to a great extent perforce is confined to people inhabiting the country whereas the preservation of our monuments must be of some concern, not only to those inhabiting Ireland at present but to the Irish race spread all over the world, and as well as that, it is of interest to everybody who has any concern with the early development of European culture, apart from and independent of the levelling influence of Roman power, since Ireland is the only country in western Europe where such a development was enabled to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to make <Col N="243" /> it clear that this Bill is not, and does not purport to be, the last word in ancient monument conservation as understood in countries where this science has been brought to the highest pitch&mdash;for example, in Sweden.  There are two reasons for that.  First of all, you cannot legislate effectively, particularly in matters of this kind, very far in advance of public opinion.  Legislative measures of this kind must advance <i>pari passu</i> with a desire on the part of the people for such measures. As long as the attitude of a considerable portion of our population towards ancient monuments is one of regret that the Land Commission stands between the tenant and the historic castle, the stones of which could be so profitably disposed of for road metal, and the prehistoric mounds or raths which could be so usefully employed as top dressing, it would be very foolish to embark on legislation, based on the assumption of active and enthusiastic co-operation on the part of all sections of the public.  Secondly, an elaborate code dealing with this matter would mean the setting up of elaborate machinery, and that would naturally entail a very large addition to the official staff for manning that machinery, and as a consequence a heavy additional charge on the Exchequer which would scarcely be justifiable at the present time, unless for some development that was likely to be immediately and directly financially productive.  The Bill is in some respects conservative, and in other respects progressive, having an eye to future development of various kinds. The Bill is conservative in so far as its effective enforcement should go a long way to prevent any further diminution of our wealth of historical and archæological remains.</P>
    <P>A great danger is to be anticipated from the clumsy and unscientific efforts at excavation by amateur archæologists.  There is the danger that such inexperienced people, in their zeal to discover something new, may destroy the very thing which they are seeking.  There is the <Col N="244" /> danger that certain objects of very great archæological value, but perhaps not obviously so, such as prehistoric human remains, unique in some particular way, may pass unrecognised or be ignored, that objects of first rate national importance, when dated by the geological layer in which they were embedded, might prove of very little value when excavated without any scientific note being made of the circumstances under which they were discovered.</P>
    <P>Then again, we are all aware of the fact that souvenir hunting tourists have played havoc with some of our most valuable archæological remains.  In fact, the souvenir hunting vandal has left a trail of destruction behind him almost as wide as that of the iconoclast army or the pillaging mob.  We have an example of that in Co. Tipperary in Holy Cross Abbey.  In that Abbey was a sedilia, described as the most perfect piece of architectural work in Ireland. That sedilia is to-day but a shadow of its former glory as a monument not merely to the skill with which the craftsmen of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries wrought in Ireland, but to the lack of appreciation of that skill which persists throughout a large part of Ireland at the present time.</P>
    <P>Then again we must bear in mind that, concurrently with the quickening of interest in archæological investigation all over the world, there has been a corresponding increase in the commercial value of the objects which have been discovered by such investigations, and the tendency is very much on the increase to market those objects in centres where they are likely to command the highest price, which is not always in their country of origin.</P>
    <P>The Bill, so far as any legislative measure can, calls a halt to all those undesirable activities and ensures, as I have already stated, that there shall be no further diminution in our wealth of archæological and historical remains.  Side by side with the conservative section of the Bill, we have the progressive side, inasmuch as the Bill gives very wide <Col N="245" /> powers to a central advisory council and to local advisory committees to advise and assist the Commissioners of Public Works, and the various local authorities, in all matters dealing with the preservation of these monuments, and kindred subjects.</P>
    <P>So much for the general scope of the Bill.  I now proceed to explain as briefly as I can the present state of the law and the principal changes we propose to make by this Bill.  The first point is the definition of a national monument. At present the Board of Works and the local authorities are only able to deal with monuments which are either ancient or mediæval. When mediæval times stopped and modern times began is, I believe, a point much disputed in the history schools, but at any rate we are barred at present from dealing with eighteenth century buildings as national monuments.  That disability we propose to remove by the definition in Clause 2 of the Bill; anyone who reads it will see that it is fairly wide.</P>
    <P>The second point is the powers of the Board of Works and the local authorities, respectively, to acquire the property in national monuments, or alternatively to become guardians of such monuments without acquiring them.  The present position is rather complicated.  The Board of Works may purchase a monument by agreement, not by compulsion; they may also accept a monument by way of gift or legacy; and they may become guardians of a monument with the consent of the owner. A county council may accept a monument by way of gift or legacy; they may not purchase; and they may not become guardians, but they may prosecute anyone who injures a monument within their territory. We propose to enlarge the powers both of the Board of Works and of the county councils.  We propose to give the Board of Works the power to purchase by compulsion, but only with the consent of the Minister for Finance; this provision is in Clause 11 of the Bill.  We propose to give the county councils the power to become guardians of a <Col N="246" /> monument; and we also propose to give the present and the new powers of the county councils to borough councils and urban district councils, as we think that in boroughs and urban districts where interesting ancient monuments exist the local council may well take a more special interest in them than the county council would take.</P>
    <P>I now come to an innovation of some importance, which is, however, already the law in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland&mdash;I mean the provision about preservation orders in Clauses 8, 9, and 14.  If the Minister for Finance is advised that a national monument which is private property is in danger of damage or destruction he may make a preservation order, of which the effect is that the owner as well as everyone else is prohibited from injuring the monument, and that the Board of Works may, if they think it expedient, appoint themselves guardians of it, and take steps to preserve it without the owner's consent. Every such order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and must be annulled if a resolution against it is passed by either House.</P>
    <P>There are three other new provisions which we expect to be useful for the preservation of national monuments, two in Clause 14 (1) (b) and (c), by which it is forbidden to make excavations near a monument. and also to export any such monument or any part of it, and one in Clause 16 which gives power to control burials.  The indecent and, indeed, appalling spectacles due to burials in overcrowded graveyards in and about ruined churches are a frequent occasion of complaint, and we hope to do something to diminish that evil.</P>
    <P>A very important provision is that in Clause 19 which establishes an advisory council to give skilled advice on archæological matters to the Board of Works.  The Commissioners of Public Works are, of course, not specialists in archæology, and their Inspector of Ancient Monuments is primarily an architect and not an archæologist; it is important, therefore, <Col N="247" /> that they should receive advice and guidance from specialists.</P>
    <P>Powers are also given to the county and town councils, by Clause 20, to set up advisory committees of skilled persons; and this should be a very useful measure.</P>
    <P>Now I come to that part of the Bill which deals with movable objects of archæological interest, and here we are on new ground altogether, for up to the present there has been no legislation whatever in the Saorstát to control the freedom of dealing in archæological objects.  There is, of course, the law of treasure trove, but the purpose of that law is not the preservation of the remains of antiquity, though it may be incidentally useful for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we make two provisions for the preservation of movable objects of archæological interest. The first, in Clause 21, enacts that every person who finds such an object shall report the find to the Gárda Síochána; in this way the National Museum authorities will get early information.  This provision is on the same lines as the existing law in Northern Ireland.  The other provision, in Clause 22, prohibits the export of any archæological object except by licence from the Minister for Education.  This is a new provision; I believe there is a similar enactment in Italy protecting valuable pictures, but there is no precedent in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to mention a general provision which is important for the protection both of movable and immovable objects, that is the prohibition in Clause 23 of excavating for archæological purposes except with a licence from the Board of Works.  Such a licence would, of course, be granted only to competent archæologists.  Unskilled excavation has in the past been responsible for the destruction of an immense number of valuable archæological objects both movable and immovable.</P>
    <P>These are all the points which it seems necessary to touch upon now. I think that this Bill, if the <Col N="248" /> Oireachtas passes it, will enable the Government to make a distinct advance in the preservation and protection of national monuments and archæological objects.</P>

      <P>We approve of this Bill.  As far as it goes it is a good Bill agus ma's maith é is mithid é. It is high time to have these compulsory powers of entry, acquisition, or preservation of national monuments. Also it is well to see us keeping in line with other nations in the prevention of the exportation of objects of national interest in as far as legislation can achieve that purpose.  At any rate, it should have a good moral effect as well.  The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken of the depredations, of the vandalism of people living in the vicinity of many of these monuments.  At the same time, in this Bill a borough rate is mentioned.  These are the people who will decide whether the borough will strike a rate or not.  I wonder how much they expect to get out of the borough rate for the preservation of such monuments.  I would advocate, of course, the striking of a rate for their preservation, but I do not know how far the boroughs and councils will respond in the present temper of the local bodies as regards the burden of taxation.  It is very necessary that something should be done in that respect, but I remember seeing&mdash;I had better not mention the county&mdash; the grave of one of the great O'Neills practically inaccessible owing to the growth of weeds and nettles a few years ago.  Whether any improvement has been made there since I know not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference also in Subsection (5) of Section 3 to voluntary contributions.  It is a pity we have not a better public spirit in the Free State in that respect, though I notice recently there have been many contributions to the National Museum from Tuam and other places which would show that public spirit is being aroused and interest taken in these matters and that the citizens are recognising their duties to the nation and the National Museum. <Col N="249" /> Perhaps it would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary told us by what machinery exactly the Commissioners of Public Works would acquire compulsorily a national monument.</P>
    <P>Section 13 says that every national monument deposited under this section in a public museum shall, while so deposited, be open to inspection by the public in like manner as the other exhibits in such museum.  I do not know whether that was put in as a joke.  Recently I visited the National Museum to see a certain collection I was interested in, and I found it down in the cellar not catalogued.  One time it was on display. If &ldquo;in like manner&rdquo; was like that a lot of the objects would be better left in the graves they are in at present.  It is very advisable, of course, to prevent these amateurs excavating, so that we will not have the Hill of Tara dug up again in a search for the twelve tables or anything like that.  As to the Advisory Council, I am certain that advice would be forthcoming, for private citizens have done a lot in that respect, and have taken an interest in those monuments.  Generally they have been regarded as a harmless lot of fogeys around on holidays.  It is very necessary in the interests even of our own history that local interest should be aroused in them.  It is generally admitted that to teach history you begin with your own locality&mdash;that is the best method.  In the schools also interest could be fostered if the children were taught what monuments are in the neighbourhood and what historical significance they have.  It is particularly necessary in Ireland to preserve those monuments to get the history of them and to teach all about them, because, as a learned professor in the National University said a few years ago, many attempts were made here to poison the wells of history.  I think some of the streams of history are to be found in those monuments.  They show not only the development of the civilisation here, its chequered career and how it was retarded from time to <Col N="250" /> time, but also the development of the national civilisation and its relation to other European nations.</P>
    <P>This is a good measure, but it could be nullified in the carrying out. There is not much money allotted by this Oireachtas to the Museum, about £1,000 per annum for the purchase of objects.  That is of very little use.  They do not seem to realise what part that could play in the history of the nation, in culture, in getting material for history. That is a small amount.  The National Museum in that respect would be the storehouse for most of these moveable objects.  It is being treated in a disgraceful manner. Reports used to be printed and circulated. Recently they have been typewritten and laid on the Table of this House, where very few members would see them.  I wonder is the reason that the criticism was so caustic that they did not care to see it in print?  One sentence, as far as I recollect the words, was: &ldquo;We do not believe that such barbarous treatment of a museum would be possible in any European country.&rdquo; That is the opinion of the Board of Visitors.  I find that in that Museum there was a geological collection. Space was wanted at a certain time and the mahogany cases in which the collection was displayed were dissected with hacksaws and the collection is now in packing-cases in the cellars awaiting still to he sorted or something done.  So there is no use passing this legislation if it is not carried out in the proper spirit. It is good as far as it goes, but let us hope that more money will be voted by the Oireachtas, so that the Museum will be put on a proper basis.  Economies might be necessary, but education is the wrong department in which to economise too much.  In addition to that, in deciding what objects should be purchased, how they should be classified, and so on, I think that the scientific and export staff should be given permission within the amount allotted to say what should be purchased, what should be paid for them and how they should be classified, and that the Department of <Col N="251" /> Finance or the Board of Works should not interfere too much, for that is work for the expert.</P>
    <P>As far, then, as this Bill goes, we commend it, and hope that it will be administered in the proper spirit; that sufficient money will be given to enable the Museum to acquire these objects of interest, and that the Museum will be properly staffed to deal with these objects.</P>

      <P>I rise with the greatest pleasure to support the National Monuments Bill. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his very able exposition of the Bill.  I am certain when it will be read from one end of the Saorstát to the other that people will realise the importance of introducing the Bill at this stage.  Down in my constituency there was an historic castle up to very recently.  A storm came along, and it crumbled to the ground.  There are only its foundations now.  It was Castlehaven Castle, at the entrance to Castletownsend Harbour, on the coastline of County Cork.  It was the castle from which O'Sullivan Beare, after his last grand and great struggle for Irish liberty, sailed away to Spain. It has now only the foundations left, but they are sacred to the country, and by this Bill, introduced by the Government, they can be preserved; they can be safeguarded, and they will be there a monument to the younger generation of what was done in the good old times to save our independence and win it.  Down along the seaboard of the County Cork there are a large number of castles that were once owned by the O'Mahony clan.  Twelve castles were occupied and held by that brave clan.  They held them until the walls crumbled around them.  The remains are there now.  Are they to disappear?  This Bill that has been introduced to-night will be taken up with enthusiasm, not alone along the seaboard, but also in the Midland counties.  Everywhere, thank God, through the Twenty-six Counties there are monuments to the heroism of our forefathers, and it would be <Col N="252" /> sad indeed if there would not be enthusiasm to-day, especially when we have the nation in our own hands, when we have a sacred heritage handed down to us; when we now, in the fullness of our liberty, come along to preserve the great monuments that stood for Irish liberty for centuries in the past.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this Bill will be enthusiastically supported in the Dáil. Every single man with a drop of Irish blood in his veins will remember that the time has come at least to recognise the heroism of our race, and it would be sad that the stones that were erected centuries ago and used by Irishmen would be used now for cow-houses and sheds.  God forbid that there should be such a sacrilege.  It is up to the Government to stand firmly by the Bill and pass it unanimously on to the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill perhaps from the fact that for a great number of years I belong to two societies that take an interest in archæological works&mdash;the archæological society of my county, and the Society for the Preservation of Memorials of the Dead.  In the course of these years, and in the course of excursions organised by these societies, I have had various opportunities of seeing the condition of many monuments of interest, not only in my own county but throughout many others.  I am sorry, to say that in many cases there has been a most deplorable laxity shown in the care of some of these crosses and monuments that never can be renewed if once destroyed.  This present year, having exhausted all our objects of interest in our own county, the archæological society of Kildare had an excursion to the Carlow district, and we saw very many works of the past that interested us, and were objects of very valuable instruction to many members of our society who were present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say there was one inestimable treasure that has been taken great care of by the Board of <Col N="253" /> Works and that is a most magnificent door in the ruin of the Church of Killeshin that the Board of Works are at present renovating and restoring. It is one of the most splendid Anglo-Norman doors in existence in the world.  On the other hand the Castle of Carlow, one of the most splendid ruins you can come across, although it stands in grounds that are extremely well kept, is, to my mind, in great danger of tumbling down completely.  I wish to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to it.  I believe it is not under the care of anybody at present although the ground about it is cared for and looks well.  Still everybody noticed that the top wall of this castle is in extreme danger of coming down and if it does the whole thing will collapse.  I draw attention to this most interesting memorial which never could be replaced if once destroyed.  As a matter of fact a great deal of vandalism has been done by the removal of stones from the castle which was at one time very much larger than it is now, but as it stands it is a work of which the whole country should be proud and it should be preserved.</P>
    <P>There is also another case I noticed some years ago.  It is in a private demesne and it is, of course, in good order.  I refer to the Cross of Durrow which I think is owned by Mr. Graham Toner.  It is one of the most magnificent crosses in Ireland and although it is in very good order I notice that there are trees standing beside it, and if there came a storm anything like the storm of 1903, this cross which could never be restored or replaced, will certainly be smashed to atoms.  I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that monument too.  It is one of those things that the whole world would esteem.  Anybody at any rate who takes an interest in any object of antiquity would go out of his way to see that such an object of interest as that should be preserved by every means that is possible.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say I think a good many people, even those who take an interest in archæological subjects, <Col N="254" /> do a great deal of damage by tearing up mounds and raths of that sort with the idea of finding works of interest.  I have come to the conclusion that a great deal more damage has been done than of value received by doing this.  Some raths have been absolutely destroyed by this insane curiosity to find what is contained beneath them.  Instead of leaving them as they are, they remove them and find nothing, and the material is used for road work or for building, or anything of that sort.  Though everybody in the county professes to take an interest in these things, when it comes to the money part of the business it is another matter.  It would be a very hard thing to persuade any council, I am afraid, to set aside money, as far as I know, for this matter.  I think the money must come from the Board of Works, that they must themselves look after these monuments with the help of the local people if the Bill is to be effective.  Leaving it to the county authorities, to my mind, will not be of much use; it must be done by the Board of Works to be effective.</P>
    <P>These objects are not alone interesting to archæologists, but they ought to be instructive to the youth of our nation.  They ought to be as useful, in their way, as the Minister said, as the cultivation of the Irish language in bringing about a national spirit and love of things great and good in the past, and if only for that reason alone I think these monuments are worthy of being preserved and cared for much more than they have been.  I hope this Bill will help towards that end. I am sorry to say I have not read it as carefully as I ought to, but I followed the Parliamentary Secretary's statement as attentively as I could. I am glad to learn that in the Bill there is a section preventing people who have an insane object in trying to see what is underneath a mound, tearing it to pieces.  There is a section dealing with that, and also to prevent articles of value from being taken out of the country, and that, too, is of great importance.  These <Col N="255" /> are all to the good, and I hope that they will be enforced, because it is very little use having an Act passed if it is simply left a dead letter.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Advisory Committee that the Minister has power to establish will include energetic archæologists who understand the subject from all parts of the country, and who will see that the work is carried out and that inspection is carried out at suitable times and that the monuments are preserved. I hope this will be done and that the result will be that throughout the country this destruction of old castles that has been going on for a very long time&mdash;I can remember several in my own county that have practically disappeared&mdash;will cease.  No one knows who took the stones from these old castles or where they are gone.  These castles were objects of great interest, and although people took a great interest and pride in them they did not do anything to prevent them from being removed.  It will be one of the most important parts of the work&mdash;at least I think it ought to be&mdash;of this Committee that the Minister will have power to appoint, to see that these historic monuments of great interest and beauty, of which no country in the world of its size has more than Ireland, are preserved. For all these reasons I hope this Bill will be beneficial, and I hope it will be worked well and that as a result we will see the younger people taking a greater interest in objects of antiquity than they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fahy suggested that in the local schools objects of local interest should be explained. I am in agreement with that.  I think every child ought to be well up in the knowledge of the historic monuments of his own county and of the country at large. It would have on everybody, child and man alike, an enlarging and elevating effect.  I am extremely glad that this matter has been taken up by the Government, and I hope it will be carried out in a wise and <Col N="256" /> beneficial way and that the result will be of great advantage to our country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the chorus of eulogy of the Bill.  I think it just as well that somebody should talk about the detailed contents of the Bill and not only about the purpose of the Bill. With the purpose of the Bill we are all in agreement, but before we make it law we ought to examine the machinery and see how it is going to work.  I am of opinion that some of the machinery is not, to say the least of it, very workable and that it may very possibly become a dead letter. It is, of course, an invasion of the rights of property.  I do not think Deputy Wolfe has quite discovered that his powers over his property will be very much diminished under the Bill.  Take Sections 8 and 9. There is nothing to prevent a preservation order being issued in respect of an occupied dwellinghouse. Assuming that the preservation order is issued in respect of an occupied dwellinghouse, the owner of that house cannot keep out the officers of the Board of Works at any hour of the day or night.  Section 9 says: &ldquo;Any officer of the Commissioners duly authorised by them in that behalf may at any time inspect and examine such national monument and for that purpose may enter on such monument and any other lands or premises.&rdquo;  They can come and inspect a man in his bath.  They can come in on him in his bed to discover whether his snoring is destroying the fabric.  That is very drastic. These powers may very possibly be necessary.  I do not think that these drastic powers will be particularly pressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then take Section 23&mdash;the prohibition of excavation.  You cannot in practice dig up your own land or anybody else's for any purpose except for agricultural or industrial operations.  If a man was so misguided twenty years ago as to bury his money at the bottom of his garden he would not be able to dig it up under this section, because it would be worth more now than then. <Col N="257" /> It would be an archæological object under Section 2&mdash;the definition section. That may be necessary.  I agree that unskilled excavation has done an awful lot of harm, but I do implore the Parliamentary Secretary to accept a one-word amendment and besides &ldquo;agricultural and industrial operation&rdquo; to allow the word &ldquo;sanitary&rdquo; to be inserted, otherwise we shall have great difficulty in getting at our own drains.  The greatest enemy of the preservation of archæological remains is not the hand of man so much as our climate. Anybody who has been to Clonmacnoise knows that.  The purpose of preservation is so excellent that I am willing to submit to these invasions of the rights of property, if they are necessary.</P>
    <P>I note, however, with great alarm Sections 21 and 22, together with the definition of an archæological object which must be read in conjunction with these two sections.  &ldquo;The expression `archæological object' means any chattel whether in a manufactured or partly manufactured or an unmanufactured state which by reason of its antiquity or the archæological or historical interest attaching thereto has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic value, and the said expression includes ancient human and animal remains but does not include treasure trove in which the rights of the State have not been waived.&rdquo;  That is a very comprehensive definition.  I found myself, on going through my library a few years ago, an uncatalogued book.  It was an old one of no particular value, but on the title page of the book a former owner had written his name and the date and that was Jonathan Swift.  Presumably that signature had made that book an archæological object within the meaning of the section and very possibly rightly so, but who is to be the judge?  You can say anything has an historical value.  A pair of spectacles have a certain value.  Presumably the spectacles worn by the Chairman of the Fifth Committee of the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva will have an added historical value and it may be <Col N="258" /> necessary to schedule the spectacles of the Minister for Education under this section.  Who is to be the judge of the archæological value?  There is a controversy going on at present as to certain discoveries on the coast of County Sligo.  One school of archæologists think they have discovered traces of the existence of man in Ireland tens of thousands of years earlier than he was supposed to exist here.  Another school say that these remains were not made by man at all, that they were the result of glacial action&mdash;that they have not been made by hand at all but that they are the result of the action of a glacier.  Who under this Bill is to judge whether these are archæological objects or not?  There seems to be no machinery for determining that.</P>
    <P>I want the Dáil to consider the position of a man who finds an object under Section 21 of this Bill. These objects are generally found, not by organised search parties.  We are not likely to have excavation parties such as the one which found the tomb of Tutankamen, but rather to have to fall back on a man whose education has riot gone beyond the Sixth Standard, and who cannot be versed in archæology.  If such a man had got an employer he would go to him&mdash;it may be to Deputy Sheehy, Deputy Gorey or myself&mdash;and say: &ldquo;Look at what I have found in the bog.&rdquo;  Deputy Sheehy, Deputy Gorey or myself would probably say to him: &ldquo;Oh, that is obviously a polished stone axe of the palæolithic period.  That must be reported under Section 21 of this Bill.&rdquo; Deputy Gorey would probably say more than that it should be reported under that section of the Ancient Monuments Act.  But supposing the man has no employer, that he is the owner of the place himself, and takes up something.  He does not know what it is.  It may be an archæological object, and he is anxious not to expose himself to the penalty of £10. He proceeds to report it to the Guards.  The Guards have very many excellent qualities, but I am not aware that every Guard on duty is a trained archæologist.  No doubt <Col N="259" /> when this measure becomes an Act Deputies, when coming to their work here, will see rows of charabancs standing outside with parties from the Depôt being taken around the National Museum getting instruction as to the difference between the palæolithic and neolithic periods.  In conjunction with the Guard, the finder, a man who may have only reached the Sixth Standard, or perhaps not as far, has to state not only his own name and address, but to describe the character of the object he has found, a task that very often will tax a trained archæologist.  Will he say, being deprived of the benefit of Deputy Gorey's advice, &ldquo;This is a polished stone axe of the early palæolithic period,&rdquo; or simply say, &ldquo;This is a quare kind of an ould stone with bits of scratches on it&rdquo;? I think it likely that he very probably would do the latter.  Of what earthly use is that sort of information? How are we going to preserve any ancient monuments by means of that kind of report?</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill as to what is going to happen all these reports. When the Bill is operative people can be brought up and fined for not making these reports.  Therefore, there will be an enormous number of such reports.  But what are the Guards to do?  There is nothing in the Bill to say.  Are they to go to the National Museum or to the office of the Commissioner of Works?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to inspect them all himself?  Is there any provision made for their publication?  Are they to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, or are they to be published in the journal of the Society of Antiquaries or in the Journal of the Royal Irish Academy?  There is nothing about that in the Bill.  Unless some provision is made for codification, examination and publication Section 21 is absolutely worthless. It might just as well not be there at all, and in fact it will be inoperative. Section 22 is very far-reaching. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke, I think, about Italian <Col N="260" /> precedents.  Deputy de Valera, I think, knows that Italian precedents are very far-reaching.  As a matter of fact, I think Italian precedents do not apply to archæological objects at all.  They apply mainly to works of art which are well known and which are not being constantly discovered. The Italian precedents prevent their exportation.  You do not want to prohibit the export of every archæological object coming under this very wide definition in the Bill. What you do want is to be able to prohibit the export of anything that could not be replaced, anything really valuable, but every little flint arrowed head or stone scraper that prehistoric man used for himself is not of very great value.  One could easily allow things of that kind to go if one could buy other things outside the country which could not be found here.</P>
    <P>There are things of definite value and importance that ought not to be lost to the country.  On the Committee Stage I hope to introduce an amendment giving to the Parliamentary Secretary or to the Minister for Finance power to issue a prohibition order of export.  I think that something on the lines of the preservation order under Section 8 could be drafted which would give the Minister all the powers necessary to prevent the departure of anything of value.  If not going outside the scope of the Bill, I would like to include things of artistic value as well as things of historical value.  My desire would be to give the Government power to prohibit the export of such articles, but not to interfere and hold up every small transaction, every little tiny deal between a dealer in Dublin and a dealer in London, until permission was received from the Minister.  It is possible to overdo red tape.  I think that the amount of red tape in this Bill is so great that the measure itself will become entangled in it, and will be absolutely unworkable.</P>

      <P>My speech may not be strictly in order on this Bill, but recently there came to my knowledge a matter to which I wish to draw the <Col N="261" /> attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  Recently I had a book in my hands relating to an estate in the West of Ireland.  It was compiled about a hundred years ago.  This estate consisted of about 50,000 acres.  The book was a survey made by an engineer named Nicholson in the city of Dublin for the owner of the estate.  The book gave a biographical sketch of every tenant on the estate, his economic condition, whether he was a good farmer or a bad farmer, how each townland and village was divided, as well as of the little towns on the estate, the industries in them, and everything appertaining to them.  I also had in my hand another book relating to the same estate, a volume of maps drawn in the year 1720.  I am glad to say that these books are at present in safe hands.  I have been informed that documents of that description are constantly going into the hands of the officials of the Land Commission and that there is practically no care taken of them, and no steps taken to collect them.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if that is so.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there is only one way to get over the difficulties Deputy Cooper raised about Section 21&mdash;there must be recognised associations established under the Bill.  The provision which is made under the Bill for voluntary local advisory committees might be extended some way so as to assist the work which it is proposed to put on the shoulders of the Civic Guards in dealing with casual finds that may be made about the country. Otherwise, I think that Deputy Cooper has raised a serious objection to the section.  It would be very difficult either to enforce this section or to ensure that if enforced it would serve any useful purpose whatever. Like all the other Deputies who have spoken, I consider that the Bill is an extremely useful one and is a valuable instalment of work in which not alone this country but other countries have been somewhat behind-hand. <Col N="262" /> Neither in Great Britain nor in this country has anything like the adequate provision been made for the care of objects of archæological value and interest that has been made for nearly a century past in every other country in Europe.  This Bill is an instalment of work that must be done before we can say that we are making proper use of, or taking care of the historical and archæological monuments that we have in our possession.</P>
      <P>There is one grave doubt that arose in my mind with regard to this Bill.  It was associated with the vesting in local bodies of national monuments.  I am very much afraid that if the preservation of national monuments is going to be a charge on the local rates the local bodies will be very unwilling to undertake any such task, and that that part of the Bill will become very easily a dead letter.  I would like to be assured on this point.  I think, as the Bill stands, that is a pious aspiration rather than anything else, and that the Minister in Section 8, where he takes the power to issue preservation orders, has the right to override local bodies and step in over their heads in cases where proper care is not being taken of monuments to see that the work is done. I think that the extension of the functions of these advisory councils, and the extension of the number of them wherever it is possible, would probably go far to improve the Bill and make it more workable.  There are some other aspects of this whole matter to which it might be well worth while drawing attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be necessary to see that not only are national monuments preserved, but that proper use is made of them in the educational sense.  In that direction I think there is more work to be done in this country than in the work of preservation. We have still to see there is a proper archæological survey, so that we could know what monuments are worth preservation, and that information about these monuments is made available for the public and strangers who may wish <Col N="263" /> to use them.  There are places around the country where good work was done in the production of guides to important monuments. That work has practically fallen into abeyance because these guides have been allowed to go out of print, and in a great many places it is not possible for the visitor to get any information worth getting locally about a great many of these important monuments.  I think it would be necessary to extend the work by some means.  I do not know whether it can be done in this Bill or not, or whether the Board of Works can take charge of the production of proper guides to national monuments, but certainly it is necessary to preserve the monuments.</P>
    <P>In addition to preserving them it will be also very necessary to take steps to see that they are of some, value when preserved, because if a monument is simply standing as an object on the landscape and cannot be studied or understood it would be better if it were not there.  The same thing applies, I think, to another duty which will, I think, fall on this Dáil.  Some time or other there will have to be a great deal more provision made than there is for scientific excavation in the country.  As far as I am aware, there is no provision made at the moment for the scientific examination and excavation of various national objects. These are things which are equally important with the preservation Of these objects, and I think that the work which this Bill undertakes to do will not be properly done until these things also are attended to.  It is in that respect I believe that the advisory councils, both local and central, can do extremely good work. I believe that once you have set up and have actively working such bodies as central advisory councils on this question of historic national monuments, that that body will be able to plan out the work that must be done in the future, and will be able to ensure that public opinion will be sufficiently educated to see that the work is done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> It is unfortunate that in this country, as in so many other countries, we are altogether, or very largely, unaware of the great amount of valuable wealth that we haw at our disposal in these national monuments.  It is well to have this Bill brought into operation before the danger became pressing&mdash;that some of our national objects might be taken bodily over and re-erected in America.  A country like this, where there are so many national monuments, is always in danger, and, of course, we have suffered a great amount, as everybody knows, in the last hundred years, and we can find fragments of very interesting national monuments embedded in modern buildings.  I discovered in the summer that one of the reasons why Connemara is so well supplied with small harbours is that the stones from O'Flaherty's castles were used, and efficiently used, in building some of them.  The Dáil should put an end to that sort of thing, but before we can be satisfied with the state of affairs with regard to archæological monuments in this country further steps will have to be taken to see that there is an extension of scientific examination and excavation, and that the results are made available to a wider public than now.</P>

      <P>I have been anticipated in two of the criticisms I was going to make of this Bill by previous speakers, but I would like to reinforce what they have said, and particularly what Deputy Tierney has said with reference to the provision of a proper survey and the registering of national monuments. To make it possible for the bigger societies in Dublin and the local societies that are contemplated under the Bill to preserve and to use national objects of archæological interest properly, it is necessary that they should be registered by some central authority or society.  Such a society would prevent losses that possibly have occurred, and some losses that I know occurred a few years ago.  One would think that there are few men in this country <Col N="265" /> that had in their private possession objects like Ogham stones, but there was one gentleman in Tipperary who had three, and he was going to export these to America because he was going to get a big price for them.  We had to pay a very big price to prevent those stones going out of the country.  I know that objects similar, but of perhaps less importance, have gone out of the country in recent years.</P>
      <P>Criticism was made by Deputy Cooper of the unworkable character of Section 21.  I agree completely with what he has said.  The definition of an archæological object expressly excludes objects that come under the definition of treasure trove.  Treasure trove are objects such as gold, silver, and plate, coin, or bullion concealed in earth or dwelling-houses and found, the owner not known.  These are expressly excluded under this section. I suppose we are to deal with such valuable treasure trove under existing legislation, but I do not know that existing legislation makes any provision for the declaration of a find of treasure trove, or any punishment for the suppression of a find of that sort.  I know the difficulties we had in the past.  Perhaps some of the Deputies have heard about the great Clare gold find made in 1854.  I suppose it was one of the biggest historical finds ever made in the world, because in the bronze age Ireland was the Klondyke or Ballarat of the world.  It seemed to have an enormous amount of gold in the bronze age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That attracted the invaders, our ancestors, to the country first.  In Clare in 1854 when building the railway workmen came on gold and took it away in buckets.  One workman went to the village and sold a handful of it for £30.  It was valued afterwards as bullion worth over £400.  A great portion of it was melted down.  Then there was the Broighter find, the greatest example of La Tene painting which we have.  You remember the action which we had to take to rescue this find which was sold privately and which got into the hands of the British <Col N="266" /> Museum.  There are many other finds now on the Continent and also in America which were slipped out of the country.  That should not occur.  We should look into Section 21 again.  I think we should revise the legislation dealing with treasure trove and bring it in under that section, and also make a better definition of &ldquo;archæological objects.&rdquo; Such definition does not occur to me at the moment, but I will mention the matter again in Committee.  I am glad that an effort is being made to prevent injuries to our ancient monuments.  Most of us have visited New Grange and have seen the signatures and scrawls which have disfigured some of the finest monuments there.  There are other injuries to ancient monuments which this Bill proposes to prevent.  I wish that something could be done for the restoration, not perhaps of our most ancient monuments, but of other monuments in which we also take pride.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with ancient monuments.  I recently saw one of the most interesting churches in Ireland, a marvellous church in Tipperary containing a royal tomb.  The chancel is about six or seven feet deep in earth.  Though one must sympathise, and I do sympathise, with the sentiments of people who want to be buried in old and hallowed places like that, one must deplore what seems to me to be a sacrilege.  I think that Deputy Wolfe can reassure himself that this Bill is going to put an end to the amateur excavator.  Scientific excavation of monuments should not, and my experience shows that it does not, do any damage to a monument. It often restores it and explains it.  I hope some day to see New Grange cleaned out.  The trees that grow on the top there never belonged to the ancient monument. There is a great ring of stones, wonderfully carved there, and there is an outer ring of stones which one can hardly see.  I hope that the Commissioners will get to work to clean it up, as it is one of the most interesting monuments in Europe. This Bill has been a long time coming. <Col N="267" /> Hope deferred makes the Bill all the more welcome.  I have been hoping for it for many years.  Everybody should be interested in the ancient things of this country and I believe that every Irishman is.  I do not know anything that stimulates more quickly a sense of nationality than a sight of one of these monuments. Nothing makes one more conscious of a national heritage than to see and examine one of these most beautiful objects which have been passed on to us by those who lived in the country formerly.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has nothing to complain of in the reception of this Bill.  Not even with the exception of Deputy Cooper, whose criticisms were entirely constructive, has there been anything but praise for it.  I certainly have nothing but praise to add, but I do not know whether the public outside realise as fully as members of the Dáil evidently do, how important, and, indeed, how urgent this matter is.  In this, as in the other matter of which I ventured to speak a while ago, namely, the historical mansions and the destruction that is going on, every day that passes without adequate protection being afforded brings about the ruin and, it may be, the disappearance of monuments which are of the deepest interest to all Irishmen. Let me give one example of the kind of thing that is happening in very recent years.  Not far from where I live in Donegal there is a castle, not of the antiquity of the monuments of which Deputy Alton spoke, but still of great historical interest, the old stronghold of the MacSweeney of the Battleaxes, one of the great military chieftains under the Prince of Tirconaill.  Those who read that wonderful historical novel, &ldquo;The Flight of the Eagle,&rdquo; will remember that it was in this castle that Red Hugh O'Donnell was in fosterage.  It was from there that he set out on his fatal journey to another MacSweeney near Rathmullen, and from there was carried off in a ship to his long captivity in Dublin <Col N="268" /> Castle.  Not quite a century later Owen Roe O'Neill landed under the walls of that castle to which I refer when he came from the Low Countries to lead the great fight in 1641. Within my recollection that castle was perfectly habitable.  It was, in fact, inhabited and was in a perfectly good state of preservation.  Unfortunately it ceased to be occupied for some time, and there was no care taken of it.  One fine day, not many years ago, there arrived a tinker who, after the habit of his kind, looked around to see what unconsidered trifle could be picked up.  He searched around but found nothing in the lower part.  Then he climbed to the roof and observed upon it a considerable quantity of lead.  He also saw that he was only being observed by the roof and the seagulls. He proceeded to strip the roof of its lead, which he took away.  Unfortunately for the poor man, whether the seagulls brought tales of him or not I do not know, suspicion fell on him, and on being arrested lead was found in his possession for which he could not account.  He appeared before the Petty Sessions Court, where his story was not believed when he pleaded that, while it was true that the lead was in his possession, he did not get it in the castle, but, in fact, found it floating on the tide.  I am sorry to say that the Bench, of which I was one, was entirely unsympathetic, and I think he served his sentence.  The result was that owing to the lead being taken from the roof, the old central keep, one of the oldest parts where Red Hugh must have lived, became exposed to the weather and within eighteen months that keep which had survived in perfect condition since, I think, the beginning of the sixteenth century, became a ruin, and after a short time the entire building was seriously damaged.  That, however, is not the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day I was over there again, and I noticed that some worthy citizen of the Free State had proceeded to make a large hole in the outer wall surrounding the castle, and that wall, which had <Col N="269" /> stood in perfect condition until this year, is now falling or threatening to fall.  That castle has been hitherto in private hands.  I believe it is now passing into the hands of the Land Commission.  That is clearly a case where the care of a national body such as the Commissioners of Public Works is desirable.  I merely give that as an illustration of the need there is for the passing of a Bill of this kind into operation at the earliest possible moment.  It is certainly not too soon.  In spite of the teachings of our past, we have been strangely indifferent to the fate of the memorials of the past.</P>
    <P>I was reading not long ago some of the essays of Thomas Davis, and again and again one gets in Thomas Davis's essays the pleading with the people of his time, if they called themselves Nationalists, that one of their first duties to their country was to see that the memorials of the past were preserved.  I might, for example, remind the House of these words: &ldquo;This country of ours is no sand-bank, thrown up by some recent caprice of earth.  It is an ancient land, honoured in the archives of civilisation, traceable into antiquity by its piety, its valour and its sufferings.  Every great European race has sent its stream to the river of the Irish mind.  Long wars, vast organisations, subtle codes, beacon crimes, leading virtues and self-mighty men were here.  If we live influenced by wind and sun and trees, and not by the passions and deeds of the past, we are a thriftless and a hopeless people.&rdquo;  I welcome this Bill, for it is a sign that at any rate we are not &ldquo;a thriftless and a hopeless people.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I think it is good that, for an hour or two, we should be engaged in the common contemplation and reverence of the things that belong to all of us.  I think that a discussion of this kind, intervening as it does in the midst of perhaps sharp political controversies which divide the people, is immensely valuable in the sense of showing the fundamental <Col N="270" /> unity which is in us.  I had a rather curious experience recently, which showed to me at any rate the significance of very small objects&mdash; I mean things apparently of very little importance&mdash;and the light which they throw on historical matters. On the almost unique occasion on which I shared a platform with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle down in Ardfinnan, we were sitting having tea with Mr. Mulcahy, who is in occupation of Ardfinnan Castle and who has very reverently restored it. He produced for us a casque or helmet which in the previous year had been dug out of the stream underneath the castle.  It was then apparently a rough tin can which he retrieved from the men who were working there.  He sent it to Dublin, where it was cleaned and polished and then, I think, submitted to the National Museum authorities here, who identified on it the crest of Ayala.  Ayala was only significant to me as the name of a wine, but to Deputy Hassett, who happened to be there on the occasion and who seems to be a man of very deep knowledge and reading in matters of this kind, it apparently had another significance.  Mr. Mulcahy was wondering how the helmet of Ayala could have been found in Ardfinnan Castle, and Deputy Hassett, who had been looking up ancient records, remembered that a knight of that name had landed at Kinsale and, in all human probability, that knight was a captive in Ardfinnan Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On further inquiry we found that the firm of Ayala, who are now exporting wine from Spain to England and Ireland, are of the same family as that knight whose helmet was retrieved after some hundreds of years from the stream under Ardfinnan Castle.  The fact that a little crest upon a thing of that kind should so link up history, and that there was the accidental presence of those who knew the two or three different pieces of information necessary to link it up, suggests the very great importance which may attach to very small objects of that kind.  My <Col N="271" /> own attitude towards old things is rather that of reverence than of knowledge.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seclusions, ivy hushed, and pavements sweet</P>
    <P>With the immemorial lisp of musing feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is well to get back, if we can, to the recognition of our common past. That is the biggest value, I think, of a Bill of this kind, that it does turn our minds back in that way.  Two thousand years at least of common history do unite us, and the two or three, or ten years which divide us may easily be forgotten in the recollection of these long years.  It is in the building up in our hearts of that recognition, rather than the merely historical value, that we must find value in old things of that kind, and our duty is to preserve them.  It has been suggested that many old monuments are scattered about that very ordinary people might possibly help to preserve.</P>
    <P>I think it was professor Petrie who found, up in the North of Ireland, a big stone which he thought must be part of a statue.  On the principle that a statue which was broken up would not have been widely scattered in the district, he went around looking at all the walls and all the houses to see if he could find the remains of that statute.  The second portion of the statue formed part of the gable-end of a farmer's house.  After certain negotiations he succeeded in inducing the farmer to allow him carefully to remove the gable-end of his house and get that other piece of stone.  Putting the two pieces together, he formed an idea of what he then required to complete the statue.  The next portion of it was found to be part of a gate-post within a mile of the same place.  Again by careful negotiation he was able to remove the gate-post and get the stone.  He searched all over the district to find the piece which remained and at last he found it as the threshold stone of the local <Col N="272" /> golf club.  He said it was one thing to induce a farmer to let him take down the gable-end of his house or remove the pillar on his farm in order to reconstitute a national monument, but the local golf club was a very different matter, so they removed the portion of the statue that was there during the middle of the night.</P>
    <P>These are examples of the way in which things of historical importance do lie within the discretion and the possible preservation of ordinary people.  I think that if this debate does nothing more than awaken both in this House and in the country a reverent recollection of the duty we owe to those old things, and a feeling that their existence represents a thing which we can share in common, because out of reverence to them we may find a greater accord and unity amongst ourselves, it will have achieved a lot.  That is the very greatest value of, and the highest possible justification for, a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion since I have been in the Dáil that there is evidence of not only a sincere but an enthusiastic unanimity amongst all parties and all individuals in the House.  In introducing this Bill the Government have shown they realise that we have a responsibility not merely to ourselves but to the many millions of our race in all parts of the world who will be coming back to this country in ever-increasing numbers to visit the homes of their ancestors. There are some difficulties in the Bill which I am sure will be remedied in Committee.  I am sure we will have very interesting discussions on the various sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the definitions are extremely wide.  The definition of a national monument, for instance, will be very difficult when it comes to a question of administering the Act.  At the present time we do not know what national monuments we have.  We have not got any archæological survey of the country.  If the Act is to be administered <Col N="273" /> efficiently, steps should be taken to see that such a survey is carried out.  In that connection a very good service could be rendered by the Air Force.  In travelling over the country I have noticed many ancient monuments&mdash;formations, forts and other erections&mdash;which, when I consulted the survey maps, were not there recorded.  Very many things can be seen from the air which cannot be noticed from the ground.</P>
    <P>The British flying men in the aerodromes near Belfast have been carrying out very interesting archæological surveys of the Six Counties.  I am sure the members of the Irish Air Force would be very glad and very enthusiastic to carry out this national work.  It would also give them great practice in aerial photography.  I urge the President and Ministers to consider that aspect.  The Free State Air Force, I believe, have already done very interesting work photographing such sites as the Hill of Tara.  That work can be extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of archæological objects.  I do not know whether they would include documents and books.  During the last few years, since this State was established, the country has been practically sucked dry of documents and valuable books of great national importance. Those books have not been found available in the National Library, and there is nothing to prevent them leaving the country.  Even to-day and yesterday an extremely important sale of documents and books of national importance has been held in Limerick.  They include valuable manuscripts dealing with the history of Limerick City.  I understand a large number of dealers from London with American affiliations have been over, and I fear that a very considerable number of these documents have left the country.  We have not the power to prevent it.  I do not know whether the definition of archæological objects will cover those particular items.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to mention in conclusion.  I notice that <Col N="274" /> this Bill does not protect anti-national monuments, and in that connection I have to express my disapproval of the delay on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary in removing a certain archæological object from the front of this building. I hope, in view of the fact that that object is not protected by this Bill, he will take immediate steps to hasten its removal.</P>

      <P>I am glad to observe that this Bill has met with such unanimous approval.  To me at any rate it appears to be an evidence of a change of heart as well as a change of mind on the part of many Deputies in the House.  In saying that, and in paying a tribute to those who have drafted this Bill, or who have given thought to such cultural and educational matters as are contained in the Bill, I would suggest to the Minister at least one alteration.  I refer to Part II.  which relates to the guardianship and acquisition of national monuments. In Section 5 it is provided that &ldquo;The owner of a national monument (not being a building which is occupied as a dwelling house by any person other than a person employed as a caretaker, ...)&rdquo;.  That section immediately excludes many buildings which have for the Irish people a very historical connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill covers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I do not think it goes as far as I want it to go.  In Cork we have a number of houses and buildings already in occupation and I do not know that the Bill makes any provision for the taking over by the State of those historic houses.  For instance we have the house at one time occupied by the Brothers Sheares and we have another house at one time occupied by Father Mathew and we have houses occupied at one time by other notable people who have contributed largely to the building up of this State in one way or another. <Col N="275" /> I suggest that the Minister would, at a later period, take that matter into consideration and make provision in the Bill which would insure to the Irish people the preservation and maintenance of these historic buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great satisfaction to introduce a measure of this kind.  From all quarters of the House there appears to be nothing but favourable criticism, and any criticism that has been of the opposite character has been such that we must all feel a certain amount of sympathy with it.  Several Deputies touched on one point.  I think Deputy Fahy was the first to touch on it.  These Deputies seem to have an erroneous idea as to the powers of local authorities under the Bill. Under the Bill the Commissioners of Public Works have extremely ample powers.  They can become owners or guardians of practically any monuments they like.  But naturally it would be impossible for the State either to become owners or guardians or to issue preservation orders to look after every possibly important monument in the country. There is a limit to the nation's purse, and there is a limit to the number of these memorials with which the State should concern itself.  That will be for the Central Advisory Council to decide.  Probably later on there will be a monumental survey made.  It will be for them to decide what monuments it will be worth the Commissioners' while to take care of.  After that there is, no doubt, a great number of monuments not of very great interest to the nation as a whole, but of very great interest locally, and if that interest is so strong that the local authority feel justified in looking after them, it is highly desirable that they should have power to do so.  They have power at the present time in some places.  While it is not a power that is generally availed of, it is availed of in some places.  And no doubt as interest in this matter increases, that power will be availed of to a greater and greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> As usual, it is not an easy matter to separate Deputy Cooper's wheat from his chaff.  In most of his criticisms there is a certain amount of chaff, but there are also some grains of wheat.  He certainly touched on the weakest point in the Bill.  The Bill was a long time in hatching.  The reason was that there were a few sections which we found very difficult to put into legal phraseology with due precision.  No doubt the section dealing with the preservation of monuments gives very wide powers to the Commissioners of Public Works.  At the same time, if we are to have full authority to deal with the various situations that may arise in the country it is necessary that these powers should be very wide.  I do not think there is any real danger of these powers being availed of to spy on Deputy Cooper in his bath or any purpose of that kind.  Immediately prior to Deputy Cooper, Deputy Wolfe referred to a very famous cross in Durrow Abbey.  I think that cross is world-famous.  The Deputy said it is in imminent danger at the present time.  This Abbey is privately owned.  Without the Government having wide powers to go in there, there is no possibility of saving that cross possibly from destruction. I do not know if the facts as stated by Deputy Wolfe are correct, but if they are it is very necessary that we should have power to deal with a situation of that kind. Sections 21 and 22 are undoubtedly the most difficult ones in the Bill. On the one hand I do not think there is any fear of such a state of affairs arising as is pictured by Deputy Cooper.  After all, we must give the people in the country credit for a certain amount of common sense. They are not going to rush to the Gárda Síochána with every stone and pebble they pick up on the beach.  But it is necessary that the power should be there to make a person think twice when he comes on a valuable find, as has often happened in this country in the past, before he would hold on to that find or try to export it, without giving <Col N="277" /> the proper authorities in Dublin who have scientific knowledge an opportunity to investigate those things and examine them.  After the objects are shown to the Gárda Síochána in the ordinary way they will be sent up to Dublin, where the National Museum staff under the Minister for Education will be able to compare them with similar finds in the Museum, and if it is found that there are already sufficient examples of that kind, then the finder will be free to dispose of them or to export them if he so desires. He will get a licence for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Although there may be a great difficulty in putting this section into operation, and although there may be very wide evasion of it, that is no reason why such a provision should not be put into the Bill.  We have put it in.  The definition of &ldquo;archæological objects&rdquo; is wide, perhaps, unduly wide.  I hope some of the Deputies will exercise their intelligence in devising perhaps a happier form of words.  However, that is the best that we can put in up to the present.  There is no intention in the Bill to prevent people exporting their antique furniture which has no particular association with this country.  There is no intention to prevent people exporting pictures or other articles of that kind which may be highly valuable from the artistic point of view, but which have no real connection with Irish history or Irish archæology.  On the other hand, if you once try to limit your definition in this Bill you will find it very hard to know where to draw the line. However, we had to make a start, and in going through the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, if any Deputy can make a better suggestion, a suggestion that will find more favour with the House, we will be quite willing to give favourable consideration to it.  Several Deputies referred to the fact that we cannot do very much until we have a monumental survey.  That is true, but that will be a matter for our Advisory Council to give advice on when it is established.  It would be <Col N="278" /> a very foolish thing to set about establishing this monumental survey when our monuments had disappeared, and, at the same time, to have no power to prevent their destruction. Deputy Walsh referred to a matter which is not pertinent to this Bill, but I think it would be well for him to consult the Historical Manuscripts Commission about it. The information he has might be very useful to them.  On the whole, I am very glad this Bill has been so favourably received, and I hope that as it goes through the Dáil it will continue to receive the same constructive support from all parties.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the University College, Galway, Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;  Deputies will be aware that the statutory grant to the University College is £12,000.  That is the amount that was fixed under the Universities Act, 1908.  The actual present endowment of the College from the State is £28,000 under a settlement we made a couple of years ago, so that the larger part of the income of the College is at present in the form of a non-statutory grant.  It is desired to make the entire State grant a statutory grant. That was done in the case of Cork and Dublin Colleges in 1926, when the University Education (Agricultural <Col N="279" /> and Dairy Science) Act was passed.  When that Act, which dealt with the position of the Cork and Dublin Colleges, was passed, decisions had not been come to in regard to Galway.  Negotiations with the Governing Body of University College were, however, proceeding at the time, and the basis of those negotiations was that University College. Galway, was, by reason of its situation, practically in the Gaeltacht, in a town where 46 per cent. of the people are Irish speakers, with the most important Irish-speaking districts in the country adjacent, that that College could do work for the Irish language, and through the Irish language, which no other College in the country would be able to do for some time.  The Governing Body of the College accepted the view that that college was in a position to do special work in connection with and through the Irish language, and that it ought to set out to do that work to an extent that other Colleges, perhaps, could not do it.  The Government agreed to increase the statutory grant from £12,000 to £28,000. The College had other non-statutory grants before that; the income was not as low as £12,000.  The salaries of lecturers and professors were to be increased as part of the scheme, as they were inadequate, and it was arranged that fees should no longer go to the lecturers and professors, that their salaries should be inclusive, and that the fees should go to the general fund of the College. It was also agreed, with a view to making the College cater to some extent, as far as possible, for the Irish-speaking districts, which, broadly speaking, are poor districts, that the fees should be reduced to the prewar level.  It was also agreed that the Governing Body of the College was to establish certain scholarships for native speakers from the Gaeltacht. The College further agreed that, if circumstances permitted, it would do an increasing part of the academic and administrative work through Irish.  It was also agreed to appoint immediately certain lecturers who would lecture in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The first part of this Bill really confirms that agreement which, as a matter of fact, has been acted upon for the last couple of years.  In Section 2 there is provision whereby the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Education, may make an order increasing the statutory grant by a sum or sums which will not exceed £2,000, when they are satisfied that it is required for the purpose of carrying further the work of Gaelicising Galway College.</P>
    <P>All the Colleges agreed when the settlement was being made in 1926 that they would make no further applications for assistance to the Government until the expiration of five years.  The Government did not undertake that any additional sums would be given at the end of five years, but it was left open for the Colleges to make application.  However, in the case of Galway it was felt that the College should not be prevented from attempting to do new work through Irish, or new work in connection with Irish, or for the Irish language, by this grant being rigidly limited, and this provision is made, whereby the statutory grant to the College might be increased by order, which would, of course, be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill which requires the Senate of the National University, the Governing Body of the College, and the President of the College respectively, when making appointments to any offices or situations in the College, to appoint, if suitable persons are available, speakers of Irish.  There are no penalties attached to any breach of that clause and it is recognised that it is in the nature of a headline for the College; it is something put there to enable anybody in the Governing Body or anybody interested in the College to argue that the right thing ought to be done by the appointment of Irish speakers. It is felt, that the Governing Body of the College and others interested have appreciated the fact that the opportunities for development depend largely on the work of the College for the Irish language; that <Col N="281" /> they will not need to be coerced in the matter, that when this headline is set down in the Bill they will endeavour, so far as circumstances will permit, to act up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well to make statutory this grant of £28,000 to Galway College, for Galway was entitled to that pro rata, and we are entitled to a college there in the capital of Connaught, perhaps just as much as Cork and Dublin were entitled to their Colleges.  That may be argued particularly when the tendency in many countries is to decentralise university education and to have local centres of culture. Then, the county councils of the West are interested, as they contribute towards the funds of the College by means of county council scholarships.  But the pre-eminent claim of Galway College to continued existence is, as the Minister has suggested, that it should be a centre for the Gaelicisation of university education, for it is useless for us to speak of two languages being on an equality or of Irish being the preferred language as long as we cannot get a complete university education through Irish.  True, it has been admitted into the University Colleges.  It is compulsory for matriculation, but in some of the colleges, I am afraid, it is there like a poor relation, just inside the door.</P>
      <P>The Title of this Bill is good&mdash;&ldquo;for securing that persons appointed to offices,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;shall be competent to discharge their duties through the medium of the Irish language.&rdquo;  But it seems to be watered down as you read through the Preamble&mdash;&ldquo;for securing that certain of the professors,&rdquo; and so on, and &ldquo;to take such further steps as circumstances may permit,&rdquo; etc. There is an inclination there to make the Title weaker as you read on. There is a reference also to a scheme of scholarships.  I think that that should be made more definite, that such a scheme might be approved of by the Dáil, or that the papers should be laid on the Table so that we would know what percentage of the scholarships should be so given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> No date is given in the Bill as to when we might expect complete Gaelicisation.  Of course, particular work could be done in Galway in the matter of providing teachers for secondary schools to enable them to carry out their programme through the medium of Irish.  Secondary schools maintain that they would do a great deal more in teaching through Irish had they the teachers. They are not providing them in Dublin; I believe they are doing something in Cork, but there is an opportunity for them to do it in Galway.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) says that the funds shall be used for the general purposes of the College.  I have no doubt at all as to the bona fides of the present Governors of that College, but I would like to see that tightened up.  Is there not a possibility that all those funds may be diverted to teaching through the medium of English later on?  Some more stringent conditions than that should be laid down.</P>
    <P>In Section 3 I see a danger of conflict between the Senate and the Governing Body and the President of the College.  Irish speakers are to be appointed to these Chairs &ldquo;provided a person so competent and also suitable in all other respects is to be found amongst the persons who are candidates or otherwise available.&rdquo; I wonder exactly who is to decide that?  I would ask the Minister to consider whether that portion could not be omitted altogether.  If it is not deleted on the Committee Stage, I intend to move an amendment to that effect.  Once you leave these loopholes, they are generally availed of.  I think that since the National University has now attained its majority&mdash;it is twenty-one years established&mdash;it is very nearly time, Irish having been compulsory for the twenty-one years, that it should be turning out men who would be able to teach subjects through Irish, or that some definite date should be fixed, within which that should be done, such as after 1934.  There are many of us on those benches who could not allow that provision to <Col N="283" /> stand, and I intend, if the Minister does not himself delete it, to move an amendment when the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I would be in order in speaking of the funds of the Universities and Colleges in general.  It would be enlightening to the Dáil if we had from the Minister &mdash;for it is very hard to obtain the information from scattered sources &mdash;particulars of the income of the University Colleges.  What is the per capita cost to educate a student in any one of them?  I find that it is about £73 a head in Galway, where they get £28,000.  I think they have 416 students this year in the various faculties.  Thirty-one of these are included in two faculties, so that the net total would be 385. I do not know how much they get from the county councils or from other sources, and I do not know where that information can be obtained.  Cork has 489 students. Many of those may be included under two faculties, so that the numbers would seem to be nearly equal in the two Colleges.  If the Minister or the Minister for Education on any occasion, not necessarily in connection with this Bill, could give us an idea of the resources and the incomes of all the Universities, what is given for research work, how much it costs to educate a student, how much goes in administration, and so on, it would be very interesting, and I think the House should get that information. However, the points I emphasise are the weaknesses in the Title as you go down along, not fixing the number of scholarships, not deciding as to what extent exactly you want the College Gaelicised year by year, or when you may expect to have a complete education through Irish, and also the deletion of that proviso in the last three lines of Section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it gives statutory effect to an agreement which was reached with representatives of the Galway College, following the reorganisation of the grants to University College a few years ago on the occasion of the taking over of the College of <Col N="284" /> Science and the establishment of Agricultural and Dairy Science faculties in Dublin and Cork, respectively. I believe&mdash;and I say it speaking as a member of the Governing Body of Galway College&mdash;that the Governing Body and all the members of it are prepared to carry out the undertaking which has been given to the Government in regard to the appointments that will be made and in regard to the conditions which will be insisted upon in the matter of future appointments.  I think the Minister will agree that in any appointments that have been made since that agreement was entered into those conditions have been complied with.  I know that at the very last meeting which I attended an appointment was made, and I believe that the appointment that was made was determined by the fact that the person had a knowledge of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I believe that, I am rather doubtful whether it would be wise to go any further in this measure in the direction indicated by Deputy Fahy.  I question the necessity for it.  If there was at any time a necessity, if it was shown that the understanding was not being honourably observed by the authorities of the College, action could be taken.  But, as far as I know, the authorities of Universities are people who do not like to be kept too much on leading strings, and I personally approve of that.  I do not know that we would be wise in limiting too much or binding up this grant too much with conditions if we feel satisfied&mdash;and I personally feel satisfied&mdash;that what we are aiming at will be gained without putting these conditions into the Bill.  With regard to the last point especially made by Deputy Fahy in regard to the question of appointments made under Section 3, I doubt if it would be wise at this stage, and I doubt if it could be done if that proviso were left out altogether. I believe we are not yet in a position to say that every appointment to a University position in the College in Galway can be filled, every chair, every assistant professorship or lectureship can be filled in every case by people who are able to <Col N="285" /> discharge their duties through the medium of Irish.  I do not believe they have reached that stage, much as we would like it.  If that proviso were taken out I feel it is possible anyhow.</P>
    <P>I have not gone very deeply into it and I do not know the number of people that might be available but I am just saying what I feel to be the case.  I believe there would be a danger that second rate men might have to be appointed to very important posts in the College if that condition were insisted on here and now.  I think we will have to await a further development of the language before we can put down a rigid condition of that kind.  I do not think anything would be gained by trying, I do not like to say &ldquo;to rush&rdquo; because it would be hardly rushing it.  I agree largely with what Deputy Fahy says but we must take facts as we find them.  I think that before a matter of that kind, the excision of that provision, would be carried by the House, that very much care and thought should be given to the problems that might arise.  I believe there is no doubt whatsoever so far as the governing body of the College is concerned. While I cannot speak for the Senate we have some very strong friends of Irish in the Senate to see that it gets a fair show.  I believe, in any given appointment a person who was suitable for the appointment in other ways would get a strong preference if he is able to discharge his duties through the medium of Irish.  As I say, I doubt the wisdom at this stage of making that absolutely compulsory. The Bill is a simple one and it is only carrying but an agreement. I do not know exactly what the reason for the delay was.  I do not think the college has lost anything by the delay.  I believe it has not, but it is putting into operation the agreement that was arrived at and as I say I believe that the governing body should carry out the obligations which they have entered into in that agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody, of course, will be in agreement with the Minister and the two Deputies who <Col N="286" /> have spoken that this Bill does bare justice to University College, Galway, and that University College, Galway, will be entitled to the money voted in this Bill.  Even if there were no conditions attached to it, in view of the fact that the other colleges have been treated as they have been treated this money only puts University College, Galway, on a level relatively with the other colleges of the National University.  It only happened owing to the peculiar situation of University College, Galway, that these conditions are being attached to the giving of the money by agreement because it is felt that there are certain ways in which University College, Galway, can do particular work and because University College, Galway, has expressed its willingness to do that work.  What arises in my mind in reading this Bill is a doubt as to whether the conditions attached to this Bill are conditions which will ensure that University College, Galway, will do the work which it is intended it should do here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahy has suggested that there are too many loopholes in Section 3 of the Bill, and that the proviso included in that section might usefully be deleted.  Personally I am very much of opinion that it will not make very much difference whether you delete that or do not.  Of course everybody who has anything to do with the university is well aware of the fact that at present the chances of getting people qualified to teach any subject on a university standard through the medium of the Irish language are extremely slight, and the danger I see in a proviso like this is not that you will not get people who are qualified to teach through the medium of the Irish language, but that you will get people appointed on the pretext that they are able to teach through the medium of Irish. They may know Irish well enough, but they are not qualified to teach the particular subject which they are appointed to teach.  This is a danger to which the Dáil should be very wide awake, and which is inherent in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> As to the policy of Gaelicising the University, it is a simple fact that you will have to wait a long time and go through a long process of education before you get people turned out with the two remarkable and unusual qualifications of teaching any particular subject to university students, and in the second place, teaching it through the medium of the Irish language in such a way that when teaching it they will do as good work as if they were teaching it through any other medium.  More important, there is a considerable danger, to my mind, from the point of view of the general education of the country, involved in that policy, and it is a policy in which I think the Government and the Dáil will be well advised to go slowly.  Personally, if I were laying down conditions for the granting of this money to University College, Galway, I would be inclined to lay down different conditions, first of all to ensure that the Irish language itself, as a university subject, is taught in University College, Galway, as the French language is taught in the Sorbonne and as the German language is taught in Berlin.  Anyone who knows anything about it will agree that in no university institution in Ireland at present is anything like that happening.  Provision for the teaching of Irish in the National University was laid down in 1910, a good many years ago, and a good many years before people interested in university education had the same ideas or ideals about the teaching of Irish that they have now.  That provision is very far from doing anything on a level with what is done in any modern European university for teaching the national language of the country.  I believe it would do more good if you could ensure&mdash;and I do not see why it cannot be ensured in a short time &mdash;that in Galway you would not have two professors of Irish but five or six, each specialising in a particular subject and working and teaching that subject on a high standard.  You should have somewhere <Col N="288" /> in Ireland, for example, a professor of Irish literature.  We have not got one at present.  Then you should have a professor of the Irish language whose interest it should be to investigate the living dialects from the grammatical and phonetic points of view.  We should have a professor of Irish folklore whose duty would be to make a survey either regionally or locally of the vast amount of very valuable educational and cultural material still alive in the mouths of the people here and there throughout the Gaeltacht.  The possibility of doing this work is vanishing year by year. We have no man at present in any university post whose duty it is to do that work.</P>
    <P>There are a good many other chairs of that kind which we could have and which I believe would do far more good in University College, Galway, or any other college, than appointing, say, a professor to teach physics, geology or some other subject through the medium of Irish.  I am greatly afraid that in our anxiety to Gaelicise the Universities &mdash;and I am as anxious as anybody else to see this done as soon as it can be done&mdash;we are apt to go a little too quickly in the wrong direction. It would pay us better before we start Gaelicising the teaching of other subjects to see that the teaching of Irish itself is Gaelicised, and to see that there is proper provision made in some one institution in Ireland for the teaching of the national language on the same level as the national language is taught in other civilised countries.  I suggest, in addition to this Bill&mdash;I do not know whether it could be done on account of the fact that this agreement is in existence&mdash;that it would be worth considering that the Dáil should request the Galway College to reconsider this whole arrangement for the teaching of the Irish language and see whether with Government assistance it could not be arranged to have various specialised professors of the Irish language who will teach the Irish language itself through Irish at a high standard, who will <Col N="289" /> teach Irish literature, for example, and who would be prepared to lecture to their students on the literature of Ireland from the earliest period, from the 14th or 15th century down, and who would be prepared to teach students and to direct them in the work of producing editions of the works in Irish literature which are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should ask them whether they could not appoint a professor of dialects, especially a professor whose function would be to deal specially with the Connaught dialect, and whether they could not have a specialist in phonetics, whether they could not have a person whose duty it would be to organise a survey of the folklore which is still extant in Connaught, and particularly in Galway, within a stone's throw of the College.  I think if that advice were taken, and if Galway College did that, that we would be then in a much better position to go ahead with the Gaelicisation of the College, and that after five or six years of conditions like that, in which you had a number of specialists teaching the language on a very high standard in different departments, you would be then able to advance and to secure that men would be turned out who would be skilled both in the Irish language and in the particular subject which it would be afterwards their duty to teach in Irish.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means opposed to the motion of teaching being done in other subjects through the medium of Irish.  What I do maintain is that it is barely possible to do that at the present moment.  I maintain that it will be many years, especially under the present system of doing things, before that will be possible.  Before we can make any pretence at doing that sort of thing we should first of all put the teaching of the Irish language itself in its own proper position in University College, Galway, and indeed in all the colleges of the National University. There is some danger that we may go too fast in the wrong direction in doing this and it would be <Col N="290" /> well worth our while to consider the whole question from the point of view of the results that we would be likely to get.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the heads of the governing body of the University or the Senate of the University will strive to shirk the obligations they have honourably undertaken in this agreement with the Government. What I do fear is that in their anxiety to fulfil these obligations it may sometimes happen that they may appoint to a Chair a person who, though qualified in the Irish language, is not skilled to lecture on the particular subject which he undertakes to lecture on.  For that reason, I suggest to the Minister and to the Dáil that it would be well worth reconsidering the whole question and trying to arrange that first and foremost the teaching of the Irish language itself should be put in a strong position in University College, Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be possible, and I see no reason why <Col N="291" /> there should not now be put in a schedule in the Bill with regard to the appointments which are to be made in which it will be necessary that the holders will have a knowledge of Irish competent to carry out their duties in that language.  A list of the different lectureships and of the different professorships could be set out in the Bill.  I cannot see why we cannot get people with sufficiently high qualifications in Irish to lecture if we specify the qualifications they are to have.  I cannot understand what the Senate of the National University will be doing. While I, to some extent, agree with Deputy Fahy's point of view about a proviso, I cannot understand how it would not be possible for the Senate of the National University to appoint certain people to positions of as high intellectual standard as exists in the case of lectureships and professorships where the work is carried out in English.  The Senate is not going to take the definite step of appointing persons who are not, whatever their competence in regard to the language itself may be, sufficiently competent to discharge their duty in Irish.  I think that these matters could be got over by putting in a schedule in the Bill setting out definitely the names of the posts which are to be filled by Irish speakers and by Irish speakers only. I do not know whether Deputy Tierney has himself experience of the difficulty of lecturing through Irish, but, according to what teacher in the primary and secondary schools throughout the country say, it is not a thing which is impossible.  If a person is a teacher of high qualifications in any subject, it ought not to be impossible for him within a few years&mdash;even, let us say, for a German, like the man we have here in Dublin connected with our antiquities. I daresay if you asked that man to study up his particular subject in Irish so as to be able to lecture in it, he would be able to do it in a very short time, although his particular branch would be one of the most difficult.  There is undoubtedly a danger in the case of a <Col N="292" /> small college like Galway, which has had a high reputation&mdash;I am a past student myself&mdash;for its engineering school, in suddenly imposing upon it the necessity of appointing an engineering professor, for example, who would lecture through Irish, but that would not be a serious danger.  At the same time, while allowing for the fact that that danger exists, I think it would be extremely dangerous for the Dáil to assume that the Governing Body of the College or the University will not do their utmost to appoint qualified people for all these positions.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Tierney that the other colleges are not doing their share.  While I am strongly in favour, as all members of the Dáil, I hope, are, of giving Galway the proper financial assistance to which it has been entitled, I think that Deputy Tierney's warning note, that we are perhaps imposing a heavy burden on Galway which we do not realise, could be stressed more sufficiently here, and that perhaps the question could be gone into a greater length, if not now, I hope on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>You have established in University College, Dublin, an agricultural faculty and in University College, Cork, a dairy faculty.  These two faculties are concerned with things in which the whole nation wants progress. University College, Galway, is going to be concerned with the development of what a large part of the nation, unfortunately, has organised against and is determined to put every obstacle in the way of its development.  There is no use in thinking that University College Galway, can do its share unless it gets assistance from the other colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy referred to the question of a scholarship scheme. Whether you are going to get native speakers who will have reached the stage at which you can rightfully give them scholarships to your Irish-speaking college in Galway, I do not know.  What I do know is that Deputy Tierney has laid his finger <Col N="293" /> on the weak spot when he pointed out that undoubtedly the danger of not getting the highly-qualified people is there.  The only way to get over that difficulty is to provide finances to enable the native speakers or persons qualified&mdash;they need not in my opinion be native speakers from the cradle, although we would prefer if they were, but persons who have worked up as far as the University and have got their degree to carry on.  There ought to be provision for increasing the post-graduate scholarships to enable them to do that.  If before the Committee Stage, you go into that question in the preamble of the scholarships, if you try to increase them, if you get in touch with University College, Galway, and try to get them to make definite proposals by which there will be no doubt whatever that the persons will be available to do this work, and that it is definitely specified here that a number of scholarships will be granted from this time forward for special research work in the Irish language, there is no doubt that you will get dozens of graduates every year, who are going out into a market which is full to overflowing, who cannot get employment, and who will be only too glad to carry on and get the very highest qualifications and go abroad if necessary. But, at the present time, if a student has an equal choice, for example, as to whether he will go to the dairy faculty in Cork or the agricultural faculty in Dublin and get a good position under the Minister for Agriculture, or whether he will go down to Galway and spend several years studying Irish there on the off-chance&mdash;because there will be no certainty whatever about it&mdash;that he will get a position afterwards, there is a weakness there.  I think that to hold out a decent promise of a decent opportunity to students by giving a larger number of post-graduate scholarships or concentrating all the best students of the other two colleges in Galway, as well as Galway's own students, is a way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are faced in this Bill, as far as the Irish language <Col N="294" /> is concerned, with a difficulty that we are faced with constantly, and that is the question as to whether we are going to make appointments on the highest qualification professionally, or whether we are going to give preference to the Irish language. We have to face that some time or other, and I, for one, believe that there is far less danger that a person who knows Irish will be appointed who may be incompetent professionally than there is that we will have the claims of the Irish language neglected.  I am perfectly certain of that.  Remember that when an appointment is being made in the university, first of all, the representatives of the faculty concerned are consulted.  Every member of that faculty is naturally interested in seeing that the candidate chosen will be the one with the highest qualifications in the particular subject.  The appointment next goes before the Academic Council.  The members of this Council represent the professional side, and they also are bound to be influenced by the question of qualifications.  The appointment then goes before the Governing Body of the College.  That, perhaps, is the body of all bodies concerned which contains the least proportion of those who are professors in the University and directly on the Academic side.  I do not know the exact proportion at present in Galway, but I am sure, without examining it, that the preponderating element are the professors and representatives of the College.  I may be wrong in that.  I admit that that body is the widest body.  Then you come to the Senate, and there again you are bound to have the question of the qualifications of the candidate in the particular subject very strongly represented.  The national side of the question that is a necessity if we are going to save the Irish language by putting it into its proper position in the University Colleges will scarcely be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been, for obvious reasons, loath to speak in this matter at all. I do not want to be taken for a moment as dissenting from a great deal of what Deputy Tierney has said. <Col N="295" /> There is no doubt that a tremendous amount of work can be done for the Irish language on the Irish side itself, and that it ought to be done &mdash;that the Irish language ought to be, not merely in Galway, but in all the other colleges, in a position which, unfortunately, at the present moment it does not occupy.  I do put this to Deputy Tierney.  Suppose you have what he suggests done for the Irish language in the three Colleges, what is going to happen a native Irish speaker who comes into the University and wants to go through all his courses in Irish?  He has to go to the professor of engineering. Has he got to learn English in order to do that?  Is it right that he should be compelled to learn English for that purpose?  Is it not our duty to see that there is at least one college in the country where a native Irish speaker can go through from beginning to end on the strength of his own native language?  I say it is.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come when we ought definitely to make it clear, as far as this body is concerned, at any rate, if we are going to give grants for the Irish language we are going to give them to enable one college to be made a really Irish college.  That can be done in Galway.  I see no other hope as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned of putting the Irish language in its proper position.  I believe that if you give way weakly to the difficulty now you are going to give way to that difficulty every time it confronts you.  There is hardly a case in which an appointment is made in which the question I have raised does not arise.  It may be met within the charter of the University under the Act as it stands &mdash;temporary appointments might be made in special cases&mdash;but I think the time has come when we should let everybody know that if there are going to be appointments made in University College, Galway, in future in all the Chairs there, they are going to be made on the basis that the holders of the Chairs have a knowledge of Irish which will enable <Col N="296" /> them to teach native Irish speakers in their own language. That is the view I know of a number of people here.  I believe that if you could canvass them it would be the view of a great number of people in the universities who have the same views as Deputy Tierney, and rightly so, as to the high standard that the holders of these Chairs ought to have.  If you ask them they will be prepared to face the dangers that might arise through omitting this proviso rather than face the dangers that are bound to arise if you include it.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties in carrying it out, because there is bound to be a conflict of opinion.  You will have endless difficulty and complaints if this proviso is allowed to stand.  I, for one, would ask the Minister for Finance in particular to see that in this particular matter a headline should be set now, and that there should be no further question, in order to show that we are serious about this restoration of the Irish language.  We want to have one college, a college that is eminently situated, to be the college that will become the Gaelic centre where the native Irish speaker can get a complete university education and can qualify for any of the professions in Irish.  If you do not do that you cannot come along to the lawyers, for instance, and tell them that they must be able to conduct their business in Irish.  You cannot come to the doctors and tell them that they must be prepared to work through Irish.  The position, to me at any rate, is that we have here a difficulty which is constantly confronting us.  If we go away from that we are putting off until Tibb's Eve the day when we are going to have Irish as a live spoken language in any university college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are perhaps two points of view to be taken in relation to the Gaelicisation of Galway.  The one is that we should tie up the governing body&mdash;that we should tie it up very tight, as Deputy Fahy suggested and as Deputy de Valera suggested&mdash;and the other <Col N="297" /> is that we should take the view that the governing body itself will realise the position.  Since this Bill was introduced I have had people writing to me to say the Bill was bad because a lot of people on the governing body, who really did not care about Irish, would pretend to make provision for Irish in order to get an increased grant and then allow the arrangement which they had made to fall into disuse, or something of that sort.  I do not accept that view.  There may be people on the governing body of Galway College at the present time who do not care about the Irish language or the future of the Irish language.  There probably will be some people there for a considerable time whose real view will be one of indifference to the Irish language, but I know there are many people there who are as keenly interested in the Irish language as any of us.  I know since the new arrangement was made&mdash;I have the testimony from a variety of sources&mdash;that the spirit in University College, Galway, in regard to Irish has very definitely improved; there is more Irish amongst the student body and more interest in the Irish language than ever there was before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a definitely new spirit in University College, Galway, and I believe that that condition will continue to improve there.  I believe that even the people who do not care anything about the Irish language themselves will see&mdash;and this Bill is one of the ways for making that clear &mdash;that if this College is to increase in importance and to get additional endowments or favours from the Government it must sincerely and earnestly go ahead with the work of making itself an Irish College.  If the provision operates at all that the professors must have Irish before they can be appointed, then the enthusiasm for the Irish language among the professorial body will increase, and I believe between all influences that may be at work that we can depend upon it the governing body will be really keen to make this a Gaelic University.  I say this. I regard the making of this College <Col N="298" /> a Gaelic University College as extremely important from the language point of view.  I can say that although we limit, under the present Bill, the endowment which the College may get to £30,000, if it went ahead and does its work right we would be prepared to make further proposals to the Dáil that would still further increase the efficiency and the importance of the College as a Gaelicised, or nearly Gaelicised, institution. My position therefore is, and it is reflected in Section 3 and sub-section (2) of Section 2 and so forth, to depend upon the spirit of the people of Galway, and to depend upon the inducement held out to them, to do all that can be done to Gaelicise the College entirely.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Deputy de Valera to this extent: that I think with him there is really much greater danger that the claims of the Irish language will be ignored than that the proper standard of professional qualification would be ignored.  We know in the past that what happened is that all sorts of people, when appointments were to be made&mdash;it still happens and perhaps will happen for some time&mdash; that people who theoretically want an Irish speaker appointed when it comes to making the actual appointment, for personal or other reasons and for a variety of reasons, set aside the question of the Irish language and ignore it in making the appointment.  I think that would be a greater danger than the danger of people not actually being up to the standard of university professors being appointed because they have a knowledge of Irish.  That danger is not very great.  I feel that if we cannot make the governing body of Galway College as enthusiastic about Irish as any Irish speaker in this Dáil would be then we will not get any very great progress from the college.  If we depend for the progress of the Irish language entirely upon statutory provisions and the actual sort of coercive pressure we are able to exercise I do not think we will get very far with the matter.  I think we must believe that an atmosphere can be created; <Col N="299" /> that a governing body will come into being that will do all that is possible to create it.  While I am anxious that every possible, speed should be made towards reaching a position where nobody will be appointed to a professorship or lecturership who cannot do his work in Irish, still I do not think it would be wise to strike out the proviso as suggested by Deputy Fahy.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fix a time limit. On most subjects you mention it might be possible next year, or even now, if you search around, to get someone who would lecture in Irish, but on some subjects you might not be able to get anybody for ten years or longer.  And so it is impossible to put a time limit in unless we fix a maximum time limit &mdash;and I do not think it would be desirable&mdash;that would allow for other contingencies.  If we fix a short time limit a short distance ahead we might have the danger that Professor Tierney referred to, that is, that you might have second-rate men appointed really on the ground that they could lecture through Irish, although they might not be up to the standard.  I do not think the Irish language would be helped in having a number of second-rate men, or by having a college get a reputation that it was a Gaelic college, but of a second-rate class.  I would prefer to do this under the sort of elastic provisions of sub-section (2) and have the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance in the position to enable that College to give a special salary to somebody who is able to do work in Irish, to take any sort of special steps of that kind in order to get good men, and to have them know they could get funds to do it rather than have them lower the reputation of the college.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tierney that it would be better to have more staff for the Irish language itself.  I would be prepared to put a slight amendment in the Bill to enable that to be encouraged.  I think it is undoubtedly necessary that there <Col N="300" /> should be additional staff, and that perhaps the Irish Language Chair here in this College, as in other colleges, should be split up into several chairs in order to enable more intensive work to be done. But I do not think that the doing of that alone is going to carry it ahead as Deputy Tierney thinks.  It is not going to get us a professor in geology or a professor in physics who can lecture through Irish.  For instance, technical terms used in conversation come down from universities.  Anybody who knows the difficulties that the Irish language labours under at the present time is aware that even a person who knows Irish pretty well will find that there are many subjects which ordinary intelligent people will talk about that it is difficult for him to discuss because we have not had much university lectures on them, because we have not had the terminology filtering down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney said that we should first and foremost deal with the Irish language itself.  I, too, would say that we should immediately deal with the Irish language itself, but I do not want to say that we should do so first and foremost. I do not think that we can postpone other things.  I do not think that we should postpone getting someone to lecture, through Irish, on history, geology, or any other subject, if such a man can be found, simply because we attach more importance to doing things directly in connection with the Irish language itself.  I do not know Whether there is anything in the way of amendment that can be considered before the Committee Stage.  I am satisfied myself that so far as University College, Galway, is concerned it is realised that we are tackling this thing seriously.  In all the circumstances, I am quite satisfied that there will not be much of a tendency there to ignore the claims of the Irish language.  Even if we left the provisions exactly as they are, and held out no inducement to the College that its prospects from the point of view, as I have said, of endowments or favours from the Government depended on it seriously <Col N="301" /> dealing with the language, I believe there is no danger that we would not have a united effort on the part of those who are in the College, whatever their individual feelings may be about it, to endeavour to push forward the work of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards amendments, might I ask the Minister will he be prepared to increase the discretionary grant?  The £2,000 will not, I think, be sufficient to make it a real inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that. In the year 1926, when we fixed the arrangement with the College, it was agreed that they would not come looking for any further grants until the expiry of the five years, that is, until the year 1931.  This sum of £2,000 was put in really to cover the interval, the period under the arrangement by which the College pledged itself not to come looking for any additional assistance.  From what I know, I do not believe it would be possible for the College to undertake new works within, say, the next couple of years that would require more than £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose that it is within the discretion of the Minister to do it, the fact that you take that discretion does not mean that you have got to pay the money out unless you get work done.  This sum of £2,000 is a comparatively small amount.  I do not think that is going to be a sufficient inducement, or that it is going to give an incentive to do the particular work the Minister wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that. What I had in mind was this, that if in a comparatively short time there was a good professor, say, of some subject available who could lecture through Irish, then the College would be able to come to the Minister for Education and say: &ldquo;Here is So-and-So, a very good man, who can lecture through Irish.  We have not the means to appoint him, and he wants so much.&rdquo;  It would then be possible to arrange to give an increased grant.  There are not <Col N="302" /> going to be very many people of that sort available.  If you got one professor you would probably be doing very well in the next couple of years, or if you got a couple or three lecturers, alternatively, you would be doing very well.  Our estimate was that while we wanted the College to go ahead we did not just want to tempt them to over-rush it. There is no sacredness about the figure.  In view of the short period that will elapse during which the College is pledged not to make further application, we think that that sum will suffice for any developments which are likely to come.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment in order to draw attention to what I consider a grievance under which many of the sporting community suffer at present.  I do not propose to press the amendment to a division, because I realise that if my amendment were carried in its present form it would negative very largely much of the good which this Game Preservation Bill seeks to accomplish.  In seeking to delete in line 17 the words after &ldquo;grouse&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;quail, landrail, plover, snipe and woodcock, and also mallard, teal, widgeon, and other species of wild duck&rdquo;&mdash;I want to point out that before the advent of the Free State there was the occasional licence, the game licence, and what is commonly known as the ten shillings licence. The Minister has given no indication that he intends to embody in the Bill any game licence cheaper than the £2 licence.  We all desire to help the Minister in an easy passage of this Bill.  It must be borne in mind that we have a number of poachers and potential poachers in the country, and if we can convert a number of these men by making it easy for them to procure a licence I believe we will be establishing a very useful precedent, and it may eventually mean, and I believe it will, the multiplication of game in the country.  As I said, I do not want to force the amendment to a division. I put down the amendment merely in order to emphasise the position that I have indicated in regard <Col N="305" /> to the two scales of licences&mdash; the £2 scale and the scale proposed in the amendment.  Does the Minister, at some future date, intend to institute some licence other than a £2 licence?  There are many poor men in the country who cannot afford to pay £2 for a licence.  They are good sportsmen if they got a chance, but if the licence is made prohibitive, as in the opinion of those people it is sought to be made prohibitive, you have the temptation to create or multiply poachers.  That I know is not the intention of the Minister.  I wish to withdraw the amendment, as I have put it down simple for the reasons which I have stated.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Anthony is withdrawing the motion, for, as he frankly admits, it would rather destroy a great deal of the effectiveness of this Bill.  On the question of a licence duty, that has nothing to do with this Bill, for this Bill, or any Bill of this kind, cannot deal with the question of the licence duty.  That duty is fixed, I think, under the Finance Act of 1926, and any alteration of any licence duty would have to be by amendment of that Finance Act.  One of the arguments the Deputy put forward does not strike me as being very sound, for he says if we reduce the licence from £2 to 10/- we would have less poaching.  It seems to me it would be the opposite.  Supposing someone living in Dublin wants to go out and shoot on the Dublin mountains. where he has got absolutely no right to shoot, and supposing he had to pay £2 for a licence, he is less likely to do it than if he got a licence for 10/-.  I think that persons who are poachers, in so far as money comes into consideration, are deterred by the fact that they have to pay £2 before they can carry a gun.  I am sure that if the Deputy puts a case to the Minister for Finance, and makes a strong case, the Minister will consider it.  But the arguments that the Deputy put forward tonight so far as I am concerned do not carry weight.</P>

      <Col N="306" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;In line 17 to delete the word `plover.' &rdquo;  I have been most reasonable in this amendment.  Though the concession asked for is small, it makes a considerable difference to a number of people in this country.  These are migratory birds, and they come here at a certain period of the year.  The argument has been put forward by Deputy Dr. White and other people that plover have been useful with regard to the production of food.  I am prepared to argue that that is entirely incorrect.  I believe that a considerable number of sheep have died in this country from fluke, and we had thousands of plover last year. I think these foreign birds can bring fluke into this country, and, from information received from some of the largest sheep-owners in County Carlow, I know that to get peony-leaf sheep will travel miles, and that is the cause of fluke.  The netting of plover gives part-time employment to thousands of people, and they should not be deprived of that Surely the bit of freedom we have got, and in fact that we had under the old régime, ought not to be filched now by a native Government. I have not got the conscience to get up in the Dáil and say something that there is no truth in.  I think the Deputies in this House who have consideration for the people, and who do not want to see them deprived of their means of livelihood, should support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>Reasonable as Deputy Doyle may be, I hope the Minister is not going to accept his amendment.  Such a startling theory I have never heard before as that fluke is caused by plover.  I never heard anybody say it.  I do not know if Deputy Doyle has any veterinary knowledge on this matter.  The theory is held in the West that plover feed on the little creatures that cause fluke.  That is the opinion generally held.  I have no veterinary knowledge.  If the Minister submits this to a veterinary authority, apart from Deputy Doyle, he will find that <Col N="307" /> if there is anything which needs protection it is the plover.  Because of its slow flight it is easy to shoot.  A man who could not hit a woodcock at ten yards would shoot a plover. The plover is a wary bird, not easy to approach, and when on the wing it flies slowly along, and the veriest amadán can shoot it.</P>
      <P>I am trying to preserve the livelihood of these poor people of whom Deputy Doyle speaks, because they are so, short-sighted they will exterminate the birds in the next ten years if they do what Deputy Doyle wants them to do.  I do not know about other parts of the country, but I know that in the West the numbers of plover have been greatly reduced within the last twenty years.  When I was a boy one saw far more plover than now.  From an æsthetic point of view I appeal to Deputy Doyle not to press his amendment, as it is a beautiful sight to see plover flying slowly across the country.  They are, in fact, part of our western landscape, or rather they used to be.  It is very rare now to see a flock of plover rising slowly and flying away. They are useful to farmers and do harm to nobody.  I think that in the interests of the small number of people who want to shoot them all the year round&mdash;because that is what Deputy Doyle proposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that we are all a little at sea so far as this discussion is concerned.  Deputy Doyle wants permission for individuals to net plover.  Plover are not going to be reduced in numbers by guns.  Plover, I believe, can maintain their population <Col N="308" /> independent of the gun.  The cause of the trouble is the practice by which a number of people go round the country netting plover wholesale.  I have seen 200 birds lying dead in a field near one man. A type of man used to come from the South with a few men, some of whom he hired, to raise the birds all over the country and try to get them in the direction of the dead decoy. I did it myself.</P>

      <P>Such a man has the best knowledge of the job, as he has been through the mill.  Everyone will admit that there are not a dozen plover now to the thousand there were when I was young.  They have gone out of the country.  I am not going to enter into a controversy as to whether plover have a beneficial effect in preventing fluke.  The question is rather whether we are going to protect the plover as a species, because they are fast disappearing, and if they continue to disappear at the present rate we will not have one in the country in a few years.  It is possible now by legislation to save the species.  In years to come, if they again become numerous, this regulation could be taken out of the Bill; but it is up to the Government to preserve the species and to try and multiple them.  There are two or three kinds of plover.  Deputy Cooper probably referred to the lapwing or green plover, but there is also the golden and the grey plover.  I think that the golden plover is one of the fastest flying birds we have in the country.  I hope that the Minister has no intention of exempting plover from this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also hope most devoutly that the Minister will refuse to accept this amendment.  In my district both the golden plover and the lapwing were quite common a few years ago, but for some time past I have noticed that they are not to be found at all.  That has not been brought about by shooting.  As Deputy Cooper says, anyone who <Col N="309" /> could not get something out of a flock of plover would be a very bad shot.  They would never be reduced by shooting.  Though I have never actually seen it myself, I know that the scarcity of plover has been brought about largely by netting. Like the partridge, we have practically none of them in my part of the country now.  Further, the taking of plovers' eggs for gourmets has also militated against the number of plover in the country.  Considering the good that these birds are reported to do and the fact that they are most useful in keeping away fluke, I hope that the Minister will not consider the amendment for one moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment of Deputy Doyle. We have heard, as far as plover is concerned, that there is a doubt as to the value of the bird in keeping down fluke in the country.  On the occasion of the last debate on this Bill, it was said that they were instrumental in preventing fluke in cattle by eating up the small creatures that were supposed to cause fluke in cattle.  Now there is great doubt amongst the members of the House with regard to that.  I think that in considering the birds, there should be a little consideration for the men who live by netting the birds.  I do not see why the preservation of these birds should override the preservation of the human beings who have to live by catching them.  About 200 men get seasonal employment in netting plover in my county.  They live in out-of-the-way places in bogs and on barren land, and if they are deprived of their livelihood at a slack season of the year, it means that they will have to clear out of their homes and drift to the towns and so increase unemployment there.  These 200 men and their families in one county should be considered.  I suppose you could multiply that by twenty-six for the whole Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>I do not know about <Col N="310" /> that.  I know men in my county who for generations have carried on the business of plover-netting and derived a good livelihood from the sale of the birds.  I am told also that traders in the towns will give them credit when they are in need of it, because when the netting season comes round they are able to pay up all they owe if they get one month's plover-catching.  Deputy Cooper says that the interests of the sportsmen who go out shooting plover ought to be considered.  Let us put the interests of the man who can go out every day in the year shooting plover or other game against the interests of the man who has to go out netting them to keep a family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey says that the species will not be extinct for fifteen years.  Why not let the netting of plover be carried on for that time?  It is better that plover should become extinct than let the men who are living by netting them become extinct.  I hope the Minister will consider the interests of the men who are living by this business instead of the interests of the sportsmen who will not go without a meal because they have no plover to shoot.  I feel very strongly on this point, and so do the people in Kildare.  I ask the Minister not to let his zeal for the preservation of game outrun his discretion in this matter.  The other provisions of the Bill protect the remaining species, grouse, etc., and if these plover netters attempt to poach on other game, there are other ways of preventing them from doing that, because they cannot, sell except to a licensed dealer, so that there is no fear of their turning poachers.  I ask in the interests of these men that the Minister should accept the amendment and show that the Government has given some little consideration for the wants of the unfortunate poor.</P>

      <P>We have heard some rather strange theories about the unfortunate plover.  As Deputy Gorey has pointed out, there are really two classes of plover, because I put the grey and the golden into one class.  They are practically the same class.  They are entirely migratory birds.  That is not true of the lapwing, because a number of lapwing or green plover breed in this country.  I was rather astonished to hear that the unfortunate lapwing was the cause of fluke, and that he imported it from I do not know where.  That is an entirely novel theory.  It was also said that a plant called peonyleaf caused fluke.  That is something new to me.  What is a generally accepted veterinary theory about the life history of fluke is that in one stage of its growth it is necessary for it to inhabit a water snail.  The green plover does not eat the germs of fluke directly but eats the water snail, and by diminishing the number of water snails it diminishes the number of hosts for these fluke germs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is common knowledge, that sheep get fluke on low-lying land.  You can buy sheep which come off a dry mountain quite safely, but if you buy them off a wet mountain, they die off with great frequency. The reason is that the water-snail is found on the wet mountain and not on the dry mountain, and it is a generally accepted veterinary theory that the green plover is of great assistance in eradicating <Col N="312" /> fluke.  I do not know of my own knowledge, but I have seen it stated that an Act has been passed in England for the preservation of green plover, having regard to the fact that it is so helpful to farmers. As well as in the matter of fluke, the green plover is very helpful in eating insects and a lot of the grub which attack wheat, oats and various other things.  The plover is extremely useful in destroying wireworm, for example.  The green plover is a very useful bird.  I agree with Deputy Cooper and Deputy Wolfe that, as far as my observation goes, green plover is in danger of extinction.  I do not now see anything like the flocks of green plover that we saw some years ago.  Every Deputy will agree with that, and I think it would be a great pity if green plover were exterminated.  Certain persons, if green, plovers are preserved, may lose a partial source of livelihood, but after all, we have to look to the advantage of the whole farming community of the country.  A certain number of persons may suffer to a certain extent, but that is a thing that cannot be avoided.  Deputy Doyle made a very pathetic plea and I am perfectly willing to leave this question to the free, unfettered, unhampered vote of the House and see if his eloquence has carried the House.  My own view is that it would be very unwise to delete the word &ldquo;plover.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to kill or take any game belonging to a class of game mentioned in the first column of the First Schedule to this Act during the period specified in respect or such class of game in the second column of the said First Schedule.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who kills or takes any game in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Part of this Act and shall be punishable accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this Act and in every Act passed after the passing of this Act the expression &ldquo;annual close season&rdquo; in relation to game belonging to any of the classes of game mentioned in the first column of the First Schedule to this Act means the annual period of time within which the killing or taking of such game is prohibited by this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> Before sub-section (2), page 2, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister may, on the application of the master or other person having charge of a pack of harriers, issue to such person a permit to hunt in any district specified in such permit with such pack of harriers during the period beginning on the 19th day and ending on the 31st day of March in the year in which such permit is issued, and whenever any such permit is so issued the taking and killing of hares by hunting with the pack of harriers in the district and during the period to which such permit relates shall not be a contravention of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessary for this reason.  After long consideration with the coursing authorities we came to an agreement that the 18th March would be a proper close season for general purposes for the coursing of hares.  Deputies will notice that subsequently I have an amendment down changing the date which first appeared in the Bill, namely, 1st April, to 18th March. That shortening of the period during which hares are protected would interfere with harrier hunting.  It is one of the best periods of the year for harrier hunting.  I had communications with the coursing authorities and they have agreed with the reasonableness, of the view put forward by the masters of harriers that for the mere purpose of hunting hares with recognised harrier packs the period should be extended from 18th March to 1st April.  I take it there will be very little cavilling at this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>That more or less meets the situation.  I do not know the view-points of the masters of harriers.  They may be as the Minister has indicated and I am not in a position to contradict him.  I do say that anything that prolongs the date of hunting hares other than harrier hunting, or that tends in that direction, will be bad for the hares.  Anything which would tend to prolongs the date to 31st March is bad.  That is the particular season of the year when the doe hares are carrying their young.  It is silly to say that that is the particular time of the year when the hares go mad.  That may be.  The jack hare or male hare may go mad, but at that time of the year the doe hares are certainly carrying young.  Another important period of the year is around October and November.  Perhaps the Minister will be shocked to hear that.  It applies especially to this year.  It is important that there should be a strict close season right through the whole summer and especially in October and November of this year.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's word that what he has stated is the considered opinion of masters of harriers and it only covers harrier clubs.  If a special permit has to be asked I have no objection, but if there is any tendency to legalise the coursing of hares in the open during the month of March I could not stand for it. Even coursing clubs should get a permit to carry on a meeting up to 17th March and their hares should be netted by the 1st March and not after it.  Most clubs would, I know, take the precaution of letting away their doe hares, but some of them might not.  I have no objection to this if the tendency is not to encourage hunting by dogs other than beagles during the month of March.</P>

      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister is satisfied that any particular species of game bird is in special need of protection in the whole or any particular portion of Saorstát Eireann he may by order (in this Act referred to as a game birds protection order) prohibit for any specified period not exceeding one year from the date of the order the killing or taking of that particular species of game bird in Saorstát Eireann or in any particular portion of Saorstát Eireann specified in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  When a game bird protection order has been made under this section, the Minister may from time to time by order (in this section <Col N="318" /> referred to as a continuation order) made before the expiration of such game bird protection order or the last continuation thereof (as the case may be) continue in force such game bird protection order for any period not exceeding one year from the date on which the same would otherwise have expired and may so continue in force such game bird protection order either in respect of the whole area to which such order applied or in respect of any particular portion of such area.</P>
    <P>(3)  When a game bird protection order has been made under this section, it shall not be lawful for any person while such order continues in force to kill or take any game bird of the species to which such order relates in any part of Saorstát Eireann to which such order applies without or otherwise than in accordance with the permission of the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the district in which such game bird is killed or taken.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who kills or takes any game in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Part of this Act and shall be punishable accordingly.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every game bird protection order and every continuation order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House within the next twenty-one days on which it has sat after such order is laid before it passes a resolution annulling such order such order shall be annulled accordingly without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 23, after the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; to delete the remainder of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment was because I had a very strong feeling that the superintendent of the <Col N="319" /> Civic Guards would be placed in a very invidious position.  Amendment 8, which is in the name of Deputy Cole, is on somewhat the same lines, and if the Minister for Justice would accept Deputy Cole's amendment I would ask the leave of the House to withdraw mine.  Deputy Cole's amendment very nearly meets what I am anxious about.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 24, after the words &ldquo;of the&rdquo; to delete to the end of the sub-section and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;District Justice for the District in which such game bird is killed or taken after he has heard an application for permission in open Court and enabled all interested parties to tender evidence on such application.</P>
      <P>I think this amendment is in the opposite direction to what Deputy O'Mahony wants.  As far as I can understand it, Deputy Ruttledge fears that the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána might be too lax about granting leave to certain people, although there was an order prohibiting the killing of game in certain circumstances.  Deputy Ruttledge's amendment would make it impossible for anybody to come along and get a permit merely because he was a friend of the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, or perhaps imposed in some way on the superintendent of the Gárda.  Deputy Ruttledge seeks instead to make it a condition that the person would apply to the District Court.  It is not contemplated that the person would make an application to the District Court unless he had good reason for making that application and also that the District Justice would not grant the permit unless good reason was stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment <Col N="320" /> because it would be altogether too cumbersome, and it would be a difficult procedure.  In these areas which will be protected areas there will always be a certain amount of shooting done for the protection of game.  The Deputy knows if there is a well-stocked grouse moor, it will be necessary to shoot some of the old cocks, because the greatest enemy of the young birds is the old unmated bird that goes round and kills the grouse chicken, as they are called. At the same time the proper allowance of pheasants where they are reared is to leave one cock pheasant to twelve hens.  That is roughly the figure that is generally worked on. For that reason persons will have to get permission from some one to shoot off those old birds or those superfluous birds which would otherwise do a great deal more harm. It helps the young birds generally if these old birds are shot off.  Therefore, permits of this nature for the preservation of game must be given. There are certain places in Ireland which are fully stocked with game. There might be a protection order made in such a neighbourhood.  A place might get overstocked with birds.  One who has had his land fully stocked might shoot a considerable number of grouse.  It seems to me it would be rather hard on that person that he should not get a permit to shoot.  Such a man may shoot three or four hundred birds in a day.  If he has to go through the very cumbersome procedure of going into court and making application for exemption it will be a great hardship.  I do not know what the form would be.  There would have to be some rules of court laid down, and probably the ordinary man would not know anything about it and he would have to employ a solicitor.  If you consider that there are a considerable number of persons who come over to this country annually and take shooting and spend money over here you will agree that they should be to a reasonable extent encouraged.  I do not think it would be fair to have this cumbersome and unpleasant <Col N="321" /> business of going into court imposed upon them.  A man may have to wait three or four hours in court, or probably longer, to make an application of this kind.  It would be a very tedious and annoying procedure. I do not think there is any likelihood of having the powers given under this section abused.  If the superintendent of the Gárda gives a licence which he should not give that is a matter which the Game Protection Association or the persons in that neighbourhood who are interested in game could immediately report, and the officer of the Gárda would have to give an explanation as to why he had given the permit. I would suggest to the Deputy that he should not press that amendment.</P>

      <P>Of course the Civic Guard will get instructions as to the principle on which he is to exercise his discretion.  He should only exercise his discretion, say, when owners of shootings show reasonable cause why they should be allowed to shoot.  He could allow nobody except somebody who was really a game preserver to shoot.  A man might say: &ldquo;I want leave to shoot, because I have got a place that is overstocked,&rdquo; or something of that kind, and then in most cases he would probably get the right to shoot only aged grouse, which are a nuisance.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3), page 3, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" />&ldquo;(3)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit on the application of the occupier of any land in a county or part of a county to which a hares protection order relates, exempt by writing under his hand for such time and on such conditions as he thinks fit such land or any part thereof from such order, and upon such exemption being so granted such order shall not apply or relate to the land the subject of such exemption so long as such exemption continues in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have put forward this amendment in the hope of solving what is rather a difficult problem, that of hare preservation, because hares sometimes do a great deal of damage, especially in young plantations. That is the view of the Forestry Department, at any rate.  It may be necessary, for the protection of young trees, to give the owner of a place where hares are likely to do damage, if he makes a case, leave to save his property by destroying what I call trespassing hares.  I think the House accepts that.  It is wider, but it is meant to cover very much the same ground that was Deputy O'Mahony's intention when he put down amendment 12.</P>

      <P>I consulted with the Parliamentary draughtsman, and his view was that what the Deputy wants is already covered, because if you authorise a person to do a thing he may do it also by his agents.  That is the general principle of draughtsmanship, and if words of this kind were put into the Bill it would not be artistic draughtsmanship.  But I can assure the Deputy that what he wants is covered.  For instance, somebody owns land and he traps rabbits on it.  He need not go out and physically set the traps himself; he can hire a trapper to do it, get friends to do it voluntarily, or give away the trapping to somebody else. What he can do himself he can authorise any person to do.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may by order declare any game preservation or gun-dog club which is <Col N="328" /> affiliated to the organisation commonly called and known as the Irish Kennel Club to be a recognised game preservation or gun-dog club for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may at any time at his absolute discretion by order revoke any order previously made by him under the foregoing sub-section.</P>
    <P>(3)  So long as an order made under the first sub-section of this section continues in force, the game preservation or gun-dog club to which such order relates shall be a recognised game preservation or gun-dog club within the meaning of this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment was put down to endeavour to obtain for people preserving game other than hares the same provisions that are given to coursing clubs.  I pointed out on the Second Reading that the formation of clubs for the preservation of game will be a necessity if game is to be preserved.  Realising that, I put down this amendment.  I drafted it in terms similar to the provisions in the Bill dealing with coursing clubs, and in doing so it became necessary to name what might be called some governing body.  In conversation with people with whom I am associated it was suggested that the Irish Kennel Club would be a desirable body.  It is a highly democratic body, and includes people in all grades and positions in society. However, if the Minister considers it inadvisable to accept that body I would have no objection to substituting some other body, or, in the alternative, the Minister could give individual clubs recognition.  Either would appeal to me.  I put forward the amendment for what it is worth. I do honestly believe that any attempt to preserve game can only be achieved by the formation of clubs, and by the co-operation of the smallholders and other people, just as the preservation of hares has been achieved up to this by such methods. It is for that reason that we, who are so anxious to preserve game, <Col N="329" /> think that we are entitled to be given the same provisions as are given to coursing clubs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very strongly to support the suggestion that clubs be recognised in some way by the Minister, because the whole object of this Bill will be defeated unless clubs are formed for the purpose of re-stocking game birds that are at present practically extinct, and, more important, in order to endeavour to exterminate scourges such as scald-crows, magpies and hawks, owing to which game is extinct. In many parts there are no partridge, pheasants, or many other kinds of game.  If these clubs are not formed, there is no possibility of re-stocking the country.  I spoke at length on this matter earlier with regard to procuring eggs, and I now say that these clubs should be formed.  A small sum could be given per head for magpies, scald-crows and hawks.  The Bill will be of no avail whatever unless something like that is done.  The young birds, after being hatched, are exterminated almost before they have got their feathers.  Everyone knows that, and we are wasting time unless something like what I suggest is done. Everyone knows that these scourges have not been interfered with for many years, and that there are flocks of them exterminating the game.</P>

      <P>The only fault that I find with the amendment is in the second and third lines:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order declare any game preservation or gun-dog club which is affiliated to the organisation commonly called and known as the Irish Kennel Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty that I see.  I think the words might be deleted from the word &ldquo;club,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the Irish Kennel Club&rdquo; might or might not be the title of the body set up to deal with this <Col N="330" /> question of clubs.  Unless we have local preservation organisations composed of the owners of the land in which game is reared, and their co-operation, you can never have winged game in this country.  The owners are the foundation upon which the whole success rests, and unless you can make them realise that it is their own property, that the game when alive is worth a certain amount, and that they can get value for it either by setting the shootings to people who want to take it, or by shooting it themselves, it will not be a success.  It is not necessary that the Irish Kennel Club should be the body.  I think it would be much better to accept the amendment with the deletion of the words after the words &ldquo;gun-dog club.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely in sympathy with what has been said in favour of this amendment, as far as it deals with the necessity to establish an association, if there is to be game preservation. Already some associations are at work.  They are doing very good work indeed for the preservation of game, and I would like to see game preservation associations springing up.  I agree with Deputies that that is the real way to make Ireland a first-class shooting country, and to establish a great national asset.  Of course there is very little gain to these associations by recognition.  As far as the coursing clubs are concerned, they get special rights.  That is to say, they get special rights to trap and buy hares.  That is really the main reason why the coursing clubs are recognised.  Coursing clubs also get one little privilege extra.  It is easier for them, because under Section 15 (1) any one may prosecute trespassers.  That is easier, because they need not bring prosecution in the name of the owner of the land; they are allowed to bring it in their own name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is another amendment which Deputy Bennett has down, that this right should be given to shooting associations.  That is the only right <Col N="331" /> which an authorised shooting association would get and it is a comparatively small right, but if the Deputies think that it would help the formation of an association that they should be recognised I would be very willing indeed that they should receive some sort of formal recognition, but I agree with Deputy Gorey that I am not at all sure that it would be correct for this House to put in affiliated to the Irish Kennel Club, and Deputy Bennett is not insisting on that.  I am not to be taken for one moment as saying anything derogatory to the Irish Kennel Club, which is an excellent body and which has been doing work of an admirable character.  As far as I know, there are not in existence at present any game preservation associations which are affiliated to the Irish Kennel Club, and I do not think the Irish Kennel Club has up to this dealt with game preservation, nor have I before me any suggestion or information from it that it would be willing to act, so therefore I think it would not be.  I am not saying anything against the Irish Kennel Club.  I cannot say, on the other hand, that it would be advisable that their name, which is only tentatively being put forward by Deputy Bennett, should be kept there.  Also there are associations which were preserving game up to this and I think they naturally would be annoyed if they, or the Irish Game Protection Association which has done work up to this, suddenly found that they have to affiliate with another body. If the Deputy thinks it would be of help I would be willing that an amendment should be inserted that any game association recognised, say, by the Minister, would have those particular rights. I would be perfectly willing, and if there is a general federation of game societies later on and if you can show a central body directing game preservation all over Ireland, one acknowledged head, so to speak, then, as in coursing matters, a short Bill might be brought in afterwards saying that these privileges would <Col N="332" /> only be granted to clubs affiliated with that particular body.  At present, as I say, as far as I am concerned, if the House wishes to give these powers to any recognised game preservation association, I will see that an amendment to that effect is inserted on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to withdraw the amendment following the Minister's statement.  I would ask the Minister, when he mentions &ldquo;game preservation societies,&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;including gun-dog clubs.&rdquo;  The two largest associations happen to be gun-dog clubs. The one in which I am particularly interested is a gun-dog club.  The work done there is so great that they have about 80 members, or 100 members, and this year they destroyed 1,500 or 2,000 head of vermin. It would be necessary to change this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a purist in the English language, it tears my heart to recognise any association known as the gun-dog club.  It is barbarous slang.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 10 of the Act of the Parliament of Ireland passed in the year 1787 and entitled `An Act for the preservation of the game' (27 Geo. III. ch. 35) is hereby amended by the insertion of the words `rabbits, plover' therein immediately before the word `woodcock&rdquo; now contained therein, and the said section shall have effect as so amended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 18 enables a person to bring a prosecution for trespass in pursuit of game not only for what is game under the Act called the Act for the Preservation of Game (27 George III. ch. 35) but it also enables a prosecution for trespass in pursuit of game to be brought for the extra class, plover, which is now being inserted in this Bill.  It also enables a similar prosecution to be brought against a person who comes into land for the destruction of rabbits.  It appears to be rather unfair that <Col N="333" /> somebody can go into your land and hunt rabbits.  You have got, as you sometimes have, considerable damage to your walls if you live in a stone wall country.  They pull down your fences hunting for a rabbit which they will probably never catch. Your only remedy is a simple trespass. They may also take away from a rabbit warren or places where rabbits are valuable a considerable number of rabbits and your only remedy is a simple action for trespass.  That appears to me to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>I think the person who has got rabbits on his land which do him enough damage should at least have the benefit of them if he wishes. This enables him to prosecute persons who come in on his land for the purpose of taking rabbits.  There is another reason why this is inserted which is really more germane to the particular Bill under discussion.  It is this: supposing you find somebody on your land with his gun and dog and you say he is there in pursuit or game.  &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I am not in pursuit of game.  I came in to shoot rabbits.  I admit I am trespassing but I came in to shoot rabbits.&rdquo;  You cannot prove what is in the man's mind.  Plenty of persons were acquitted by the magistrates because it was not proved that they were there for the purpose of shooting game.  To prevent that ingenious defence invented generations ago by some skilful or astute advocate and which has been acted on for a considerable period I suggest that this word &ldquo;rabbits&rdquo; be put in and that trespass in pursuit of rabbits and game should be on the same footing.</P>

He proposes to amend Section 10 of an Act of 27th year of George III., and in the Second Schedule of the Bill he proposes to repeal that whole Act.

      <P>As the section stands, all instruments and other things which are used by poachers for the taking of game would have to be disposed of by the superintendent of the Gárda. It might be inadvisable that traps and engines used for the taking of game should be put up for sale, because the person whose traps were confiscated might buy them in, or someone else might buy them in his own name for him, and he would have the weapons of his unlawful trade still at his disposal.

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 13, to insert after the word &ldquo;Club,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or by the landowners or occupiers of the preserved lands.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In many parts of Ireland, particularly in Munster, farmers co-operate with the local sportsmen in preserving their lands and for that reason I move the amendment.  Without the goodwill of the farmer, coursing clubs cannot afford to carry on, and so far as Cork county and city are concerned, we find that this arrangement works very well.  I suggest that these words should be inserted in the section.  I do not see how there can be any tangible objection and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy completely understands, if I may say so, the scope of the sub-section.  I would point out to him that under sub-section (1) anybody can bring a prosecution. In the ordinary course, however, the prosecution must be brought in the name of the person who owns the land.  But, if you hire land you cannot bring a prosecution for trespass in the name of the occupier. This gives a certain power to the secretary of the particular club to bring the prosecution, and if he brings a prosecution in his own name, that then it should be no defence to say that the person who trespassed was authorised by the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It means this, that if the owner lets the land to a coursing club, and the club have got an exclusive right to course over it, and find somebody trespassing upon it, they can bring a prosecution in their own name, and it will not be a defence for the person who was poaching to say that he was authorised by the owner of the land.  In other words, if a person lets his land to a coursing club he cannot let it to anybody else.  If there was a prosecution brought in the name of the owner of land, which, apart from the section, would be the only name in which it could be brought, it would be a good defence to that prosecution to say, &ldquo;I was authorised by the owner; I have a letter from him.&rdquo;  Under that, the prosecution would break down.  This section enables the prosecution to be brought in the name of the coursing club, where they have the exclusive rights to the land, and, in that case, even if the owner has tried to play a mean trick, having let the land and tried to give leave to other people to course, it prevents him.  As for putting in these other words, that the prosecution may be brought in the name of the owner, it can always be brought in the name of the owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience has shown that in many cases farmers' sons have been prosecuted for coursing upon their own land.  That is my own experience.  I want to obviate that as far as possible.  The Minister must know cases where the farmer has signed over his rights to a coursing club to course over his land for a given period, and where that agreement has been sealed, signed and delivered, if a farmer's son is found coursing upon his own or his father's land he is prosecuted. I want to guard against that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not tend to harmonious relations.  As the law stands it has led to the breaking up of two or three clubs.  I want to make the Bill read so that the farmer who has signed his right to a coursing club or other organisation will have a right to try a brace of dogs on his own farm.  Of course I know he would get permission, but it has occurred where the farmer has given permission to friends to course over his preserves on a Sunday or some other day they have been prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony should realise that when lands are preserved they are not the lands of one particular farmer.  They are the lands of a number of farmers in the locality, and if those are to be at perfect liberty to give permission to everyone to course over their various lands, then they might as well not preserve them at all.  That is one of the difficulties that coursing clubs are up against, that they find this permission to course given in many cases, and when the coursing club comes to net hares for a match they find there are no hares there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of view that is argued here has no relation whatever to the section or to the amendment. Deputy Anthony proposes to strengthen the section in the Bill not to take any of the powers from the coursing club, but he wishes to add other clubs than the clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club.  That is to say, if other people wish to go in for coursing they are to have equal rights with the coursing club.  Sub-section (2) of Section 15 says: &ldquo;Where any lands have with the consent of the occupier thereof been reserved by a recognised coursing club for the purpose of killing and taking hares thereon.&rdquo;  Deputy Anthony proposes to insert after the word &ldquo;club,&rdquo; in line 13, the words &ldquo;or by the landowners or occupiers of the preserved land.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing there to allow the farmer's son to go out day after day.  There is nothing <Col N="342" /> there to give any liberty whether to the father or the son.  It helps rather to curtail their liberty.  The fact is that the words proposed to be added do not deal with that aspect of the question.  I do not think this section could be argued on the point that Deputy Anthony has put forward. Indeed, I think the Minister might be well advised to allow this amendment to go through, because in addition to the clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club there are other preservation societies, and especially in Cork, where you have what are known as Sunday clubs. These clubs are not affiliated with the Irish Coursing Club, but they are still clubs and have a definite standing, and they may grow up in other counties where there are no coursing clubs at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What the Deputy wants is to see that when a prosecution is brought, in the name of the secretary of the coursing club or in the name of the owner or the occupier it shall not be a defence to say that he was authorised by the occupier of the land to take hares <Col N="343" /> there.  What is the meaning of that? If a prosecution is brought by the occupier I think it ought to be a very good defence to say &ldquo;You authorised me to do it.&rdquo;  I do not think the Deputy completely understands his own amendment.  If the occupier brings a prosecution against a man it ought to be a good defence to say that he was authorised by the occupier, but on the other hand if it was brought by the secretary of the coursing association which has acquired the rights of the occupier then it would be no defence.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 42, after the word &ldquo;selling&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;to the holder of a game dealer's licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to try to deal with one of the worst enemies that we have for the preservation of game, that is the professional poacher.  He takes out a game licence, and as a rule he wanders about the country on land that does not belong to him, on land that he has no right to shoot on and afterwards he goes around the country selling the game that he has shot. The object of my amendment is to ensure that such a person should be compelled to sell the game to the holder of a game dealer's licence.  I cannot see any hardship in compelling everyone who takes out a game licence to sell to the holder of a game dealer's licence.  I think that if that is done it will go a long way <Col N="344" /> to prevent the harm that is being done at present by those whom I call professional poachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy to a considerable extent in what he says, but I am afraid that I cannot go the whole way with him.  I agree with him that the professional poacher is a great enemy to the preservation of game.  Not only does the professional poacher shoot over the lands of people who have taken steps to preserve game, but he is also very often a gentleman who shoots grouse on the 10th and 11th August in order that he may get the top market price on the 12th August for grouse.  I agree with all that, but I do not think that this amendment, if adopted, would put the professional poacher out of action at all, because he can sell the game to a dealer.  I think that the professional poacher does sell to the game dealer. I do not think that he sells very much to the private consumer. There are persons who rear their own game and shoot their own game, and yet who, while they may wish to dispose of that game, would not like to be under the necessity of disposing of it to a game dealer. They may wish, so to speak, to cut out the middleman.  I can understands someone, for instance, who has large game preserves over which he shoots himself.  He may be a wealthy man.  He shoots, say, a great deal more than he possibly can consume, or than he wants to give away.  He may have a contract with a club or a hotel or something of that kind.  I do not think it would be fair to him to prevent him from entering into such a contract.  Though I entirely appreciate the motives that moved Deputy O'Mahony to bring in this amendment.  I think that possibly it it a little too strict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one thing that the Minister may not be aware of.  As we all know, there is a good deal of poaching of game going on as well as snaring of hares, while in the close season there is a great deal of destruction of spawning fish.  The <Col N="345" /> people who engage in that do not, in many instances, go into the towns to find a market for what they have to sell.  They are able to find a market in their own districts.  That certainly applies to hares, and to a lesser extent, perhaps, to game. Many of these people are able to find a market for what they have to sell within a mile of their own homes, and sometimes, perhaps, within a hundred yards of them. That is one of the great outlets that the poacher has for what he has to sell.  I would like to see some words introduced into this Bill to deal with that.  The Minister may take it that the poachers in that way are able to find a considerable outlet for what they have to sell. They are able to effect sales for the game they have to dispose of in too many instances in their own districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  I know a number of small farmers who take out a game licence each year.  The game that they shoot they supply to customers weekly, in the same way that they supply eggs and butter and other farm produce.  They have bona fide customers for the game which they have to offer for sale.  This amendment would rule out these people altogether.  It would compel them to sell the game to the middleman, and I think that would be very unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>I do not see how that comes in.  The question seems to me to be whether you are going to prevent the small farmer from being able to take out a licence.  I think that is what it comes to.  In my opinion this is a landlord's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister to consider what steps ought to be taken to deal with this matter.  There is no doubt that great abuses are being committed at the present time by these professional poachers.  They go out and they shoot pheasants and other <Col N="346" /> birds and it is to be deplored that they are able to find a ready market for them in the country and in towns.  That is one of the principal reasons why in the counties that I represent pheasants and partridge are almost extinct at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Shaw is aware that this Bill is drastic enough as it is against the poacher.  I do not stand up for the poacher.  Is any man in this House going to prevent me, after having paid £2 for my licence, from selling the game that I shoot if I have the desire to do so?  I might say, however, that I never sold a bird in my life.  At the same time it must be remembered that there are hundreds of good sportsmen in the country who frequently, when they get a good bag, and having made some presents to their friends, are compelled to dispose of the remainder. I would like to know a Deputy Shaw and Deputy O'Mahony in the case of a man who complies with the law by taking out his licence, desire to prevent him from disposing of what is a profit to himself.  I consider that this amendment, if adopted, would certainly curtail the liberty of the subject in that respect. I know some of the best sportsmen from cross channel who frequently send the birds they shoot to people in the Leadenhall market to dispose of them for them.  To my mind this is a most reactionary amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is reactionary at all.  First of all, the people who kill game are licensed. The game dealer is licensed, and in between the two you allow a traffic to be carried on between a private individual and the person who kills the game.  There is, of course, a good deal to be said for the point of view of Deputy Anthony, that the man who complies with the law by taking out a licence should have all the freedom and privileges that that licence gives.  On the other hand, you are faced with this position, that something must be done to try and preserve game in the country.  In many places game is almost extinct at the moment.  There are only a <Col N="347" /> few partridge to be found in certain counties.  As regards pheasants, they can be imported and hatched out here, but the position is altogether different as regards partridge.  I think we must all admit that the man who takes out a licence and who endeavours to make a living out of the shooting of game is, and always has been, a great curse in this country.  I am referring now to the type of man who shoots every day from the opening to the end of the season.  That the position is as it is with regard to game in this country is largely due to the action of men of that type.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Whether he is aware that the reorganisation of the home-spun industry in Co. Donegal is being seriously retarded by the prolonged and unnecessary delay on, the part of his Department in supplying a stamp; and (b) what decision has been reached in regard to supplying breaking and carding machines and dyeing baths to the Ardara district.</P>
      <P>I received the following answer:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that the reorganisation of the home-spun industry is being retarded for the reason stated at (a).  The mark of guarantee to which it is assumed the reference is made is applied by means of transfers, and any person desiring to have pieces of cloth so marked should apply to the Mart at Ardara or to my Department.  The decision already taken that financial assistance cannot be given for the setting up of breaking and carding machines and dyeing baths at Ardara has not been altered.  Great difficulty is being experienced by the Department in finding spinners in <Col N="348" /> that area and it would appear highly unlikely that home-spun in sufficient quantities to justify the installation of the plant suggested can be made in the district for some considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>Further, he stated: &ldquo;The test as to whether or not the industry is being retarded for want of a stamp is the fact that we have had no application for it.&rdquo;  Again, in reply to a supplementary question by me, he said: &ldquo;I have already informed you that there have been no applications for the stamp, either to the Mart or to the Department by persons desirous of having cloths stamped.&rdquo;  The Minister, by the replies he gave to me, endeavoured to lead the House to believe that no request had been put forward for a stamp.  I may point out to the Minister that Deputy Law, on 17th October, 1928, put a question to him regarding the provision of a stamp at that particular time.  The Minister, in reply, promised that the stamp would be provided.  Before Christmas an inspector and an official from the Minister's Department gave the people in Ardara during the time they were there a specific promise that the stamp would be provided. So much for the Minister's contention that no request had been made for a stamp.  Again, on 12th June of this year I find that a further question was put to the Minister as to &ldquo;whether it has been decided to supply a stamp, to furnish carding and breaking machines, and facilities for dyeing the wool.&rdquo;  The Minister was not in the House on that occasion, and the answer was given by Deputy Roddy, the Parliamentary Secretary, in which he stated: &ldquo;It is proposed that there should be an official mark of quality and character to be applied under adequate safeguards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the Minister's contention that no request had been made for a stamp to be supplied. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to what the Congested Districts Board did in regard to the industry in this respect.  In the year 1893 the Irish Industries Association suggested that the Congested <Col N="349" /> Districts Board should unite with them in an effort to improve the manufacture of hand-spun tweeds in the Ardara district.  The improvements scheme provided for the establishment of a store for rolls of tweed; the inspection at monthly fair in Ardara of all the rolls submitted for examination; the stamping or branding of all rolls of thoroughly good manufacture; and the payment of a bonus of 1½d. per yard to the owner and a ½d. per yard to the weaver.  Sufficient precautions were devised to guard against improper claims.  As a result, both the quality and price of the tweeds improved greatly.  Again, I would like to point out to the Minister that the Gaeltacht Commission set up with regard to improving the economic conditions in the Gaeltacht and assisting the language, recommended:</P>
    <P>The homespun industry, that is, the weaving of homespun yarns in the homes of the people, is, in the opinion of the Commission, capable of being made a very valuable industry in many parts of the Gaeltacht.  All the local circumstances point to this.  The industry has been brought to its present unsatisfactory position largely by lack of supervision and by failure to keep abreast of modern requirements.  The Commission is of opinion that the industry can and should be reestablished by the State.</P>
    <P>And further it states: &ldquo;Arrangements should be made at such centres as Carrick and Ardara in County Donegal and at some suitable centre or centres in County Galway, for the stamping of approved cloth.&rdquo;  I would also direct the attention of the Minister to an article which appeared in the official publication, as I understand, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in a paper called &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; (although it does not shine very brightly). About the month of May an article appeared in that paper which was written by a Deputy of this House, and with which I am in agreement. It stated: &ldquo;First and foremost, it is <Col N="350" /> generally agreed that it is necessary (a) to revive the practice of examining the webs of cloth and affixing to such as are up to standard a Government mark as a guarantee of quality.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>took the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that a signed article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand that it was by Deputy Law.  As I have mentioned, I am in favour of most of the recommendations in that article.  When it appeared in the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; one would come to the conclusion that the Government would adopt the recommendations, unless it is meant as mere propaganda or political eye-wash.  The Minister in the course of his remarks to me said: &ldquo;The mark of guarantee to which it is assumed the reference is made is applied by means of transfers, and any person desiring to have pieces of cloth so marked should apply to the Mart at Ardara or to my Department.&rdquo; I submit that the stamp of itself will not improve the industry. If the stamp is to be effective as it should be as a brand as to quality, publicity should be given to that through the Press generally throughout Ireland, and if possible a photograph of the stamp should be given in the Press across-Channel and in America.  We have a number of Trade Commissioners in several countries for which the taxpayers are paying heavily.  They should also give publicity to this stamp which would be a brand of quality. There is no use in having a stamp if it is going to be kept in a backroom in Kildare Street.  The weavers and spinners of Ardara would know nothing about a stamp kept in that way.  I submit that there should not be merely one but two distinctive stamps.  There should be a stamp for the genuine hand-spun material which contains, only wool that has been spun in the homes or cottages of the people; and another for yarn that has been spun in the mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not being done.  As I have <Col N="351" /> said, it is no good for the Minister to say that the stamp is there.  Publicity has not been given to the fact. Publicity should be given to the fact so that people in the commercial and business arena in this and foreign countries will be able to see and recognise the genuine hand-spun or mill-spun article when they see it, and so that they will know that it is not Galashiels or other shoddy.  The value of the stamp lies in the publicity given, to the fact that the article is a genuine homespun.  So much for the Minister's contention that he was not asked to supply a stamp. The fact that the question has been raised here on a number of occasions, the promise that was given in Ardara, and the article that appeared in the official or semi-official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal, should belie the statement which the Minister made to the effect that no request has been made for a stamp.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second portion of my question as to what decision has been reached in regard to supplying breaking and carding machines and dyeing baths to the Ardara district &mdash;although I mentioned Ardara I would like to see the industry developed all over Donegal, including the Dunlewy area&mdash;the Minister said that the decision already taken that financial assistance could not be given for the installation of carding and breaking plant and dyeing baths at Ardara has not been altered.  That was the first time that we heard of that decision.  &ldquo;Great difficulty,&rdquo; the Minister says, &ldquo;is being experienced by the Department in finding spinners in Ardara area and it would appear highly unlikely that homespun in sufficient quantities to justify the installation of the plant suggested can be made in the district for some considerable time to come.&rdquo;  In the course of a number of supplementary questions put by me in regard to that portion of my question, I stated that in a letter to a Deputy, written in April, 1929&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood you to say 1926 there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I said that in a <Col N="352" /> letter to a Deputy written in April, 1929, the Minister stated that the question of the provision at Ardara of carding and breaking plant has not been lost sight of.  Months ago, as I pointed out, he stated that the project had not been lost sight of, but in his reply to me yesterday he said that in connection with that matter I went back very far.  I have only gone back six months.  It was then under consideration and it is now well over twelve months.  The Minister stated also that it was well over twelve months since he stated that he was not prepared to recommend the installation of carding and dyeing plant.  Six months ago the Minister stated in a letter to a Deputy that he was prepared to give the matter consideration, but yesterday he stated that over a year ago he had already decided that he would not recommend the installation of the plant.  I would point out to the Minister that before Christmas, in addition to the promise given to provide the stamp for the homespun industry, it was also promised that plant would be supplied to Ardara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The writer of the article in &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; also advised that carders and breakers should be supplied to various districts in Donegal.  The Gaeltacht Commission Report also recommended that loans should be given to set up the necessary machinery, namely, the carding, breaking, and dyeing plant, if the industry was to be improved.  I would further point out to the Minister that when I addressed him yesterday he made a definite statement to me in which he said: &ldquo;I should like to inform the Deputy that the Instructor of the Department, after searching the highways and the by-ways, could only find six spinners in the neighbourhood of Ardara.&rdquo;  The Minister neither amplified nor clarified that statement. I stated that there were hundreds of spinners in the area and in order to confirm what I stated yesterday, I despatched the following telegram to Ardara at 2.30 p.m. to-day: &ldquo;Department allege only six spinners can be found in neighbourhood <Col N="353" /> Ardara.  Wire me immediately and give approximate number of spinners in Ardara area.&rdquo;  The reply, which was handed in at 4.50 p.m. in Ardara to-day, states: &ldquo;Not less than fifty spinners actually working for different parties and big number not working.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>How many are not working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Big number not working.&rdquo;  So much for the definite statement of the Minister that there were only six spinners in Ardara when, as a matter of fact, there are fifty working and a large number not working.  I do not know what reply the Minister will give.  I am sorry that when he replies I will not have an opportunity of saying something further, but I would point out to him that the policy, as carried out by the Instructor, seems to be in favour of the mill-spun as against the home-spun yarn.  In other words, he takes yarn from the Gaeltacht and sends it to the mill to be spun, thus taking employment from the homes of the people.  I submit that that was not the policy the Gaeltacht Commission recommended to be carried out.  An Instructor was definitely appointed to improve and develop the industry in the Gaeltacht and to get employment for the people there, but the very fact that he sends the yarn to be spun in the mill as against the home seems to show that he is neglecting the home-spun yarn altogether. I believe that both should be fostered, but, apparently, that is not the policy at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promises were also made to the Industrial Committee in Ardara which was established to develop the industry that if it put a certain amount of money into an electrical installation the necessary machinery would be put up.  The local committee in order to show their sincerity installed an electrical installation, and although it takes only 15 horse power to light the village they have a plant of 45 horse power which would enable them to give electricity for a penny a unit for industrial purposes&mdash;that would be <Col N="354" /> cheaper than the Shannon Scheme. Any Deputies who read the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission will find that in South Donegal there are 1,500 spinning wheels for which money was advanced by the old Congested Districts Board and in connection with which the loans were regularly repaid by the spinners.  There are, as I say, roughly 1,500 spinning wheels, and if we estimate the value of each wheel at £2 it means that you have £3,000 worth of spinning wheels. There are in South Donegal 600 looms, each approximately valued at £15, so that these looms are worth £9,000.  If you add to that the value of the electrical installation, say £1,000 at a modest estimate, you will find that there is capital lying dormant within the Gaeltacht, in Ardara area, to the extent of £13,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to get any chance of replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas Cheann Comhairle An Leas Cheann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Leas Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been speaking for twenty minutes and the Minister must get time to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  As I say, you have capital lying dormant to the extent of £13,000.  That should be put in operation so that employment will be given to 200 or 300 people and the Minister should give a grant to instal the necessary machinery, namely, carding and breaking plant and dyeing baths. Before the War, even for old patterns, there was a very big market.  There should be a bigger market to-day in view of the fact that you have tariffs and trade representatives in London, New York, Berlin, Paris, Brussels and elsewhere. An official has admitted to me that if the Minister would act as he promised and if institutions would take even a percentage of the hand-spun material there would be enough work to keep a large number of weavers going.  There is room both for mill-spun and home-spun and the Minister should not neglect one at the cost of the other.  To develop mill-spun and to neglect home-spun is asking the people to commit <Col N="355" /> economic hari-kari or economic suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been said about the stamp and what I stated yesterday in reply to the question.  I repeat what I said then, that &ldquo;I am not aware that the reorganisation of the home-spun industry is being retarded for the reasons stated at (a).&rdquo;  I am stating that very definitely to-day.  I stated in reply to a supplementary question that no application has been received by the Department from anybody in Ardara having cloth and desiring to have a stamp put on it.  It is quite a different matter from saying that there has been, and I know there has, a general demand for branding for homespuns and hand-woven material. The test as to whether the industry has been retarded for want of a stamp is the fact that nobody has come along to say: &ldquo;I have cloth, which I could sell if I had a brand on it.  I am held up with this stuff.  Will you have it examined and have it branded?&rdquo; Not one bale of cloth has been brought in under those circumstances. That is what I meant by my answer, and I think it is perfectly obvious to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In portion of my answer I stated that any person desiring to have pieces of cloth so marked should apply to the Mart at Ardara or to my Department, showing very conclusively that the idea of having a brand, or two brands, as the Deputy has actually prophesied, whether he had any inside information or not, has not been abandoned. In fact, the brands are practically ready, but the industry is not held up for the want of a brand, because not one bale of cloth has been brought in by anybody asking that it should be examined with a view to having it branded.  I should say that the preparation of these brands is not quite such an easy matter as one may think.  It is not.  After a considerable search my Department has found that there is no place in this country where this particular transfer <Col N="356" /> is made, and it is some firm called Briggs in Manchester which is preparing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they were ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The brand will be ready for anybody who brings cloth into Ardara for examination by the time the examination is completed. I said further in any answer that in connection with the carding and dyeing plant the Deputy goes back very far.  I said that it was then under consideration, but it was well-over 12 months since I stated that I was not prepared to recommend the installation of carding and dyeing plant.  I went further, perhaps, than I should have.  I always deal with that question with a certain amount of reservation.  I would not recommend at the moment, and there was no time that I would have recommended, the installation of the carding and dyeing station in Ardara unless I saw there was greater need for it.  The amount of home spinning is not so great as to warrant the installation of a dyeing and carding plant there.  In a letter which I sent to the Donegal Co. Council, the end of the second paragraph says&mdash; the letter is in Irish and I will translate it for the Deputy&mdash;&ldquo;It is not contemplated at present to provide a plant for carding and dyeing in any place other than the places in which they are already.&rdquo;  I should say that whether we establish a carding and dyeing plant in Ardara or not does not in the least say that we are for or against homespun as against millspun.  It has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Deputy that he does not want us to confine ourselves entirely to home-spun, because if we did we would confine ourselves to a very limited market indeed.  There is a great variety of cloth which cannot be made from homespun material for which there is a very considerable market, and I feel that these two things must run side by side.  Just to show that we have not been neglecting homespun as against the <Col N="357" /> millspun, it is largely through our instrumentality that the Donegal Co. Council decided to have home-spun for the institutions, and we prepared patterns of stuff for institutions from homespun out of the amount of wool that was available before the last clip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that hand-spun?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Home-spun.  The other is hand woven.  One of the brands will be &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann pure wool home-spun.&rdquo;  The other brand will be &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann hand-woven.&rdquo; It will be, in fact, mill-spun.  We are preparing these patterns from the amount of wool available after the last clip.  We bought from the last clip 4,000 lbs. of wool.  Twelve hundred pounds of that are being made into home-spun for the institutions. The other 3,000 lbs. are being made into home-spun or hand-spun of other types of cloth.  We had that carded and dyed in the mill at Convoy and we are actually held up for want of spinners.  We had an instructor out for a day and a half and he only found six spinners in Ardara to handle this cloth.  We are so hard up for spinners at the moment that we were forced to circularise the clergy in the parishes of Ardara, Glencar, and Glencolumbkill, asking spinners to come along either into the Mart at Ardara&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister deny the accuracy of the telegram which I received this afternoon from Ardara?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know myself there are spinners employed by Mr. McNiece.  I say that we sent an instructor out to find spinners and we could only get six.  We are so hard up for spinners that we have had to circularise the priests to get them for us.  Generally with regard to home-spun, anybody who wants to <Col N="358" /> make home-spun has only to go into the Mart at Ardara and he will get every possible help.  There are methods of exchange there for the home wool.  He will get in exchange an equivalent amount of shrunken, carded and dyed stuff or he can dye his own stuff and he will get a corresponding amount when shrunk and carded.  We will have the wool carded for him or we will exchange&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>And give the work outside the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The spinners can spin in their own homes.  The stuff, when spun, can be given to the weavers, 50 or so of whom we have drawn into the Mart at Ardara, and the work can be concentrated in the area as far as possible.  We concentrated at first on the thing nearest to hand. We got out patterns in very large varieties from the mill-spun yarn. We showed them to the trade in order to create demand.  We are following that up now by getting as many of these patterns as can be produced in homespun and getting them out in the same way for exhibition to the trade.  Our policy in this matter is to extend the thing as widely as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>And as slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And not to neglect one for the other, not to concentrate on homespun alone and neglect mill-spun, nor, on the other hand, to concentrate on millspun and neglect homespun.  Our policy is to keep both going together, and I think we are succeeding.  I think that any fair-minded person who visited Ardara recently will agree that a very considerable amount of work has been done in Ardara in the last twelve months.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until Friday, 25th October.</P>
