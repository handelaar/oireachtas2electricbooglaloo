      <P>Deputy de Valera was arrested in an area over which we have no jurisdiction, and was tried and sentenced in respect of an offence against the law prevailing in that area. The Executive Council cannot interfere with the administration of the law in Northern Ireland, and accordingly the only course that was open to the Executive Council was to make representations to the Northern Government that, in the special circumstances of the case, Deputy de Valera might be released. Such representations were made, with the results already known.</P>

      <P>Otherwise we have no means of knowing, except the Minister in proposing the ratification of this document will give us a fairly full statement of the lines upon which the Governments, with which the Executive Council of the Free State were associated, agreed to sign.  Unless we get a fairly full statement of the policy associated with the proposed ratification, we would be more or less agreeing to ratify in the dark&mdash;if we did agree. Perhaps, I am anticipating.  Perhaps, the Minister will make a full statement. But from our point of view we think it would be certainly better and more satisfactory for all concerned. If there are any confidential documents, of course we will not ask to see them; I take it that is not the common practice.  But the letters in which the policy was set out and the reasons given for the signing of this Pact ought, in our opinion, before ratification is agreed to, be published.  I again ask the Minister, in case there are letters which are not confidential and which can be laid on the Table for the information of the House, would he not consider it judicious to do that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has had under consideration for some time past the difficulties which have arisen in regard to <Col N="13" /> the amount of the compensation payable under Article 10 of the Treaty to transferred officers who are discharged or retire in consequence of the change of Government.  Neither the British Government nor the Government of the Saorstát has ever entertained any doubt as to the principles on which the compensation payable should be assessed, and the difficulties referred to arose, in the main, as a result of an interpretation being put upon Article 10 of the Treaty which was contrary to what both Governments believed to be the true meaning and intention of that Article. We have always adhered to, and frequently reiterated, our desire to carry out in full the obligations undertaken by Article 10 of the Treaty in respect of the transferred officers concerned. With a view to securing to those officers a fair and impartial consideration of their claims we set up early in 1922 an Advisory Committee, presided over by Mr. Justice Wylie, to advise the Minister for Finance as to the principles on which the compensation of claimants under Article 10 should be assessed.  In assessing the amount of compensation payable to individual applicants we invariably acted on the awards or recommendations of the Wylie Committee without regard to whether or not the official view coincided with views embodied in such awards or recommendations.  In making their recommendations the Wylie Committee had regard to the principles on which the superannuation and pensions of transferred civil servants would have been calculated had they remained in the service of the British Government. The British Treasury, in a Minute of 20th day of March, 1922, had declared the basis on which those portions of a British civil servant's superannuation allowances which are granted in respect of the cost of living bonus should be calculated.  That Minute of March, 1922, became effective before any transfer of service to the provisional Government took place.  It was accordingly applied here in the calculation of the amount of those portions of the compensation payable to transferred officers which were referable to the cost of living bonus in the same way as if those portions of that compensation were an annual allowance, or <Col N="14" /> a gratuity payable to a civil servant receiving a superannuation allowance from the British Government.  The application of the Treasury Minute involved</P>
      <P>(a)  that so much of the compensation awarded as consisted of an allowance computed on the cost of living bonus should be calculated originally and revised quarterly with reference to the current cost of living figure.</P>
      <P>(b) that the said portion of such compensation should not at any time exceed, in the case of any particular officer, the amount at which it would be calculated if it were computed by reference to the cost of living index figure on which the cost of living bonus paid to such officer immediately before his discharge or retirement was calculated (this limitation was referred to as the overriding maximum), and</P>
      <P>(c) that so much (if any) of the compensation payable to a transferred officer as consisted of a gratuity or lump sum payment should, in so far as it was computed by reference to the cost of living bonus, be computed only on 75 per cent. of the appropriate cost of living bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceedings were instituted in our courts by two of the transferred officers to whom awards of compensation had been made in accordance with recommendations of the Wylie Committee and in strict compliance with the principles laid down in the Treasury Minute.  It was contended in these proceedings that those principles were not applicable to civil servants who were transferred to the Provisional Government and to the Government of the Irish Free State.  The House is familiar with the history of the Wigg-Cochrane action.  The case came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court and the Judicial Committee advised that the Treasury Minute could not&mdash;to use the words of the Report&mdash;&ldquo;affect the rights of officers who at its date had been transferred to the Government of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  In fact, the civil servants <Col N="15" /> concerned had not been transferred until after the date of the Treasury Minute so that it was manifest from the Report itself that the Judicial Committee had based its advice upon a fundamental mistake with regard to the historical facts underlying the issues involved.  When the advice of the Judicial Committee was delivered (on the 3rd day of May, 1927) the British Government agreed with us that the interpretation put on Article 10 of the Treaty by the Judicial Committee was contrary to the undoubted intentions of the framers of that Article and that that interpretation, if carried into effect, would in the results defeat those intentions.</P>
    <P>In a statement which I made to the House on this matter on the 22nd of February, 1928, I pointed out that it was clear that &ldquo;some of the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee in the case referred to would, if given effect to, result in more favourable treatment under Article 10 of the Treaty being accorded to transferred officers in the matter of bonus than they would have received had they remained in the British Civil Service or than transferred officers who elect to remain in the Civil Service of the Saorstát would receive on ultimate retirement in the normal course under the Superannuation Acts.&rdquo;  I added&mdash; what was then and is now a matter on which the two Governments were in the fullest accord&mdash;that &ldquo;such a result was not what was intended by Article 10 of the Treaty.&rdquo;  I then outlined proposals for legislation to confirm the awards already made on the recommendations of the Wylie Committee and to make these awards binding in law.  These proposals included one for the setting up of a Tribunal somewhat on the lines of the Wylie Committee whose duty it would be to hear and determine all pending and future claims for compensation under Article 10.  This statutory tribunal in assessing compensation would be required to adhere in the treatment of bonus to the basis applicable to officers in the British Civil Service immediately prior to the transfer of the officers to the service of the Provisional Government. In a statement in the House of Commons <Col N="16" /> on 23rd February, 1928, the British Government accepted the view that it would not be equitable that the transferred civil servants should receive more favourable treatment in the matters in question than if they had remained in the British Civil Service, and intimated that the British Government were prepared to concur and cooperate in giving effect to the proposals which I had outlined in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Following a debate in the British parliament on 25th April, 1928, the British Government thought it advisable, for reasons with which we are not concerned, that the question at issue should be referred back in some general form to the Judicial Committee under Section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act, 1833.  We did not oppose this proposal.  The Judicial Committee was not being approached by way of a &ldquo;petition for a re-hearing&rdquo; of the Wigg-Cochrane case, but by special reference to it at the instance of the British Government of a general question upon which the British Government alone now sought for its own purposes the advice of that body.  Furthermore, as I have already stated, the British Government and the Government of the Saorstát were in complete agreement as to the intention of the framers of Article 10 of the Treaty, and we had therefore no interest whatever in the result of the reference. Though in no sense parties to the reference, we agreed, in response to the urgent request of the British Government, that counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General should appear before the Privy Council with a view merely to ensuring that every relevant fact and legal argument should be put forward. The Report of the Judicial Committee was delivered on the 13th day of November, 1928.  It is unnecessary for me to comment upon the opinions expressed in that Report.  Our position and our rights as party to the Treaty were in no way affected by the Report.  The view which had previously been expressed by the British Government and by ourselves&mdash; namely, that the intention of Article 10 of the Treaty was that the civil servants in question should receive treatment as favourable, but not more favourable, than if they had continued <Col N="17" /> in the service of the British Government, remained and still remains entirely unaffected by that Report. We have always been unalterably determined that the taxpayers of this country should not be forced to bear a heavier burden than that imposed by Article 10 of the Treaty as interpreted in accordance with the intention of the framers of and the parties to that Treaty.  For some time past informal negotiations have been proceeding between the Attorney-General and counsel on behalf of the Transferred Officers' Protection Association in an endeavour to arrive at an adjustment of the claims of the different interested parties.  The matter has also been discussed between the British and the Government of the Saorstát, and I am now in a position to announce that an agreement satisfactory to all parties concerned has been reached.  By that agreement a distinction is made between those civil servants who have been discharged or who have given or may give notice of retirement before the 1st day of March, 1929, and those who may be discharged or give notice of retirement after that date.</P>
    <P>In respect of the former class it has been agreed that their compensation should be payable without reference to the Treasury Minute of March, 1922, so far as that Minute relates to the overriding maximum and the calculation of lump sum payments on the basis of 75 per cent. of the cost of living bonus.  The British Government have agreed to recoup the Government here the difference between the amount of compensation payable to those officers on that basis and the amount which would be payable if compensation had been calculated in accordance in all respects with the Treasury Minute referred to, so that no additional burden will fall on the taxpayers of the Saorstát.  In regard to those officers who may give notice of retirement or are discharged on or after the 1st of March next, it has been agreed that the provisions of that Minute shall apply to the assessment of their compensation. This agreement has been reached as a result and in consideration of the accepted undertakings of the Government to define with greater <Col N="18" /> clarity and more precision the position of the transferred civil servants.  Legislation will be introduced by us at the earliest possible date to give effect to the agreements arrived at, and for that purpose also the British Government have undertaken to introduce the necessary concurrent legislation on their side.</P>
    <P>The Bill will extend the time for notice for retirement under Article 10 until the 5th December of the present year.  It will also make clear the position as regards the compensation of an officer who is able to establish a claim that he has been detrimentally affected by alterations in his duties or conditions of employment; and of a promoted official whose promotion would have been attained in the normal course at the time it was granted had the British remained here.  These provisions do not on balance involve us in any additional liability.</P>
    <P>Provision will also be made for the setting up of a Statutory Board under the plan indicated in my statement to the Dáil on the 22nd February last.</P>
    <P>The Board will consist of an equal number of representatives of the transferred officers and of the Minister for Finance, presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court.  All questions of fact and law including the right to compensation in individual cases arising upon claims under Article 10 of the Treaty will be determined by the Board and their decision will be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal to or review by any tribunal whatsoever. The setting up of the Board will provide an inexpensive and readily accessible tribunal by which claims for compensation can be expeditiously determined. Subject to what I have already said, all decisions in the matter of compensation taken on the recommendation of the Wylie Committee will be confirmed and made binding in law. Subject to the insertion of the provisions I have indicated, the Bill will substantially embody the proposals outlined in my statement to the Dáil on the 22nd day of February, 1928.</P>
    <P>Throughout the negotiations which have now eventuated in the settlement of a difficult question the Government <Col N="19" /> has had in view two main objects, namely, to honour to the fullest extent the obligations undertaken by Article 10 of the Treaty and to secure contentment amongst those transferred officers who desired to continue in the service of the State.  Both those objects have, I think, now been attained.  The arrangement secures to the taxpayers of this country what was contended for by us all through these discussions, namely, that they should not have to shoulder a burden which it was never intended by the authors of Article 10 of the Treaty that they should bear. The passing into law of the proposals for legislation will remove from the minds of those officers who intend to continue in the service of the State any unfounded fears of treatment while remaining in the service which they might consider unfair, and so ensure an attitude of confidence which is so essential a requirement for efficient and loyal service.  The proposals to be made in the Bill have been accepted by all the interests affected by the measure and the Government hopes that in the circumstances the proposals will be acceptable to all parties in the House.  It is anticipated as a further beneficial consequence of the settlement that few retirements from the service will take place.</P>

Will the Minister tell us just now whether there will be any additional expense for the taxpayers in the Irish Free State in respect of civil servants who will retire, or may retire, after the 1st March?  He has guaranteed that there will be no additional expense in relation to the payments to be made by pension, compensation or otherwise to the civil servants who have already retired.  I did not catch all that the Minister read out in his statement, and I would like him to repeat that part of it in which I understood him to say that there will be no additional expense to the Irish taxpayers arising out of any retirements of civil servants after the 1st March next, or after the later date to which an extension is to be granted.  I would also like to know if there is any truth in the statement frequently made in the Press that the agreement arrived at in this matter has relation to the question of the coinage&mdash;the change in the coinage that recently took place in the Saorstát.

      <P>With reference to whether the Privy Council decision has been accepted or not, if the Deputy will read the answer over carefully when he sees it in print he will better understand the position.  So far as I am concerned, what I have said all along was that we would pay no more in consequence of any decision of the Privy Council in this matter, and we are not paying any more.  With regard to further retirements, I am satisfied that the arrangement with the serving transferred officers, taken as a whole, will save us money, because I think the effect of the negotiations which have been going on for a long time, and the result of them, have undoubtedly been that notices have not been sent in which would be sent in, and most probably notices of retirement will be withdrawn. The discussion of this question of Article 10 was never at any time connected up in any way with the question of the coinage.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of the statement he made in an interview with the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; published on 15th November, 1928.  He said, referring to the Judicial <Col N="22" /> Committee of the Privy Council:&mdash;&ldquo;It has nothing to do with us&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the Executive Council of the Free State&mdash;&ldquo;When the original decision was given we made our position perfectly clear.  We said it was an entirely inequitable decision, a decision which we could not accept and which we have no intention of accepting.  Really, we are not interested.&rdquo;  That statement was made, I take it, by the Minister, having in mind the fact that the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State had given a contrary decision.  Now he is throwing over the decision of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State by accepting the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</P>

      <P>I think that the Deputy will find that all that is in the portion of the interview which he has read out can be found in slightly different words in the answer I have now read. In regard to the main question of the Privy Council, that was dealt with by the late Kevin O'Higgins here at great length, and was a subject of discussion at the last Imperial Conference. It will be a subject of discussion again, and the attitude of the Government has not altered from what it was when Mr. O'Higgins spoke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask leave to move the adjournment of the House, in accordance with Standing Order No. 27, to discuss a matter which I think is of considerable public importance. Standing Order No. 27 says that the Deputy requesting leave to move the adjournment for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance shall state the matter and deliver to the Ceann Comhairle a written statement of the subject to be discussed.  I have a written statement here.  I desire to give notice that it is my intention to ask leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgent public importance, <Col N="27" /> viz., the action of the Saorstát Executive Council in re the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. de Valera.  Have I your permission, sir, to move the adjournment of the House to discuss that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been good enough to give me ample notice of this matter, and I discussed it with a representative of the Deputy. The matter which it is desired to raise is the action of the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann in regard to the arrest and imprisonment of Deputy de Valera.  Standing Order No. 27 contemplates that a matter to be raised should be of urgent public importance. In order that it should be urgent it seems to me that the matter should be of such a nature that any delay in discussing it might prevent effective action from being taken.  In this case, as the Deputy recognises by the form of his question, the position is, that a member of the House is in the custody of another Government.  A matter of a similar nature was raised before on 19th January, 1926, and it was then ruled that no discussion in the nature of criticism of another Government could be allowed here.  In a case of this kind the Executive Council, which is the Government responsible here, could be asked what action they had taken.  Therefore the discussion that is to take place here is to be a discussion in regard to the action or inaction of the Executive Council.  Some action&mdash; I am not saying whether it was satisfactory or not&mdash;having been taken, it does not seem to me to be a question which, in all the circumstances, is one of urgency.  I think what the Deputy desires to debate is the action already taken by the Executive Council in regard to the arrest and imprisonment of Deputy de Valera by way of criticism of past action, not by way of getting anything done to-day.  While I cannot accept notice under Standing Order No. 27, in view of the precedent that might be created.  I suggest that the Deputy should raise the matter on the adjournment.  In making that suggestion I recognise that the usual half-hour allotted to a discussion arising out of a question on the adjournment <Col N="28" /> would not be sufficient in this particular case, and I suggest that more than half an hour should be allowed for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the matter of the arrest and imprisonment of a distinguished member of this House and one who plays an important role, not only in this House but in the public affairs of the country, is a matter not alone of importance but of urgent importance. So far as public business in this assembly is concerned he is here playing an important rôle in the public affairs of the country, and many matters will arise here, even to-day, every day, and in the next few days, matters of grave public importance, in which he is involved as a public representative, and as the responsible head of the second largest party in this House, and also as a responsible public representative. Speaking for a very large body of public opinion, outside this House as well as here, we think it is of the most urgent public importance that Mr. de Valera should be here in his place to do his public duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not going to discuss, on this point, whether any action that might have been taken, or could be taken, would get him here, but we did have in mind that if this matter were given the importance it should be given, and if it were allowed to be discussed under this Standing Order, it would be put on a plane quite different to the plane upon which you, sir, would put it when you referred to it as a matter that, like some small sewerage scheme, or something of that kind, could be discussed on the motion for the adjournment. That is, you wish to put it on the lowest possible plane, and in that way relegate it as far as you could by making it a light matter.  To us it is no light matter.  This is a very serious matter that reflects on this whole House, that reflects on every member, and we would urge upon you that it is our right. in all the circumstances, even if we were to go the length that you suggested of creating a precedent, that the matter should be discussed on the plane on which we ask it should be discussed, that it should be treated as a matter of urgent public importance, and one to which the very serious attention of this House should be given at the earliest <Col N="29" /> opportunity.  This is the first opportunity we have had of raising it.  It is a matter that has certainly excited considerable attention outside, not amongst one Party, but everywhere.  In view of the importance that is attached to it by the public outside we think that you should not relegate it, like some small parish-pump affair, as you would do if you relegate it to the motion on the adjournment in the usual way.  We think that you should give it that attention which it deserves, not because of the personal importance of Mr. de Valera, but because of the public position which he occupies.  We think you should allow it to be discussed under Article 27 of the Standing Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If this matter were under the jurisdiction and within the competence of the Executive Council, so that immediate action could be taken by them by way of solution, then I think there might be a case for raising the matter as one of urgent public importance, but it seems to me that the case for urgency cannot be made.  I am now deciding that the matter cannot be raised under this particular Standing Order.  In regard to raising matters on the adjournment, although matters of perhaps no great significance are occasionally brought forward, when that is so I am usually, as the Deputy will recollect, an unwilling co-operator. On the other hand, very grave matters indeed have been raised in that way.  If the adjournment of the House is moved by agreement at nine o'clock so as to have this matter taken, it will be treated with the same importance that it would get under Standing Order 27. The practice has been to debate a question on the adjournment sometimes for half an hour, sometimes for an hour. and sometimes for longer.  I am not accepting the Deputy's notice under Standing Order 27, but I suggest to the Deputy, as I have already suggested, that the other procedure is open to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect may I remind you of another aspect?  On matters raised on the adjournment no vote, can be taken.  I do not suggest there should be a vote in this case; but suppose that during the discussion of this important public matter the House did desire to express a certain opinion <Col N="30" /> there would be no opportunity of their doing so.  If it were raised under Standing Order 27 some such action could be taken.  It could not be taken on the adjournment because it is prohibited by the Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan (An Clar)</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to you, sir, that the urgency of the case is that the Executive Council did not take proper action to secure the release of Deputy de Valera and that now if proper action is taken Deputy de Valera may be set at liberty.  Therein lies the urgency of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Kelly's point, that under Standing Order 27 a decision can be taken, that is so.  The Standing Order leaves the initiative in moving the adjournment to the Deputy who succeeds in obtaining leave under the provisions of the Standing Order.  A motion moved in such circumstances might in fact result in a discussion equivalent to a discussion on a vote of censure on the Executive Council.  It seems to me in this particular case that, since the Executive Council is not responsible for the arrest and detention of Mr. de Valera, such a procedure is not suitable. If a motion were put down, it would be a different matter.  I am not therefore acceding to the request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not desire to give any facility for the introduction of this Bill.  Repeatedly in this House promises have been made that the Bill to deal with the local government situation in Dublin would be introduced. Last year and the year before on more than one occasion promises were made that this Bill would be introduced at an early date.  Last year we thrashed out the matter here at some length, and a very definite promise was given by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that the Local Government Bill for Dublin would be in time to enable elections to be held and perhaps the Municipal Council of Dublin or of Greater Dublin to be elected in the month of June of this year.  That promise is being broken.  I take it when a Bill of this kind is introduced that the Bill for the arrangement of the local government in Dublin will not be introduced, and certainly cannot be passed in time to enable elections to be held in accordance with the promises of last year.  We think that there has been too much shilly-shallying with this Greater Dublin question.  It is a matter of importance, we all admit, but the Report has now been in the hands of the Executive Council, and of the Department primarily concerned, for a sufficiently long time for that body to have made up its mind as to what its policy with regard to Dublin City should be.  We think it would be better if this House would agree to refuse permission for the introduction of this Bill, and thus force the Local Government Department and the Executive Council to come forward with considered proposals for the municipal administration <Col N="34" /> of the affairs of Dublin City and County.  At any rate, as the only form of protest against putting back this Bill, putting back the question of the restoration of the municipality of Dublin, we have decided that we must not vote to give leave for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will admit that a Bill dealing with Greater Dublin would be a Bill having very much more involved in it than there was involved in the Cork Bill.  The Cork Bill dealt with a simple alteration in the administration.  The Greater Dublin Bill means an extension of the boundary and several other matters connected with it, alteration in the administration and so forth. The Cork measure has occupied a very considerable time in this House and, as a result, I suppose, of some members of the Party opposite getting elected to the other House, it has had a chequered career in that House and has been delayed accordingly.  Two questions arise for the consideration at the moment on the speech of Deputy O'Kelly.  The first is: Is the Dublin Council more important than the Greater Dublin measure?  I think not.</P>

The question really at issue is, is a municipal council, with the old powers, more important than the Greater Dublin measure, even assuming for the moment that the Greater Dublin measure were to be delayed until the last day of the session?

      <P>These resolutions are the most important items on the Order Paper to-day. They arise out of a report which has been received from the Tariff Commission on the application for a tariff on woollens and worsteds.  The report has <Col N="42" /> just been received, but the matter which it dealt with was familiar to most members of the Executive Council, because applications had been made very frequently to Ministers and to the Executive Council as a whole for a tariff on woollens before the Tariff Commission was set up, and when the report was received yesterday the members of the Executive Council were in a position immediately to act upon it.  They thought it well to act upon it as rapidly as possible for the reason that any delay might lead to information getting abroad that a tariff was to be imposed. In all cases in which there is any question of a tariff a certain amount of speculative forestalling takes place. Speculative forestalling is not such a very serious matter.  What is serious is when people get to know that there is a certainty of a tariff.  In such cases what is liable to happen, and what has happened in previous instances when people, if they had not at least certain information that a tariff was going to be imposed, had a very good idea, was that such quantities of goods were imported as damaged the factories working here for a very considerable period, although they got the advantage of the tariff.  This application for a tariff on woollens and worsteds is the biggest proposal that the Tariff Commission has had before them.  The only other proposal that was comparable to it was the proposal in relation to flour. Although the value and quantity of flour imported are greater than the value of the woollens and worsteds imported, yet from the point of view of actual employment that is given, or may be given, the application for a tariff on woollens is, I think, vastly more important. It is more important for another reason, that the prospects of the woollen industry are greater.  So far as flour is concerned, I think the most that could be hoped would be that it would supply the internal needs of the Saorstát. So far as woollens are concerned, there has always been a considerable export trade in woollens, and a tariff which would give the woollen manufacturers the home market would perhaps lead to increase in their efficiency, add to their resources, and perhaps give them an opportunity of very considerably increasing their export trade.  For <Col N="43" /> that reason I think the application for a tariff on woollens and worsteds is really vastly more important than even a flour tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been before the Tariff Commission for a very considerable period.  It was referred by me to the Tariff Commission on the 25th February, 1927, and has occupied a very great deal of the time of the members of the Tariff Commission since. No less than 52 meetings of the Tariff Commission have been held for the purpose of considering the application and drafting the report.  About 11 of these meetings were open to the public.  In addition to the meetings which the members of the Tariff Commission have had, they have individually had to study a great mass of documents relating to it, and great masses of accounts had to be examined, so that it has imposed a very great strain on the members of the Tariff Commission, much more in proportion than I think any of the applications that have been before them. There were 20 firms of woollen manufacturers associated with the application for a tariff&mdash;all the major woollen manufacturers in the country.  The smaller manufacturers who were not associated with the application for a tariff do not, I think, manufacture any very great percentage of the cloth made in the country.  We have had joined in the application:&mdash; The Athlone Woollen Mills Co., Ltd., Athlone; Bantry Woollen Mills, Ltd., Bantry; City of Galway Woollen Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Newtownsmith, Galway; F. and J. Clayton and Co., Ltd., Navan, Co. Meath; J. Cogan and Sons, Midleton, Co. Cork; The Convoy Woollen Co., Ltd., Convoy, Co. Donegal; Dripsey Woollen Mills Co. Dripsey, Co. Cork; Glanworth Woollen Mills Co., Glanworth, Co. Cork; Harold's Cross Woollen Mills Co., Harold's Cross, Dublin; S. Heaton and Sons, Ltd., Lock Mills, Athlone; Hill and Sons, Ltd., Lucan, Co. Dublin; Kilkenny Woollen Mills, Ltd., Greenvale, Kilkenny; Martin Mahony and Bros., Ltd., Blarney, Co. Cork; Morrogh Bros. and Co., Ltd., Douglas, Co. Cork; Mulcahy, Redmond and Co., Ltd., Ardfinnan, Co. Tipperary; O'Brien Bros., <Col N="44" /> Ltd., Douglas, Co. Cork; James O'Flynn and Sons, Ltd., Sixmilebridge, Co. Clare; The Ormonde Woollen Mills Co., Kilkenny; Providence Woollen Mills, Foxford, Co. Mayo; C.J. Shehan and Sons, Ballinamuck, Dungarvan, Co. Waterford.  So the Deputies will see that all the principal mills of the country have been associated with the application.  The original application was for a tariff of 25 per cent. on all woollen and part woollens and worsted and part worsted cloths of a weight of seven ounces per square yard and upwards.  Cloths include serges, meltons, clerical cloths, friezes and other overcoatings, fancy worsteds, etc.  And further, that the existing tariff of 15 per cent. on blankets and blanketing and rugs should be increased to 25 per cent.  After some time the latter part of the application was withdrawn&mdash;that is, the part with reference to increasing the present tariff on blankets and blanketing and rugs.</P>
    <P>The fee of £100 for the hearing was paid by the applicants on the 21st May, 1927.  Notice was given in the daily papers on the 27th May, 1927.  On the 20th June, 1927, Mr. Goodall, of Cork, filed a statement on behalf of the Irish Free State Wholesale Clothiers' Association claiming to be heard in opposition to the application.  On the 22nd June the Woollen Distributive Trades' Protective Association and Irish Merchant Tailors' Association claimed to be heard in opposition, and they nominated Mr. Goodall to file a statement of their case.  The same gentleman on the 28th June filed a statement on behalf of the Leinster Laundries Association claiming to be heard in opposition to the application.  Then there was a joint request from Messrs. Magennis and Co., representing the applicants, and Mr. Goodall, representing the opponents, made upon the 3rd August, 1927, asking the Commission not to fix an earlier date than the last week in September or the first week in October. As a matter of fact the public sittings did not commence until a little later than that, but in the meantime applications and documents relating to it and evidence of various kinds, including printed evidence and literature in <Col N="45" /> relation to the woollen trade, had been very carefully studied by the members of the Commission.  A considerable number of people were heard both for and against the tariff.  Mr. C.P. McCarthy, of the firm of Messrs. Magennis and Co., was heard in favour of the application; so also were Mr. Wm. Cronin, Director Dripsey Woollen Mills; Mr. John C. Munroe, Director, Messrs. Morrogh Bros., Cork; Mr. Edward T. Mahony, Director, Messrs. Mahony Bros., Ltd., Cork; Mr. Andrew O'Shaughnessy, Director, Dripsey Woollen Mills, Cork; Mr. John T. Telford, Managing Director, the Athlone Woollen Co.; and Mr. Alexander Weir, the Convoy Woollen Co., Donegal.</P>
    <P>Against the application there was heard a considerable number of witnesses, including&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's name does not appear here on my list, but there were heard against the tariff: Mr. Callanan, of Messrs. Fallon, Callanan and Co., Lower Bridge Street, Dublin; Mr. Patrick Hanna, Limerick Clothing Factory; Mr. Wm. Dwyer, of Messrs. Lyons and Co., Cork; Mr. John P. Twomey, of Messrs. Jonathan Richards and Co., cap manufacturers, Dublin.  On behalf of the Woollen Distributive Trades Protective Association there were heard: Mr. John O'Connor, Manager of Messrs.  Ellis and Co., Dublin; Mr. O'Sullivan, of Messrs. T. Lyons and Co., Cork; Mr. Wigglesworth, of Messrs. John G. Hardy, London; Mr. Fitzgibbon, as representing McBirney and Co., Ltd., Limerick; and a considerable number of representatives of the other various trades that were opposing the tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to hearing all these witnesses the members of the Tariff Commission visited a considerable number of mills, both here and in England and in Scotland.  They had the assistance of various experts and people with technical knowledge.  As a result of their consideration of the application and of <Col N="46" /> the evidence in support of it, and all the evidence against it at the Tariff Commission, they made the following recommendation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend the imposition of a customs duty of an amount equal to 25 per cent. of the value of the article on all woollen, part-woollen, worsted and part-worsted woven tissues imported in the piece into Saorstát Eireann, and weighing 7 ounces per square yard and upwards.  We recommend that there should be an Imperial preferential rate equal to four-fifths of the full rate.  We consider that where the value of the tissues does not exceed 1/6 per square yard, that is, approximately 2/6 per trade yard, they should continue to be imported free of duty.  The duty which we now propose is not intended by us to apply to blankets, blanketing and rugs, on which, we presume, the existing duty of 15 per cent. ad valorem will continue to be levied.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We consider that the Revenue Commissioners should be empowered to admit, free of duty, tissues of a character akin to blanketing or felt which they are satisfied are suitable for, and intended for use, (a) in the manufacture of harness and saddlery, (b) in the printing trade, and (c) as ironing cloths in laundries and the tailoring trade.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We also consider that in cases where manufacturers of ready-made clothing in the Saorstát secure contracts for the making up of garments for export from specified cloths delivered to them for that purpose by the other party to the contract, facilities should be provided for the importation of such cloths free of duty.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that the existing duty on wearing apparel be increased from 15 per cent. ad valorem to 20 per cent. ad valorem in the case of articles made up wholly or partly from woollen and worsted woven tissues, and that the increased rate should apply irrespective of the weight and value of such tissues.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission is satisfied that the woollen mills of the Saorstát are on the whole, to use their own words, &ldquo;reasonably efficient.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> As Deputies will gather, the tariff will not apply to the whole range of cloths.  First, cloths under seven ozs. will be free.  That means that a quantity of cloths which are not at present manufactured in the Saorstát and are used chiefly for ladies' wear will not be affected; secondly, cloths the value of which does not exceed 1/6 per square yard will not be taxed.  That means that cloths of the shoddy variety which are used for very cheap clothing and for the manufacture of very cheap ready-made clothing will not be affected.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the Saorstát mills seems to be about a half a million yards under the total requirements of the country for woollen and worsted cloths.  But when we take into account that a considerable quantity of the two classes of cloths will be exempt from tax it may be assumed that the present capacity of the mills is equal to supplying the entire requirements of the country in the class of cloths to which the tariff will apply.  As I have already indicated, the woollen industry has a considerable export market. That is an indication in itself that there is a good deal of efficiency and enterprise in the industry, and, consequently, it seems to be an industry in which it may safely be taken that there will be a considerable amount of internal competition; and it is believed that while there may be some increase at the beginning, especially at the beginning, in the price of cloths of the kind in ordinary use as made by these mills, that ultimately the increased price that will be paid by the consumer as a result of the tariff will be small.</P>
    <P>There will be a special class of cloths which the mills will not make here, or perhaps will not make here as cheaply as the more ordinary variety, and so far as they are concerned there will always be a tax.  But people who want a special, unusual, exclusive design, or people who want cloths of a special kind for their garments, will continue probably to have to pay substantially in excess of the present prices.  But so far as the people who are wearing the more ordinary and usual grades of cloths are concerned, the view of <Col N="48" /> the Commission is that the increase so far as they are concerned will not be considerable.  That, of course, is a matter about which nobody can be sure.  But, at any rate, in granting a tariff here this much is certain: that we are dealing with an industry that has a good tradition behind it.  We have mills at present which rely mainly on export trade.  We have mills that when the whole of the difficulties of the post-war slump came upon them set out to recover the markets abroad, and they successfully recovered them. They compete in these markets under the adverse circumstances that they have to face.</P>
    <P>So far as shoddy is concerned that is a trade which consists in making cloths from wool which has already been used&mdash;from reclaimed wool.  It is a trade in which special skill is required and in which more expensive machinery is required than in the manufacture of cloths from what is called virgin wool.  The use of reclaimed wool has not taken place to any great extent here.  It is not correct to assume that there is no use of reclaimed wool in the Saorstát mills.  In some of the Saorstát mills there is the use of reclaimed wool and, in fact, to some extent all the processes concerned with the manufacture of shoddy are to some extent carried on in the Saorstát mills.  Some mills have argued that they ought not to carry it on at all, that it would injure the reputation of their cloth, but the Tariff Commission is not satisfied that that is so.  There are many countries which manufacture a low class cloth and a high class cloth and the reputation of the high class cloth does not suffer because of the fact that in the same country cloths of a cheaper quality are manufactured.  It may be that progress will be made with the manufacture of this cheap quality cloth in the Saorstát mills.  But the fact is that at the moment, for the very cheapest cloths which are used to any appreciable extent by the manufacturers of ready-made clothing here, the Free State mills could not supply the demand.  For that reason the Tariff Commission has come to the conclusion that cloths of a value of 1/6 per square yard or under should be exempt from the duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> The proposal for having an imperial preference rate is made by the Tariff Commission because of the export trade which the mills here have, and because they believe that the giving of that imperial preference rate would be an advantage in solving the marketing problems in the export trade.  The result of that will be that so far as the great bulk of the imports of woollen and worsted tissues is concerned, the effective rate of the tariff will be 20 per cent.  It is necessary, of course, when woollens and worsteds are being taxed that some adjustment should take place in the apparel duty.  The present tariff on apparel is 15 per cent.  But having gone into the matter at some length the Tariff Commission came to the conclusion that an increase of 5 per cent., that is a tariff of 20 per cent. would reasonably meet the case of the wholesale clothing manufacturers, taking into account that for a certain part of their trade they would have a 20 per cent. tariff without having any duty on the cloth.  After consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, the Tariff Commissioners came to the conclusion that when they were dealing with apparel it would not be practicable at all to take into account or to endeavour to ascertain what was the value per yard of the cloth in the garments, or that it would not be very practicable or easy to put 20 per cent. on garments which had cloth of a certain weight and have 15 per cent. on garments which had cloth of a less weight.  Consequently the proposal is that on all made-up garments, containing woollen and worsted woven tissues, the duty for the future should be 20 per cent. instead of 15 per cent.  That figure was fixed approximately taking all things into account leaving the manufacturers of the ready-made clothing with the same amount of effective protection as they have at the present moment.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the tariff will speedily lead to the employment of a thousand more people.  Of course, a further increase in the amount of employment given will depend upon the developments which are not so easy to foresee.  It is anticipated that in the first year the revenue result of the tariff, including the tariff on woollens <Col N="50" /> and worsteds in the piece and the additional tariffs on manufactured garments, will be about £150,000.  It is expected that amount will very steadily and rapidly decrease, and that the amount to be obtained out of this tariff will finally be the amount that will be obtained practically from luxury cloths of one type or another.</P>
    <P>The motions which I will move are motions made under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.  If passed by the Dáil they become effective immediately, so that the taxes can be collected. They lose their effect if, within ten sitting days of the Dáil, they have not been passed on Report.  If they are passed on Report, then the Second Reading of a Bill ratifying them must be passed within a certain limited period also.  The need for this procedure is, as Deputies will understand, to prevent goods being rushed in when a tariff is mooted, and so escaping duty.  It is never possible on such occasions very effectively to discuss a proposal when the Resolution is first moved, because Deputies cannot have been informed of it in advance, and they cannot have had any opportunity of hearing from members of the public who are particularly interested in the matter.  What Deputies do when they pass such a Resolution is: they determine that if such a tariff is to be imposed traders will not be able to get around it by large importations before the tariff becomes effective.</P>
    <P>The report of the Tariff Commission, as I have said, has just been received. It will be passed to the printer now, and will be circulated to Deputies as soon as possible.  I gather from the members of the Tariff Commission that it probably could not be circulated before this day week or to-morrow week, because in printing it the calculations will have to be checked and figures will have to be checked, so that the errors that might pass in the typescript documents may be rectified and so that there shall be none of those casual errors.  The printing, therefore, will be a little slower than if the Executive Council had the report for a week or ten days and these matters could have been going on in the meantime. Therefore, pending the circulation <Col N="51" /> of the report to Deputies, the consideration of it by them and the raising of such questions as may occur to Deputies on examination of the report, I think it is not necessary that I should say any more at the moment.  I move the resolutions.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it should be necessary for me to say that these resolutions will receive the support of Deputies on this side of the House.  I do not intend to speak to them at any length now, as we will have an opportunity of examining them in detail ourselves, and also, I understand, of examining the report of the Tariff Commission before the motions come up on the Report Stage. In view of the fact that the resolutions must come up on Report within ten days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;it might be advisable if the Minister would consider it possible to put one copy of the report in the library, so that it would be available for those who would like to have an opportunity of examining it at greater length than would otherwise be possible if we were to wait for the printed report.  I hope some means will be found of giving effect to that suggestion.  The report of the Tariff Commission, while satisfactory, could not, in my opinion, have been other than it was.  Those of us who had an opportunity of examining the facts relating to this industry long ago became convinced that they were of such a nature as to break down any free trade prejudices that might exist either in the Tariff Commission or the Executive Council and ensure the granting of the application of the woollen millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated that this industry is already doing a substantial export trade.  I think that for the year 1926&mdash;that is the year to which the Census of Production figures relate &mdash;the actual quantity of cloth produced in Saorstát mills and exported exceeded the quantity sold within the country. There is no doubt whatever that the industry is one capable of very considerable development.  It seems to me <Col N="52" /> that if it is given any reasonable opportunity, at the end of a very short period this export trade should represent by far the greater portion of its total production.  I note the Tariff Commission anticipate that 1,000 extra employees will be taken on almost immediately as a result of the imposition of the tariff.  That is all the more satisfactory in view of the situation which existed heretofore when a large number of the mills were working only part-time.  I think over 50 per cent. in 1926 worked less than 100 days.  The additional amount which will be paid to Irish workers in consequence of these resolutions will be considerably in excess of the amount that the 1,000 additional workers will earn.</P>
    <P>I must say I do not feel convinced by the reasons given by the Minister in support of the resolutions bringing these duties under Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1919 and providing that imperial preference will be given in respect of them.  It seems to me that the most hopeful field for the development of an export trade in Irish woollen cloth is not in Britain, but in the United States of America.  If any special rate should be given at all it should be given in favour of the goods of that country in which we hope to sell the products of this industry.  It is true the British woollen millers are themselves seeking a tariff.  I am now speaking from memory when I say that I think that tariff only applies to cloths under the weight specified in resolution No. 1 here.  I may be incorrect in that, because I am speaking only from memory.  In any case there is a highly developed woollen industry in England, and it does not seem likely that Irish mills, no matter how efficient, would be able to penetrate the British market to any extent except in special classes of cloths, such as hand-woven tweeds, which find sale in consequence of their original designs and for other reasons than their commercial value.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is speaking again on this matter.  I would like him to go more fully into the reasons for proposing Part 4 of the Resolution relating to imperial preference.  I am not satisfied that it is wise national policy to exclude from the operations of this tariff cloths of a value of less than 1/6 <Col N="53" /> per square yard.  It seems to me that the actual wearing value of these cloths is not represented by the price charged for them.  If, as stated before the Tariff Commission, Irish mills could produce cloth to the value of 3/-or 3/6 per square yard, its value to the purchaser as a suit of clothes would be much superior to that of imported shoddy at less than 1/6 per square yard.  It seems to me that we could in the course of time educate our people to realise that it is better economy to purchase Irish cloth at a slightly increased price than to purchase imported worthless goods which seldom, if ever, survive a shower of rain.  In any case it is not unlikely that the importation of shoddy cloth will be greatly increased as a result of the operations of the tariff in this particular way.  The increase of the duty now in operation upon wearing apparel made partly of woven tissues is a step in the right direction.  It was, no doubt, necessitated in any case by the fact that the tariff was being imposed upon the cloth, but the trade statistics which are now available indicate that the existing tariff of 15 per cent. on wearing apparel was totally inadequate. No doubt it resulted in the establishment of new factories and gave additional employment.  I have not had an opportunity of examining the returns relating to employment which were laid on the Table of the House to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The trade figures for the first nine months of last year indicate that there was a substantial increase in the importation of wearing apparel as against the same period in the previous year.  The increase in the duty on these goods will effect an alteration in that position, and will still further increase the amount of employment which that duty gives to Irish citizens.  On the whole, I am very glad to know that the view expressed by the Minister for Agriculture at a recent meeting did not operate to prevent the Executive Council doing its obvious duty in connection with this industry. I hope when applications for tariffs on other goods come before the Tariff Commission and the Executive Council in future that the views of the Minister <Col N="54" /> for Agriculture will be again ignored as they ought to be.</P>

      <P>Deputies on these benches will support the resolution, but we are at a grave disadvantage in discussing it at this stage by not having the Report of the Tariff Commission before us.  There are one or two points on which I would be glad to hear further argument, and to read the comments of the Commission in regard to them.  One is the point mentioned by Deputy Lemass in regard to cloth under the value of 1/6 a yard.  I do not think that the Minister made it very clear&mdash;certainly he did not, in my opinion, convince the House&mdash;that this particular type of cloth costing under 1/6 per yard should be admitted free.  As I say, I do not wish to comment very much on that until I read the argument put forward by the Tariff Commission.  I take it from the Minister that the Commission made that recommendation, and I take it that they have put forward some substantial arguments in its favour.  My view coincides with that of Deputy Lemass, namely, that it would be a good thing for the country if shoddy could be kept out.  I think it is really a temptation to people to buy shoddy cloth.  Our poor people really suffer considerably in health from the fact that they are tempted to purchase such cloth because it is low in price.  That temptation will, in my opinion, be increased under this regulation.  I notice that the Minister did not dwell to any great extent on the question of the possibility of mills, not so much mills perhaps as retailers, putting up the price of cloth because of this tariff.  When a tariff was put on margarine undertakings were given that the price would not be put up, but there is no mention of any undertaking of that description in this case, or no mention of any steps that could or might be taken.  I do not know if it would be practicable to take steps to prevent the price of cloth being substantially raised as the result of the tariff.  I think the danger lies more with retailers than with manufacturers. The Minister spoke of the possibility of competition, of having much competition in the country among various mills, and he said that that would have <Col N="55" /> the effect of keeping down prices.  I think it would be an advantage if there were co-operation and reorganisation among mills in the Saorstát, so that each mill would not be producing a large or wide range of different types of cloth.  There might, for instance, be an arrangement by one, two, or three mills to produce one type of cloth and amongst others to produce another type.  That would have the effect of increasing output.  While that would be good, you might have a combination to put up prices.  I do not know whether there is anything suggested in the report of the Tariff Commission to prevent that.  As I say, we cannot discuss these points usefully until we have the report of the Commission before us.  At present I just want to say that in view of the fact that this tariff will have the effect of giving employment and of reducing unemployment we will support the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point mentioned by Deputy Lemass which might be reinforced in reference to Part 4 of the Resolution which relates to preferential tariffs.  I have been looking up the figures for imports for the year 1927.  I find in regard to the part embodied in the resolution that the tariff, instead of being 25 per cent., will be 20 per cent.  The total imports of woollens and worsted tissues during 1927 was 5,242,477 yards, the value of which was £968,859, while the total imports which would not be entitled to a preferential tariff amounted to only 64,700 square yards, to the value of £9,892.  I submit that if the manufacturers applied before the Tariff Commission for a tariff of 25 per cent. they had in mind a tariff which would give them protection against their main competitors.  They experienced practically no competition except from the mills in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It does not, I think, meet the case of the applicants who applied for a 25 per cent. tariff if the Government in appearing to concede that tariff only give them in fact a protection of 20 per cent.  In view of these figures I think the Minister, if he is going to reply, ought to devote some of his remarks to justifying Part 4 of the Resolution.</P>

      <P>Personally I welcome this very practical contribution towards constructive statesmanship on the part of the Minister.  Speaking for a district in which there are two villages, Douglas and Blarney, manufacturing tweed and cloth of a very superior character.  I believe the tariff will be welcomed in these particular districts.  However, there is one portion of the Minister's statement dealing with cloth which is used in ladies' clothing from which it would appear that this cloth will very largely escape the tariff duty.  I am not going to suggest that at the present day ladies wear very much clothing, but, anyway, such as it is they are the largest sinners in this respect in regard to imported clothing.  I do hope that at some future date the Minister will be able to introduce a tariff in this regard which will have the effect of making the chief sinners in this respect purchase cloth manufactured in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of the question to which I would direct the attention of the House&mdash;namely, the importation of shoddy.  There is unquestionably a demand for this class of material in the country.  We know it from the returns given from time to time of the imports of this particular article.  I want to make a serious suggestion.  If there is such a great demand for shoddy, why should not shoddy be manufactured?  The Minister stated that certain ill effects would follow from such a policy.  I am aware that it might be said that because a certain manufacturer went in for making shoddy it might reflect on his concern. At the same time I suggest that it is important to impress upon manufacturers in the Saorstát that they should endeavour to cope with this demand. I admit that it might not be a very laudable thing to suggest that we should manufacture inferior articles, but the fact is that the demand is there for it.  If it pays the English manufacturer to dump and sell shoddy, I seriously suggest that some of our Irish manufacturers ought to go in for the manufacture of such material.  It might not be considered a very noble thing by some people, or it might be considered unpatriotic to suggest that <Col N="57" /> we should manufacture anything in the nature of shoddy, but as I have already said, there is a demand for it, and it is up to our manufacturers to meet that demand and to instal machinery to meet it.</P>

      <P>I have more pleasure in supporting this tariff and less anxiety in relation to supporting it than in relation to a good many other matters. In the first place this is a trade which is specially suitable for the country and for which the raw material can effectively be produced in the country.  In the second place it is a trade which is widely distributed and made up as a rule of small units which have local associations and what is very valuable in this matter, a local loyalty.  It is one of the few trades which, as far as I can see, can by reasonable means, by reasonable loyalty and reasonable co-operation within the elements of that trade, be saved from any considerable danger of peaceful penetration.  That and the local flour mills are probably two of the trades which can be held most immune from that influence.  I had the pleasure a few days ago of speaking at a meeting in relation to a tariff of this kind which meeting was peculiar in the sense that it had upon its platform men of different political parties.  I am glad to see that in relation to this particular tariff there is going to be reproduced in this House that same condition and that an economic measure which is for the good of the country is going to be backed not by a party but by the country, against an interest if necessary. There were not merely absentees from such a platform but there were deliberate abstainers from such a co-operative platform of opinion in this country in relation to this particular tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sorry at all that that difference between the main body of opinion and a section of the opinion of the country should be brought out definitely on this matter.  The State in relation to this particular industry is going to do its share.  I agree with Deputy MacEntee that in regard to the difference between twenty and twenty-five per cent. the Minister may be making a mistake.  My information is that that difference of five per cent. may make all the difference between <Col N="58" /> the large effectiveness of this tariff and its less considerable effectiveness.  I hope the Minister may have more information&mdash;he has certainly the report which we have not&mdash;but my information is that that five per cent. is a critical difference and should be considered as such.</P>
    <P>Now, if the State is going to do for these mills and for the industry its share, I think the State is entitled to ask of those mills that they also shall do their share in any matter in which co-operative effort, understanding and arrangement between them will enable this industry to be more effectively dealt with.  It is suggested that particular manufacturers will not like to have their names associated with the manufacture of shoddy, of cheap material which is being used and will be required to be used, in my opinion, in this country for some considerable time.  I know from personal contact with manufacturers that they do not want their names associated with that. I think they are very wise, because in a small and poor country of this kind if we are going to get an export trade it will be in speciality and quality goods and not in mass production, and the manufacturers are very wise to be very cautious and very chary of the association of their names with anything of that kind.  But that does not get over the difficulty.  There will still be that import and consumption of that stuff, and the suggestion which I would be inclined to make to them is this, that this is one of the things in which they can co-operate with that trade.  They can set up a mill which is not the mill of any one of them, which is the mill in which they will, as members of the trade, take shares and be responsible for the manufacture without a definite association of that particular quality goods with their own particular manufacture.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in relation to the manufacture of worsteds.  None of the mills can afford, nor would it be profitable for them, as far as I can understand, to set up a worsted spinning plant of their own, but there is room in the Saorstát for a worsted plant which would belong to and which would serve the general body of the <Col N="59" /> manufacturers.  A great deal of worsted thread is at present being imported into this country, and it is up to the woollen manufacturers of this country to take in co-operation the steps which are necessary to manufacture for themselves that particular stuff.</P>
    <P>Again, there is another line in which co-operation is possible.  I am suggesting that, as the State is doing its share, it is entitled to some extent to require that those to whom it is giving this concession shall meet them in this matter.  It is in the question of design. If you go into any of the mills in Ireland at present, and I have been in most of them, you will certainly be amazed at the variety of designs which very little mills seem to be able to turn out.  I was in a mill the other day, a relatively small mill in Ireland, and it was turning out everything from fine clerical cloths to homespuns, and apparently nearly every grade in between. I think there is an individual quality in relation to those mills which they are not merely entitled but in my opinion bound to maintain, because it is only upon quality goods that we can look for any large export trade which will be available to us.  While maintaining as far as possible that individuality, there is something to be said for research in designing, for a co-operation department in which the knowledge and training of the skilled man which cannot be afforded by any particular one of those mills will be made available for all of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise this point for further consideration later.  The Minister is going to get out of this £150,000 of revenue.  Now I suggest for the purpose partly of taking the temptation away from his successor that there should be a segregation of the income obtained from tariffs for the purpose of production.  I mean for definitely productive and development work in manufactures in this country.  There is a great temptation, and to some extent it is to the credit of the Minister for Finance that last year, faced by an awkward position in the Budget, he did not fall for it.  There is a temptation to find in the emergencies of a Budget <Col N="60" /> reasons for introducing particular tariffs at particular times, and if it were understood that money which was obtained by tariffs would be segregated, as, for instance, money taken from petrol and motor-cars should be segregated for roads for the purpose of development, great temptation would be taken out of the way of future and, of course, much weaker Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is another point, and in this perhaps we may have later, as we have had already, the co-operation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We must build up an export trade in these things.  In relation to a particular woollen manufacturer in Ireland who attempted to use the port of Cork, and the liners which were plying in the port of Cork, for the purpose of exporting his goods, on application to the liners for the purpose of that export he was told that they could not do so owing to certain restrictions by the Cork Harbour Board.  That complaint, which probably ought to have come direct to Cork, came first to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He transmitted that complaint to the Cork Harbour Board, and as a result the Cork Harbour Board altered the basis upon which dues were charged on liners so as to enable these goods to be exported from the port of Cork in the liners going out from there.  See what happened.  They could not export them because the dues position was of a certain kind.  We altered the dues position to enable those goods to be exported, and immediately those goods came forward to these liners the application to carry them was sent to the head office in Liverpool.  The answer has come back that, as a special case and as a definite exception, this particular consignment of woollen goods&mdash; it is from the Ardfinnan Woollen Mills &mdash;would be carried, but in future every such consignment must go through Liverpool.  Now, it will be very little use our putting on a tariff, it will be very little use our engaging in other activities of that kind, if in order to develop the export trade the transport system out of this country is going to use our ports simply and solely in furtherance of the policy that their export is human being and not manufacturers. <Col N="61" /> I think the Minister for Finance, in co-operation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we will welcome their co-operation in this matter, should go into the question of seeing whether difficulties of that kind may not be very definitely met. Personally I am very glad to see this particular tariff.  As I said before, it applies to an industry which has great traditions in the country and which is in itself eminently suitable for the country, one whose development will have very great social advantages and whose distributive industry at the present moment is of a kind which we want to develop.  I think in offering this co-operation to this industry from this House, at the same time there ought to go out a message that if differences between themselves&mdash;prejudice and lack of co-operation&mdash;are interfering with the development of the industry, to any extent to which a development of closer union and co-operation between them will produce better results, this State is entitled to expect of them that co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules and regulations of this House in connection with propositions of this kind place Deputies in a difficulty.  We are asked to approve in the resolutions that have been put before us of the imposition of certain tariffs before we have the facts and figures from the Commission to consider, and to come to a conclusion as to whether their decisions were wise or otherwise.  That is a difficulty that I personally feel very keenly at the moment.  As far as tariffs are concerned, I like to examine each proposal on its merits, and to come to a conclusion after a certain examination as to whether the imposition of such a tariff is wise or otherwise.  The Minister, in his opening statement, did not make clear to us whether the imposition of this tariff is for the purpose of providing employment or providing revenue. I rather gathered from what he said that the object is to provide additional employment.  He has told us incidentally that it is estimated that the imposition of this tariff will give employment to 1,000 additional hands in these factories.  I take it that these hands will consist of adult males and females <Col N="62" /> and juveniles, and that the additional cost on those who use these articles will be approximately £150,000 per annum.  In other words, that every additional employee is going to cost the country £150 per annum.  Under this proposal 1,000 additional employees, costing the State £150,000, will mean £150 per annum for each additional employee.  That is only one criticism that one can offer, and from that criticism I think it is clear that before the House should be asked to express an opinion on a problem of this character, it should have an opportunity of exploring it very much more fully than we have had up to the moment.  All economists are agreed that all tariffs tend to raise the cost of living.</P>

      <P>All economists are agreed on that subject, and the feature which to me is a rather serious one is the serious difference between the cost of living in this country and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In some figures that were issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce within the last few days we have seen that this difference has reached the high figure of ten points as between the two countries. In other words that the cost of living in this poor State of ours is ten points in excess of what it is in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the figures as published by the Minister's Department. It is well known that the cost of production depends very largely on the cost of living and if our cost of living is going to be so greatly in excess of Northern Ireland or of Great Britain that excess in time is bound to seriously affect the export trade from this country to Northern Ireland and to Great Britain.  These are facts that I would like Deputies seriously to consider. They are important matters from the aspect of employment in this country.  The danger of increasing the <Col N="63" /> cost of living and the cost of production is that in our efforts to provide additional employment in one industry we may cause a much larger measure of unemployment in another industry by reason of the increased cost of production. As I have said, one is in a difficulty in discussing a problem of this character in the absence of the Report of the Commission that have inquired into it, and I will offer no further criticism on this proposal at this stage except to warn Deputies that this tariff proposal is a two-edged sword and may have its dangers and reactions.  I want both of these problems inquired into before any additional tariffs are imposed.</P>

      <P>Ma's maith is mithid.  Is mithid rud dá leithéid seo do dhéanamh.  Deputy O'Connell raised a rather important point as to whether this tariff is going to increase the cost to the consumer, which is the principal argument used against tariffs by all parties.  It reminded me that some time ago I was informed that a ring existed amongst the wholesale distributors of cloth in Ireland.  I have been informed that the wholesale distributors of cloth in this country have an understanding that if any manufacturer attempts to sell cloth to a retailer he will be practically boycotted. In the past that understanding operated very much against the production of cloth in Ireland.  To prevent the cost being unduly increased to the consumer, which is the strong point scored against the policy of tariffs, it would be no harm if this thing were investigated. It would be no harm if this were investigated and the formation of such a ring made illegal.  In America the trusts have operated very seriously against the interest of the consumer, and the American Government have had to take steps to ensure that the operation of such trusts would not militate against the welfare of the citizens.  Deputy Good has spoken of the danger of increasing the cost of living.  He has told us that if a thousand extra men are employed they are going to cost the consumer £150 for each man.  That is a rather far-fetched argument.  Dealing with the cost of <Col N="64" /> living in general, it is not so much the cost of living that counts, it is the ability to meet it.  What is the use of having a low cost of living if you have a vast body of unemployed to whom the cost of living means nothing at all? Is it not far better to have a high cost of living if you can afford to keep all our people employed in order to meet it?  During the war, when the cost of living was at the highest point and when we had practically no unemployment, nobody bothered about the cost of living.  If the cost of living were to come down to half what it is, what use would that be to the unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take America, where the cost of living is higher than it is here.  The American Government are not exactly bad economists, and they are not sentimentalists. Still the Americans have put tariffs on more than woollens, and their tariff on woollens is far higher than the one proposed here.  Reference has been made to the manufacture of shoddy.  I am inclined to agree with those who suggest that shoddy should be made here.  If our people want it, and if many of our people cannot afford to buy more expensive cloth, we should provide them with the cheaper material.  It is quite possible that we can produce a fairly cheap material without going to the limit of shoddy. Many Donegal homespuns can be had very cheaply.  Good rough, strong, hard-wearing cloth can be had at a very reasonable price.  An industry like the homespun industry in the Gaeltacht might be encouraged.  Instead of producing shoddy, if we could encourage our people to produce cheap, rough, strong homespun, and if we could devote some of the revenue derived from the tariff on the imported cloth to helping on that industry, it might improve the position.  There is just the possibility, as happened in the case of the tobacco industry, that some of the big shoddy manufacturers in England may come in here with capital and establish a huge factory to produce this shoddy and send it abroad as a sample of Irish-made cloth, thereby, perhaps, damaging our reputation in foreign markets.  However, all these matters can be discussed when the Bill comes before us.  I would ask the <Col N="65" /> Minister to bear in mind that many people in the country may endeavour to take advantage of the tariff to get rich quickly at the expense of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Lemass's speech.  I was very glad to have such a specific repudiation of the official economic policy of his party as we got to-night.  I was very glad to hear that he was entirely against this policy of general tariffs.  I was also very glad to hear that he was entirely against the policy of a tax on the raw materials of the farmers' production.  I will say this: if Deputies face these problems and show they are able to learn, I will do anything I can to help them.  It is a long step in advance certainly when Deputy Lemass practically specifically tells us that he had abandoned this policy of a general tariff&mdash;that he had abandoned the policy of a tariff on the raw material of agriculture and that he was entirely in favour of our policy of selective protection.  I welcome that; it is a sign of sense.</P>
      <P>However, there is more shoddy in this debate than has been referred to by the Minister for Finance.  There is one point I should like to make.  We are told that the preference should go to America, so far as there will be any preference.  That is what I call shoddy. There is an Imperial Preference system in England at present.  It might be extended at any time.  Do Deputies think it would be well that we should get the advantage of that in case of extension? If they do, do they think we are likely to get the advantage of that if we do not reciprocate?  The suggestion that a country like this, with an export trade to England of between thirty-five and forty millions, should, when giving preferences, give them to a country like America, with which we have no export trade worth speaking of, and refuse them to a country with which we do far and away our largest export trade, is merely childish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. I am making quite a relevant observation. <Col N="66" /> What I should like to know is: what is the reason for the suggestion that this should be given to America? I ask Deputies to consider this question not as having an export trade with England, but say with the Balkans or some country like that, leaving England out.  If our export trade was with the Balkans or some other country that we apparently would have more affinities with, just consider this: We have an export trade of between thirty and forty million pounds to a certain country. There is a question of giving a certain preference.  When it is suggested that this preference should be given, the suggestion comes that the preference should be given to a country with which we have no export trade at all.  That is just shoddy and nonsense. As Deputies have learned so much on the question of tariffs up to the present, they will probably go a bit further and, if they consider it, they will see the great advantages from the business point of view, whatever about politics, in giving the preference not to America, but to England.</P>

That export trade we are going to build up now is going to be very valuable to us, but as to the existing export trade there is something wrong with it&mdash;we can afford to ignore that.

In any case, in future the export trade is the thing. As I said, Deputy de Valera is being let down in a shocking way in his absence.  The official policy was to build a wall all around this country.

There is, as Deputy Good pointed out, another party to the transaction whose interests have got to be thought about and to be considered, and that is the consumer and the tax payer.  Twenty per cent., someone said, is not high enough.  No, not from the point of view of the woollen manufacturer. If I were a woollen manufacturer I would like thirty or forty or fifty per cent.&mdash;the higher the better, and why not?  But there are other interests to be considered.  Have you thought of them?  There is the consumer and the taxpayer.  Any money in the way of taxation resulting from any policy such as this should go to the relief of taxation and to the lowering of taxes.</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite seem to be incapable of dealing with any questions except in simple generalisations. They cannot be dealt with effectively by simple generalisations.  The position here is that in this particular case it was suggested that a preference of five per cent. should be given to imported English manufactured woollens. It was immediately suggested by Deputies opposite that this five per cent. preference should be given to America, and I say that that general idea is completely unsound.  Speaking generally, as this has been raised, my opinion is that if preferences are to be <Col N="69" /> given they should go to the country with which we do the biggest trade&mdash; that is my general idea&mdash;and not to the country with which we do practically no trade, and I say that any business man will agree with that.  It is all very fine to talk in this sense here in the Dáil.  But it would be a serious matter for us if there was an extension of the present Imperial preference that exists, if this country were not able to avail of that.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has estimated whether this is to be a very expensive tariff or not.  It would seem as if it would be a very expensive tariff, and in that connection the chief expense seems to be in bringing goods across the Border. So far as I can learn, all dutiable goods coming across the Border are leading to no end of trouble.  I think it would be worth while to consider whether the greater part of the dutiable goods that come in should not be compelled to come in through the ports of Saorstát Eireann.  I remember when the Dublin Industrial Development Association had an interview with the Minister for Industry and Commerce some years ago one of the arguments he put up against going more quickly with protection was that it took nearly three years to train a revenue officer and that they had not revenue officers enough to perform the work required under general protection.  Obviously there is going now to be very much increased duties put on the revenue officer at the Border, and very likely the number will have to be increased. These revenue officers will have to be men capable of valuing cloth which they see coming in across the Border, and the question is could there not be found a more economic way of performing the duties than the present system, by which, at any port and at various points on the Border, dutiable goods can be brought in.  I throw out that suggestion.  In connection with the tariffs, if we are to get any advantage <Col N="70" /> worth while from them, we should not allow part of the proceeds to be dissipated in that manner.  I do not suppose the Minister is yet in a position to deal with that matter, but it may be that there is something in the report of the Tariff Commission on the subject, and if so we would like to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be possible to lay the type-script copy or not on the table before the printed copy is ready, but I shall consider it.  With reference to the question of Imperial preference and the point which Deputy MacEntee raised with regard to the importance of this matter, while the figures that Deputy MacEntee quoted dealt with countries of consignment rather than with countries of origin, nevertheless, it is true that the majority of the imports of woollens to the Saorstát come from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Consequently it is true that the effective rate for the great bulk of the goods would be twenty per cent.  Now, it was intended by the Tariff Commission that twenty per cent. should be the effective rate for the great bulk of the goods, and the Tariff Commission's recommendation would be, if the Government or the House were not prepared to have Imperial preference at all, simply a flat rate, and that that flat rate should be twenty per cent.  Deputy MacEntee, I think, or some other Deputy, said that an application for safeguarding tariffs is at present being heard in Great Britain.  That application is for a tariff on cloths of from two to eleven ounces in weight, so that the market in Great Britain would still be open for many of the ranges of cloth made by the Free State manufacturers. It needs to be borne in mind in this connection that there has always been a considerable sale of woollens to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is a known fact, of course, that appreciable quantities of the cloth sold by manufacturers here to wholesale houses in England afterwards came back here, but that cannot be anything like the major part of the exports.  I shall quote a few figures casually.  In 1908 the total production of woollens and worsteds in Saorstát Eireann was 2,500,000 odd yards.  I presume they <Col N="71" /> are trade yards.  The home sales were 1,600,000 yards.  The sales in Great Britain and Northern Ireland were 659,000 yards, and in other countries the sales were 222,000 yards.  Now, say in 1913 the figures were similar.  There was some increase in the quantity.  We had in 1913 1,500,000 yards in the home sales.  We had 787,000 yards in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and 373,000 in other countries.  Then, during the war, there was, of course, a very great export to Great Britain, but in 1921 we had a substantial drop, so that you had 780,000 home sales, and 457,000 yards in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The proportion of sales to Great Britain and Northern Ireland has steadily since 1908 been a very important factor in the trade, much more important than all other countries outside Great Britain taken together.  It will be important for the mills to retain that trade as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Now the mere imposition of a tariff here with the present state of industry in Great Britain is bound to create marketing difficulties.  I will say no more than that.  It seems to me that the Tariff Commission were well advised in recommending the Imperial preference.  I personally had no idea that the matter of Imperial preference was being discussed until I actually received the Report of the Tariff Commission. I had not in the short time since had an opportunity of discussing the matter very fully.  But for the purpose of putting down these Resolutions I accepted the recommendations of the Tariff Commission as they stand; the resolutions are based entirely on them.  I am prepared to consider that whole question of Imperial preference further, but, on the face of it, it seems to me in all the circumstances of the position it is a justifiable recommendation, and one which I think we should adhere to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of shoddy, shoddy is not necessarily such a bad material as some Deputies seem to think.  There are qualities of shoddy which are much superior to certain classes of cloth made out of virgin wool, shoddies which are made <Col N="72" /> out of wool reclaimed from samples and tailors' clippings.  In many respects shoddy made out of samples and tailors' clippings is superior to cloth made out of virgin wool.  With regard to the cheap classes of shoddy, it is not at all certain that they are uneconomic. Some of the woollen manufacturers here who do not make shoddies have contended that they should not be allowed, and they have contended that although they are very cheap, their wearing value is so much less, that on the whole the people suffer economically by buying them.  But, as I say, that is not proved, and you have the difficulty of the people who would be extremely hard hit if they were forbidden to purchase these classes of goods, and have to find the price for a much superior article.  The position with regard to this is that while there is a certain use of reclaimed wool in the Irish mills, the mills appearing before the Tariff Commission were not prepared to undertake the development of the manufacture of the cheaper lines.  If we impose a tariff now on those cheaper lines which could not be made here, it is probable that we would handicap very seriously certain manufacturers of ready-made clothing who are operating in the Saorstát and that we might cause unemployment in another direction.  The whole position with regard to shoddy can be reviewed at some later period.  It may well be that the general development of the position of the woollen mills here will cause them to undertake&mdash;either some one of them or a number of them joined together&mdash;the manufacture of types of cloth which they at present do not bother with.  That remains to be seen. The question of shoddy is one of the matters which has been dealt with at very considerable length in the Report of the Tariff Commission.  When these Resolutions come up before the Dáil again, Deputies will have been able to read the Reports of the Tariff Commission, so that they will be in a somewhat better position to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the question of the reorganisation of the industry and to the question of rationalisation&mdash;the policy of confining the product of a particular mill to a much smaller range of goods.  As I gather from the Report <Col N="73" /> of the Tariff Commission, the Tariff Commission set out upon the inquiry with the point of view that Deputy O'Connell has.  While they are not so very positive, in my view, in this matter, they seem to have come to the conclusion that not a great deal is to be done in the direction of centralisation so far as the woollen industry is concerned.  However, again, I do not think I should pursue that until the Deputies have an opportunity of reading the Report.</P>
    <P>Worsted spinning is done to some small extent in the Saorstát, but the finer types of yarn are not made here. The worsted industry is a very specialised one.  As a matter of fact, to some extent each operation in connection with the production of worsteds counts as a separate trade.  There are manufacturers who simply comb the wool and sell the tops.  There are others who simply spin and dye and purchase the tops.  There are others who dye and spin and some of them only spin a particular type of yarn.  So that what the future of the worsted spinning is in the Saorstát is, I think, somewhat obscure.  But, as there is a certain amount of worsted spinning done at the moment, it is probable that the assistance to the worsted weaving which will be given by the tariff may result in an increase in spinning.  The Tariff Commission were, judging by their Report, in some doubt as to whether they ought to put a tariff on yarns so that spinning could be encouraged at the same time as weaving. They apparently came to the conclusion that at present, at any rate, there should not be any duty put on yarn, but that the duty should be put on the woven material.  I think that by a simple interjection, at any rate, there has been a reply to the two points raised by Deputy Good.  The amount that is received in revenue is not what the assistance to the industry costs the country.  So far as revenue is received there is no cost to the country.</P>

      <P>Where the cost to the country in the case of any tariff arises is where there is no revenue but a higher price charged to the consumer <Col N="74" /> for the home-produced article.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the class of boots, and at any rate the amount that the increased employment in the boot trade costs the country has no relation to the yield in revenue from the boot tariff.  If there were no boots at all made at home, and £300,000 were collected by way of a tariff, then there would be no cost to the country except the amount involved in the collection. If, on the other hand, the home boots were fully 15 per cent. higher, or perhaps, say, 14 per cent. higher than the boots made outside, and if there was no revenue collected, then the cost to the country for keeping the industry going would be that 14 per cent.  It would not appear in the revenue figures at all.</P>

      <P>With regard to the cost of living, it has already been pointed out that the cost-of-living figure here <Col N="75" /> is not calculated on the same basis as in Great Britain.  I do not think it would be practicable to do what Deputy Moore suggests.  The Border traffic, of course, does involve a considerable amount of expense and the revenue collected at Border stations is relatively small.  Yet traffic cannot be prevented.  You cannot put up a barbed-wire fence and make all traffic go by the ports.  Even though you try to prevent commercial traffic, your staffs will have to be there in order to see it.  You cannot do it unless you put up a barbed-wire fence and allow nobody through.  Even for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the barbed-wire fence you would have to have some sort of guards.  Besides, it would involve hardship and inconvenience to people if we tried to send the traffic around.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What they do is: in case of doubt the matter is referred to somebody who has special knowledge.  So far as the ordinary imports are concerned the duty would be charged on the invoices in the ordinary way.  In cases of suspicion and doubt a special investigation will take place.  Also, there would be keener scrutiny where exemption from duty is claimed on the matter of price. So far as weight is concerned, that can be dealt with more simply.  There is no special training for those men as compared with the men dealing with the importation of motor cars, or anything like that.  The officer dealing with any particular class of goods acquires a certain amount of knowledge which enables him sometimes to be suspicious much more quickly than he would otherwise be.  Again, he would be able to accept a statement which, if he were ignorant, he might think out of order. The training such an officer requires is a general training; it is not a special training in order to deal with a special class of goods.  The difficulty the Deputy referred to in regard to the number of trained officers is a difficulty which has been overcome.  We had <Col N="76" /> great difficulties in the early stages immediately after the tariff boundary was set up.  We had to take in a great number of men who had no experience and certain delays and difficulties arose, but that has long ago been overcome.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether this matter is being put to the Chair as an actual point of order, but this particular motion in its present form was circulated some weeks ago and actually more than the necessary four days notice was given.  As the Dáil was not sitting, this was the first opportunity that occurred to lay the document on the Table.  From the point of view of order, I feel I would be unable to rule that the motion is not in order, seeing that such notice was given and that the House has not been meeting.  For the purpose of laying on the Table, the ordinary procedure would be to lay the document on the Table and subsequently move a motion.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this reason for urgency.  The Pact only comes into operation when ratified by all the original signatories.  The present American Administration goes out of office on the 4th March.  It naturally expressed a desire that the Pact should be completed and in force before that date.  That has led me to take this rather exceptional step, namely, to have a Ratification Order provisionally completed and sent to our Charge d'Affaires at Washington.  It will then be presented in due form on the receipt of an intimation from my Department that both Houses of the Oireachtas have agreed to ratification.  The ratification instrument has been despatched, but it cannot be released until intimation is sent that the Pact has been ratified here.  There will be certain checks and certain things will have to be done in the meantime.  While I do not say that it is absolutely necessary to pass this motion to-day, I got a motion that was put down in the Senate postponed on the ground that it was being taken here to-day.  Its consideration was postponed in the Senate until to-morrow.  If there were any <Col N="80" /> fears that the document finally presented here was different from that which anybody who is interested in it could have seen for months past, and if such notification had been given, I could have arranged to take this motion in the Dáil to-morrow and in the Senate to-day.  I do not press the matter, but, seeing that the actual draft of the Treaty was known to many members here, I think it is rather futile to hold the matter up.</P>

We are dealing in an official way with a very official document, and we say that the rights of the House should be preserved.  We think that some time&mdash;a day, or, perhaps, two days&mdash;should elapse so that Deputies may have an opportunity of seeing a document which they may not have seen before.  It is not in order to act as obstructionists but to preserve the rights of members that we think that the motion for ratification ought not to be proceeded with on the same day that the document is presented to the House.</P>

No Board of Censors, even as the Bill stands, will hold that a medical journal comes under the definition of &ldquo;indecent.&rdquo;  I do not think it will be an improvement to the Bill or that the Bill will be disimproved without it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that no bona fide medical journal or book could be in the slightest danger under the Bill as it stands, but since certain fears exist it is just as well to allay them.  I think it is simply allaying fears by expressing openly what is already latent in the Bill.  I do not think it will do the Bill any harm.  So far as &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; is concerned, you will have to go on and say &ldquo;historical,&rdquo; etc.  I think that is going too far.  As a matter of fact, when you come to deal with Sections 7 and 8, those are the sections which deal with the prohibition of books and publications. It would be better possibly to define there the nature of the book or periodical which will come under the censorship.</P>

      <P>My impression is that the amendment does not affect the Bill at all, because unless a book is defined to be a book written in a particular language by the definition thereof it means a book which is written in any language.  I do not see how you can confine &ldquo;book,&rdquo; as it stands in the section, to books written in Irish, because Irish, being the official language I take it, if a book could only mean a book in one language it would mean a book written in Irish and exclude books written in English, which it could not conceivably do.  The word &ldquo;book&rdquo; means a book written in any language unless it is defined.  Then the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

As a result of the discussion, if a vote were taken and the words were taken out, it could <Col N="87" /> be left to, I think, some informal process to find out what words ought to be put in afterwards, or if no vote were taken some agreement might be reached consequent on the discussion on an amendment which could be put in subsequently. I think the only way to discuss the matter is to take all the amendments together, and the best way is to take them on the motion that lines 29 to 31 stand part of the section.</P>

      <P>I think it was admitted, even by the Minister himself, on the Second Reading that he was not completely satisfied, at any rate, with those three lines which it is proposed shall stand &ldquo;the word &lsquo;indecent&rsquo; shall be construed as including calculated to excite sexual passion or to suggest or incite to sexual immorality or in any other way to corrupt or deprave.&rdquo;  The Minister, I think, stated that his own view&mdash;that view, I think, was confirmed &mdash;was that it was necessary to interpret the latter words of these three lines by the limitations that were imposed on him by the preceding words. But I doubt very much if that statement is universally accepted, and I am quite sure that the impression conveyed to the ordinary reader by reading those three lines is something quite different. The three lines, as they stand, would undoubtedly suggest to the majority of people that those open up the way to including any paper or book that might in any way corrupt or deprave. The Minister, on the Second Reading Stage, I think, admitted that the inclusion of those words did not add at all to the strength of what he wanted in the section.  I contend his object is gained by the words I suggest, and that the whole object of the Censorship Committee that is appointed would be also gained by those <Col N="88" /> words.  If the words I suggest were adopted there would not be introduced that ambiguity which I do believe is contained in the words in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The words I suggest are &ldquo;the word &lsquo;indecent&rsquo; shall be construed as meaning that which, in its purpose, suggests or incites to sexual immorality.&rdquo;  I took those words from the Minister's Second Reading statement.  He used the words &ldquo;ex professo,&rdquo; purposely, in its purpose, for the idea he wanted to bring out in his Second Reading speech and he gave us what I think is an insufficient translation of that phrase. The phrase &ldquo;in its purpose suggests or incites to sexual immorality,&rdquo; my contention is will secure the Minister's object and they are quite free from what I believe to be an ambiguity which lies in the words of the Bill.  From the various speeches that were made I think there will be very large agreement amongst members of this House that we ought not to allow it to be said that any kind of censorship is being introduced against any paper which may in any way corrupt or deprave.  It was not the purpose of the censorship committee to go into that wide matter.  It is not the Minister's purpose in this Bill to introduce censorship of that wide kind.  I sincerely hope the House will not pass the definition in the form the Minister suggested to the House.</P>

      <P>The particular amendment on which we stand I do not wish to discuss at the moment.  I prefer to mention certain reasons why I think the amendment of Deputy Thrift is not altogether satisfactory.  While I agree that the definition in the Bill as it stands is not satisfactory, at the same time I think the words, in its purpose, are unnecessary and apt to lead to a confusion of thought.  It might be contended that the book is not, in its purpose, that the purpose of the author was not, so to speak, to give a certain tendency yet a book may have that unhealthy element in it.  If there were any machinery by which there might be an appeal we might agree to allow an author of a book to be represented at meetings of the Board, but it would add very greatly to the difficulty of censoring books if those words &ldquo;in its purpose&rdquo;<Col N="89" /> were included.  I think we should take the attitude which is taken by a court of law on questions of libel where it is not what the man intended to say but what the general public, the ordinary reading public, would take out of the book.  In the same manner we should use this rule in this particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, of course, with all Deputy Thrift has said.  In my definition I had the word &ldquo;manifestly.&rdquo; I think I was aiming at what he was trying to get by his words &ldquo;in its purpose.&rdquo;  I think there is a little in that point.  &ldquo;Manifestly&rdquo; will be manifestly to the censorship board.  I think that is the way in which the matter should be.  That I think is the way they should try it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not think it necessary to retain the loose wording in line 31.  I accept, of course, his explanation&mdash;he is a jurist&mdash;that it is covered and governed by the preceding words, but this Bill will be read by the public and it will give them an utterly false idea of its scope.  If these words are retained they are either tautological if they are governed by the preceding words or they have some further meaning.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept something on the lines of the amendment that has been put up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment standing in my name, with which Deputy Law is also concerned.  Our attitude is that the definition in the Bill cannot very well stand as it is.  If the five words which we seek to omit be omitted, the definition would read: &ldquo;Including calculated to suggest or incite to sexual immorality or in any other way to corrupt or deprave.&rdquo;  I take it that wording in itself would cover the point which Deputy Thrift has been making.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; would include the amendment that both Deputies Thrift and Alton have tried to include in their amendments.  It seems to me that we really want to get rid of these five words which commit the Oireachtas as a whole to a very extraordinary statement, and once these five words are got <Col N="90" /> rid of the definition is as good as we are likely to get.</P>

      <P>I think what Deputy Tierney has said would not be sufficient unless we got the words &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;deprave&rdquo; more definitely defined, so as to make it clear even to the man in the street as well as to the lawyer that the words &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;deprave&rdquo; refer to sexual matters, because that was undoubtedly the intention of the Committee.  I was a member of the Committee along with my colleague Deputy Professor Thrift, and this point came up on many occasions. It was the intention that the censorship should be confined to matters dealing with sexual immorality. The Board of Censors will not be lawyers and they might take that phrase to deal with books preaching rather peculiar political doctrines.  For instance, books dealing with Russian politics might be barred out because they tend to corrupt and deprave decent society such as we have in this State, or books dealing with or describing peculiar religious doctrines or tenets might also be ruled out.  I think it would be well if we had these words made quite clear.  In that respect I think Deputy Ruttledge's amendment would probably meet my point of view better than any of the other amendments.</P>

      <P>I think there is pretty fair agreement in the House as to what the House wishes to do.  The sole question is in what words the House will express its thoughts.  Deputy <Col N="91" /> Thrift and Deputy Alton, I think, slightly mistook what I said on the Second Reading debate.  I do not think that that question of the distinction between ex professo and obiter, which I drew distinctly and which I still stand by, is a distinction which comes into the definition of the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; at all.  A thing may be indecent ex professo; a thing may be indecent obiter, but it is indecent.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; is the same. It is when you come to deal later on with the classes of books that are to be prevented from circulating in this country that the distinction arises between what is obiter, which is &ldquo;by the way,&rdquo; and what is ex professo, which I may say roughly, is &ldquo;systematically or in substance&rdquo; indecent.  It is on Section 7 that that distinction really arises.  You should not condemn a book because it has got one little passage &ldquo;by the way&rdquo; in it which is indecent, but none the less there is a passage there and indecency has got its same meaning.  I think what was running through Deputy Alton's mind and through Deputy Thrift's mind, and also which is my own expressed opinion, will arise rather on Section 7 than in this particular definition. Deputy O'Connell and some other Deputies have said that though this may mean a certain thing to a trained interpreter of statutes it would mean possibly quite a different thing to persons who are not trained in legal interpretation.  But that is precisely what I myself said in my Second Reading speech.  I said I believed that that, as worded, carries out the intention which was in our minds when we brought in this Bill.  That was the intention, that nothing but matters of what I may style sensuality should be dealt with.  I do not think if you take out those words, &ldquo;in any other way to corrupt or deprave,&rdquo; you will have a wide enough definition.  If you put in &ldquo;corrupt or deprave in sexual matters&rdquo; I do not think it would be wide enough, because you could corrupt or deprave, I will say, in matters of sensuality which are not sexual matters, and do not relate to vice between the sexes at all.  For instance, there is that book that was censored recently, &ldquo;The Well of Loneliness.&rdquo; I <Col N="92" /> need not develop this thing further.  I have thought the thing over, and I would suggest to the House words something like these which would convey clearly to every lay man what is the real intention of the House: &ldquo;The word &lsquo;indecent&rsquo; shall be construed as including calculated to suggest or incite to sexual immorality or to unnatural vice or in any other like way to corrupt or deprave.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the House that that does not leave any loophole and at the same time it is not too wide.  I am sure Deputies Ruttledge and Lemass will agree with me that in every definition clause it is highly advisable that you should have general words, so that nothing might happen by which a little fish, so to speak, might slip out of the net.  You should have general words, words which are bound down in their meaning by the particular words in front of them, but which are there because the particular words might possibly be evaded.  When we bring in the words &ldquo;in any other like way,&rdquo; I do not think it is conceivable that anyone can make a mistake as to what the meaning is.  I would suggest to the House, since we have the same thought, and our only trouble is to express it in words, that this particular form of words would carry out the real intention of all parties.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, undoubtedly, met one point that I tried to make.  The words &ldquo;in any other like way&rdquo; are free from the objection I raised against the words as they stand.  They are not capable of being misunderstood in the general sense in which I think the definition as it stands is capable of being misunderstood. But I have another point in my definition which I do not think the Minister got over: that is the word &ldquo;calculated.&rdquo;  It is clearly ambiguous. Does it mean what I have put down in the phrase &ldquo;in its purpose&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>It is arguable.  A man takes a certain calculated course. That means a course calculated to lead <Col N="93" /> to certain consequences&mdash;calculated to produce certain effects.  One interpretation of it is that it is the author's purpose in that book to do a certain thing&mdash;to suggest or incite to sexual immorality.  The other interpretation might mean that in the opinion of the Board of Censors it is likely to do a certain thing.  If that ambiguity exists, I do not think the House ought to pass a form of words in which it knows that it exists.  If it does not exist, I am prepared to be taught.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Thrift that the Minister's revised draft is a very great improvement on its predecessor.  But I think he will want to define &ldquo;unnatural vice.&rdquo;  I suggest to him that, instead of the term &ldquo;unnatural vice,&rdquo; in order to check the kind of propaganda that we all detest and want to change, he might insert, in addition to &ldquo;sexual immorality,&rdquo;&ldquo;sexual or homo-sexual immorality.&rdquo; I think that would cover the precise kind of propaganda that the Minister wants to check.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some substance in the point made by Deputy Thrift&mdash;the use of the word &ldquo;calculated.&rdquo; Otherwise the Minister's definition seems to be a very admirable one.  I am puzzled by the word &ldquo;calculated.&rdquo; As I understand it, it means calculated in the opinion of the Board of Censors.  On the other hand, the report of the Committee on Evil Literature, I think, suggests the word &ldquo;intended.&rdquo; I should have thought it would be much easier to infer an intention in the general nature and character of the book than to infer the effect upon the readers, because in the one case you have to infer from the general nature of the acts a person's intention, and in the other you are dealing with one single thing&mdash;the intention of a man, his intention as shown by his acts, or, in this case, by his writings.  If you use the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; it seems to me, at least, that you are thrown into a very much <Col N="94" /> more difficult field, because you have to ask yourself, &ldquo;calculated to incite in whom?&rdquo;  In the youth?  In the adult?  In the person of education?  In the person of no education?  For whom are you legislating?  For the exception or the rule?  For the man or for the individual?  I should have thought that you would place a very much greater burden of difficulty upon those who have to interpret this Act by using the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; than would be placed by the use of such words as those suggested by Deputy Thrift, and I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <P>I suggest the introduction of some words that would further define the word &ldquo;calculated,&rdquo; as to whether it is calculated by the author or calculated by the Board of Censors. Because, on the lines of what I said before, we do not inquire into what the purpose of the author is or what his intention is.  It is as people read it. I think the word requires further definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done this way, by using the words &ldquo;likely to suggest or incite to sexual immorality or unnatural vice or in any other similar way.&rdquo;  That is putting &ldquo;similar&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;like,&rdquo; which is synonymous, in order to get the hang of the thing.  It must be the book itself, the book itself is the main thing, no matter what the author might consider. Deputy Law thinks that the class of persons should be defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not say that; that would be absurd.  What I suggest is that it is easier to infer the intention from the character of the book than it is to decide what the effect of that book would be upon the general public. You can infer what it would be on a particular class of people, but the question is what is the test.  Obviously what might incite to sexual immorality in a boy of eighteen might be entirely powerless to incite anything of the kind in a man.  Therefore it is much more difficult.  What is the standard of test? In whom is the incitement to take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a <Col N="95" /> matter which would arise more properly when we are dealing with the class of books to be excluded rather than with the actual meaning of the word &ldquo;indecent.&rdquo;  I think there is this confusion in Deputy Law's mind.  You are not here dealing with intention. You are dealing with books objectively. You are considering what the effect of a book is going to be.  If you prosecute a man and punish him for producing an indecent book it is only natural that what his intention was or what it was that he meant would be matters that might be considered, because that would go to show whether he had or had not criminal intent, but what the author really meant does not matter; it is his expressed purpose, it is the effect which his thought will have as expressed in the particular words into which he has flung his thought that the censors have to consider.  If there is difficulty about the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; I would be willing to substitute &ldquo;likely&rdquo; for &ldquo;calculated,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; for &ldquo;likely&rdquo; in another part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have given this matter a considerable amount of thought.  In the debate on the Second Reading, it may be remembered I said that I did not consider the difference between five and nine a matter of principle but rather that it was a matter of detail.  Since the Second Reading debate I have considered the matter carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that if you have a committee of nine&mdash;a large committee of that nature, but a committee which is supposed to be balanced between various interests in the country &mdash;you run a very grave danger indeed of making this Bill entirely worthless. If you wanted to ensure that this Bill should be a complete failure, and that it would not achieve the purpose for which it has been drafted, and the purpose which most people wish to carry out, you could not choose a more perfect way of doing it than by having a very large committee.  That is a matter with which I think everyone will agree.</P>
      <P>If you have a very large committee you will have argument and dispute, and you will have persons ranged into different camps.  When you come to a small number like nine you are met with very much the same difficulty. You will have to get nine persons who will be willing to act, of well-balanced judgment upon whose considered opinion this House and this country can rely and you must have constant attendance by these nine.  I have considered this matter carefully and I look round and I do not see where nine persons could be found who would have the necessary qualifications for persons who are going to be effective censors and who, at the same time, would be willing to take on the not inconsiderable burden of work which this Act will impose on their shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly aware that the censorship <Col N="99" /> committee which formulated the report upon which this Bill is based recommended a committee of from nine to twelve.  Because that recommendation appeared in that report we departed from that figure with very great reluctance.  But considering the difficulties which this censorship board will have to encounter and which we will have to get even five satisfactory persons to constitute this board and that if you have a larger board like nine you will have to weigh one head against another&mdash;here a Catholic, there a Protestant or a literary person&mdash;that would be very unsatisfactory.  I must frankly warn the House that in my humble opinion&mdash;and as I say I have given the matter most careful consideration&mdash;you are endangering the success of this Bill and you endanger it enormously if you increase the number from five to nine.  I ask the House really to give this matter most careful consideration because although it is only a detail I think it is a vital detail. If this Board be large, unwieldy and unworkable this Bill will fail and that would be very unfortunate indeed.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister has done more in advocating five instead of nine than to express his own opinion very strongly now.  He has not put up anything that I think would be sufficient argument to dispose of the recommendation that was made by the Committee on Evil Literature.  As a member of that Committee, I would say that this very question got very grave consideration indeed from the Committee, who considered the points now made by the Minister and who finally came to the conclusion that the membership of the Committee should be increased from nine to twelve.  If the Minister thinks five is a magical number whose opinions ought to carry more weight than a Committee of nine, I would remind him that there were just five on this Committee that recommended nine, and that, perhaps, ought to weigh with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Their recommendations <Col N="100" /> ought to weigh with the Minister when they recommended nine.  Now the Minister puts up what I think is an extraordinary argument&mdash;that is, the difficulty of getting nine suitable people to act on this Board.  But it is not a question of getting nine suitable people but four suitable people, because he must get five in any case.  It is a question that four cannot be got, four citizens of balanced judgment, four of the right kind of people to act on this Board in addition to the five.  Four just men cannot be got.  Well, I do not think there is anything in that argument. If there is any issue, it is whether a small Committee is more effective than a large one.  That is the only issue.  I cannot conceive that the finding of nine people to act on the Board would present any very great difficulty as against the possibility of finding five.  It might be argued that a Committee of nine would be a more unwieldy Committee than a Committee of five.  I think there is this point&mdash; that in the Committee of nine you would have the advantage that you would have various types of men represented on it.  You could not have that Committee&mdash;you could not be successful by confining it to a smaller number than nine.  We, the members of the Committee on Evil Literature, had that in our minds.  We were satisfied that it would be necessary to have a small Committee, for a small Committee would be more effective than a large one, but we did not think that nine would be too large a Committee.  If you confine the Committee to any lower number than nine you would not have represented on it the various outlooks on these matters that ought to be represented and properly catered for and properly represented.  I think the Minister has put up no effective argument in this matter except to express his own opinion very strongly.  I think the Minister should agree to the views given expression to on the Second Reading of this Bill and increase the membership to nine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We have considered this amendment very carefully, and after three or four meetings, and after careful discussion on the matter, we came to the conclusion that nine was the best <Col N="101" /> figure.  There were several reasons for that.  The first is that such a number would create general confidence in the Committee on the part of the general public.  The general public would then have the feeling that matters before the Censorship Board would not be decided by one or two or three people, but that the matters before it would be decided by something that approaches the attitude of mind of a jury.  If you applied the Minister's argument to a jury you would find that he would not allow trial by jury at all, because he would be afraid he could not get twelve men who could agree as to whether a person is guilty or not guilty.  I think the object of this Bill is to get after something that is obviously criminal.  The work of the members of this Committee is like the work of a jury.  We think that it is reasonable to expect judgment from twelve men in a box.  It is not unreasonable to expect judgment from nine men who would sit on this Board continuously.</P>

      <P>Well constantly.  If you have nine men on the Committee you may find that one of them may be sick and unable to attend, but one absent will not make much difference.  If you have a Committee of five the absence of one member makes a great deal of difference.  Then there is the principle of giving every section in the community an opportunity of having their views expressed on this Committee.  On the whole matter of the censorship there has been very little difference of opinion on the moral issue in the Bill between the different sections in this House.  In the House there has been general agreement.  That agreement will be reflected also if we have a Committee of nine.  You would have on that Committee a variety of opinions and of views, and you would probably have unanimity on what was, according to the common sense of the ordinary man, criminal and what was not.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Evil Literature had very many valuable qualities, but they had no experience whatsoever of censorship.  At least, I do not think that Deputy Thrift or Deputy O'Connell had, and I do not <Col N="102" /> suppose that the clergymen on the Committee had either.  Unfortunately, I have had some experience of censorship. I know the difficulties of censorship with which that Committee was never confronted.  The great difficulty is the difficulty of getting a fixed standard as to what should be allowed and what is not to be allowed, and there is the inclination to vary which exists in a larger Censorship Committee. The ideal censorship really is to have one censor, because although being human he makes mistakes, he, at any rate, makes the same mistakes all the time, and those who have to deal with him know where they are.</P>

      <P>I had very few quarrels with the Deputies opposite when I was Censor, because I tried to give them a fair deal.  The ideal Censorship is one man.  I would prefer three to five, and I would infinitely prefer five to nine, because you get there, as it were, a standardised censorship.  Deputy O'Connell knows quite well that when you are on a Committee of nine you do not feel it quite so essential to attend as if you were on a small Committee where there may not be a quorum without you.  There may be sickness.  There are a great deal more chances of sickness on a Committee of nine than on a Committee of five.  The result will be that on a Committee of nine the decisions of the Committee will vary as the personnel of the Committee present varies, and nobody will know where he is.  It also means delay.  It takes longer for nine individuals to read a book than five.  Some people read more quickly than others.  Some people have greater claims on their time than others, and you will find it hard to get nine people who are able to give the Committee the bulk of their time to read the books laid before the Censorship Committee.  Take one instance. I have no doubt that the first book to be put before the Censorship Committee will be Gibbon's &ldquo;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&rdquo; six volumes.  Those are closely-printed volumes too.</P>

In whatever language they are printed, written in Latin or Greek, they are certainly calculated to deprave.  But Professor Thrift is a scientist and not likely to be depraved, but I fear for Professor Deputy Alton.  Now, that is a book that is certain to be brought before the Censorship Board.  It is a book that is almost certain to be put before the Censorship Board.  How long will it take nine people to read those six volumes and the footnotes, and if they are unable to read the footnotes they have to get translations.  The smaller the membership of a Committee is the more effective will the Committee be.  I agree with the Minister after a somewhat similar experience that if you wish the Act to break down you should make the Board as large as you can. You will not satisfy the various conflicting interests, you will not do this by making the Committee nine.  You will have all the different Protestant denominations saying they ought to be represented.  If you are to give on this Censorship Committee proportionate representation to the Catholics and to each of the other religions you will make it a machine that will not work. I want this machine to work on reasonably sensible lines, and I believe that five is the largest possible number that will enable the Committee to do so.</P>

      <P>Personally, I do not think there is any very strong argument in this matter either way, except the one argument which, in spite of Deputy O'Connell, I think the Minister made very forcibly.  That is the practical argument.  It does not very much matter whether you have nine or five people.  What really does matter is whether you can get nine people&mdash;whether it is easier to get nine than five.  I do not think the analogy of the jury that Deputy Little put forward holds altogether in this case, because this work will differ considerably from the work that jurymen are called upon to perform.  For one thing, it <Col N="104" /> will be more permanent work, and for another thing, it will be work requiring more special qualifications than are usually expected from jurymen.  I do not at all like the suggestion made by Deputy Doyle, and also by Deputy Little, that in selecting the Board the representative principle should be adhered to.  I think this is emphatically a matter in which you should be very careful to avoid trying to represent conflicting interests.  As Deputy Cooper pointed out, it is quite impossible to do so, and a rather terrible picture is called up before the mind when you consider the thing working out in practice. If you take the census figures you will have to find room on the Board for half a Jew, for example, and probably the next step will be to provide that the findings of the Board shall be arrived at by proportional representation. I think that not only has that representative principle no force in this particular kind of case, but that it is actually a bad principle, because you do not so much want to represent interests, some of which may be peculiar and most of which will probably be quite small; what you really want to represent is the general common-sense of the community in a matter like this. I do believe that you will get that better represented in five citizens than in nine.</P>

      <P>I think, in considering this question of the Board, the House should bear in mind the views of those to whom the introduction of this Bill is due.  Anybody in touch with these people knows that they desire a larger number, if possible, than nine, but the minimum which would be acceptable to them would be nine. I agree with every word that Deputy O'Connell said.  To me it seems an unthinkable thing that in a nation like this, that claims to have some culture, nine common-sense people with the necessary qualifications could not be found to act on the Censorship <Col N="105" /> Board.  I think it is asking this House to believe too much when such a statement as that is made&mdash;that this country is only capable of producing five men fit to act on a Board of this description. I do not think that argument will bear analysis.  I think it is utterly fallacious. Deputy Tierney crystallises the whole thing, and I do not think he so meant to crystallise it.  He said that after all what is wanted is common sense.  It is common sense that makes the world, and it is common sense that will make a good Board.  If you have not good common sense on the Board it will be a failure.  Give me the man with common sense, not the literary crank or the man with the fanatical point of view. Give me the man broad-minded and fair who can look at the thing from a common-sense point of view.  If you want to come to a proper conclusion upon what is for the good of the people in a question of this kind, I unhesitatingly plump for the common-sense man.</P>
      <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy Cooper, who has had some experience of censorship.  He made the point that the difficulty is to get what he called the standardised censorship.  What is the necessity for standardised censorship? What we want is effective censorship. If we get effective censorship this Bill is going to be a success.  The question of standardised censorship does not arise; we want effective censorship. Deputy Cooper went on to say that a small Board of five will make the same mistakes again and again.  What difference does it make what the nature of the mistakes is?  What the Board is set up for is to avoid making mistakes. It does not matter if a mistake is a different one this time to what it was before; it is still a mistake.  That class of reasoning is illogical, and this House should not accept it.  Deputy Cooper says that the first book that would come before the Censorship Board will be Gibbon's &ldquo;Rise and Fall of the Roman Republic.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is really a question, as I think the Minister clearly put it, of getting an effective censorship.  I believe, with Deputy Cooper, that the larger you make the Board the greater the tendency will be to make that Board ineffective.  I admit that a large Board has certain advantages. Deputy Little says that it might give more confidence.  I think from that point of view it might be a little more spectacular.  I fear if you have a Board of nine you will not get effective censorship.  A Board of five will work more quickly.  If you have a Board practically double that size I fear the work will be choked up.  Even though there be a demand for a larger Board, if you have a larger Board it does not follow that the members of it will attain the ends they have in view. A suggestion was put up that possibly the most effective method would be one censor, as in the case of films.  I think on the merits there is a good deal to be said from that point of view.  It was not without considerable hesitation that the Executive Council came to the conclusion that on the whole in this particular case that would not work. I believe from the point of view of real effectiveness in the actual censoring of books and papers you would get better work from a Committee of three rather than a Committee of five.  I am convinced of that.  It is not a question of representing, as Deputy Little and Deputy Doyle mentioned, different interests; it is the ordinary moral common-sense of the people that you want represented.  You are putting a heavy demand on every one of the men you put on the Board.  It will be extremely difficult to get five really effective men who will be able to devote their attention to the work.  It will be difficult to get the type of men you want.  Just realise the amount of time that would <Col N="107" /> be occupied in the actual operation of this measure.  I ask Deputies seriously to consider whether they are not making the Bill to some extent unworkable by insisting on a larger Board.</P>
      <P>If I wanted to block the Bill&mdash;I am not suggesting that there is such intention in the minds of those who are moving the amendment&mdash;I could conceive no better way of doing it than by adopting this amendment.  If carried, it would render the work of the Committee slower and less effective.  There is that danger.</P>

      <P>If the people for whom Deputy Byrne speaks who are keen on this Bill want the Board to work slowly they have concealed their views very carefully.  I thought that they wanted the Board to work quickly. Of course by working slowly there will be fewer mistakes, but you will have a great deal more undesirable literature coming in before the Board can give a decision, and after twelve months you will have a very small quantity of literature actually censored. Has the Deputy visualised the amount of reading which members of the Committee will have to do?  Deputy Little has compared their work with that of jurors, but most jurors, if a trial is unduly long, are excused service for a number of years, whereas this unfortunate Board will have to sit year after year.  He said that it was analogous to a criminal case where a man is obviously a criminal and is found to be so by twelve of his fellowmen. Unanimity is not necessary in the case of these nine men.  That analogy will not work.  I am sorry in a way to see that there is what I might call a party line-up in this matter.  I understand from Deputy Little that his party is not going to leave it to individual members but, having considered it, they will vote en bloc.</P>

      <P>May I draw attention to another amendment of ours, namely, amendment No. 30?  There we supply the machinery which would render the working of a Committee of nine more rapid and effective.  You have the words &ldquo;the Minister shall cause such complaint to be examined by an officer to be appointed by him for the purpose and on the receipt of the report of that officer the Minister may, in his discretion, refer such complaint to the Board.&rdquo;  It constitutes that officer as the person to sift the book carefully.

      <P>Deputy Little, in one breath, is proposing a Board of Censorship of nine, and, in the next, one of six.  He goes further than the Minister. I think he is misled by the analogy of the film censorship, which is quite different.  There the Censor takes the responsibility of rejecting, but the lessee can appeal to the Appeal Board, and they have to see the film.  There is nothing of that sort here.  The paid Censor is supposed to read the book, but the obligation to read will rest on every one of the nine members in regard to it. I think there is a mistaken idea in regard to this, and it was at the back of my own mind at one time, which makes one rather inclined to think that people of divergent opinions must necessarily be representative, and that it is good for the Board that opinions should be divergent.  I think that that is wrong in this particular case.  We are not going to pick out extremists in every line of thought, but rather specialists in common sense.  I think it is more likely, if you get five men of that sort, to get satisfaction, and why raise the number to nine?  There is another difficulty, and that is the question of report. If you raise the number to nine you will find it hard to get a group of six to agree to a signed report.  You will find it hard to get six members to attend.  I have been on several boards, and I know how hard it is to get a quorum.  It will be difficult out of a Board of five to get a quorum of four. I hope that the Minister will leave the matter as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said, namely, that there is no question of principle involved in this amendment.  The matter is one of making the Board effective in so far as its decisions will be acceptable to the ordinary person of common sense and good character.  That is the only way <Col N="110" /> in which the Board can be effective.  If its decisions outrage common sense, or appear to err on the side of puritanism, I feel that the decisions of the Board will be rejected, more or less, by the ordinary individual, and it will not appear to be a grave crime if one can run contraband against the decisions of such a Board.  We do not wish that position to occur.  We are anxious, if a Censorship Act is in operation, that the decisions of the Board under it will be generally respected.  We do not wish to have in Ireland conditions similar to those which exist in the United States, where the prohibition laws exist.  For that reason we think that if we could get a larger Board than the Minister suggests, a Board of nine reasonable men, and if six came to a decision in regard to a book, that that decision would be generally accepted and censorship, from that point of view, would be more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the contention of the Minister that a Board of nine is going to delay the work of censorship. As the Minister has said, the five censors have to read the book.  It would take them as long to get five to read a book and come to a decision as it would in the case of nine.  They will know that their decisions are expected on the same date, and they will take the book home at the same time, so that so far as the element of time is concerned, there is no more in favour of a Board of five than one of nine.  The reference to the other amendment is, to a certain extent, misleading.  The purpose of the officer, or officers, to whom the Minister might refer a book was to deal with complaints which, on the face of them, were frivolous and unsustainable and in that way to facilitate the work of the Board.  We do not wish the two amendments to be taken together.  We suggest, if you increase the size of the Board, that the mere weight of numbers behind a decision will make it more acceptable and the censorship will be more effective.  I do not believe that there is any interest, no matter how strongly opposed to the Bill some people may be, that bases its opposition to the Bill on the ground that it wishes all sorts of pornographic literature to circulate among the people here.  I think it is the general opinion <Col N="111" /> that such literature should be banned, and one way of ensuring that is to have that weight which a decision of six reasonable men will give as compared with a Board of four reasonable men.</P>

      <P>I find myself somewhat in the position of a famous judge in this country, who is said to have given his judgments somewhat on these terms.  After his two colleagues had given contrary judgments in a very complicated case, with most elaborate reasons, he is supposed to have said: &ldquo;I agree with my brother B for the reasons given by my brother C.&rdquo;  I agree with the Minister, and I hope he will stand to his guns, chiefly for the reason presented by my colleague, Deputy Byrne.  You want on this Board, as Deputy Byrne has said, men of common sense.  You do not want representation.  I cannot conceive anything more utterly destructive of any proper censorship than if you get a Board which would resemble in many respects the old Board of Intermediate Education, in which you had to be continually balancing members to see whether you would put on a Catholic or a Protestant.  I am glad to say that there is no suggestion of that kind in this House, but I have heard it outside.  The idea in some people's mind was to obtain, if possible, a Board constituted on sectarian lines and deliberately&mdash;I say quite clearly deliberately&mdash;to obtain a permanent Catholic majority.  I am a Catholic.  I became a Catholic, but I can say that there is nothing against which I will fight more determinedly than any attempt to introduce sectarian issues in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>I confess that I find myself somewhat in a difficulty.  As regards the numbers on the Board, considered by itself, I still adhere to the opinion I gave as a member of the Committee that I think a Board of nine would be a better Board probably than a Board of five, but in voting on the question I find that I cannot isolate that by itself, because I have to consider this amendment in conjunction with amendment 38.  The Minister proposes that this Censorship Board should consist of five members, and you would <Col N="112" /> have to get four of one mind.  What the Committee wanted to secure was that any publication or book which, to the average self-respecting citizen, was sexually objectionable, should be kept out of the country.  To secure that object I would rather take four in agreement out of five ordinary self-respecting citizens than be satisfied with six out of nine.  I would feel that we were more likely to be all convinced, as a community, that we were right in keeping out a certain book if four out of five people said that it should be kept out.  I would not feel so confident if there were three out of nine who said that they did not think it should be kept out.  Therefore, if I were considering the Committee by itself, still I would adhere to the opinion I gave as a member of the Committee and vote for nine. If I had to take these two amendments together, as I think I must, I would vote for five, because the Minister is going to act on the opinion of four.</P>

      <P>I have very little further to add to what I have already said upon this.  Deputy O'Connell said that no case at all had been made for five.  I think I endeavoured to put forward views which certainly appeal to my mind.  The case for five is itself morally certain.  You can get five satisfactory men to fill this position.  It is by no means certain that you will get nine willing persons, not persons merely competent but also willing.  Deputy Byrne said he could point out immediately Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Peadar Doyle.  I wonder if Deputy Ruttledge were asked to go on this Board what his answer would be?  I should not wonder.  I know perfectly well what his answer would be.  You may regard it from this point of view. Persons who have other work to do and are busy could not possibly give the amount of time this would demand, and the further you widened your number obviously the greater your difficulties would become.  Deputy O'Connell said you have to get five, and if you get five you will get nine.  If you can get nine, then you can get a hundred and nine, and I suppose it would be his opinion that you could also get 1,000.  That is a kind of progressive <Col N="113" /> argument which I cannot follow. He also talked of types of mind. I do not know what types of mind you want on this body, but I do know that what you do want is a person who will be reasonably able to say that a particular book is likely to do harm to the morals of the community by circulation. It does not require any particular mind to come to that decision.  It requires an amount of common sense, a person who will consider each particular book, and consider it well.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputies opposite are agreed that this Bill, with a Committee of five, would be a success.  They think it would be a greater success possibly with a Committee of nine, but I do not think they consider it would be a failure or that it would have any probability of failure if there were a Committee of five.  Our position is slightly different.  We think this Bill would be a success with a Committee of five, but we think it is highly probable that this Bill will be a failure with a Committee of nine, and you are endangering the real success of this Bill by establishing your Committee of nine.  I would ask the Deputies to consider that very carefully, because this is an important measure. The probability of success or failure of a measure of this importance requires very careful consideration indeed from this House, and the fact that persons outside the House happen to think that nine would be better than twelve, I must frankly confess, does not appeal to me at all.  It is our duty in this House to do what we think is right, and I think we should not be controlled by outside opinion.  We should do what we consider in our mature judgment to be the right and proper thing to do.  Deputy Little talked about a jury, but, of course, the Minister for Education has already pointed out that there is no analogy between this case and that of a jury, because you do not have the same jury sitting the whole year round.  Supposing you had to have only a certain limited number of jurymen in Ireland, I would prefer to have five permanent jurymen than twelve.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I think the Minister's statement is an ingenious misinterpretation of what <Col N="114" /> I meant.

      <P>Certainly, there would be no difficulty about a certain class of book just as there is no difficulty about a certain class of case for a jury to decide.  But there are certain cases in which juries disagree, just as there are also certain borderline books.  Those will cause the Committee a great deal of trouble, only those.  There are certain books the Committee will have only to skim through and say &ldquo;those cannot come in.&rdquo;  Then there are books they will have to weigh up very gravely.  Those are the difficult cases in which they will have to make up their minds.  Again, Deputy MacEntee said that nine persons could read a book as quickly as five.  I suppose nine persons might read a book if they were all of the same mind and had separate copies.  Rules and regulations will have to be drawn up, but it does not follow that everybody who makes a complaint will have to send in nine copies.  If they had it would be a strong argument for reducing the number to five on the grounds of expense.</P>

      <P>It must be brought before it.  If the Deputy read the Report of the Committee he would see that the system of indicting and charging people for the sale of indecent literature has completely broken down and that a charge once a year or twice a year is practically the most that can be brought, and even then it is only against one particular seller.  It is because the Committee reported that the ordinary law had broken down that this Bill has got to be introduced.  If the Deputy reads the Report he will see that.  That is the conclusion arrived at after this Committee had examined a great number of witnesses and had gone into a vast mass of evidence.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 40, after the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not being ministers of any religious denomination.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is needless to say that in proposing this amendment there is no feeling in my mind except one of the greatest respect for ministers of every religious denomination.  In fact, I simply propose this because I think the function of ministers of religion is a much higher one than the function of this Board of Censors will be.  As indicated in the report, to secure the object which the Committee had at heart the censors will only be at best partially successful, and to secure that object in full in the best way will be largely the function of ministers of religion, by educating the youth not to wish for this sort <Col N="119" /> of thing.  What the Committee indicated in their report was, if the consensus of opinion of the ordinary self-respecting citizen was against a book, it was advisable that that book should not be admitted.  What we want to get in this connection is the opinion of the ordinary citizen.  With Deputy Law I am in entire agreement.  There is nothing even religious in this matter; certainly nothing denominational. It is the moral sense which is affected.  If we can secure that only such books are kept out as are repulsive to the ordinary self-respecting citizen, I think we shall have secured what we want.  I think we are likely to get that by establishing a Board of such citizens.  I contend there is no theological point involved, and no denominational point involved, and therefore I move that in the choice of a Board of Censors the Minister shall confine himself to ordinary citizens, and that we do not put ministers of religion on this Board of Censors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this should be left entirely to the discretion of the Minister&mdash;that it would be very invidious to make any distinction between layman and cleric.  It might just happen that some particular minister of religion might be very suited from his natural temperament for this work, or it might happen that the Minister would consider that no minister in religion would be suitable.  But I think it would create a great deal of feeling against the Board if an invidious distinction is made between one kind of citizen and another in this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift's opinion justly carries so much weight, and I find myself throughout this Bill so constantly in general and cordial agreement with him, that I must, on this occasion, express definitely why I cannot vote for this amendment.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Little said.  I said on Second Reading that in answer to a friend of mine who expressed fear of what might be done by the Bishops, I remarked that I was afraid, not of Bishops, but of busybodies. I am certain that a minister of religion would not take any less wide and sensible view on these matters than <Col N="120" /> a layman.  On the other hand, I am much more afraid in this connection of the fanatic, and want to avoid him. I see no reason whatever to assume that a man is disqualified from acting as a member of the Board of Censors by the fact that he is in Holy Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  My chief reason for voting for the last amendment was because I believed that if the Minister's section was carried as it appeared on the paper, we might have an undue proportion of representatives of the Churches upon it.  The proportion might possibly be two to three.  As the last amendment was carried, we will have a Board of nine.  I therefore see no valid reason why any disabilities should be placed on any representatives of religious denominations.  I am further strengthened in that belief by the report of the Committee on Evil Literature.  As the House is aware, the recommendations of that Committee were signed by the mover of this amendment, Deputy Thrift.  Amongst the recommendations of that Committee, on page 18 of the report, is No. 3&mdash;that a Board or Committee consisting of from nine to twelve persons representative of the religious, educational, literary and artistic interests of the Saorstát should be constituted. That is one of the recommendations of the Committee, and no valid reason has been put forward to show why this disability should be placed on the members of religious denominations.  I would be sorry indeed if sectarianism should be introduced into this Board, but I take it that the representatives of these religious institutions who may be placed on the Board will be people of discernment.  In any case, they cannot do very much harm on a Board of nine, and for that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot support this amendment.  I think a knowledge of theology should be no barrier to representation on this Board.  I do not like the unskilled theologian, and for that reason I would be very glad to see responsible men with a knowledge of theology on the Board.  The unskilled theologian, like an unskilled person of any kind, is generally a bit of a nuisance. <Col N="121" /> For that reason, I think that the fewer of them we have on the Board the better.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment, nor can I agree with the argument put forward against it by Deputy Anthony.  I cannot see any reason why a person who has taken Holy Orders in any Church, whether a Catholic priest, a Protestant clergyman or a Presbyterian or Methodist minister, by taking Orders, has ceased to be a common sense man. I cannot follow that argument.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why because a man is in Orders, because he is a priest, his common sense has flown away.  If his common sense has not flown away, why is he not eligible to be appointed on this Committee?  We had it expressed in the last debate in every quarter of the House that what you want on this Board is men of common sense.  You ask us now to hold that clergymen of all denominations do not contain amongst them even one man of common sense.  Is not that what the amendment really comes to?  That is how it presents itself to my mind, and it is not an argument that I can accept. I do not say necessarily this Board will have clergymen of any denomination upon it.  I do not see that that necessarily follows, but I say to exclude clergymen of any religious denomination would be absurd.</P>

      <P>The arguments which I tried to put forward when moving this amendment were obviously misunderstood, so that I must ask permission to make two or three remarks in reply.  I have no intention of pressing the amendment, because it is quite clear also that it is against the feeling of the House.  But every speaker completely misunderstood what I tried to say. Deputy Little completely begged the whole question by calling it an invidious distinction, which was exactly contrary to what I expressed&mdash;namely, that I reserved for the Ministers the higher functions of educating youth so that they would not wish for what this Board of Censors was to try to keep from them.  The Minister for Justice thought that I argued that persons in Holy Orders were unfit for this office. I tried to convey quite the opposite, <Col N="122" /> not that they were unfit for this office but that we would get better results by using those who might be much less fit. Deputy Hennessy objected to unskilled theologians.  The whole purport of my argument was to show that theology did not enter into this question, and neither does it.  It is moral sense, and not theology at all.  My arguments were misunderstood, but clearly the House does not want this amendment, and therefore I ask leave to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 13 on behalf of Deputy Ruttledge:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2), line 41, the words: &ldquo;of whom at least two shall be women.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it would have a very salutary effect on the Committee to have a variety of views, and as this is a matter upon which we want the fullest possible viewpoint I think it would be well to have two women on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this amendment for the same reason that I objected to amendment No. 11.  It is based upon a notion which I think in itself is antiquated at present.  If you have a section of this Bill drafted providing that at least two of the members of the Committee shall be women why not have another section providing that two of the Committee shall be men.  This whole notion that you can never establish a Committee without ensuring that a certain proportion of its members should be women belongs to the 1890's, and ought in my opinion to be abandoned at the present day. The Minister, naturally, if he finds there are certain aspects of the work of the Committee which women are better able to judge than men will in the normal course appoint women to that body, but it would be altogether wrong to tie his hands in that respect just as it would be wrong to tie his hands negatively as amendment 12 tried to do.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment either.  I completely agree with what Deputy Tierney has said that this is a matter in which men and women must be weighed on their respective merits. <Col N="123" /> What, in effect, this amendment does is to confine the women membership to two.  But to confine the women to two would be possibly quite wrong.  Now that the House has elected to have a Board of nine it would mean seven men to two women.  It might be advisable, because women have sometimes more leisure than men, to have three. You should decide these things not upon very antiquated lines, as Deputy Tierney pointed out, but leave it so that the best persons will be selected for the position, whether men or women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an idea in the House that a great many matters in connection with this Bill should be left to the Minister.  If there are genuine objections to the proposal of putting at least two women on the Board let us hear them, but let us not take up the attitude that the House is not capable of deciding for itself who should be put on the Board and why women should be excluded.</P>
      <P>There is no use saying that by putting this motion down we are simply presupposing that the members of the House are living in the Victorian era. Women have as much to do with reading and writing as men have.  If it is the intention of the Minister and if, as Deputy Tierney believes, the Minister would give in any case consideration to this matter, what is the objection to having the clause in?  The clause specifies that there should be two ladies.  It is only right that the women of Ireland should have a place on this Board, and why should they not get representation as well as the different religious bodies?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (7), page 3, line 10, after the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for cause shown.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will accept this.  I hope he will.  As the section stands, it seems to me that it gives the Minister more power than we should hand over to the Minister.  As it stands the Minister may remove from membership anyone who becomes, in his opinion, unfit to be a member of the Board.  He can act on that and remove him without any statement at all as to why he does that.  I know it is not likely that the present Minister will do that.  It would not happen in the case of the present Minister, but <Col N="125" /> it is possible that a Minister in the future would remove from the Board a person who had given an opinion on a certain matter in opposition to the views of the Minister.  The Minister may remove such a person and say he is unfit to be a member.  I suggest if the Minister is given power to do that he should do it &ldquo;for cause shown&rdquo; or words to that effect could be inserted in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Thrift that he would reconsider this matter &ldquo;for cause shown.&rdquo;  Who is to show cause?  Someone has to show cause.  Who is that person who is to show cause?  Surely the Minister himself.  It is rather meaningless to say that the Minister must show cause to himself.  That is how it appears to me.  I cannot see who is to be the prosecutor, who is to be the person who will show cause to the Minister. Now consider another aspect of it.  The Minister may remove from office &ldquo;for cause shown&rdquo; any member of the Board who is absent otherwise than on account of illness from four consecutive meetings of the Board.  That is not within the Minister's discretion at all; &ldquo;or becomes unfit to be a member of the Board.&rdquo;  In the first place, nobody would be removed from the Board unless that person had shown himself, in the judgment of the Minister, to be a crank, somebody that the others cannot pull with, somebody who is preventing the machinery from working. Whom is the Minister to show cause to?  To himself?  I do not quite follow exactly how this is to be done.  Is the Minister to put in a public minute and circulate it: &ldquo;I consider so-and-so to be a crank and so I will not keep him on the Board?&rdquo;  I do not think that would be a very nice thing.  It would be a rather difficult position.  I do not see how it could be done.  You must always recollect that if a person goes on this Board and has to be removed, it might be unfair to him that the Minister might have to go through the task of publishing in a newspaper <Col N="126" /> what is his personal opinion of a particular individual whom he has asked to act as a censor.  I do not think it would be fair to the person who would be removed.  As far as giving too much power to the Minister is concerned, you must remember this&mdash;and I am very strong upon that point&mdash;the Censorship Board will not be independent of the Dáil.  The Censorship Board, if established, will be under the control of the Dáil, because the Minister will be under the control of the Dáil, and he will have the last word in the censorship. It is keeping Parliamentary control over the Board and not setting up an independent corporation, independent of this House, independent of anything that this House could do. Where avoidable I think that is not a good thing.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the case he cited would not arise and it is no answer to my contention.  The Minister would not in practice attempt to remove a member from the Board.  This proposal of mine is put in to meet certain special cases that might arise.  In the case the Minister cited, the member of the Board would, no doubt, be entitled to some reason for his removal.  I am not wedded by any means to these words in my amendment and the Minister could choose words a great deal better than I can.</P>
      <P>What I want done in this case is that when any such public act takes place it should be accompanied by a public statement giving the reasons justifying the act.  I do not think we ought to have in legislation of this kind sections which give autocratic power to the Minister.  If his action in removing a member of the Board should be questioned in the Dáil, a Minister might easily reply that he acted merely in accordance with the section in the Act which allowed him to remove a member of the Board if he thought he was unfit to be a member.  The Minister need not go beyond that.  If we are to give powers of this kind, I think we ought to qualify them in such a way that the Minister shall be obliged to state his reasons for any particular action.  The Minister can frame the amendment in his own words; he can be advised as to the proper words he should use.  What I want is a public statement giving the reasons why a particular course, which, no doubt, the present Minister would be reluctant to take but which another Minister might consider it advisable to take, was adopted in regard to a member of the Board who might be removed from membership because of his unfitness, in the Minister's opinion, to be a member.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Thrift is making his point purely as a matter of principle.  He stresses this power that is given to the Minister to remove a member.  We give the Minister without question power to put men <Col N="128" /> on the Board.  If we can trust his judgment in putting on suitable men, surely we can trust his judgment in taking an unsuitable man off?  If we have no way out in the case of appointing members of the Board except to leave it to the discretion of the Minister, then I think we may trust his discretion if he thinks it advisable to remove a member.  I can quite see the difficulties he will be up against if he had to show cause such as in the cases Deputy Thrift cited.  I think the net result, if this proposal were agreed to, would be that he would hesitate to remove the man who should be removed simply because he did not want to show cause.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift wants the Minister to publish reasons for the removal of a member of the Board.  I think that would be very unfair to the person who was being removed in a great many cases. There is existing at the moment power in the Executive Council to remove a person from office if that person has misconducted himself in office.  You may say that so-and-so has been dismissed from the Civil Service, but if the Executive Council had to publish that so-and-so was dismissed from the service for particular reasons, setting out what they were, it would do that man an infinity of harm, and would prevent him, perhaps, from getting any other chance of employment.  I think it might very well be the same way in connection with the removal of a member of the Board.  If a member of the Board were removed and reasons had to be published, it might do him a great deal of harm, and I do not think it would be fair to him.</P>

Suppose six of the nine members&mdash;if that number is to constitute a quorum, and they cannot act without six&mdash;do not turn up once a month, what happens?  It appears to me that if they do not meet, then the whole Board is dissolved.  We will then have to go round the world looking for <Col N="130" /> the second best nine, and so on.

      <P>You may have the Board meeting once per calendar month and adjourning whatever work is under consideration from one meeting to another&mdash;that is just as likely to happen as what Deputy Doyle suggests.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, I wish to call the attention of the House to a matter which has come under the notice of everybody and the details of which you are all familiar with.  I refer to the case of the arrest and imprisonment of a member of this assembly, Deputy Eamon de Valera, who was arrested on the 5th of this month and sentenced to a month's imprisonment on the 8th.  The reason for his arrest is because he attempted to cross what is known as the Boundary, and to go to Belfast at the urgent request of a number of friends, some political friends, perhaps, but I believe that the number included many who were not his political friends, who invited him as a representative Irishman who had taken a prominent part in the Irish-Ireland movement, as they invited others on successive nights, to open a bazaar organised to provide funds for the furtherance of the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association in Belfast and probably in the Six-County area generally.  Deputy de Valera's mission to the North was, therefore, a peaceful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows what the Gaelic League is and what it stands for and it is remarkable that while Deputy de <Col N="132" /> Valera was arrested and imprisoned for attempting to go there and open the bazaar no disorder resulted that brought anybody else into the hands of the law.  Therefore, it is not taken that the purpose for which he went there was associated in any way with purposes of disorder or illegality.  He was arrested and we believe that this interference with the personal liberty of a citizen&mdash;and in this case I think we can claim a distinguished, important and representative citizen of the Free State&mdash;was caused because he attempted to pass into another part of Ireland.  I think the whole country expected that there would arise from those in charge of the Government of the Free State, the Twenty-Six County area, and that there would be sent out a ringing challenge to those who dared to interfere with the rights of citizenship of a distinguished citizen of this State.</P>

      <P>We heard a good deal in the last few years about the rights and liberties achieved for the citizens of this Twenty-Six County area.  Where are they now, these rights and liberties personally guaranteed in your Treaty and your Constitution for every citizen, every peaceful citizen if you like?  The sovereignty of this State, so often emphasised in the Press and on the platform and in every place it could be spoken of&mdash;where is your boasted sovereignty at this moment?  A citizen on a peaceful mission passing into one part of Ireland is held up, put into jail, flung there and left there because he dared&mdash; I say again on a peaceful mission&mdash;to pass the Boundary and go into what is known as the Six-County area.  That is all very well.  He was arrested and imprisoned, but what action was taken? What notice was taken of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I happened to be, as I am not likely to be, the head of a State that boasts, mind you, of its close connection with the British Commonwealth of Nations, in which all men are free men, <i>mar eadh,</i> and if a distinguished or other citizen were arrested and flung into jail, I would make the welkin ring if such an insult were offered to the State of which I was head, a State associated with what most of you are <Col N="133" /> proud to boast as being part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, where all men are free and personal liberty is not denied to any peaceful law-abiding citizen.  I am not the head of such a State, and therefore it is not for me to say more, but I think that those even who do accept that State, those who have supported and backed that State with all their might, have expected, and do expect, that the head of that State and the Executive Council would make themselves felt and heard, would do something definite and make it known that citizenship of this Free State of yours was something to be valued.</P>
    <P>It is dragged in the mire, it is walked on and spat upon.  What have you got? What protest is made?  What attempt is made to defend your citizenship?  A crawling, creeping, begging letter or a telephone message to the head of a subordinate State of the British Empire in which we are supposed to be equal partners with all the Dominions!  Here is a subordinate entity in that Commonwealth of Nations you boast so much about, and you crawl to the head of that subordinate institution and you say to him: &ldquo;Please, sir, will you, by an act of grace, release this citizen of ours?&rdquo;  Things have come to a nice pass.  You have something to be proud of with your crawling letters, your begging letters.  Down on your knees!  We ought not to be surprised.  They went on their knees often enough to England before, and will, I suppose, again.  We are not associated any more than we can help, thanks be to god, with your crawling citizenship, your crawling messages.  We do not, any more than we have to do, accept your citizenship in the Free State or your association with the British Commonwealth of Nations, but it is up to you who do, if you have any manhood left, if it has not all oozed out by now in your association with the British Commonwealth, as it must have, in the last six or seven years, adulterated as it has been &mdash;it is up to you to stand up for your own citizens' rights.  It is up to you to see that any citizen going into any part of the Thirty-Two counties on a peaceful mission has his rights and liberties guaranteed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> It came certainly as a shock, a great shock, to many in this country to find that Partition was so engendered in the minds of those in control of this State that they could bring themselves to do nothing more.  They recognised it to such an extent, that they acceded to it, accepted it, and agreed to it, mentally, morally, physically, and in every direction they could.  They could bring themselves to do no more than crawl in order to uphold the dignity of this State, about which they boast so much, and whose liberty and sovereignty, if you please, are such cherished objects with them.  We did not expect a great lot from them, I need not tell you, for the reasons I have just given, but your own citizens, those who back you, did.  Read the Press.  I have, even since I came into the House, been told by more than one of your own backers that they were ashamed, that they expected more of you, and they said to me, &ldquo;Do not be afraid to tell them so.&rdquo;  You have fallen, fallen very low.  Could anyone imagine even those whose names you, as Free Staters, honour and cherish, Griffith and Collins, accepting that position.  I must say I could not, though I disagreed as much as any being in Ireland, with certain actions of theirs.  I think there was manhood enough in them to prevent anything of that kind.  Is that what the Black and Tan war was fought for?  Is that what honest men in Ireland of all shades of opinion, died for?  I will not mention in this assembly&mdash;it would be a desecration to mention them&mdash;Terence McSwiney, Liam Mellowes, Cathal Brugha or Erskine Childers&mdash;but any of these men, whether they died before or after this Treaty of yours which brought into existence the Free State, I believe I am right in saying, would be ashamed, and they would have every right to be.</P>
    <P>There is one other division, I think, that we can see, a very marked division, now arising, out of this action towards one citizen.  I do not think I am exaggerating in saying that it is a line-up of those who stand for Ireland against those who stand for Belfast, your own Free State, and England all combined. There is the division, the old division, <Col N="135" /> All that have any manhood in Ireland, whether they stood for the Free State before or not, repudiate your puny, crawling message.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to. The hands of the Executive Council are tied.  The Executive Council themselves have too many political prisoners in jail for what, if they are anything at all, are very shadowy political offences. There is no necessity why at this moment they should show such an example to the Northern Government. They have set the example, and they left themselves open to a proper retort. Of course, probably, that is one of the sources of their weakness.  There is just one other matter.  It came as a source of astonishment to me when I read in the newspapers a statement, probably official or semi-official, which intimated that on a previous occasion when Mr. de Valera entered the Six-County area he did so by leave of the Northern Ministry.  I repudiate that with all the emphasis with which I can utter these words.  Neither Mr. de Valera nor any member of this Party would ever dream of asking the Six-County Government, directly or indirectly, through the Free State or otherwise, for any leave to go into any <Col N="136" /> part of the thirty-two counties.  This is our country, and we claim the right to go where we please.  We will act on that right as we have done before. There is no crawling about us anyhow, and if we incur censure or imprisonment by going as freemen through any part of our own land we will do so, and we will not go on our &ldquo;benders&rdquo; to Lord Craigavon, Mr. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council, or anybody else, to beg for release from any sacrifice or sufferings that may be imposed on us.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the Chief whip of the Fianna Fáil Party gave the names of some of our Party who intended to go to Armagh for the funeral of the late Cardinal O'Donnell.  He may have done that.  He may have been asked, as I understand he was asked in the Lobby one day, who of our party would probably attend.  He did not know very definitely, but he gave some names.  He never knew, and was never told, that any use was going to be made of those names that were given.  Whatever names were given, to say they were given to secure for Mr. de Valera or anybody else permission to enter any part of Ireland, I repudiate with the fullest emphasis, and demand any person who makes that statement to prove it&mdash;that Mr. de Valera, or anyone acting on his behalf, at any period asked permission directly or indirectly to go into the Six Counties or anywhere else in Ireland he felt he ought to go, as an Irishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have probably said enough, but I feel, and we, on this side, feel this very strongly, and we know there are others besides the Fianna Fáil Party who feel it strongly.  We know definitely from the members of the Labour Party that they feel it strongly, as a denial of the rights of citizenship, and as a curtailment of the liberty of the subject which every citizen should protest against. We know already, I do not want to emphasise it at greater length, that very many of those most publicly associated with the Free State, since its inception, back us in this protest, and would like to see a vigorous protest.  I think many public bodies have spoken, and many have not been heard that will probably be heard on this question. Many would have expected that very <Col N="137" /> definite action would be taken, not alone by the Executive Council, but by this assembly, when it met to-day, to put on record the strong feelings that are evident everywhere, in every corner of the country, by a protest, by resentment against the treatment offered to one of the most distinguished members of this House, and one of Ireland's most distinguished sons.  Nothing has been done beyond the crawl.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question as to what had been done, President Cosgrave told us to-day that the Executive Council cannot interfere with the administration of the law in Northern Ireland, and accordingly the only course open to the Executive Council was to make representations to the Northern Government that in the special circumstances of the case Deputy de Valera might be released. Such representations were made with the results known.  The President was even so much ashamed of his own begging letter and the answer he got that he would not put it down in the paper; he would not tell us the answer he got, or what the results were.  He said, &ldquo;Go and read the newspapers.&rdquo; I hope he and his colleagues have been reading the newspapers.  Even the Press most hostile to the aspirations and ideals we stand for, to the aspirations Deputy de Valera stood for and stands for, practically all of it joined in a protest, and I am sure these protests have been read.  They should make known to the President and members of the Executive Council how small and mean they look in the eyes of every freedom lover, every citizen who stands against partition, who stands for Ireland one and undivided, who stands for the liberty of Ireland and the personal liberty of the subject.  They look small and mean in the eyes of these people to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this matter from a somewhat different angle from Deputy O'Kelly.  Might I say at the beginning that I do not think it adds to the cause in which he, and I, too, are interested to belittle this assembly in any way, or the institutions under which we are working.  Whether I would prefer to have another form of government or not is a matter outside the issue at the moment.  I take things <Col N="138" /> as I find them, and I find that a distinguished member of this assembly goes into a neighbouring country, or into a portion under the administration of one of the members of the Commonwealth of which we are members and co-equals.  That is the position.  We are supposed, under the Constitution, to have common citizenship.  The issue raised here is the right of a citizen, the right of one member of the Commonwealth to exclude a citizen of another member of the Commonwealth, a peaceful citizen, a man who, as Deputy O'Kelly said, goes there on a peaceful mission.  I think that it is not with the Northern Government that this matter should have been taken up at all.  That is the reason I asked to-day, when this question was under discussion, whether the President had made representations to the British Government.  The Northern Government is a subordinate Government; it does not settle, as I understand, questions of citizenship or has no rights in that matter.  Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a member of the British Commonwealth co-equal with the Free State.  The Free State is co-equal with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It was to the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that representations should have been made, in my opinion, at any rate, and no representations were made.  I think that not only the action that has been taken, but the existence of the Order itself, the very existence of the Order, is a matter that should long ago have been taken up with the British Government.  I believe that the existence of that Order, in view especially of the events of the last two or three years, the putting up of such a barrier against a citizen of this State very nearly amounts to an unfriendly act on the part of the Government, and as such should have been resented by the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an instance a few months ago of a foreign Government detaining citizens of another country for some time.  The point was made then that a country has the right to detain aliens or prevent aliens entering its territory, but if there is anything in this common citizenship that is mentioned in the Oath which all members of this House <Col N="139" /> have taken, then surely this is not a parallel case.  Deputy de Valera is a common citizen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as he is a common citizen of this State.  Is he or is he not? If he is a citizen of the Irish Free State he is a common citizen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the other co-equal member of the Commonwealth. I agree with Deputy O'Kelly that the Executive Council did not take the action they should have taken in regard to the arrest and detention of a member of this House.</P>
    <P>I have here before me a document which was signed in 1925.  It was signed by representatives of the British Government, by representatives of the Free State, and by representatives of Northern Ireland too.  Reference is made to the progress of events and the improved relations now subsisting between these Governments.  They signed certain articles of agreement so as to avoid any causes of friction which might mar or retard the further growth of friendly relations between the said Governments and peoples. This Order against a citizen, and not alone one citizen but other citizens of this State, is still in existence, even after this document has been signed and our Executive Council, as far as I know, have made no protest against that barrier to the free movements of citizens of this State.  I believe that the Government have been neglectful in protecting the interests of its citizens, in protecting, especially, and standing for the international courtesies that should exist between supposedly friendly States.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as far as I am concerned, I would have much preferred if the Government took no action whatever rather than the action they did take. I agree very largely indeed with Deputy O'Kelly that the action they did take was rather worse than if they had simply ignored the matter altogether. I think they took the wrong action.  I think a protest should have been made and the country I believe looked to them to make the protest, because we must recognise this: Not alone is Deputy de Valera a citizen of this State, he is a distinguished citizen and it <Col N="140" /> was only through the accident of five or six votes that he does not occupy the position of our President.  And if that were so would the people of this country still sit quietly under an insult of the kind offered to the President of this State, if this Parliament met, with the President of the State in gaol, as it very well might be?  I say again I believe it is not with Northern Ireland, but with the British Ministry, because Northern Ireland in this matter is a purely subordinate Government, that this matter should be taken up by the Government and a proper protest made in the name of the people against the arrest, imprisonment and the barrier put on the movements of a free citizen of this State.</P>

      <P>I would just like to clear up one or two things.  Two Deputies who have spoken referred to the British Commonwealth of Nations, citizenship, co-equality and so on.  Long ago, I was ridiculed in the papers, for talking of the implementation of co-equality, and afterwards that question came up rather considerably.  What is co-equality? I presume it is just one being in the same position as the other. I would never, in any circumstances, when I was dealing with the British Government, agree that they had the right to say that any citizen of theirs had the right to come here if this Government decided that they did not want them here.  The idea of the Opposition, and apparently of Deputy O'Connell, is that there is a common Government of the British Commonwealth. There is no such thing.  If any Canadian, Briton, South African or any other citizen wants to come into this State they come here only in so far as we allow them to come.  That is a right that we must maintain all the time.  It may happen at some later time that a Government will come in here that may be anti-Semitic, and if the people voted for that Government as an anti-Semitic Government, that Government would have a perfect right to say we do not want Semites coming into this country.</P>

      <P>I want it to be clearly understood that membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations does not convey that any other member of the Commonwealth has the right to dictate to us as to what should be done here.  A Government exists primarily for the maintenance of social order.  It is a regrettable fact, if you like, that this Government here is not the Government in charge of and responsible for social order in Northern Ireland.  Deputy O'Connell said that the Northern Government in this matter is a purely subordinate Government. I do not think he is right.  The Government of Northern Ireland is a subordinate Government in as much as many matters relating to Northern Ireland are excluded from their supervision, but social order in Northern Ireland is within the province of the Government of Northern Ireland. They, being responsible for social order, in their wisdom or in their folly, may decide that social order may require a certain thing to be done. They have the power to put that in operation.  Have they the right?  We are not the Government of Northern Ireland.  It is a regrettable fact, but it must be admitted.  No other Government but the Government of Northern Ireland is responsible for social order in Northern Ireland.  That Government passed an Act.  You may say that such a Government should not exist, but if the Government is responsible for social order, it must be within its province to take such precautions as it thinks in its wisdom or in its folly, are necessary for the maintenance of social order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where I am departing from the truth.  I am stating that a Government's primary duty is the maintenance of social order.  It may be untrue, but if it is, a great many Catholic theologians have maintained it.  I have stated that the only Government in whom that responsibility exists, so far as the Six Counties are concerned, is the Government of Northern Ireland.  We may regret it, but it is a fact.  As far as this State is concerned, we insist upon the right existing in every State to exclude any outsider we do not want in it, and we will do that either by name or any other way.  If we suspect that a man is coming in here for a purpose detrimental to the State, we not only have the right, but we have the duty to citizens to exclude him. We may be misinformed; our judgment may be wrong; but once we consider that any individual should not be allowed into this State, if that is our honest judgment, we are bound to put it into operation, in our trustee position for the people of the State. We may be wise, or we may be foolish. The Northern Government may be wise, or they may be foolish.  But they have the responsibility and the power and they are the people to whom any representation should be made and not the British Government, because <Col N="145" /> the matter of social order is not a reserved service as far as Northern Ireland is concerned.  In that they have the responsibility and they have the power and they are the people responsible. I will not admit that all this talk about the common citizenship of the British Commonwealth of Nations is going to give any other Government the right to dictate to us whom we shall or shall not, or will or will not ask here.  Once I assert that for us, it is co-equality, it is not suzerainty, that we claim for the other members.  If we claim that for ourselves, we have to recognise it for other people.  If anybody says it is an unfriendly act for any Government to exclude one of our citizens, I can only say that it is happening every day in every country that demands visas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  If he wants to go to the United States, he has to get the permission beforehand of the United States Government, and he has to pay for that permission.  In the case of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, for the convenience of our citizens we have agreed not to have passports in operation for the time being.  The Northern Irish Government exists; we cannot help it. All this argument seems to me to come from a denial of their right to exist. As there is no other Government there, that Government has a right to function there.  There is no other Government for that place to look after the social order there.  They made an Order, as was within their power, if not within their right.  Certainly you must admit that it was within their power&mdash; that they had the power to do it.  There is talk of insult here.  If the Government of France or America, or any other country makes a regulation that an individual shall not be allowed in there&mdash;if the Government of the United States say that they will not have me in the United States, where is the insult? If I attempt to go there in spite of them, it is a denial of the right of the United States to make laws for the good government of the United States. Is that an insult to the United States Government or is it not?  I say that <Col N="146" /> would be an insult to the United States Government, and an insult they would have every right to object to, and to put their objection into solid form.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell said that clearly, perfectly clearly, and if we claim that right for ourselves we must recognise it for other people.  But the question as to whether there ought to be a Northern Government does not enter into this.  There is a body of men responsible for social order in the Six Counties, and if they have that responsibility they must be recognised to have the power over everything which is not against the moral law.  There is no use trying to get beyond that.  It was suggested that we were not a sovereign State because we cannot dictate to other Governments.  I have not the imperial ambitions of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not aspire that this Government should have the right to dictate to other Governments.  It must be recognised that all this talk about the perfect rights of the citizens of this State to enter into other territory outside the control of this Government does not exist.  It demonstrably does not exist in the case of the United States <Col N="148" /> or in Jugo-Slavia, or in any other country which insists upon only allowing people to enter these countries who pay for and receive visas from these Governments. This Government has that right as other Governments have, and we are prepared to exercise it the same as other Governments.  We are not prepared to allow people into this country if their presence is detrimental to the existence of the State.  The people of this country have the right to elect the Government of the country on a prejudice against any one type of person.  They have a perfect right to do that.  There are Governments more or less anti-Semitic, and if the people elect an anti-Semitic Government, that Government would be elected for the purpose of keeping out Semities.</P>

      <P>I only regret that I have not been previously assured of the protection of Deputy Flinn.  I just wanted to get these things clear.  There has been so much cross-talk and so many misleading things said that it seemed to me we were arrogating to ourselves a power that no Government can claim, or that we were recognising in other Governments a right here that I personally would not be prepared to recognise.  It is unfortunate that a man knowing that there is an Exclusion Order against him in territory not controlled by this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is part of Ireland but is outside this State, with a definite body of men responsible for social order in it, and consequently with all the powers necessary for the maintenance of social order; whether they are wise or unwise is a different matter.  I want to make that clear, because it seems to me that Deputy O'Connell and Deputy <Col N="150" /> O'Kelly did not realise that they are attempting to refuse to other Governments what this Government would allow no one to refuse to us.  That is the position.  The only insult I can see is the very clearly implied denial of the right of people responsible for social order in the Six Counties to make regulations for the maintenance of that social order.  It was not a member of our Government, fortunately, or an important person that went up there.  I can see there an insult, but I cannot see that anyone can claim that we have been insulted to the point of almost declaring war because they merely said, whether wisely or foolishly, they would decide what was good or bad for social order there, and whom they would not allow in or what was good or bad for social order in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter of the arrest of Deputy de Valera, and the action taken by the Government in relation to it, I find I am in a position of particular difficulty. The difficulty I am in is that I can see quite clearly one very good reason why the Executive Council could not have taken any action other than the action they did take in relation to it.  Deputy de Valera was not arrested by the authorities in Belfast because he is of bad character.  He was not even arrested primarily because he disobeyed the Exclusion Order and travelled to the country for which he was the elected representative.  He was arrested primarily because he was an Irish Republican and because he stood for the termination of Partition and the establishment of a Republican Government in this country.  The difficulty which I see now and which the Executive Council, no doubt, saw very clearly if and when they considered this matter, is that they themselves have done precisely the same thing as the authorities in Belfast have done.  They have arrested Northern Deputies because these Deputies stood for the termination of Partition and the establishment of a Republican Government in this country.  It was quite obvious that they could not consistently object to Lord Craigavon doing the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> We have had from the Minister for Defence another explanation of our co-equality. We know all about our co-equality. We know that it means in reality a combination of the Governments now existing in these islands to suppress any attempt by the Irish people to achieve their national aspirations. That is what is meant by co-equality, and it is because there is a community of interest between this Executive Council and Lord Craigavon and his colleagues that no effective action was taken when a Deputy of this House was arrested.  I do think, however, that the Executive Council should have recognised the logic of the situation, and knowing that they could have taken no effective action that would not be altogether inconsistent with their own past, they should have done nothing.  They could at least have spared Deputy de Valera the added insult of asking Lord Craigavon to release him as an act of grace.  I think the action of the Free State Government was more galling to Deputy de Valera than the action of the Northern Government, for it is not the first time that Deputy de Valera has been imprisoned.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time that those actively working for the Republican movement have been imprisoned, and they possibly will be imprisoned again. They have come to look upon going to prison as part of their normal duties as Republicans.  but we do ask that when circumstances result in another demonstration of the foundation on which the rule of the Governments now existing in Ireland rests&mdash;the foundations of brute force&mdash;when another demonstration of that fact is given that we should at least be spared from such an ignominy and such action as that taken by the Executive Council in relation to Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>A number of people who heard that this matter was likely to be raised in the Dáil, not seeing for themselves quite clearly why the Executive Council could do nothing, and being at the same time dissatisfied with the action which they took, have asked us to state, and have themselves expressed opinions as to, what the Executive Government could do.  I would like to ask <Col N="152" /> some Minister opposite to tell us what, in his opinion, the British Government would have done if the Civic Guards had arrested Lord Lascelles when he came here a few weeks ago to visit his estate down in the West of Ireland, from which his ancestors drove the original Irish owners by fire and sword. Deputy de Valera had much more right in Down than Lord Lascelles had in Galway.  Does anyone think that the British Government would have shown the same slavish acquiescence if he had been arrested by the Free State Government as the Free State displayed towards the arrest of Deputy de Valera?  When the news of Deputy de Valera's arrest was heard in every part of the country there arose a storm of protest from all the people.  The Executive Council was then given an opportunity, which they are not likely to get again, of uniting the people of this part of Ireland in taking effective action, by the utilisation of that incident, to re-open the question of the partition of this country and to keep it open until some more effective solution of that question had been found.</P>
    <P>The arrest of Deputy de Valera has done one very useful thing.  It has demonstrated the futility of the policy which we have heard expounded from time to time from Cumann na nGaedheal platforms with reference to the possibility of ending partition.  We have had Mr. David Barry, O.B.E., and the Minister for Finance and other people telling us what we should do is to concentrate upon the establishment of better trade relations between North and South.  They will not recognise that those who are now in control of affairs in the North do not regard themselves as Irishmen, but regard themselves as, and, in fact, are a British garrison holding a new Gibraltar for Imperialism.  These people have no illusion as to what their position is.  It is only here in the South and amongst people who should know better that illusions exist.  You had an example not long ago of that.  Lord Craigavon, speaking in Derry, told the people of the Six Counties that they were to buy Ulster goods first, and if they could not get Ulster goods then they were to buy British goods.  There was no suggestion <Col N="153" /> that the people of that area should buy goods from the Free State.  I do not suggest that we should adopt a similar policy.  I would prefer to buy goods manufactured in the Six Counties to buying British goods.  But we should make it clear to these people that if they want to live on friendly terms with the Irish people and to carry on with the Irish people a trade profitable to themselves, they must first recognise that they are Irishmen, and take a step forward in the creation of a real Irish nation here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence said that Governments exist primarily for the maintenance of social order.  He should know, or at any rate he knew it once, that the Government in Belfast does not exist primarily for the maintenance of social order.  It was not established for that purpose. It was established for the purpose of keeping that part of the country a stepping-off ground for the reconquest of Ireland should British policy dictate that at any time.  The Minister said we had not in operation between the two parts of the country a passport system because the convenience of our citizens demands that there should not be one.  What is the true situation?  if the Northern Government wish that certain citizens shall not enter their territory without their permission, is the Minister right in saying that no passport system operates; or is this another example of the many examples we had already, that whenever there is a difference in the relationship existing between the Free State and the Government of Great Britain or Northern Ireland it is always detrimental to the interests of the citizens of this State?</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  Deputy Doyle, who is not now in the House, has been writing letters to the papers recently, insinuating or directly asserting that Deputy de Valera asked the Free State Executive Council to intercede with the Northern Government, asking them not to put into operation the Exclusion Order against him on the occasion of his visit to Armagh to attend the funeral of the late Cardinal O'Donnell.  Deputy Doyle has said that he has documentary evidence <Col N="154" /> to prove that that is the case. He has an opportunity now of producing that evidence, and if he does not produce it we can only come to the conclusion that he was drawing upon his imagination when making these statements in the public Press.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass asked what the British Government would have done if the Gárda Síochána had arrested Lord Lascelles.  I was present at a meeting at which the question of Deputy de Valera's arrest was discussed. I think it was pretty fully discussed.  We did not naturally discuss the question that the Deputy has touched.  But the reply I give him is this, that if any suggestion had been made by this Government to Lord Lascelles that his presence was unwelcome to us here, he would not have entered and if any suggestion had been made to Lord Birkenhead when he was about to come here that his presence was unwelcome, he would not have come here.  I am perfectly certain of this, that if we had an Act in force which gave us the particular powers that the Northern Government have in their Civil Authorities Special Powers Act that no British politician would enter the Free State in defiance of that order, and if anyone did by any chance that there would be no protest at all from the British Government.  The most that might come from the British Government if that happened would be a letter asking if we could not release him.  I am absolutely sure that if the Public Safety Act were in force still, if we did make an order prohibiting British Communists or a London Irishman, or somebody taking an interest in political affairs over here, or that is likely to take an interest in political affairs here&mdash;if under that Act we issued an order forbidding a particular person to enter here and if that person entered and was sentenced to imprisonment, there would be no protest from the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we in the interest of the country as a whole, apart altogether from the interests of the Free State, could have taken any action other than the action we did take.  One may question whether in view of the deliberateness of Deputy de <Col N="155" /> Valera's action in going there and also in view of his attitude in court whether we ought to have written or not.  But Deputy de Valera was not involved in our action.  We were certainly not desirous that he should remain in prison, but there was no reason why he should feel galled as he had no responsibility for our action; there is no reason why he should feel offended or why he should feel that there was any ignominy on him in relation to the matter.  Our action did not really affect him in any way.  I think Deputy de Valera some time ago said that if we wanted to end Partition there was no use in talking too much about it.  I took that to mean that the problem of ending partition was an extremely delicate problem and one that was not going to be solved by attempting to rush it unduly or by having any tremendous amount of public discussion. I think that the ending of Partition which people are talking about here would not be helped forward but would be retarded by making the welkin ring or doing anything in relation to the present Government of Northern Ireland that could not be defended as perfectly correct.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Defence, that this matter of whom they will let into Northern Ireland is a matter within the powers and the constitutional rights of the Government of Northern Ireland.  They would have reason to regard it as an insult and an offence if we approached them in any other way about this matter.  I do not think that Partition is going to be a work of all time.  I once before said in this House that I believe Partition could not be ended by any form of coercion; that if the end came it would come when a majority in Northern Ireland believe and realise it would be to their advantage to agree to the ending of Partition.  I do not say that one could not find historical justification for coercion, if coercion were possible; but I have believed for some time that coercion is impossible both now and in any future that can be foreseen.  If coercion is impossible, then the end of Partition can only be brought about by the consent of the people, and that consent will only come, amongst other <Col N="156" /> things, as a result of normal political evolution there.  Any unjustifiable attacks on the Northern Government for doing a thing which was in their right, whether we like or dislike what they did, will only hinder and delay the normal political evolution that one might expect to take place there.  If there are any people up there who would be pleased at the arrest of Deputy de Valera, believing that it would hold up political evolution, then those people would be the more pleased the more the welkin was made to ring here.</P>
    <P>If Deputy de Valera were President, somebody said&mdash;Deputy O'Connell said that a small change over of votes might have made Deputy de Valera President&mdash;then what would the country have done if the President of the Executive Council were placed under arrest?  All I can say is that if Deputy de Valera were to do such a thing&mdash; I put this, not meaning any offence&mdash; if he were to be guilty of a petty offence against the laws of another State and got himself into jail for doing so, then he would not be fit to be President.  A leader of the Opposition who has not actually the responsibility of government is in a different position, and he may do things which, I believe, are not quite correct even in any prominent politician.  But they are not so serious as they would be if they were done by a man who was for the time being charged with the responsibility of government.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Defence said, there is no use in pretending that Partition does not exist, and objecting to things because they are one of the natural consequences of Partition. We are not going to end Partition that way.  We are not going to end it by any sort of attack on the things up there.  Although the Government, as the Minister for defence said, has the right to exclude a person whom it thinks, for its own reasons, dangerous to admit, it might be that a certain sort of discriminate refusal to admit citizens of a State would after a time come to be regarded by that State as an unfriendly act.  The Belgian Government lately refused admission to certain members of the British Parliament. The United States have refused <Col N="157" /> admission to British politicians.  But there might come a time when, if the ordinary non-political citizens of Great Britain were in some discriminating way refused admission in considerable numbers to Belgium, the British Government might say, &ldquo;Here, we are not being treated fairly in this matter. There is a discrimination against us, and you are refusing admission to some of our citizens against whom no fault can be alleged, and we take that as an unfriendly act.&rdquo;  In the same way, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, if an ordinary merchant from Cork or Dublin who had no interference at all in politics, were refused admission, and if instances of that kind continued, we might then take the matter up and say, &ldquo;Here are acts which are definitely unfriendly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You must recognise the position that from the point of view of Northern Ireland Deputy de Valera is one of their politicians.  He is a member of their Parliament, although he has not taken his seat.  He is the leader of a political party there.  Above all men, I think he is the man about whose arrest we would have the least shadow of justification for issuing any protest.  As regards a man who had never any connection with the North&mdash;in that case I do not think we could protest unless the thing were happening frequently. We would then have some grounds.  I would be glad to see Deputy de Valera released.  We regret his arrest.  He went there and may not have known that he would be arrested.  On the other hand, he must have known that there was a considerable chance of his being arrested.  He simply decided to challenge the powers that be there, and for us to enter any protest in regard to that would be extremely foolish.  I do not think I need deal further with that point.  Deputy O'Connell seemed to think that this expression &ldquo;common citizenship&rdquo; involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Australia and Canada, and all those countries retain their right to keep out a person, even though he is a citizen of another member of the Commonwealth. A prominent member of the Dáil, Deputy Esmonde, was once refused permission to enter Australia. He was refused by the Australian Government. They afterwards invited him there and entertained him at great expense.</P>

      <P>If Deputy de Valera could do the same I think he would be welcome.  However, without going too far into this matter, perhaps India is in a different position, but there is no doubt that Indian citizens are continually refused.  The Canadian, South African, and other Governments retain their full right to exclude anybody they like.  We have not any Act under which we can exclude a person who is a citizen of any other State of the Commonwealth. The powers in regard to aliens do not, I think, extend to them, but we had here certain powers for a short time under the Public Safety Act.  If the Deputies opposite did not come into the Dáil, it is most probable that the various powers under that Act which were not put into force would have been put into force, and if Exclusion Orders were issued under that Act, I have no doubt that some of the people on whom orders would have been served would be people who were natives of Belfast, and some of them natives of Great Britain.  British citizens from every point of view, people who were perhaps only the grandchildren of Irish parents who may have been born in London. The British Government could not question our right, and it would certainly be wrong for us to admit that the British Government was entitled to say that we should not exclude such people. Even if we take the point of view that the Northern Government is subordinate to the British Government, it would be illogical to deny them that right.  We get no further by all the pretence that has gone on in connection with this matter.  I have discussed it with several people who condemned <Col N="159" /> it, and I found that none of them had given consideration to the matter.  After a candid talk they practically all admitted that there was nothing to be done.  My own opinion is that the whole business has a good deal of political basis behind it, both here and in the North.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister deny that the Executive Council are responsible for the arrest of Deputy de Valera?  I can show that they are responsible by the underhand way that they went about asking Lord Craigavon to grant a permit to Deputy de Valera to go there without his knowledge.  The people who invited him there would not have done so if they had been aware of the circumstances under which he attended the funeral of Cardinal O'Donnell.  In that way, I submit, the Government was primarily responsible for the invitation being issued to him.</P>

They told us that not alone is Northern Ireland co-equal with this State, but they compared Northern Ireland, a fifth of a small country like Ireland, with such countries as Germany, Belgium and the United States.  They told us that Belgium, the United States, Germany and England could exclude aliens, but neither the President of the Executive Council nor the Minister for Defence has told us that Germany, Belgium or the United States sent police to the border line to watch for the entrance of these people and imprison them. We have no record of aliens&mdash;if you like to call them that&mdash;or citizens of these countries being arrested by another country for entering it.</P>

If he does, where then is all the talk to which we have been listening about co-equality and nationhood?  If that is so, there is no substance in those statements made previously.  We have been willing to accept and make the most of the status we have achieved here, but I venture to suggest that nothing has degraded this State so much as the action of the President of the Executive Council in asking, as an act of grace from a subordinate British Parliament, that one of the Free State's citizens should be released.  Nothing so degrading has happened in this country for years.  I want to say clearly, on behalf of most of the constituents whom Deputy de Valera represents, that they <Col N="161" /> do not want his release as an act of grace, but as an act of justice and right, and they want the Executive Council to take such action as will enable him to be released as an act of justice.  They do not want this State, poor and all as its status is, to degrade itself further by asking for the release of the Leader of the Opposition in this Dáil as an act of grace.  We have heard a lot of talk about Lord Somebody or another coming into this State, and it has been asked, in the event of the Civic Guard arresting him, whether his arrest would be followed by a letter from the British Government.  If Lord Beaverbrook, or somebody else, insisted on landing here in defiance of an Order of this State, would the Minister for Defence have him arrested and put in jail?</P>

But if he compares the rights of Northern Ireland with the rights of Belgium, Germany and the United States, what can I understand but that he suggests that Northern Ireland has the rights of a sovereign state.  He says that these States can exclude persons.  He says that Northern Ireland has the same rights as these States.  What can I conclude from that but that it is a sovereign State and that we have two sovereign States in this country?  The Minister is uncomfortable. It is no wonder he should be.  The action of the Executive Council and the statement of the Minister for Defence clearly prove that I was a prophet and that this British Commonwealth of Nations is an international fallacy&mdash;a bubble which has been pricked by their own action to-night.</P>

      <P>Not since the Treaty have I heard such muddle-headed talk.  This debate reminds me of some of the worst debates that went on on the Treaty.  The innocence of Deputy Hogan is past all understanding.  He wants to know what are the rights of the Northern Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence explained quite clearly that if they have the power to pass a resolution for social order they have the power to administer that resolution. Does the Deputy suggest that that right&mdash;rather an elementary right &mdash;gives them equality with Australia or Canada?  If he does, then his studies in constitutional law have been cut very short.  There are other rights which they have not got.  They have not got the right, for instance, to impose tariffs.  They have got no real fiscal power.  I could go on at great length to tell the Deputy what rights they have got and what rights they have not got, but it would be a waste of time, because the Deputy knows what powers they have already.  There is a right which they have got&mdash;the right of saying what citizens may enter their territory and what citizens may not.  The Deputy should not draw any foolish deductions from that.  That is all the Minister for Defence said.  The naiveté of this debate is past belief. What does it come to?  It is the old story: de Valera will pick a quarrel and then we will go to war and clear it up.  That has been his consistent rôle for the last five or six years.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputies what has happened here?  What is the suggestion?  Somebody quite irresponsible&mdash;somebody who will have no responsibility for taking action of any kind&mdash;makes the quarrel, and then everybody unites and says to the Government of the day, &ldquo;You clear up this.&rdquo; I say that is typical of Deputies <Col N="164" /> opposite.  It is typical of Deputy de Valera and of the rôle he has always played.  Deputy O'Connell said that Deputy de Valera might have been President, and if he were arrested, what then?  As the Minister for Defence said, there is all the difference in the world&mdash;please do not laugh at this&mdash;between arresting a member of a Government and arresting a Deputy, for this reason: if he were President of the Executive Council, assuming that the standards of this country are the standards of civilised countries, he would have to make up his mind on one thing immediately&mdash;whether he was going to recognise the rights which exist in Northern Ireland, and if he were not prepared to recognise those rights his only alternative would be to break off relations.  There is no third method.  There is no <i>via media</i>&mdash;making the welkin ring and bawling at each other across the border, partly recognising their rights and partly denying them.  That is not the method of a civilised Government or of a Government that has any respect for itself.  If a member of a Government is arrested, it must be assumed he is arrested, not for any personal reason, but because of his policy&mdash;because of the policy which he stands for&mdash;and no Government could stand that insult. It is not a personal insult by any means.  It has nothing to do with the person.  It merely comes to this: there is a convention amongst civilised people that either of two things happens; there are normal civil relations between peoples or there is the opposite, which is war.  There is no third course.  This making the welkin ring, these challenges and all this bawling would not add to the dignity of this State, and would not be adopted by anybody who has any concern for the dignity of this State.</P>

The ordinary people of the country understand the position quite well, and nobody is sleeping one hour less, and nobody is refraining <Col N="165" /> from taking his food or feeling in the slightest degree aggrieved or insulted because a citizen of this country has been arrested in another country under the laws of that country.</P>

      <P>One or two facts which transpired here to-night are apparently in the nature of news to some of the people here.  One is that it is almost an invariable custom that when a member&mdash;distinguished or otherwise&mdash;of a Parliament is going into the territory of another Parliament, an intimation to that effect is usually transmitted to the Government concerned.  On a previous occasion when Deputy de Valera and some of his friends intended to attend the funeral of the late Cardinal, I took steps to make representations to the Northern Government in that connection.  My Parliamentary Secretary got into communication with the headquarters of Mr. de Valera's organisation in Abbey Street on the 'phone, with a view to finding out who was going.  Subsequently, in order to have no doubt whatever in the matter, he got a note, in the handwriting of the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, headed &ldquo;Cardinal's funeral.&rdquo; There are then the names of those who proposed to attend. The first is E. de Valera, and then there are Sean T. O'Kelly, Frank Fahy, Donal O Buachalla (Kildare), Dr. Con Ward and Sean French, Lord Mayor of Cork.  There follows then, in the typical Civil Service style and in the elegant caligraphy of one of my secretaries: &ldquo;Are there any prohibition orders in force against any of the latter three?&rdquo;  The answer to that is: &ldquo;Do not think so&mdash;F.A.&rdquo;  Then there follows: &ldquo;I do not think so either.&mdash; E.J.D.&rdquo; The note passed from Deputy Duggan to Deputy Aiken, and was returned from one to the other.  That was the policy adopted then.  It was a successful policy, and no intimation was <Col N="169" /> made to the public compromising either Deputy de Valera or anybody else in connection with it.  Exactly the same policy might have been adopted recently, on an intimation to my secretary or to myself of the intention of Deputy de Valera to travel to any place where an exclusion order had been in force against him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might clear this up, as I was present?  I was told by the President's Secretary that he was in touch with the Northern Government with a view to securing that Deputy de Valera and his colleagues should be free from molestation.  He informed me that the Northern Government asked for the names of those who intended to go.  I rang up Fianna Fáil headquarters in Abbey street and asked for the names.  As a result, I received this document.  There was then the query whether there were prohibition orders in force against any of the three latter names.  There are six names here altogether.  I passed that document across the House, addressed to Deputy Aiken, with my writing on the back of it.  It came back to me addressed &ldquo;Deputy Duggan,&rdquo; in Deputy Aiken's handwriting, saying &ldquo;Don't think so.&rdquo;  That was initialled &ldquo;F.A.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the President, but this is a very vital matter.  My point is that Deputy Aiken was not aware of the purpose for which those names were required. <Col N="170" /> When I saw the letter from Deputy Doyle, I cabled to Deputy Aiken the exact letter that had appeared in the Press and I received the following reply by cable:</P>
      <P>Duggan asked me in Lobby whether any of our people attending funeral.  He did not say Belfast Government was being requested to permit our members enter unmolested. I said de Valera, Fahy and some others were going but did not know exactly who.&mdash;Aiken.</P>

      <P>I felt ashamed that the people of Northern Ireland would read that pronouncement of the responsible leader of the Opposition in this Parliament at the present moment. I listened most carefully to Deputy Lemass, who usually addresses himself with some common sense to the subject under discussion.  His contribution was barren&mdash;absolutely barren and hopeless.  I should be sorry to believe that this whole thing was planned with a view to getting political kudos.  But it has very much that appearance and it ought not to be put that way.  A distinguished member, as he is called, of this House&mdash;the leader of the Opposition in this Parliament&mdash;should have sufficient common sense to know that he should not allow his position to be belittled by taking risks such as he took there.  As I said before, the usual procedure in every place is to intimate to the Government concerned the projected visit.  That is not published.  It was not published at the time of the funeral.  It was never mentioned. These things are done and it is understood that they are done by Governments. The only known means of communication between States and areas of jurisdiction is for Government to communicate with Government.  In this particular case, one or two questions arise.  Had the Northern Parliament any right to pass that Act?  If they had the right to pass it, they had the right to enforce it.  As long as their majority exists, we, as a democratic State, having matters settled here in accordance with majority, must subscribe to their right in that respect. There is no question at all as to whether or not we agree with it. <Col N="172" /> Having regard to the fact that under the law&mdash;that was passed by that Parliament&mdash;an offence had been committed, there was no course open to the Executive Council but to ask for the release of Deputy de Valera as an act of grace.</P>

There are protests for the distinguished person, but there are no protests for the unknown person.  We do not stand for that policy.  We do not stand for discrimination. If Deputy de Valera had realised his responsibility as a member of this House, not to say as leader of the Opposition, he should have intimated to my Office his intention to go across, and, quite possibly, without any trouble whatever, he would get an uninterrupted passage to his destination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that insurance companies registered outside the Free State are conducting business here, and that their policies bear British revenue stamps; if there is any private arrangement with the British and Northern Governments to refund the relative amount to the Free State, and whether he has power to compel these companies to have their policies for the Free State stamped in the Free State.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Double Taxation Relief Order (No. 1), 1923, an instrument, such as an insurance policy, chargeable with stamp duty both in Saorstát Eireann and in Great Britain, if stamped in one country is, to the extent of the duty which it bears, deemed to be stamped in the other country.  The principle has been generally accepted that a document which is signed in the Saorstát in such manner that the signature affixed in the Saorstát completes the document as a binding instrument should be stamped in this country.  This principle applies as a rule to fire, accident, employers' liability and other miscellaneous policies, and also to premium receipts and to a large proportion of policy loan agreements.  Such documents almost invariably are stamped in the Saorstát accordingly.  Life policies issued by British companies are, however, normally completed in every respect in Great Britain, and, as a rule, the stamp duty is, therefore, paid in that country. The arrangement for avoiding <Col N="24" /> double stamp duty under the Order quoted above applies as between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland in like manner as it applies as between the Saorstát and Great Britain.  No question of refund arises as between the three Exchequers concerned, and, having regard to the terms of the arrangement, it is obvious that there is no power to compel companies to have documents stamped here which are chargeable with stamp duty to the same extent in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and which, in the normal course of business, are stamped in one or other of those countries before they reach the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has observed the statement in the Press that British Trade Unions not registered in the Free State have no legal status here, and if, seeing that collecting societies which are carrying on industrial insurance business are in the same position, he will state what action he intends to take in connection therewith.</P>
