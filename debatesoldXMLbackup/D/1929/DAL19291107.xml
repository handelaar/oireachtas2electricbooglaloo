      <P>I am rather at a disadvantage in asking a supplementary question, because the Minister for Finance is not here.  Whatever might be said of the reasonableness of the answer to the first question about the cost of supplying the information, that reason certainly does not apply in the case of the second question.  The Minister knows perfectly well that as regards the total yield from licence duties and the total yield from beer and spirits in the City and County Borough of Dublin, there is no difficulty about getting that information.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state why a claim to unemployment insurance benefit made by Patrick Boyce, of Glebe, Downings, County Donegal, was disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit made on the 14th of January last by Patrick Boyce, was disallowed by the insurance officer under Section 7 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, on the ground that the claimant was not unemployed.  The claimant appealed against this decision and the case went to the umpire, whose decision was that the claim should be disallowed.</P>
      <P>Last August, when it was represented on behalf of the claimant that there was a material fact of which the umpire was not aware when giving his decision, the umpire reconsidered the case, but decided that the claim should remain disallowed as he saw no reason for altering his previous decision.  The claim accordingly remains disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that this applicant is a road ganger and not a farmer?  Apparently the claim is disallowed because this man owns a few acres of poor, rocky soil, which proves beyond yea or nay that the man's ordinary occupation is that of a road ganger.  He has been employed on that work for a long time and his cards were stamped; and I would ask the President to make further inquiries with regard to the case.</P>

That a customs duty of an amount equal to twenty per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all quilts of which the covers consist wholly or partly of silk or of artificial silk and which contain down or feathers and imported into Saorstát Eireann on or within five years after the 8th day of November, 1929.</P>

    <P>3.  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties mentioned in this section in like manner as if quilts of which the covers consist wholly or partly of silk or of artificial silk and which contain down or feathers and also unfilled quilt covers which consist wholly or partly of silk or of artificial silk were respectively mentioned in the Second Schedule to that Act as goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate but with the substitution in the said section of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>4.

The report has been received and I hope to have it in the hands of Deputies to-morrow, or perhaps even this evening.</P>
    <P>Along with the report upon down quilts, a report was presented on the application for a tariff on fish barrels.  The application for a tariff on fish barrels was reported against <Col N="910" /> by the Tariff Commission.  That report, however, will also be in the hands of Deputies to-morrow, or if not to-morrow, the day after.  The down quilt tariff is really a very small matter.  Down quilts are manufactured only by one firm in the Saorstát, by the firm of Messrs. Booth and Fox of Cork.  The down quilt in its present form was patented by this firm in 1841, and as a result of their patent the firm had practically a monopoly of the manufacture of down quilts for a considerable time, and consequently they built up a foreign market.  With the lapse of their patent, however, competitors came in and gradually the foreign market was lost.  The present difficulty in which the firm finds itself arises from the British Finance Act of 1925 which imposed a customs duty on silk and artificial silk and on articles made partly or wholly of these materials, with the consequence that the British market was cut off; it became unprofitable to manufacture here and export to Great Britain quilts in which silk or artificial silk was used.  In consequence this firm, which owns factories in England, has recently been compelled to manufacture quilts for the English market in its English factories.</P>
    <P>Generally, the position is that the industry is in grave danger of going out here.  It can really continue only if it is given a monopoly of the Irish market.  The Tariff Commission, after careful consideration, after visiting factories and carrying out all the investigation that was possible, recommended the tariff I have indicated in the Resolution.  The Tariff Commission propose that the tariff shall apply only to silk-covered quilts, not to quilts which may be covered with cotton, mercerised cotton, or other materials, which, as a matter of fact, are not subject to the British tariff and in respect of the manufacture of which the firm is in the same position as it was prior to 1925.</P>
    <P>The industry is a small one.  The number of people engaged in it recently has been about 40 or 50, and the Tariff Commission is of opinion <Col N="911" /> that if a tariff is imposed the maximum additional number that will be employed will be about 60.  In fact, the Tariff Commission does not believe that as large a number as 60 will be employed; that is the maximum figure, but the Tariff Commission does not believe that it will be reached.  Owing to the lack of statistics the Tariff Commission has found it difficult to come to a conclusion as to what is the annual value of the import of the goods which are now to be taxed.  It is, possibly, somewhere between £15,000 and £20,000.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is an old-established firm which was able to manufacture efficiently and to maintain an export trade until that export trade was cut off by the tariff of another country.  The Tariff Commission is satisfied that it will be possible to manufacture goods efficiently here and to sell them as cheaply as they are being sold, and that, broadly speaking, no increase will fall on the consumer as a result of the tariff.  It is not anticipated that any revenue will be collected on account of the tariff, because it is believed that this 20 per cent. will give this particular firm a monopoly of the market here and will enable them to overcome, by giving them the output which is necessary, the difficulties under which they have been labouring up to the present.</P>
    <P>The opposition to the tariff came from one firm, the Cork firm of Messrs.  Nolan and Sons, which is engaged in the extraction of down from feathers.  I will read an extract from the report so far as it affects the opposition to the tariff. The opponent firm stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As purchasers of approximately one-half of the poulterers' goose feathers produced in the Saorstát, they believed that the presence of their factory in Cork helped to keep prices at a profitable level for producers, especially as they were able to offer better prices than dealers.  Messrs. Nolan's witness instanced disadvantages which his firm already suffered in <Col N="912" /> comparison with their English competitors.  He opposed the imposition of a tariff on down quilts mainly on the ground that it would have an adverse effect on their trade.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commissioners say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We do not think it advisable to set out in detail their contention, which, in our opinion, is not likely to be borne out to the extent anticipated by Messrs. Nolan. We have, however, given full consideration to the objections which they have offered to the proposed tariff, and have had due regard to the fact that they employ a greater number of persons in the preparation and export of down and feathers than the Cork factory of Messrs. Booth and Fox employs in the preparation of down and the manufacture of quilts.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any other matter I need mention at present.  Deputies will have the report in their hands before the Report Stage of the Resolution is taken.  I have nothing further to say, except to repeat that this is a small matter, but that the industry is an old-established one, which is in danger of disappearing, not through any fault of those who are conducting it, but because of the imposition of a tariff outside.  It can be saved, in the opinion of the Commission, without expense to the consumer, and it seems desirable that it should be so saved.</P>

      <P>It is satisfactory to know that at any rate the Tariff Commission has not altogether ceased its labours, and that the applications for protective duties on down quilts and fish barrels, which were made in 1926, have at long last been reported on.  In connection with the recommendation with respect to the application concerning down quilts, I understand from the Minister that it is intended to impose a duty only upon quilts manufactured out of silk or artificial silk.  The application was, of course, for a protective duty on all down <Col N="913" /> quilts, no matter what covering material was used.  As far as I have been able to follow what the Minister said, the reason why it was decided to impose a customs duty upon down quilts made out of silk or artificial silk was because a duty upon such goods is in operation in Great Britain, and the reason why it was decided not to impose a duty upon other classes of quilts was because no such duty was in operation in Great Britain.  Apparently the Tariff Commission were merely anxious to bring the customs laws of this country into conformity with the customs laws prevailing in England.  It seems to be an extraordinary reason to give for the rejection of that part of the application which concerned down quilts made out of materials other than silk or artificial silk.  It is not possible, of course, to discuss this matter fully now, as we have not yet seen the report.  We will have an opportunity, when this motion again comes forward on the Report Stage, to go more fully into the reasons given for the apparently extraordinary decision of the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>I trust that the House will also be given an opportunity of discussing the report upon the application for a protective duty upon fish barrels, which will not come before the House in the ordinary way, as no recommendation has been made concerning it.  If some time could be set aside for a discussion of the report, it may be found that the decision of the Tariff Commission in that connection is apparently just as extraordinary as the decision in the case of down quilts and in the numerous other matters that came before it.</P>

      <P>As this matter will be discussed at a later date when we have had an opportunity of studying the report, there is no necessity to take up the time of the House at this stage, but I would like to have some information from the Minister on the general subject matter of tariffs which was recently discussed, I understand, by our representatives <Col N="914" /> at Geneva.  A proposal was put forward there that nothing should be done in the way of imposing further tariffs for a period of two years.  I do not know whether or not our representatives were signatories to that draft arrangement at Geneva.  Possibly the Minister could give us a little information on the subject.</P>

      <P>I welcome this resolution because I believe it has not come one moment too soon.  The firm to which the Minister referred, Messrs. Booth and Fox, have built up a very large industry, and by good administration and trade organisation have been enabled to build up a remarkably good export trade.  Owing, as the Minister stated, to a change in the fiscal policy of another country it has been found necessary to introduce the motion, and I am glad that the Tariff Commission in this case, at least, have shown a good deal of common sense in applying this tariff.  As a matter of fact I know that were it not that there was a belief, and a well-founded belief, that the Tariff Commission would have acted as they have acted, this firm would have to close its doors in Cork city, and throw on the unemployment market possibly sixty or eighty persons.  Of course there is a fly in the ointment.  I regret with Deputy Lemass that the Tariff Commission have not seen fit to apply this tariff to down quilts, the covering of which should not be confined to silk or artificial silk, and that they should have included in the impost other fabrics.  So far as it goes, at any rate, I am glad to learn that it will mean that this firm which, as I have already indicated, has built up an export trade will not have to close its doors.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that as far as the application for a tariff on fish barrels was concerned it had been turned down by the Tariff Commission.  Deputy Lemass asked the Minister to agree to set aside some time later on in order to discuss this decision regarding <Col N="915" /> fish barrels.  Personally I believe the announcement the Minister has made in regard to the decision of the Tariff Commission not to put a tariff on fish barrels will be very very good news indeed for the Chambers of Commerce in Belfast and Derry, and to the manufacturers of fish barrels in those districts.  I also believe that the announcement will more or less sound the death-knell of the aspirations of the workers in the congested areas who hoped to get employment at such work.  I would like to know if the Minister will agree to the suggestion put forward by Deputy Lemass, that the House should get an opportunity of discussing the decision with regard to fish barrels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems reasonable to inquire why, if the tariff on down quilts is intended to be prohibitive it was fixed so low as 20 per cent. A 20 per cent. tax as tariffs go is a rather low figure and if the intention was to give a monopoly to the firm in Cork it seems rather curious that it should not be, say, 33? per cent., so as to ensure that the desideratum would be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite understand Deputy Good's reference to an agreement at Geneva, but I can tell him that the attitude the representatives of the Saorstát took up in any discussions with regard to tariffs was that this country was not over-tariffed, that it was a country which was industrially undeveloped, and that it must stand out against any proposal in regard to a tariff holiday, or to the lowering of tariffs which would hinder it in making full use of the tariff weapon for the development of its industries.  I presume the question as to why other quilts and silk-covered quilts have not been included can be more satisfactorily discussed on the next stage.  I will just point out now that the firm is still in the same position to sell cotton covered quilts in its old markets.  It is now suffering from the fact that its output of silk quilts, <Col N="916" /> and consequently its general output, has been reduced.  If this tariff gives it a large output, by enabling it to supply silk quilts to the Saorstát, there is no reason why it should not continue to manufacture the other types of quilts satisfactorily without a tariff.</P>
      <P>With regard to fish barrels, when Deputies have seen the report it will be open to any Deputy to put down a motion and have the question discussed.</P>
      <P>The applicant firm in the case of down quilts applied for a tariff of only twenty per cent.  That of course would not preclude the Tariff Commission from recommending a higher tariff, but, naturally, they would only do so if there were extremely strong reasons, and I presume they were satisfied, as the applicant firm was satisfied, that a 20 per cent. margin would be sufficient.</P>

      <P>I desire to express the hope that, whatever opinion the Minister may have on the amendments that are tabled regarding the compensation of those who have given good service in the working of the Insurance Acts, at least he will accept the principle outlined in these amendments advocating provision by way of compensation for the officials that may be affected by this Bill.  I direct the Minister's attention also to the cases where the local authorities require to make an appointment for the carrying out of extra duties imposed by the Bill. They should be empowered to transfer existing officials and insurance committees to their service with the sanction of the Minister.  I recollect that on the introduction of the National Insurance Act, 1911, it was necessary to secure the services of men of administrative ability in order to secure the working of the Act, and that notwithstanding whatever appointments that resulted most of these officials have done a considerable amount of voluntary work, and having given such efficient service for so many years, some compensation should be given them whether they are whole time or part time officials, many of whom would find it difficult to take up similar posts.  I trust the Minister will favourably consider the views expressed in support of granting these officials compensation.</P>

      <P>In reference to amendments 12 and 16, in the one <Col N="918" /> standing in my name there is a difference that might be called a difference in principle.  It might be so looked upon by some.  In the amendment in my name, there is a limit to the persons who can get compensation if the amendment were adopted, and also there is a further limit limiting the income.  It would be difficult to decide the issues raised there.  They are distinct issues.  While in general principle, they are the same, there are still subdivisions of each that are not in the first amendment.  Would it be possible, therefore, to get a separate vote if a vote were necessary?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly's point is sound to this extent. On the face of it, his amendment is a more restricted amendment than Deputy Davin's.  Therefore, while the Committee might reject Deputy Davin's, it might in theory accept amendment 16, which is not as extensive.  An amendment in the name of the Minister, amendment 13, raises a similar question of compensation, but in a different way from amendment 12.  We can have a decision separately on amendments 12 and 16.</P>

Amendment 12 has added to it a schedule which makes it complete. I think I would have put amendment 12, no matter how it occurred, because amendment 12 is coupled with a suggested third schedule on the paper.  Therefore, the amendment is quite complete.  Amendment <Col N="919" /> 16 has reference only to the Railways Act, and does not state exactly where the compensation is to come from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Deputy Davin's amendment, because of the number of men on insurance work who are not engaged in any other occupation.  They devote their whole time practically to the administration of sanatorium benefit of members. They may have four or five thousand insured members in their area.  It entails a large amount of time, four or five hours some days, and at other times it occupies the whole day, receiving people, giving them instruction, looking after the cards, finding out details in connection with various sanatoriums and hospitals and other regulations.  It is not possible under Deputy Doyle's suggestion to transfer some of these over to the public bodies, because the public bodies would be dealing with non-insured persons.  They will be in a different position.  Some of them are already employed.  The boards of health have already made arrangements with their clerks and assistant clerks to take over the administration of the tuberculosis scheme for non-insured persons.  It is not likely that a public body will want other officials to deal with four or five thousand persons in their area.  For that reason insurance clerks should receive the same treatment as other officials received when their positions were abolished.  Some may have other positions already, but still when we consider the case in Dublin, say, where there might be anything up to <Col N="920" /> one hundred thousand insured persons, it is a whole-time position.  You cannot define part-time or whole-time or any other position there.  I say there should be some arrangement made, and that those officials whose posts will be abolished should receive not less generous treatment than that received in other amalgamations by other public officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be admitted that the secretaries of insurance committees are whole-time officers.  For instance, as well as being secretary to an insurance committee you have one who is a collector of income-tax; another who is secretary to a county council; another who is clerk to a county council and another assistant-secretary to a county council.  Sixteen out of thirty-five hold positions such as that.  So the position is explicitly regarded as a part-time appointment. I think I pointed out yesterday that the funds which are administered are very small.  In nineteen cases out of thirty-one the amount of money administered by the Committee is less than £750 a year.  Deputy Davin's Schedule proposes that compensation for loss of office should be given to the secretaries of these committees or employees of these committees, in the same way as compensation is given to whole-time permanent officials of local bodies.  We cannot accept that at all.  What my intention and the intention of the Minister for Finance and of the Insurance Commissioners in this particular matter, relying on sub-section (4) (a) of Section 22, is, whatever more explicit reference to compensation may be necessary, to deal with the employees of insurance committees in the same way in which employees of school attendance committees were dealt with under the 1924 Act.  The 1924 Act, in connection with the abolition of school attendance committees, explicitly arranged that the officials of such committees, whether whole-time or part-time, would be given compensation to the extent of being paid a gratuity of not more than one-tenth for every year of office. <Col N="921" /> An explicit introduction of provision for compensation into this measure, to give compensation to officials of insurance committees on being dispensed with, could not, in my opinion, give more advantageous terms in general to these officials than were given to the employees of school attendance committees. That would restrict the position to this: that the secretaries of these committees would simply get sums as gratuities amounting to not more than one-tenth of their annual salaries for each year of office.</P>
      <P>Personally, I do not want to put that explicitly in the Bill, for the reason that I desire a little more latitude than that given to the different classes of officials that are to be dealt with here.  There would be cases in which, because of the personal circumstances, if you like, or because of the fact that they had no other occupation, if funds were available, you would like to deal somewhat more generously than that with a particular employee of a committee who had long service and whose services were being dispensed with in this particular way.  These officials were part-time.  The nature of their work was such that they were appointed explicitly on the terms that their services were liable to be dispensed with on three months' notice.  The salaries paid them for their services were comparatively high compared with the small amount of money they were administering.  I want to say again that they cannot expect to be dealt with more generously than were the employees of the school attendance committees, but I do not want to be tied up completely in that particular matter, in so far as there may be funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the amendments that we are discussing here suggests that it may be possible to transfer these officers to the boards of health.  I think I have explained, with the exception of four or five counties, that what these committees do is to hand over the funds available for sanatorium treatment to the boards of health, and that the present <Col N="922" /> machinery of the boards of health puts that money in with the tuberculosis money and administers the general treatment of insured persons through the same machinery as they administer their ordinary schemes. So that I can see no prospect that any employees of these societies will be required by the boards of health, particularly in circumstances that will prevent the boards of health appointing them directly if they so wish.</P>
    <P>There are classes of appointments which it would be necessary to have filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners, but that could not possibly arise out of the present changed position in which one of these officers may be required by a board of health and may be required in a position that would have to be filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  So that it is simply better to treat the whole class as a class whose services are being dispensed with and pay them such gratuities as will be coming to them on the lines I indicated.  If the local circumstances are such that there is employment offered to them under the board of health schemes then the type of employment that would be offering would be such that there would be no restrictions on the board of health appointing them.</P>

      <P>The only case of the kind that could arise would be where you had a county in which there was no tuberculosis scheme&mdash;a county such as Wicklow.  I do not know that we could force the board of health in Wicklow to take into their employment a particular person if that particular person did not appeal to the Board of Health.  I do not think there is any reason why in the few counties that would remain like that&mdash;Wicklow, Longford, and Roscommon&mdash;where they have not <Col N="923" /> health schemes&mdash;and to some extent Meath&mdash;we should force the boards of health to take into their employment persons. that there is nothing to prevent them taking, if they so wish.  I see no reason for dealing differently with the employees in these four counties than the employees of committees in any other county.</P>

If you take Waterford, I cannot see that any additional assistance will be required because of this change. In Waterford, the insurance committee hands over the money already to the Board of Health and the Board of Health is handling the money to the extent, in fact, that it will handle it in the future, so that I see no prospect of an appointment.</P>

If the Deputy, as a member of the board of health, shouldering its responsibility, cannot influence the board of health to employ the person who has a particular class of experience, and whom he probably can speak for, I do not know why a person who is so far away as the Minister should interfere to force the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister's present attitude is certainly an improvement upon the Bill as it was originally introduced, to the extent that he has stated he is now willing to provide some compensation for those who are likely to be disturbed as a result of the passage of the Bill.  In moving this amendment I was not bothering one jot what effect it was likely to have on this or that individual.  I confined myself mainly, in the few arguments I put forward, to the point <Col N="925" /> which has been put to this House on other occasions in support of a similar proposition, namely, that the individuals who are likely to lose their part-time or whole-time employment&mdash;and that particular matter has been stressed too much as far as I am concerned&mdash;should be compensated for the loss of their office, as a result of a Bill of this kind, in the public interest.  The Minister and some Deputies have unduly stressed the question of part-time and whole-time employment. When the Insurance Commissioners were looking for suitable persons to be appointed as secretaries to insurance committees they laid down in almost every case that the individual concerned should have the administrative ability and experience which would qualify him for the part-time or whole-time position.  That was particularly stressed in the case of those who occupied part-time positions, and they were appointed to these positions because they had rather considerable experience in other positions.  They were paid an appropriate salary, and my proposal is merely that they should receive compensation, if they become redundant under the Bill, on the basis of their part-time or whole-time salary. I would much prefer, with other Deputies, that the individuals likely to be affected would be found suitable positions, based on their experience and knowledge, in some of the other public boards in the areas affected, rather than that the individuals would have to be compensated for loss of office if they cannot be found equally suitable posts by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not give me any good reason, in fact he gave no reason at all, as to why he wants latitude in reference to the question of compensation.  In the Acts passed concerning the amalgamation of unions, the amalgamation of railways, and in connection with matters of this kind likely to arise as a result of the Electricity Supply Act, it is clearly laid down not only in the Act itself, but in the Schedule, that the compensation should be on <Col N="926" /> a certain basis.  I want to know from the Minister why he is not prepared to give that effect in regard to this particular matter, which is on all fours with what has been done by his predecessor in the case of the Local Government Act, 1925, and by other Ministers in regard to the other measures to which I have referred. I am not prepared to give the Minister any latitude which will allow him by regulation later on to fix compensation, perhaps for one individual on one basis and for another on a more favourable basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy understands my point in that. It is that if we are to be explicit in this, then I can make no more favourable provision in this Bill than was made in the School Attendance Act, 1924, that is, a sum not exceeding one-tenth for each year's service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of part-time employment, let us apply the argument to the position of Deputies.  Many Deputies are forced, if you like, to give their whole time without any other occupation to the service of the country.  I go so far as to say that about 75 per cent. of Deputies have other business to attend to.  That does not prevent them, as far as I know, from giving equally good service to the country as those who have no other employment or occupation.  That should, I think, from the Minister's point of view, dispose of the question of part-time as against whole-time employment. Let us apply the principle involved in this particular amendment to ourselves.  I have not heard up to the present any good reason from the Minister as to why I should withdraw my amendment, which lays down in clear and definite language the conditions under which redundant officials shall be compensated as against the very vague promises made by the Minister in his speech.</P>

      <P>We had better be clear on this matter and know where we are.  Is the work of the insurance committees going to be done by the <Col N="927" /> board of health as such, or is it going to be done by a committee of the board of health or a committee appointed from outside by the board of health?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens at present is, you have a tuberculosis scheme in Kilkenny&mdash;an ordinary scheme extending to whatever class of the population requires it.  They spend a certain amount of money on that.  I have not the figures at present, but I take it the amount of money spent publicly, as compared with the amount spent by the insurance committees in Kilkenny, can be regarded as being in the same proportion as over the whole country, that is, that four or five pounds are spent out of public funds as against one pound out of insurance committees' funds.  What the insurance committees in Kilkenny do is this.  They have approximately £525 or £540, and they hand that money over annually to the board of health and say to them:&ldquo;Spend that money when you are spending your own, and with the same machinery that you spend your own, but we will tell you the people on whom it is to be spent.&rdquo;  That is done at present. What this Bill does is, it wipes out the insurance committees, and the board of health in Kilkenny will get the £525 or £540, or whatever the sum is, annually to spend, and they will spend it with the ordinary money raised for the tuberculosis scheme.  It will not add anything that I know of to the board of health's work in Kilkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want to get at.  Will it add anything to the work of the board of health, and is the board of health likely to transfer this work to a sub-committee of itself or to a committee outside? Will the claim be made, as is made in all these matters, that the secretary to the board of health will make an application for an increase because of an increase of work? That is usually what occurs in all these amalgamations.  The moment amalgamation takes place a claim is <Col N="928" /> made that extra duty has been put upon the officer, and he at once applies for an increase in salary, and gets it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the secretary's duties, there is going to be less work, because it is going to cut out correspondence between the committee of the board of health and the secretary of the insurance committee dealing with cases that cover the £500.  The cases that were made the subject of correspondence and reports between the board of health and the insurance committee will fall into the normal tuberculosis scheme, so there is a prima facie case for saying that there will be less work for the board of health.  At any rate, the correspondence and reports between the board of health and the insurance committee will be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there will be no such thing as a possible increase in salary of the clerk of the board of health because of additional work. I think the Minister has made it quite clear that in as much as it means less work than was formerly done by the clerk of the board of health his salary might have to be decreased instead of being increased and there is no chance whatever of the present official fitting in to any new scheme.  Now there are two bases on which the question of remuneration might be considered&mdash; first of all, the salary he is in receipt of as clerk of the local committee, and then the question of bonus, which is a shifting sum that might disappear in four or five years.  Certainly it ought to disappear if it is based on what the general public could afford to pay.  The question of the bonus ought to disappear if the ordinary official is to come down to the level of the people in a very short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin has wiped out, I should say, the distinction between those in part-time employment and those in whole-time employment.  It is quite true that people in part-time employment may do as good work as Deputy Davin himself does, or as those in <Col N="930" /> whole-time employment in particular duties, but it appears to me the remuneration received is an important consideration.  If an insurance committee secretary is drawing the substantial amount of £150 or £200 per year out of some other business, it seems to me he is in an entirely different position from the man with a wife and family who has no other salary.  The Minister says these people took the positions under certain conditions, and these conditions ought now to hold.  It is fifteen years since these committees were set up, and in the course of that time these people, no doubt, began to regard themselves as servants of the State.  I do not know whether they were right in that or not.  I am sure they never contemplated that they would be taken as a particular class and then suddenly thrown out of employment without sufficient remuneration.  I am glad that the pressure put up to the present has made the Minister advance so far as to offer a gratuity of one-tenth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, which I support, would in effect give the same conditions as Deputy Davin wants, except that we only want to give compensation in cases where we feel that the person was really dependent upon it, that is to say that he or she had not an income from other sources of more than £200 per annum.  The terms which Deputy O'Kelly's amendment seeks are substantially the same as Deputy Davin's.  The schedule to Deputy Davin's amendment is based upon the Railways Act, and in that case the gratuity would amount to one-sixth per year.  The Minister is willing to give one-tenth, and I hope that Deputies will press this matter strongly upon the Minister.  Whatever the claim of those who are in part-time employment may be, I agree with Deputy Davin that because, as the Minister reiterated, they are only in part-time employment, is not a sufficient consideration. Officials in the Department have a habit of assuming that because a man has a little shop or something else he is getting a good income out <Col N="931" /> of it.  As a matter of fact, it is the salary that is keeping the shop very often.  But however it may be in regard to the part-time people, we here are particularly interested in those who have no other means of subsistence practically, and in order to give a reasonable margin we have put down &ldquo;where the income from other employment does not exceed £200.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another qualification&mdash; that is, that the individual should have at least five years' service, and a further qualification that in the event of equivalent employment being available he would get no compensation.  Between those different qualifications I think the amendment is very reasonable, because there are only about 35 individuals, I understand, concerned. I ask the House to urge upon the Minister the necessity for making some further advance beyond the gratuity of one-tenth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  The Minister must certainly anticipate a surplus, because he is making provision for the manner in which any surplus standing to the credit of sanatorium benefit, etc., shall be expended.  In this amendment we suggest that the position of clerks to insurance committees should be taken into consideration and that they should be compensated in some way.  The nature of that compensation, whether it be by way of gratuity or pension, could be decided on at a later date.  I think it is unfair of the Minister to suggest that he does not want to be tied up in any way. Surely he has a precedent in other Acts passed by the Dáil under which sums have been set aside for a purpose such as the one we are now debating.  There is a whole lot to be said for Deputy O'Kelly's amendment. The Minister mentioned officials such as secretaries and assistant secretaries of county councils and other people drawing large salaries.  I think some line should be drawn between these well-paid people and the persons referred to <Col N="932" /> by Deputy Derrig.  I know that in Cork the secretary to the insurance committee there is mainly dependent on the salary he receives.  If he is not superannuated or compensated in some way&mdash;such, for instance, as the granting to him of a lump sum&mdash;it is the general desire of the people there that he should be taken over by the board of health and his services be continued. I know that these schemes differ in various counties.  What may obtain in Kilkenny, Longford or Westmeath may not, and in fact does not, obtain in County Cork.  There the board of health has more work to do at the moment than it can reach on.  In fact it is overburdened with work.  If that board, as soon as this Bill becomes an Act, has in addition to do the work now so well performed by the insurance committee, it will undoubtedly have to employ extra clerical assistance.  Therefore, I think provision should be made in the Bill to the effect that when the board requires that extra clerical assistance, it should take over the existing secretary to the local insurance committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, is asking too much when he suggests that he should not be bound down to a specific sum or to regulations governing the way which the surplus he anticipates is to be administered.  I think the first charge on any surplus left over should be the claims of the people who are disturbed or thrown out of employment as a result of the change which this Bill will make. The Minister, I believe, means well in this Bill.  He has yielded somewhat, and has come round a little to the views which were expressed, not alone in this Party and in the Fianna Fáil Party, but by members of his own Party.  Perhaps this latter was the urge which has been the most insistent, and the one to which he has shown the least resistance. I suggest to the Minister that he should not divide the House on this matter, but that he should act on this amendment as he has done in the case of another amendment that came before him.  I think the Minister should undertake to alter the <Col N="933" /> phrascology of this section so as to meet the views expressed by members in all parts of the House.  I know that in his own Party there are many members who, if they made themselves vocal on matters of this kind, would be altogether against the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know that in the Minister's Party there are members from Cork, Tipperary, and Limerick who, if they made themselves vocal and were not tied up by the Party machine, would on this matter find themselves in the Division Lobby with us.  If the Minister thinks that is mere conjecture on my part, I suggest that he should leave this to an open vote of the House and not put the Party Whips on.  On a recent occasion, when the Minister for Justice stated that he was prepared to have an open vote on a matter then before the House, we found that the Party Whips were put on.  Five or six Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who came in for that division asked what way they were to vote.  When they saw the Party Whips on, they voted on Party lines.  I suggest the Minister who has already given evidence of a little liberality on this matter&mdash;I have no doubt that his intentions are of the best&mdash;should agree to have a real open vote of the House on this question.  I suggest, further, to him that he should agree to the suggestions that have been put forward in support of this amendment and alter the section so as to ensure that the officials concerned will be compensated, and that the sum they are to receive shall be specified in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a word with regard to the point raised by Deputy Gorey.  The Deputy questioned the Minister as to the amount of work that will be thrown on the secretary of the board of health as a result of the abolition of the insurance committees. I understood the Minister to say that there would be less work for the secretary to the board of health to do than he has at present. <Col N="934" /> Perhaps the Minister is right in one respect.  There will be less correspondence, as the Minister has said, because one of the committees with which the secretary to the board of health has to be in close contact will not be in existence.  Therefore, that correspondence will cease.  But one other thing will happen when this work is handed over to the boards of health as they are at present generally constituted.  The insured persons, who heretofore have been looked after by members of insurance committees, will not receive the same attention in the future.  I know something of the work done by two or three of these committees, and I am aware that there were people on them who took an interest in the work to be done.  They frequently visited the sick in their homes.  They also met at fairly regular intervals to interview those who were not able to come before the committee.  That work will not be done in the future, and as a result it will be a loss to the public health services in these counties. Unless boards of health in the future nominate voluntary or subcommittees to look after that work in the future in the same manner as some active committees that I know did it heretofore, then that work is bound to be neglected.  Deputy Gorey is of opinion that the work will be reduced, and that it will be possible, as a result of that, to reduce the salary of the secretary to the board of health or of whoever looks after that work.  I would like to see Deputy Gorey propose that at a meeting in the County Kilkenny.</P>

I was assured that there would not be extra work, and that instead of salaries being increased it would probably be the other way, which I think is unlikely.  The question involved was one of more work and not a reduction of salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think from his experience Deputy Gorey will agree with me that what will happen is that the secretary of the board of health will in a short time ask for an additional clerk to look after this work.  We are abolishing the committee; well and good.  Then we are to abolish the secretary of that committee so far as his services are concerned. I think we here on all sides are in favour of compensating those whose position is being abolished. They will get compensation, generous or otherwise.  The majority of these people have been doing this work for the insurance committees for a number of years.  They know the work they are doing, and they are to be dispensed with now and new and younger people will be employed to do this work under the board of health.  We will be creating new appointments after two or three or five years when we are re-organising the health services and establishing a State medical service.  The people appointed to take the place of those displaced under this measure will, when the re-organisation takes place, be given further pensions.  I suggest that we should avoid that, and an effort should be made to find employment for the officials we are now dismissing.  If that could be arranged it would be a saving to the rate-papers twice over by not having to pay these compensations.  We would be doing an act of justice to those who are dismissed, and would prevent claims that will be made in nine counties out of ten for an additional clerk to do the work of the committees we are now abolishing. To provide employment in the way I have suggested would be the best way out of the difficulty, and it would avoid the payment of compensation. I think the Minister, in <Col N="936" /> consultation with his officials, should be able to find a way out on the lines I have suggested.  The Minister should, at least, compensate those part-time officials who have been a long time in the service, and who have given good service, if their services are dispensed with, bearing in mind the restriction we have in the amendment as to those who are deprived of their sole means of income.</P>

      <P>In reply to some of the points made by Deputy O'Kelly, these committees that are being abolished are made up of representatives of the local bodies, representatives of insured persons, and nominees of the Insurance Commissioners. In abolishing the committees we are not abolishing the approved societies or the insured persons. We are not abolishing the local bodies.  If on a committee made up of representatives of insured persons and of the local bodies are people who can give that kind of personal attention that would be described as visiting the sick and helping in the homes, the abolition of that insurance committee need not necessarily do away with such personal attention.  I have said it so often that I feel shy about repeating it again&mdash;we are dealing with an expenditure of £27,000 a year.  What has happened with regard to the expenditure of that sum is that £22,000 of it has been handed over in a lump sum annually to bodies, <Col N="937" /> and it is estimated this year that we are going to spend in addition £118,000, so that in so far as the actual expenditure of the money and looking after the treatment of the people are concerned, the local bodies under the board of health dealt with expenditure to the amount of £140,000.</P>
      <P>That happened in Deputy Kennedy's county.  There is an agreement by which the insurance committee hand over their funds in a lump sum to the Westmeath Board of Health and nominate the insured people to be treated.  The board of health in Westmeath is already dealing with them, and the tuberculosis scheme in Westmeath is operating to deal with the insured as well as the uninsured persons, so there is no reason in letting our imagination run on and saying that because of the fact that we are going to send an extra £5,000 after the £22,000 to join the £118,000 there is going to be a tremendous increase of work and a tremendous increase in the number of people employed under the boards of health.  Deputy Kennedy asked where the county medical officers come in under National Health Insurance. I do not know what the Deputy has in mind, but they do not come in at all.  The county medical officer of health undertakes the supervision of tuberculosis schemes in the county.  Over and above the economy that would be brought about, one of the things that actuated the members of the Commission who recommended the abolition of insurance societies was the concentration of control and supervision which would result from having one scheme in a health service such as tuberculosis.  That is the only way the county medical officer of health comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig, I think, makes my case to some extent in the matter of discrimination.  I am asking to be allowed latitude, and not to be forced to put into this Bill a provision to say that employees of insurance committees should be treated in the same way as the employees of school attendance committees should <Col N="938" /> be treated in the Act of 1924.  Deputy Derrig makes the point that persons who have a certain income from employment should be discriminated against, but there is no question of discriminating against the person who has an income from shares or an interest in business.  If a discrimination is to be made at all, let us have latitude of discriminating in so far as there are funds available.  What I am asking the House to realise is that here you have officials who are subject to three months' notice for the termination of their services.  Even if they had to deal with the whole administration of the funds, they were paid, in basic salary and bonus, a salary that was comparatively high, having regard to the amount of money expended.  With the exception of five counties in the country, expenditure of the money was not by them, but by another body to whom they handed it over, and who nominated persons who were to receive payment.</P>
    <P>I am asked, whatever provisions may be necessary to be put in here, to state that there will be definite compensation.  I am asking to have it accepted that these people cannot be treated in the way in which whole-time permanent employees of local bodies were treated, as Deputy Davin suggested.  The best thing that can be done is to treat them in the same way as employees of school attendance committees were treated and that I be left united in the matter, so that if funds are available and if cases require discrimination there can be discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): If this Bill has one characteristic more than another it is its indefiniteness.  The Minister wants us to give him more latitude for indefiniteness in this matter of compensation.  He wants us to give him carte blanche and to let him do what he likes as regards officials whose positions are wiped out because of an act of the State.  I do not know why he asks that particularly in this case.  I do not know what his reason is in this particular instance.  He <Col N="939" /> suggests that there will be very little work to be done in future.  I am half doubtful about the relevancy of this but it was referred to before. I hope it will pass now.  The Minister doubted that.  Secretaries of boards of health would have much to do.  I do not want to suggest that the Minister has not made himself acquainted with the activities of insurance committees and has not the information about them at his fingers' ends, but does he know that an index has to be prepared of all insured persons in the county? Does he know that an index has to be kept and that the history of insured persons has to be recorded? There are a hundred and one things which a secretary would have to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a general desire on the part of Deputies to do justice to those officials. I think it is also the desire, if it is at all possible, to avoid a division on Deputy Davin's amendment.  If the Minister could give an assurance to the House that between now and the Report Stage he would be in a position to make some little advance on the proposals he has enumerated here already, perhaps it would be possible to achieve the desired result. So much has been said on the amendment that I think it would be a waste of time to continue the debate much longer.  Suffice it to say that it is a well-recognised principle that where an individual loses employment as the result of legislation introduced by the Government, such individual should be entitled to compensation, and the officials and secretaries of the various insurance committees, who will, by virtue of the change effected in the Act, be deprived of their livelihood should, as a matter of justice, be entitled to compensation.  The only matter in dispute is the basis of the compensation to be paid, and I think that it would be well if the Minister would make some advance to endeavour to meet Deputy Davin in some way so as to prevent a division on the amendment; otherwise I am afraid many Deputies who appreciate the position of the Minister, and also the economic position of the country in general from the point of view that it is not good to increase the number of pensioners already on the list, would be forced perhaps to vote for the amendment proposed by Deputy Davin.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to make some statement that might meet the Deputies concerned and satisfy the officials, while at the same time safeguarding the finances of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to secure, in any way I can legislatively, that officials of these <Col N="942" /> societies will get terms at least as favourable as officials of the school attendance committees got, and that where it is possible&mdash;here the Deputy will see that discrimination comes in&mdash;in deserving cases, where funds exist, to give more than that. My point is that that is secured in the Bill even as it stands, unless we introduce some more explicit statement with regard to the principle of compensation generally.  Beyond that I cannot go.  Whether Deputies want that to be explicitly in the Bill, or whether they would leave the position as it is, is a question entirely for themselves.  If it is generally accepted I will endeavour to put it in explicit terms on the Report Stage, but it is quite impossible to go beyond that.</P>

      <P>I have not the figures by me at the moment, but I am assured that the funds which exist will bear that.  Deputies have argued that certain employees of this class are in a different position to others.  If that is so and if there are funds available, I am anxious to discriminate in the matter of these particular people, but I would not like to say, when we come to the point of drafting an amendment, that I can bring forward an amendment that would be satisfactory from the legislative point of view.  I think I have left Deputies under no misapprehension as to what my intention is, but beyond compensation on these particular lines we cannot go.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I move amendment 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 15, after the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and the amount of any benefit of which an employed contributor has been deprived by reason of such failure or neglect to pay contributions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to secure a greater amount of justice than has hitherto been secured under the National Health Insurance Acts. The National Health Insurance Commission has power to take into court people who fail to stamp insurance cards.  It has power to secure that these cards are stamped and that the amount that is necessary for the stamping is collected.  But there the function of the National Health Insurance Commission ceases.  It will be perfectly obvious to anyone who has experience of the administration of National Health Insurance that a good many insured contributors suffer hardship because of non-compliance on the part of employers in certain cases.  I have had some experience in different capacities of the administration of National Health Insurance, and I know that a good many employed contributors do suffer.  Take the case of an employed <Col N="948" /> contributor whose card has not been stamped for twelve months. Unless a free year operates on his behalf he ceases to be an insured employee and, if he seeks benefit, there is none to be got.  The modus operandi is that the insurance inspector is called in and the ordinary machinery is put into operation. Some time elapses before the cards are collected, stamped and handed in to the society.  The society can then refuse to pay benefit for a least a month.  That is to say, the cards must be in the office at least a month.</P>
    <P>One can see how that can work against the employed contributor, the insured person.  It may take a fortnight or three weeks or a month from the time the person falls sick until the machinery of the Insurance Commissioners secures the stamped cards and another month may follow before benefit is paid to the insured person.  The Minister will probably tell me that the loss can be recovered as a civil debt; that the employer can be brought into court and proceeded against by the employed contributor and the benefit secured. But I think it will be in the recollection of some people&mdash;probably it will be in the knowledge of the Minister's Department&mdash;that quite recently certain benefits were lost because a certain employer went bankrupt.  Now, all these people&mdash;his employees&mdash; were entitled to benefit.  The employer was brought into court not on a charge of not stamping his cards but on another charge.  These people lost.  If that can be pleaded&mdash;the failure to stamp cards because of his failure to meet his liabilities&mdash;what is the position of the employed contributor who gets 30/- or £2 a week?  What is his chance of carrying the case to its ultimate issue and securing the benefit?  I think the logical consequence of making the employer stamp the cards is to pursue the matter, and where the benefit has been lost because of the failure of the employer to stamp the cards I think the logical sequence of the prosecution is to secure benefit for the employed contributor.  I ask the Minister to give this matter very <Col N="949" /> favourable consideration in the interests of the employed contributors and in the interests of not a small number of people who have lost their benefits in this way.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Hitherto the Commissioners have not had powers to prosecute for the recovery of contributions except for a period of twelve months.  Section 27 secures powers to the Insurance Commissioners to proceed for the recovery of contributions over an unlimited period.  In practice, the Insurance Commissioners do not desire to go back more than three years in the matter of the recovery of contributions. Under Deputy Hogan's amendment, not only could the Commissioners proceed against the employer for the recovery of contributions which had not been paid, but they could proceed against the employer for the amount that the employee had lost in benefits as the result of the non-compliance of the employer with the law.  The position now is that under Section 40 (1) of the 1918 Act any person can proceed against his employer for benefits which he had been deprived of as a result of the non-compliance of the employer with the Act, or if that person is a member of an approved society and if that person does not himself prosecute his claim against his employer, the approved society can prosecute the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Hogan's amendment seeks to do is to give the Commissioners power in the particular case where the employee should have his card stamped to proceed against that person's employer for his failure to stamp the card in cases where the employee will not himself proceed against the employer.  If the employee belongs to a society which itself will not take advantage of the powers it has of proceeding against the employer for the recovery of the benefits that person should get, had he been insured, the Deputy's amendment gives power to the Commissioners to step in and <Col N="950" /> proceed against him.  And all that is for the benefit of a person who will not himself move in the matter, and who belongs to a society that will not move in the matter of securing him benefit.  That is seeking to give powers to the Commissioners that the Commissioners do not want, powers that the Commissioners will not exercise, because they would have to exercise them on behalf of a person who will not go to the trouble himself to seek what is due to him, and a person who belongs to a society that will not trouble to seek what should belong to its insured contributor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): Surely the Minister can visualise cases where a member would not be in the position himself of seeking from his employer the benefits he has lost through his non-compliance.  There are many people who cannot proceed against their employers for the recovery of lost benefits.  Then the Minister makes a good deal of play about belonging to an approved society which will not proceed according to the powers conferred on it by the 1918 Act.  Does the Minister know that it is quite possible that a man would be insured for twelve months and at the end of that time cease to be a member of that society for insurance purposes, and then for the subsequent twelve months might not get his card stamped?  The person has ceased to be a member of the society because he is marked on the books of the society.  &ldquo;Not in insurable employment.&rdquo;  For twelve months after that the man gets no stamp.  The society does not know anything about him, and perhaps they would not accept him at all. Then the contributor has nobody on whom he can fall back.  For various reasons the employed contributor cannot proceed against the employer. Therefore, the statement about the insurance society not proceeding against the employer has no force, and I hope that the Minister sees that.</P>

      <P>I would also press upon the Minister the advisability of accepting this amendment.  It is, of course, very probable that the powers it would give to the Insurance Commissioners would be exercised, if at all, in only a very few cases, but I can see no reason why they should not have the power, and I do not think that the Minister has made any case against giving them the power.  It is probable that in a number of cases employees will hesitate to take proceedings against their employers to recover benefit. It might jeopardise their employment, as Deputy Coburn pointed out, if they did so.  It is possible that such men will have no approved societies to take action on their behalf, and even possible that approved societies will not take action on their behalf, and if there is a clear case of injustice there should be somebody to take proceedings against the employer for the benefit that is lost in consequence of the employer's non-compliance with the terms of the Acts.  I do not think any serious dislocation of the machinery of the Acts would be caused if the amendment were carried. I do not think that the power given to the Commissioners would be even exercised, but I think there is a strong case for giving the Commissioners that power.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section the words: &ldquo;This section shall be held to apply to such debts only as shall be proved to have accrued since the date of the coming into force of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept in principle the idea that those who have failed in their duty to their employees should be pursued and should be made to pay. We are entirely with the Minister and with everybody interested in seeing the Insurance Acts properly worked in so far as that is concerned. But everybody here knows that there have been very considerable complaints in the last few years with regard to the action of another Department of State, the Revenue Commissioners, who are reported, at any rate, as having in many cases gone back six, seven and eight years; and it was with a view to putting a limit to the period of time over which the Insurance Commission might be inclined to go back on people who had neglected their duty in this matter that this amendment was put down. We believe that these people ought to be pursued, but we think that there ought to be a limit to the period of time.  The Minister has said that as the law now stands the Commission has power to pursue people for one year only.  We would have no objection to them pursuing them for two years, but if what happened in the case of the Revenue Commissioners were to happen in the case of the Insurance Commission we think it might lead to great hardship, especially as, in our view, there is a duty on the Insurance Commission and on the Government, as well as on the employer, to see that the law is carried out.  We think that certainly they ought not to go beyond the period laid down in the Statute of Limitations for debt, which is six years, but if the Minister would say that they would not go beyond three years we would be inclined to accept it.  I think two years is what the majority <Col N="953" /> of our people would favour, with six years as an absolute limit, but if the Minister would accept three years we would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>At the present moment the Commissioners like to ask for arrears of contributions after the 5th January, 1925.  They have no legal powers to seek for any more than twelve months.  I would agree to put in an amendment restricting it to, say, three years, which would then read:&ldquo;This section shall be held to apply to such debts only as shall be proved to have accrued since January, 1927.&rdquo; I am afraid that the Commissioners would rather have January, 1926, but I would agree to take the difference between two years and four years, and to make it January, 1927, if that is generally accepted.</P>

      <P>There shall be added at the end of sub-section (1) of Section 70 of the Act of 1911 the following words, that is to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that if the employer, being a company, fails to pay to the Insurance Commissioners any sum which it has been ordered to pay under this sub-section, that sum or such part thereof as remains unpaid shall be a debt due to the Insurance Commissioners jointly and severally from any directors of the company who knew or could reasonably be expected to have known, of the failure or neglect to pay the contribution or contributions in question, and proceedings for the recovery of the said sum summarily as a civil debt may be commenced at any time within twelve months from the date of the order for payment made on the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> This amendment is intended more or less to safeguard insured persons whose employers fail to pay their contribution.  It is with a view to making personally responsible directors who know, or who perhaps have reason to know, that such contributions are not being made to the insurance fund.  I think it is only right that in such cases the persons responsible should be made to pay the contributions of their employees in the event of anything happening to the undertaking in which they are engaged.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that there is some confusion with regard to this amendment.  It refers to Section 70 of the Act of 1911, but that Section has already been repealed, and there is probably some confusion between Section 70 and Section 69. Perhaps the Deputy would withdraw this amendment, and I would look into it further before the Report Stage, because if he wishes to help the employee to recover from the employer benefit that he might have been deprived of by reason of the employer's non-compliance he will require an amendment of Section 40 of the Act of 1918; but if it is simply a question of contribution it will be to Section 69 of the Act of 1911 and not Section 70.  If the Deputy would see me we might get clear as to whether this is a question of contributions or benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 23 to insert before the word &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; the word &ldquo;administration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has reference to the audit of the accounts of insurance societies. I am informed that it would satisfy the Insurance Commission if they were restricted in this matter to the administration accounts, but I do not know whether that is correct or not. But at any rate the approved societies say that if this amendment were not adopted their proceedings would be hampered, that they would be tied up in many cases where they have liberty at present.  Under the present regulations the management committee of an approved society has certain latitude in giving benefits to its members.  They inquire into them, and the people concerned are usually well known to them, and where they know there is special need they often grant special benefits. They now feel that if this regulation is passed they will be held very strictly to the wording of the Act, and they will hesitate very much before granting anything that might be held by the auditor to be outside the strict limit of the law. They think that it will crib, cabin and confine their efforts to relieve persons who are sick, and that all <Col N="956" /> that is necessary for the Insurance Commission would be the administration accounts, which the societies are quite willing to have scrutinised. In fact, all the accounts are scrutinised in the fullest way, but they do feel that the latitude that they are allowed in deserving cases will be denied, and in fact they will not be prepared to take a risk in these cases.</P>
    <P>Very often when an official knows that a particular case is in special need the Committee take the chance and grant a little extra relief out of their funds.  They claim that they ought to be entitled to do that without the risk of a surcharge.  If the regulation stands as it is at present they will feel in every case that they cannot be more generous, by giving an additional shilling or two shillings, as the case may be, to certain deserving persons.  As a rule they are not over-generous, I understand, but I do not think that it can be denied that they are careful in the management of the funds.  They claim that they have this liberty at present, but that it will be now taken from them.  All that is necessary, they say, is that the administration accounts should be subject to the right of surcharge.  Of course, they are responsible if any funds are maladministered, and if there are any defalcations, and they have no objection to a surcharge in that case.  It might reasonably be held by the auditor that they had gone beyond their power in giving a shilling or two shillings extra to some deserving person, but they think that it would not be wise to have approved societies subject to the risk of surcharge because they were a little more generous than the Act allows.  Many people who have spoken to me are of opinion that the insertion of the word &ldquo;administration&rdquo; before &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; would cover all that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had cases where a clerk of an approved society writes bogus cheques for maternity benefits one after another over a particular period, and so pays <Col N="957" /> out under the heading of &ldquo;maternity benefit&rdquo; a sum amounting to a couple of hundred pounds under circumstances where the secretary signed the cheques.  There were defalcations of that kind going on.  If we accept Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, we will not be able to surcharge the secretary of such a society owing to whose gross negligence the clerk was in a position to steal a certain amount of money. Take a case like this, where the secretary of a society goes to a trustee with a cheque for £500 and says: &ldquo;I want more money for benefits and I want you to sign this,&rdquo; where the trustee signs it and where the secretary takes the £500, which is put to certain uses and is never heard of again.  If we accept Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, it would be impossible to surcharge that trustee. You might put the person who got the £500 in jail, but you could not recoup the money to the society by way of a surcharge.  There is no question of in any way interfering with the discretion allowed in the matter of such payments of money as the Deputy spoke about.  Very often cases arise in which the societies have difficulty in deciding whether payment should be made. They submit the facts to the Insurance Commission, who give permission for such payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference in Section 1 (2) of the Schedule provides power for remittance of a surcharge on the part of the Commission, so that all that is desired is to have power to surcharge where there is gross negligence or misconduct.  I submit to the Deputy that the benefit funds of the societies require to be guarded, quite as much as the administration funds&mdash;they require to be protected against gross negligence or misconduct on the part of people who have to deal with them.  I submit to the Deputy that there is no danger such as he suggests, and that we should take steps to safeguard, by the powers of surcharge, not only the administration funds of societies, but also their benefits which are, perhaps, in greater danger of being <Col N="958" /> eaten into by gross negligence or misconduct.</P>

    <P>if he has had fifteen or more completed, years of actual service, seven years shall be added thereto,</P>
    <P>if he has had ten or more completed years of actual service and less than fifteen years of such service, five years shall be added thereto,</P>
    <P>if he has had five or more completed years of actual service and less than ten such years, three years shall be added thereto.</P>
    <P>3.  No person transferred to the service of a council or committee under the provisions of Section 22 of this Act shall, without his consent, be by reason of such transfer in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his or her service as a whole (including tenure of office, remuneration, pension or superannuation) as compared with the conditions of service formerly obtaining with respect to him or her.  If any person so transferred is, without his consent, in any such worse position as aforesaid by reason of such transfer and has thereby suffered any loss or injury, he shall be entitled to be paid out of the Insurance Committees' Officials Compensation Fund such lump sum as would reasonably compensate him for such loss or injury, the amount of such lump sum to be determined by the council or committee, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the House accepts the motion which the Minister for Finance has moved, I think that some consideration should be given to the speech which the Minister made in winding up the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill. There was something in that speech which would be possibly generally acceptable to most parties in the House.  There was, for instance, his statement that &ldquo;I for my part see no reason at all why we should obstruct or in any way hinder or make difficult the action proposed to be taken by the British Government in paying that extra amount.&rdquo;  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have no objection whatsoever to the British Government <Col N="963" /> making any donation or payment by way of extra allowance they may care to do or they may feel bound to do to those who were formerly members of their Civil Service in this country and helped them to carry on their administration.  The relations between these two parties are really no concern of ours, and if the British Government outside this House, and without imposing any obligation on this State wishes to pay that extra compensation, we, on this side of the House, have no objection. However, it seems to us that the Minister's speech left a number of points very doubtful and very obscure, and we are anxious, before the Bill gets any further and before the Money Resolution relating to it is considered, to have those points cleared up.  For instance, he said (column 667, volume 32):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Incidentally, I am quite satisfied that this particular case, although we did not set out to destroy the appeal to the Privy Council by means of it, has in fact finished the appeals to the Privy Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;it is no longer a question of getting the British Government to agree to kill appeals to the Privy Council.  It is only a question of getting them to agree to give the corpse a decent burial.&rdquo;  If that is the case I think that we ought to permit the British Government to discharge that necessary and sanitary function of giving the corpse a decent burial.  The only way we can permit them to do that is by signing its death certificate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister will say in this Dáil that in giving effect in this Bill to any agreement he made with a section of the Civil Service in this State he does not in any way accept the decision of the Privy Council in regard to the matters in the Wigg and Cochrane case which was referred to them, then I think he will have gone a long way towards clarifying what is at present an obscure position and will, I admit, go a long way to satisfy some of our objections <Col N="964" /> to the Bill&mdash;not all of them. Possibly we would still have an objection based on Section 14.  But, so far as the main purpose of the Bill is concerned, if the Minister will definitely state in this Dáil that henceforward there will be no appeals carried to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by citizens of this State in relation to matters arising in this State or in relation to matters in which the Government or the Executive of this State is concerned, then I think that one of our major objections to this Bill will be removed.  The Minister in speaking to the Bill was rather optimistic in regard to the position of appeals to the Privy Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 formally confirms the agreement interpreting and supplementing Article X. of the Treaty, which is based on this Bill.  As I indicated on the Money Resolution, we should like to have some definite declaration from the Minister for Finance as to whether that agreement is, in fact, based upon the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; whether we are to take it that the fact that he has entered into such an agreement with those who were parties to the appeal to the Judicial Committee is an indication that he does accept and feels himself bound by the decision.  As I was saying, when the Minister was speaking in relation to this matter on the Second Stage I thought that he took rather an optimistic view of the present position of appeals to the Judicial Committee.  He stated that the judgement which had been delivered in this case had occasioned such denunciations, even in the British Parliament, that the Judicial Committee has received a shock from which it will never recover.  He went further and said that the result of the blunders committed has been to bring the question of appeals from this country to the Privy Council to an end.  I should like to know whether we are to take that as a definite indication of the Government's future policy in this matter, because, strange as it may appear, there are people on the other side who do not think that the question of appeals to the Judicial Committee has been settled either by the statements which the Minister has made in this House or outside it or by the agreement which has now been entered into.  For instance, I notice that in the House of Lords to-day Lord Danesfort has given notice that he will on Wednesday, 13th November, raise the question of the Free State Copyright Preservation Act and its bearing on appeals to the Privy Council.  Therefore, as I said, this matter is not nearly so dead or so dormant as the Minister led the House to believe when speaking on the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been our intention, if we had been so permitted by the Chair, to introduce into the Bill a Preamble which would definitely clear away the ambiguity and doubt which now exist.  That Preamble would have made it clear that in introducing the Bill the Minister was in no way questioning or accepting any disclaimer that the Supreme Court of Saorstát Eireann had not on the 1st day of April, 1929, in the case of Wigg and Cochrane finally determined the meaning and interpretation of Article X. of the Articles of Agreement, and that this Bill was being introduced altogether independently of any decision which the Judicial Committee had given in the matter.  That is the position which we would like to see the Minister take up.  It is the position which we had hoped to offer him an opportunity of taking up, but, unfortunately, in this matter the rules of order were against us.  However, the Minister is not bound by the decision of the Chair, which I do not for one moment contest, that <Col N="969" /> a Preamble of the nature which I have indicated would be out of order, and he himself might even now, I think, by leave of the House, or upon the Report Stage, introduce such a Preamble to the Bill as would clarify the uncertain position.  Unless, however, the Minister does indicate his willingness to introduce such a Preamble, or to agree to accept it, we on this side of the House will have to vote against the adoption of Section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister is absolutely averse to a declaration of this particular kind being put in the Bill?  As Deputy MacEntee has said, it has only been suggested for the purpose of making his position clear as a responsible man who, having made a definite and important statement, honourably stands over it.  Is the Minister averse to that action being taken? He undoubtedly could facilitate the House in so doing.  We, unfortunately, are not in the position of being able to make clear, to those who will look at the records of this House for the purpose of finding whether our Ministers are men of their word or not, that the Minister for Finance in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was intending to tell the truth when he made a certain statement and, having made it, was prepared to go through with it and see that it was the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that this Bill does not, in fact, carry out the intention of the Minister.  It is quite possible that in this Bill of interpretation in interpreting Article X. in precisely the opposite way to which our courts have decided it should be interpreted, that the Minister's intention is not being carried out.  I am prepared to give him credit for that.  The Bill may have been badly drafted.  There may be lapses in it of one kind or another. It may not be clear in its purpose, and if the Minister wants to make good on that we are prepared to help him.  The matter in a Bill, in a case of this kind, is something distinct from the intention of the Bill.  If the intention of the Minister is to be <Col N="970" /> straight, then the matter of the Bill can be put right.  But if the intention of the Minister is to be crooked, then the matter of this Bill fits in precisely with his intention.</P>
    <P>I take it that when the responsible Minister of a Government, functioning willingly and consciously under the Treaty, said in relation to the decision of a court, which was contemplated in that Treaty, that its decisions did not concern him, that he was not interested&mdash;and these are very remarkable words&mdash;when he said that he meant that he was, in fact, repudiating the authority of that tribunal, or he might say that he only meant that he repudiated the authority of that tribunal when it did not agree with him.  Is that the position he is taking up?  Remember this is a Bill of interpretation. Its matter is entirely distinct from that.  What is his interpretation? Is his interpretation intended to be the interpretation of the Saorstát High Courts?  If it is, this Bill is a fraud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  As I understand this particular section, it is a definite repudiation of the previous declarations of the Minister. That is sufficient reason to reject <Col N="971" /> this particular section.  The operative matter of this section is repudiation of the authority which the Minister had previously claimed for the Saorstát High Courts.  The matter of this particular operative section is an acknowledgement of the over-riding authority of the Privy Council in this matter, which the Minister had specifically repudiated. Now that may not be the intention of the Minister.  This simply may be a foolish Bill instead of being a conscious, a frigid and calculated lie.  It may only be a mistake.  The Minister has the power unless he is forbidden by a higher authority than this Dáil to whom he submits this Bill, and to which in submitting it, he pretends to be submitting it to a sovereign authority, so to alter the Bill that it will make clear that whatever may be in the operative section of the Bill nothing in the operative section of the Bill is to be taken as a repudiation of the authority of the Saorstát High Courts or an acknowledgement of the overriding authority of the Privy Council over the Saorstát High Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why would he not do it?  Because <Col N="972" /> he will not do it, and because he will not do that we must take it that the actual matter of this operative clause is his intention in the Bill; that he intends this Bill to be fraud; that he intends every Cumann na nGaedheal member who goes into the lobby to openly and consciously stand over a deliberate, cold and calculated lie.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House are not quite happy about this section.  The conditions required in order to meet the compensation or the awards of the Board will have, in the first instance, to be provided out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  Originally it had been our intention to amend that.  We wish that the Oireachtas should only be directly responsible for awards granted on the basis of the Treasury minute of the 22nd March, 1922. That, I presume, would leave the Minister free to make some other arrangement than that here indicated with the British Treasury for the payment of any balances which might be due and awarded on the decision in the Wigg-Cochrane case. We submit, in view of the statement of the Minister that he has no objection to the British paying certain moneys in any way that they wish, and in view, as he said himself, &ldquo;that we see no reason at all why we should obstruct, hinder or make difficult the action proposed to be taken by the British Government in paying that extra amount,&rdquo; that such machinery should have been introduced into this Bill as would make it quite clear, over and above <Col N="975" /> the schedules, that the extra moneys were being paid by the British Government.  As it appears to us at present, the first responsibility for paying the extra moneys is put upon the Exchequer of the Free State and not upon the British Government. If, at any time, the British saw fit to depart from, or to dishonour, the agreement embodied in the schedules this House would still be responsible for finding the moneys on the decision in the Wigg-Cochrane case. We on this side of the House are not prepared to accept that position.</P>

      <P>The Government of the Saorstát is the Government which now deals with those persons who were transferred to it as civil servants.  It pays their pensions, and the only convenient system is that the one authority should pay all the pensions and receive the receipts, the receipts indicating that the person was still alive, and all that sort of thing.  In the contingency that Deputy MacEntee mentioned, if the British for some reason at a future time dishonoured their agreement. then it would be quite easy for the Oireachtas to take the steps that would be necessary to relieve us of any liability, beyond the liability which is now fundamentally ours.  It would be quite easy to pass an amending statute paying out no sums to these civil servants except the sums for which we ourselves were entirely responsible.</P>

      <P>I can see the difficulty in the way of providing these extra moneys.  For one thing, there is an objection on the ground of principle of having our citizens in receipt of moneys from another Government and paid direct.  In view of what the Minister has said, that the responsibility is fundamentally ours, would he pledge himself, in the event of the British at any time in the future dishonouring the agreement included in the schedule of recouping to the Free State any extra money that may be payable by them in respect of awards based on the Wigg-Cochrane case in relation to <Col N="976" /> these cases, to introduce an amending Bill to bring this Act into accordance with the position which he himself first took up here when the decision in the Wigg-Cochrane case was announced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the section is, as I tried to point out on the Second Reading, to secure that the civil servant who has been transferred will not be prejudiced by reason of the transfer, and that he will continue to hold his office after transfer on the same terms and conditions as he held it before transfer. With reference to the amendment which was put down by Deputy Thrift, that does not mean that all allowances are to be stereotyped. For instance, travelling and subsistence allowances are relatable to facts which may change.  That applies to hotel costs and things of that sort.  The civil servant who has to travel and who was entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances is guaranteed that.  In being guaranteed the same terms and conditions <Col N="977" /> as before he is guaranteed travelling and subsistence allowances, but he is not guaranteed these at the old rate.  As a matter of fact, we have revised travelling and subsistence allowances, and should a fall in the cost of living occur to the extent of, say, 25 per cent. it is almost certain that there would again be a revision of travelling and subsistence allowances.  I am clear in my own mind that when a civil servant is guaranteed the terms and conditions that he had previously he is guaranteed when he has to travel a fair subsistence allowance and travelling allowance.  I do not think that civil servants who have been transferred have any reason to fear unfair treatment by this or any Government that may succeed it, but the fact exists that civil servants have expressed fears, and in order that these fears may be allayed the whole matter is put down here in as much detail as anybody could expect. There is nothing provided that the civil servants were not getting before, and there is nothing that indicates any view that was not already taken by the Wylie Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil servant is guaranteed that he will continue to serve under the same terms and conditions as before.  He is not guaranteed that he will be protected in case of misconduct, or anything of that nature. He is liable to dismissal if guilty of any misconduct, and transferred civil servants have been dismissed for misconduct, but if he gives good and efficient service he is given a guarantee that he will continue to serve on the same terms and conditions, including salary and superannuation rights, as before.  The point has been put forward that though the civil servant is given the same salary as before he was transferred, he might be given work which it was not reasonable to expect him to do.  It is here provided that if a civil servant is given work which is not analogous to the work he had been performing, or which is an unreasonable addition to his duties at the time of his transfer, he <Col N="978" /> is to be regarded as a man who is being discharged.  That appears to be reasonable.  Let us suppose, as an example in the nature of a caricature, that a man who is a clerical officer, in addition to doing his clerical duties, is asked to wash the corridors and the front steps every day, or something of that nature, that would be an unreasonable addition to his duties.  What the section means is that if anything of that kind were done the civil servant could come before the Board, and, if the Board were satisfied, they could hold that he was being discharged, and he would be entitled to discharge terms.  Similarly, if the Board holds that owing to changes in the conditions of his employment the position of such an officer has been materially altered to his detriment he can retire.</P>
    <P>Again to take an example in the nature of a caricature, it might be possible for a Government, if unprincipled enough, to say, &ldquo;We will give you the same conditions and hours of work and salary as before, but though you are a clerical officer you are to come in at 9 o'clock at night and go out at 5 in the morning.&rdquo; If the Government were to do something so unreasonable as that, the man could go before the Board, and, I presume, the Board would take the view that he was entitled to discharge terms, and he could regard himself as being discharged and get conditions accordingly. To come to the terms of promotion, the object of the provision in regard to promotion is to make it perfectly clear that a man does not lose his right by accepting promotion. The Government might take the view that a transferred officer was entitled to all his rights as before so long as he remained, say, a clerical officer but that if he was promoted an executive officer he lost those rights, because he was no longer serving in the employment in which he had been transferred.</P>
    <P>This section makes it clear that if a man were promoted to the position of, say, an executive officer and if his conditions of duties were then <Col N="979" /> unreasonably altered, the mere fact that he accepted promotion would not prevent him from being able to go before the Board and claim that he was entitled to discharge terms. It is indicated here that promotion means increase of salary or promotion in the ordinary course and not some promotion that really means an entirely new appointment.  It seems to me that what is guaranteed here to transferred civil servants is entirely reasonable.  They are guaranteed nothing that is unreasonable. While I myself do not believe that it is necessary that these guarantees should be given&mdash;I do not believe that any Government here would act unfairly&mdash;nevertheless, there is no harm in giving such guarantees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself unable to accept the position as outlined by the Minister for Finance, because my difficulty is that these civil servants have had seven years and were originally granted, I suppose by reference back to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, seven years in which to decide whether they could safely entrust their future careers to the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  They had seven years within which to make up their minds that they could be confident that they would be fairly treated by that Government.  So far as I can see, the purpose of the clause is to extend the period more or less indefinitely.  I do not think that we are entitled under the terms of the Treaty to do that.  I think, in view of the experience which these officers have had and the manner in which they have been treated by the Executive Council, that there should not be any unreasonable uneasiness in their minds, and I do not think that we are entitled to go out of our way to deal with an irrational and unreasonable person.  The fact that we are extending this permissive period, as it has been called, indefinitely is a concession which might ultimately react disadvantageously to the State as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that at some future date the whole Civil Service <Col N="980" /> system will have to be very searchingly examined, if only to satisfy the public mind on one or two matters.  There is a general belief that the service is inefficient and unduly costly.  If it is only to satisfy the general mass of taxpayers that such belief is not well founded there will have to be a very searching investigation into the whole Civil Service of the Saorstát.  Suppose such investigation were carried out and, as a result, that certain recommendations were made which would affect every one of these transferred officers, what would be the position of the Executive Council of the day in regard to recommendations made by such a commission?  It may be that fully ninety-five per cent. of civil servants would have secured vested interests under Section 14 and the day of reform would be put back indefinitely until even the young men in the Civil Service had become patriarchs before you could carry out substantial reforms, if such reforms were found to be necessary. I am not quite certain that civil servants as a whole are not being granted even further concessions by having the period of retirement extended.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, if these men under the original position had not retired within seven years they would have no rights under the Treaty to any extra consideration whatever, because there was nothing in the Treaty which bound the Government of the Saorstát to set up such Civil Service Commission as was contemplated by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  Therefore there would be no body, such as a Civil Service Committee, which would permit them to retire.  Therefore there would be no body in consequence of whose permission to retire a civil servant would be entitled to have an extra period of ten years added to his actual service for the purpose of calculating a lump sum gratuity and an annual pension allowance.  So far as I can see, and I have studied the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and the Treaty very carefully, the effect of Section 14 is to confer the benefits <Col N="981" /> and advantages of the Eighth Schedule of the Act of 1920 upon a large body of civil servants who, because of the fact that they did not within seven years exercise their right to retire under the Treaty would not be entitled to the rights under the Government of Ireland Act.  That is a very serious matter, and I would like to have the position in that regard clarified very much more than it has been up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is anything more that I could add.  These people were entitled to this treatment if they were subjected to an unreasonable addition to their duties or required to perform duties that were not analogous.  Deputy MacEntee talks about the future and the way in which the hands of the Government would be tied.  I am perfectly satisfied that if it were not perfectly clear now that men in the future would not be left without protection we would have at present a very large number of retirements from the Civil Service.  I am, of course, aware that the striking out of this section, so long as the agreement and Section 8 of that agreement stand, would not carry us anywhere, but if we were to strike out any provisions protecting civil servants against unreasonable alterations or additions to their duties and requiring them to discharge duties that were not analogous to those which they discharged at the time of their transfer, there would be a great number of retirements from the Civil Service.  Statements like that which Deputy MacEntee made would be taken much more seriously than perhaps they deserve to be taken.  They would be taken in the way of a threat, whereas nothing in particular might happen even if Deputy MacEntee were on the front bench on this side of the House. They would, however, be taken seriously, and there would be retirements on a considerable scale.  I am perfectly satisfied, even if we could remove any reference to these things from the agreement and from the Bill, that the position would be <Col N="982" /> that there would be substantial and immediate loss.  I am not satisfied that there would be any gain at any time in the future.  Deputy MacEntee stated that civil servants had seven years in which to decide whether they were safe or not.  They might say that we had not Deputy MacEntee for seven years in the Dáil making this threat.  You cannot say to people, who entered the service of another Government with certain prospects before them and who were transferred to us carrying certain rights, that they should be deprived of those particular rights by mere lapse of time.  This simply gives a guarantee that fair treatment has not only been given to them up to the present, but that it will be continued to be given to them so long as their service lasts. Very much more, as I say, would be lost than could possibly be gained if we were to become free, as I do not think we could, to do anything at all we liked with transferred civil servants after any period from now on.</P>

      <P>I am very diffident in following the Minister because it is quite obvious from the speech he has just made that no matter how one tries to approach a question like this, no matter how impartial and judicial one wishes to be, the Minister is sure to distort one's word.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything in the discussion that could be construed as a threat.  I carefully avoided anything which would indicate that we were pre-judging the position in regard to civil servants. Some of us have come in contact with civil servants in the course of our duties here and we have certainly found that they have been efficient and hard-working, possibly very much more efficient and working much harder than they would in private employment.  We do say, however, that there is a certain impression abroad and that it may be found <Col N="983" /> necessary, even for the benefit and the advantage of the civil servants themselves, to have such an inquiry into the present administration as will satisfy the people of the country that the services are not being extravagantly or inefficiently administered. That is as far as I go, and we are not pre-judging the issue one way or another.  So far as safeguards are concerned, if the attitude of civil servants towards the chief Opposition Party in the House is such as the Minister indicated, then I say that this Bill affords them no safeguards whatever. If we did intend to deal with civil servants unfairly or inequitably, or without due regard to their previous conditions and terms of service, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent us doing that.  If it were brought in in order to reassure civil servants against such fears, there was no warrant for introducing the Bill beyond the fact that the Minister, for some reason or another, possibly because he yielded in the first instance to pressure which had been brought to bear on him from other sources, possibly outside the State, was compelled afterwards to capitulate.  He yielded in order to get himself out of the difficulty in which he had placed himself and the Executive Council by the declarations he had made in the Press and elsewhere in regard to the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  When the body of civil servants found him yielding to the unwarranted and unjustifiable pressure brought to bear on him. they themselves brought pressure to bear on him and he, as on another occasion, capitulated.  That is really what I believe is at the back of the section.  If the Minister had been firm in the first instance, if he had stood firm in his declarations regarding the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, I believe that Section 14 would not have to be retained in the Bill.  He yielded to blackmail in the first instance and he is yielding to it now again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not admit that there have been already scandalous retirements under this clause regarding analogous duties? Will he not admit that men of 40 years of age have been able to claim pensions of £400, simply on the plea that the duties allotted to them were not analogous to those they were performing already?  If he says that there is going to be no change now, is that likely to prevail to the same extent in the future?  Is it fair that any section of the community should be treated like that?  It is not fair even to those who are getting pensions, because it has happened to a Deputy in this House that a civil servant is haunting, so to speak, his door, asking him is there any work he can get, as he feels so miserable from being idle&mdash;a man enjoying a pension that is more than the allowances to a Deputy, and a man younger in years considerably than the average Deputy.  Is it right, I wonder, that the representatives of a not very wealthy community should be asked to sanction privileges of that kind for a particular class of people?  I said on the Second Reading that I did not think it was fair to civil servants, and I still think it is not.  We must take it that the provisions of the Bill will be explained all over the country. It is not at least going to make civil servants appreciated if it is felt that the Government has had to make such terms with them in order to secure their services.  I think the Minister is unwise to press the section in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not materially alter the position.  It only makes clear and explicit what was there.  The civil servants were entitled to terms not less favourable than the terms of the Act of 1920. These had included the right to discharge terms when their duties were unreasonably altered.  This section makes that clear in certain respects where it was not so explicit. Deputy MacEntee says that he made no threat.  There is no doubt that he said very little on the point, but <Col N="985" /> what he did say is the sort of thing that would be taken as a veiled threat.  I am absolutely clear about that.  As I said, I do not want to be taken as putting it offensively when I say that undue weight would be attached to his words.  They would be thought to imply a great deal that perhaps they did not imply.  Undoubtedly the effect of words like that, if we had no provision in this Bill and if we were, in fact, by deleting it, casting doubts on the position, would be that we would have retirements, and, I think, retirements on a substantial scale, that would cost a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee said that if a Government got into power which was determined to treat civil servants very unfairly no Act would stop them.  That is perfectly true, if you had a Government that was going to go all-out in the matter, but the protection that civil servants would have is not protection from big and sudden attacks on their rights, but from insidious, undermining attacks or from attacks on individuals of small classes, by imposing new duties on them or by serious alterations in their positions and rights.  As a matter of fact, I think that is what a Government might do if a Government were going to be unfair&mdash;make one small alteration after another in the duties of civil servants.  This section would prevent that.  That is the sort of security that a civil servant has in a section like this.  If the Government is going to attack these rights of the transferred officers, it must come out and repeal the section.  It must decide to go the whole hog.  It must decide on going the whole hog.  Deputy Moore said something that I did not think was entirely relevant to this point about civil servants having retired and being sorry for it.  That is so.  But we are not really dealing with retirement cases, but we are dealing with discharged cases&mdash;not people who decided to go out when they got a chance of getting a pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the right of retiring was abused.  I believe a great many people alleged they were retiring because of the change of Government when, in fact, they were retiring because of the opportunity they had of getting a pension. It was, in many ways, unfortunate for the State that this was so.  A pensions bill was heaped up because this right was given to retire following a change of Government. That did heap up the pensions bill. In a great many cases people retired for that reason.  We are not dealing with them now.  We are dealing with cases where the Board will take the view that the man has been forced out, that he was suffering those unreasonable conditions; that, in fact, he is being discharged, and we are insuring that a man who might be forced out will be treated, if the Board believes he is being forced out, as being discharged.  I believe there will be a very small number indeed of cases occurring under this. Very few people will be affected because, I assume, from the operations of the Wylie Committee, that reasonable changes, though they are to the disadvantage of the civil servants, will not be accepted as grounds for discharge.  For instance, civil servants were required, shortly after I became Minister for Finance, to come in half an hour earlier in the morning.  They went before the Wylie Committee and they were turned down.  The view that the Wylie Committee took was that small alterations of one sort or another might be made.  It did not mean that you could not touch the Civil Service.  There had to be something that did substantially affect the position.  I believe that very little will come of this at all.  I could not give the Deputy the figures he asks.  I am perfectly certain that if we could not have produced a Bill which was agreed to by the representatives of the transferred officers as this Bill was&mdash;they accepted all <Col N="987" /> sections of it&mdash;a very large number of retirements would have taken place before now &mdash; retirements which will not take place at all.</P>

Then there is a sum invested under the Act of 1869 which provides an income of £845 3s. 6d., which is available for the maintenance of national monuments.  That money is invested under the Act of 1869; so that at present there is available a sum of £2,845 3s. 6d. The amount therefore that is likely to be expended under the new Bill while it cannot be estimated is not likely to be very large.</P>

      <P>While on this section, I would like to say that there was a certain amount of discussion during the Second Reading in favour of a limitation of the definition of an archæological object.  With that criticism I am rather inclined to agree. Deputy Cooper has an amendment down at a later stage which is somewhat to the same effect&mdash;limiting the effect of that definition in another way.  On the Report Stage, I will probably introduce an amendment limiting the definition of an archæological object to objects that have not been introduced into this country within the last 300 years.</P>

    <P>shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems almost impolite to interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary's monologue, but I will not follow his example by reading this amendment, which is perhaps a new section.  I think it would be best if I were to indicate to the Committee the differences between my proposal and those embodied in the Bill.  To begin with, the Bill says that any find of an archæological object must be reported within seven days.  It is possible that a man might find an archæological object, the value of which he might be more or less ignorant of, and he might wish to have time to consult the parish priest, or some other clergyman, or a schoolmaster, or somebody better educated than himself.  You cannot expect a man to leave his work in the middle of the week to find somebody who would be able to tell him what it was.  He might leave it until after Sunday, or he might not be able to find somebody to advise him.  I do not think that there can be any objection to fourteen days.</P>
    <P>My second difference is that instead of reporting the find to the Gárda Síochána he should report it to the National Monuments Advisory Council.  I saw yesterday <Col N="998" /> that the Commissioner of the Gárda attended a meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  I am thinking of founding a society for the prevention of cruelty to the Gárda Síochána.  I do not know if Deputy Fahy will act as vice-president.  But they are being overwhelmed with duties that have nothing to do with their own work, and acting as a recorder of ancient monuments is not part of the ordinary policeman's duty under normal conditions.  I think it is probable that the National Monuments Advisory Council will set up sub-committees in the different counties.  I hope it will.  It seems to me that the most effective way of working would be to find in each county four or five people who are interested in archæology and to get them to act, and I would have no objection to adding the words &ldquo;or any sub-committee thereof&rdquo; to the amendment.</P>
    <P>My third point of difference to the Bill is that a person becomes liable to a penalty if he fails to report the finding of an archæological object without reasonable cause.  At present there is no discretion in the Bill at all; if a man has found a thing, it does not matter if he does not know that it is valuable, it does not matter if he cannot read or write, the District Justice is bound to convict him.  My amendment would make it possible for the District Justice to take these facts into consideration&mdash;the fact that he was ignorant and could not read&mdash;and if he was satisfied that the man had no malice aforethought and was not trying to conceal his discovery but merely acted out of ignorance he could allow the man to escape a conviction.</P>
    <P>My fourth point of difference from the Parliamentary Secretary is this: the Bill says that information must be given to the Gárda Síochána and to nobody else.  That seems to be rather a drastic proposal.  You must not tell a lie or give false information to the Gárda Síochána, but if the Professor of Archæology in University College or the Director <Col N="999" /> of Antiquities in the National Museum goes down you can tell him as many lies as you like, and there is no redress, unless the Parliamentary Secretary takes the precaution of enrolling these gentlemen in the Gárda Síochána before they are sent down.  My amendment proposes to substitute for the Gárda Síochána the National Monuments Advisory Council or any person or persons authorised by the Minister.  He has it in his power to authorise the Gárda Síochána or a member of the Gárda Síochána if he wants to, but if he does not want to, he can authorise an archæologist.  I think on these four points the amendment is something of an improvement on the proposals in the Bill, and I think the amendment would mitigate what might be a hardship, not perhaps an enormous hardship&mdash;I do not want to exaggerate&mdash;but still a hardship on a man who was not very well educated and not very conscious of the value of what he found who might be punished under the section as it stands.  I therefore suggest that this is a proposal that the Dáil and the Parliamentary Secretary might reasonably accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Cooper in substituting fourteen days for seven.  As regards reporting to the National Monuments Advisory Council instead of to the Gárda Síochána, I think there are difficulties.  In any case, &ldquo;or any member thereof&rdquo; should be added if Deputy Cooper's amendment were to be taken instead of the proposal in the Bill.  But even with that addition we do not yet know, for instance, that members of that Council would be in any county, not to speak of any barony, and a person finding an object might not have a member of the Advisory Council within thirty miles of him, so that even the fourteen days suggested by Deputy Cooper would not then be sufficient.  You would not ask a man to travel twenty-five or thirty miles to report such a thing.  There would be no objection to putting in &ldquo;the National Monuments Advisory <Col N="1000" /> Council, or any member thereof,&rdquo; or the Civic Guards in the local barracks. But I think that the Civic Guards should be left in as well, despite the fact that it might put some extra work on them, and that Deputy Cooper is so concerned about cruelty to animals or humans. Incidentally, I hope he will be with me in preventing cruelty to animals in another Bill one of these days.</P>

      <P>I desire that this section shall be as useful as possible, and I am criticising it rather with a view to finding a wise solution.  I think seven days is better than fourteen.  My reason is this: Many of the objects about which we are concerned are very fragile, very destructive, will disappear in a day or two, some of them in hours.  Small silver urns and things of that kind will perish in a very short time.  If we are to wait fourteen days until information is given about them they might be washed away by the rain.  That is my fear, and there are grounds for that fear.  I would like to illustrate that by just one instance from a list I have got of what my informant calls acts of vandalism that have occurred quite recently. Talking about Mayo, he said: &ldquo;Scores of the numerous eiscirs in Co.  Mayo are being excavated at present for road material.  In these are found both boulders for crushing and sand for finishing the surface of the road.  These dry, sandy ciscirs were a favourite place of interment for our pagan ancestors. Knowing this, I asked an official of <Col N="1001" /> the Mayo Co. Council who superintends gangs of workmen if graves were ever found during the excavations. `Yes,' he replied, `graves containing bones and little cups. `What happens then?'  I queried. `Oh, they are shovelled out with the rest of the material,' he answered. And his gang is only one of many such.&rdquo;  That is the danger of waiting. Information should be handed in at once and you should make a responsible man like a farmer, who does realise that these are ancient objects, or at least that they are not modern objects, give information of a discovery to an official whom everybody in the county knows, that is a member of the Gárda Síochána.  I do not know whether it will be possible&mdash;it will certainly take some time&mdash;to establish sub-committees of the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council, and certainly it would be very hard to advertise the presence and address of any of these in every neighbourhood in the twenty-six counties.  On these grounds I think that the section is really better than Deputy Cooper's proposal.</P>
      <P>There is one suggestion that Deputy Cooper made that I think should be accepted, that is, that we should incorporate the words &ldquo;without reasonable cause.&rdquo;  Of course you can quite conceive that a workman might often in ignorance not realise that he had made a very important find, and I think the District Justice could reasonably forego punishment in a case of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to support Deputy Cooper and Deputy Fahy in the matter of fourteen days, rather than seven days, because an instance came to my notice where men discovered objects of archæological interest and did not know what they had found. For example, there is at present a shrine in the Museum which was found in Lough Erne by two fishermen. One fisherman suggested to throw it overboard again as he thought it was a little box.  It was what was called the domhnac.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Probably Deputy Alton is acquainted with it.  Only that one of the fishermen happened to be a little more enlightened than the other it would probably have been thrown overboard.  They decided to bring it to a local archæologist, who bought it for 15/-.  There are times when a man may not realise within seven days that he has got an object of archæological interest, whereas someone might come along afterwards and tell him that the object was valuable.  Within the fourteen days' period he might, perhaps, see somebody to whom he could report the find, while he might not be able to do so within seven days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Cooper and Deputy Fahy with regard to extending the period, but, at the same time, there is a great deal of weight attached to what Deputy Alton said.  However, in most cases I think it will serve the purpose of the Bill if we extend the period to fourteen days, and I am willing to meet Deputy Cooper that far.  As regards the other point of reporting to the Advisory Committee rather than to the Gárda Síochána, there are many difficulties in the way. That is the method adopted in the Northern Ireland Act, but in that case the Advisory Council has much wider and stronger functions than under this Bill.  They have got executive and administrative functions, while the Office of Public Works there has no function at all. In this case, the Advisory Committee merely advises the Commissioners of Public Works, and as the Commissioners have nothing at all to do with archæological objects, there would be no point in reporting to the Advisory Committee.  If the report was to be made to anyone it should be made to the Minister for Education, or better still, to the Keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum.  In order to meet Deputy Cooper in that respect I would be prepared to insert a provision that the report should be made either to the Gárda Síochána or to the <Col N="1003" /> Keeper of Antiquities.  That would be the most direct way of reporting it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other points about leaving some discretion to the District Justice and adopting the words &ldquo;without reasonable cause,&rdquo; that is a matter I would like to consider further, and perhaps on the Report Stage, when dealing with the whole section, I may be able to give a more satisfactory explanation of the line we will take on it.  I do not know what the consequences would be if it were inserted now, so that perhaps the Deputy would withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret to find Deputy Alton so inconsistent, as I have always admired him for his consistency. Deputy Alton has, on various occasions, suggested that this Dáil ought to pass an Act similar to the Act passed in 1926 in Northern Ireland.  The provisions of this amendment came straight from that Act, yet Deputy Alton now says that it is not satisfactory, although I believe he told us that it was working admirably on more than one occasion.</P>

      <P>I beg Deputy O'Connell's pardon&mdash;there is one here.  As regards Deputy Fahy's point, the Parliamentary Secretary has made a point about the Advisory Council here.  In Northern Ireland the Council has a representative in every county, and while it might not work here, I am quite prepared to take the Parliamentary Secretary's half-way house.  He has told us nothing about paragraph <Col N="1004" /> (b) of sub-section (2) of the amendment empowering any person authorised by the Minister, not merely the Gárda Síochána, to put questions or to receive information. I think it would be a great pity if an official of the Office of Public Works, or a strange archæologist, were to go down the country and then to find that he was deceived, or humbugged, because he had no power&mdash;not being a member of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;to take action.  I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the Parliamentary Secretary will consider it before the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 23 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where it appears to the Minister on a report made by the Advisory Council, or otherwise, that any object which in his opinion is of archæological, cultural, historic or artistic value is in danger of being exported from Saorstát Eireann, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a prohibition order) prohibit the export of any such article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> (2)  Any person who exports or attempts to export or sells for export any object in respect of which a prohibition order has been issued and is in force, in contravention of this section, shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may at any time, by order made after consultation with the Advisory Council, revoke any prohibition order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My amendment is really an alternative to Section 22, and perhaps, with the leave of the Dáil, it would be convenient to discuss the two together, because if Section 22 stands my amendment is quite useless. The proposal in the Bill is that anyone who wants to export an archæological object must write in and get leave to do so.  Of course, that is founded on a belief that is deeply rooted in the Civil Service. Civil servants spend a great proportion of their time writing letters to the outside public and to other Government Departments.  They are admirable letters; they will in time be classified as archæological objects, because no one in future will understand why people began and finished letters in one language and had another language in the middle. There is matter in that for a long and serious controversy.  But civil servants, being so immersed in correspondence, cannot realise that people in the country have anything else to do but to write letters to Government Departments.  The contents of their post-boxes probably makes them think that.  I must say that there are people who have other things to do than to write letters to Government Departments. My suggestion is that instead of writing letters every time you want to export an archæological object the Minister should have power to prohibit the export of any article <Col N="1006" /> that is considered valuable to the country.</P>
    <P>I daresay a great many of these things which Deputy Alton is deploring while they may be archæological in value are not things that would be very valuable.  There are probably a great many specimens of them in national collections already and there is no great reason why they should not be exported.  I have purposely made a wide definition, in fact it is open to the criticism that it is too wide, giving the Minister power to stop anything of real value to the country going out of it and that is all that is needed.  He has power to stop not only things of new discovery but things of old discovery. I have in my hall the horns of an Irish elk.  My hall was thoroughly looted and the only things not taken away were the horns of an Irish elk which I suppose were too big to take. They are not very rare.  I do not know why, if I wanted to, I should not have the right to export them or why I should have to write to the Minister and ask him.  If he knew that I had the horns of an Irish elk he would probably issue an order of prohibition under this section.  I think anything increasing the amount of letter writing which means a burden on the Civil Service and leads to Deputies making speeches stating that there are too many civil servants and too many salaries paid should be checked, and if everybody who wants to inspect an article which comes under the wide definition of archæological which Deputy Murphy has now discovered writes a letter to the Department you will have an increase in staff.  I commend this to the House with some faith but not with much hope.</P>

There is one ancient monument&mdash;I think every member has found it, I found it anyway when I came in here&mdash;and I suggest that we give a special permit for its exportation, that is the ancient monument <Col N="1007" /> outside the door.

      <P>I think Deputy Cooper's amendment draws the line rather tight, and I am more inclined to agree with the paragraph as it stands in the Bill, because I think it is very desirable that all archæological objects that are connected with the country should be cared for, and that it should be seen that they are not taken out of it.  But then one may have in one's possession things that are of archæological interest and are not connected with this country at all. People who go in for archæological subjects may have in their possession objects of archæological interest that are really not connected with this country at all, and I think that Deputy Cooper's amendment may prevent those things which are not connected with this country at all from being removed from it.  I think it is too tight, and I prefer the paragraph as it stands in the Bill, although dealing with Irish archæological objects it is quite right, on the whole, I think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the wording of the Bill in this section is better than Deputy Cooper's suggested amendment, because it would be very difficult for the Minister to know what articles were going to be exported and so on.  You have not an archæological survey, and we do not know what number of these objects are in the country.  It would be much better to leave the law that when a person intended to export them he should get permission.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to find <Col N="1008" /> out what they intended to export, except he was told by the exporters, and it is easy for them to write and get permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fahy has pratically said what I intended to say on this amendment.  We have no means of compelling anybody to let us know that they have made a discovery or got some valuable possession like Deputy Cooper's ancient elk horns.  Possibly other people may not show the frankness he has shown in this house.  If there were any great value attached to these horns once they were sold out of the country, or once a dealer had come in and purchased them, it would be too late to issue our prohibition order and the only defect I can see, in this amendment is that it has got no power to deal with a dishonest person who is trying to conceal the fact that he has got a find.  It is only going to unduly penalise an honest person who has made known that he has made such a discovery, because this is a much more stringent section than the previous one, as it includes the words &ldquo;cultural and artistic.&rdquo;  It would mean that a valuable picture or a piece of valuable furniture with any kind of association with the country could not be exported if the Minister issued a prohibition order.  In the other section cultural and artistic objects are not at all affected.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Section 2, I intend to introduce an amendment with regard to the definition of archæological objects which will considerably narrow it down and there is no danger of objects which are not of particular Irish interest being affected by it once that amendment has been accepted, if it will be accepted.  I really think the section is much better as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's point about articles of furniture has, I think, strengthened my case.  There are articles of furniture which might well be considered archæological objects. Suppose that chair in which the <Col N="1009" /> Ceann Comhairle is sitting was discarded by some future Dáil, it should not be allowed to leave the country or be allowed to lie amongst the refuse of an old clothes shop. It should be placed in the sanctity of the National Museum.  I think articles of furniture might very well be prohibited from export.  At the same time, when both front benches are against me, I know I am probably right, but that I have no <Col N="1010" /> chance of carrying my point. Therefore, I will not press my amendment on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Bill.  The matter with which it deals has been the subject of discussion, I think, on several occasions in the Dáil, and has been the subject of discussion on a couple of occasions by the Public Accounts Committee. Military service pensions are awarded following an investigation by a committee which was set up under the Military Service Pensions Act to determine the services of the applicant.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General reported that he had not been allowed to examine the documents on which the decisions of the Board of Assessors were based. As I said, the Public Accounts Committee discussed it, and finally it was promised by the Government that the matter would be regularised and the dispute brought to an end by legislation.  The Bill deals with one or two subsidiary matters, such as defining rank and the question of double pensions, but the main subject-matter of the Bill is this question of the proceedings and the awards of the Board of Assessors. In my view, it was never intended that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should examine the evidence on which the awards of the Board of Assessors were based.  The Minister was given by the Act really no discretion in respect of this matter. It was not intended that the Minister who finally gave the pension should himself examine the evidence on which years of service were based, nor should he have any access to the evidence.  The applicants who came forward were promised that the evidence submitted by them would be kept secret.  I think that was necessary and that it was proper that that matter should be confidential.  It relates to times of disturbance and of ill-feeling, and a great deal of damage might be done if it were possible at this time of day to have publicity given to statements that are to be found in the evidence submitted by people in <Col N="1012" /> support of their claims for military service pensions.</P>
      <P>It would be quite impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to come to any conclusions on the files merely because the Board of Assessors was in fact a court.  It heard oral evidence and examined written evidence.  It had particular qualifications and knowledge.  It weighed the credibility of witnesses in the way in which it could only be weighed by a court which had actually heard them.  The object of this Bill is to put those awards of military service pensions by the Board of Assessors on the same basis. vis-á-vis the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as awards of the court.  If money is paid out following an award by a court&mdash;a high court or a circuit court&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot examine the merits.  He cannot go behind the award of the court.  The intention of the Act&mdash;I have not any shadow of doubt, nor I do not know whether any doubt is felt in any quarter&mdash;was that this Board, of which a District Justice was made chairman, should hear verbal evidence, examine the written evidence submitted, and take into account all the factors of the case, form their own views of the credibility of any witness and the admissibility of any testimony, and then come to their finding.  It was intended that that finding should not be reviewed by any person but the Board of Assessors, and that there should be no submission of the documents to any person outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will prevent further references to the Public Accounts Committee and discussions and disagreements that may take place in the Dáil.  One can quite admit that it is not desirable that special committees like this should be set up and should be given, vis-á-vis the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the position that the ordinary courts have.  But the work it did arose out of an abnormal and difficult period. It was a kind of work that we all hope will not have to be repeated. The need for such investigations will <Col N="1013" /> not arise again.  It was the only sort of tribunal, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the other members of the Government, that could have been set up and that could have satisfactorily decided the issues that were put before it to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance certainly gave no good reasons to the Dáil why it should pass this Bill.  If we pass this Bill we are certainly setting up a new principle in ordinary administration. According to the laws as they stand, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is supposed to audit the accounts of the Departments of the Government. That has been the case up to now, and the Minister is asking us to agree to his proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not examine the accounts of one of these Departments.  This particular Department is subject, and the Minister must know it, to great suspicion throughout the country. Everything that they have done in connection with it creates more and more suspicion.  When we asked for a list of the names and addresses of the pensioners, we were given a list of the names, but no addresses.  We were given several hundred names for each of the counties, and, as anyone knows, there are several Paddy Murphys and Johnny Murphys, and it is impossible for anyone to find out who exactly the pensioner is who is getting the money.  We got a list of names, and we tried to find out who the people were whose names were given, and very few of the people who went through the Volunteer movement in the different counties knew them.  There were some names that were known throughout the country, and when we started to question ourselves as to whether or not these people deserved a pension we found in a great number of cases that they were awarded pensions for service that they had never given, and that Ministers must have known perfectly well they had never given. <Col N="1014" /> Take, for instance, one name&mdash;Seán O Muirthille&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot discuss names here.  That cannot be done under this Bill.  If you discuss one name you can go into the whole work of the tribunal. The question at issue is whether the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to have access to the files, not whether we are now to do the work which the Comptroller and Auditor-General might do in certain circumstances.</P>

I only want to give the Dáil one or two instances which we have to prove that assertion.  Otherwise, how is the Dáil to know?  We make a general statement and we want to prove it.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy think the limit should <Col N="1015" /> be, therefore?  How many cases should we discuss?  What the Comptroller and Auditor-General does in the case of an audit is to check the accounts, but he does not turn down anybody.  He brings to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts such things as he deems ought to be brought to their attention.  When the point is put to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee have power to go into the whole question and make a report to the House.  I take it what Deputy Aiken is desirous to do now is to do here, with regard to certain persons, the work which, if the Comptroller and Auditor-General had made a report to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee of Public Accounts might do.  If this debate is going to be a debate in which every Deputy who has an opinion with regard to a pension is going to state his views of the pensioner's rights under the Act, then the House will be asked to decide questions which it is not fitted to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that you stated the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General quite correctly in relation to military pensions. I think the one point that was at issue between the Public Accounts Committee and the Tribunal was the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was denied access to the papers upon which the Tribunal had made its awards and that, consequently, he could not bring before the Public Accounts Committee any individual case in which he thought that the award had not been made in accordance with the Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not saying that the Ceann Comhairle has made any statement different from what he has stated himself now.  The Deputy has not indicated that what the Chair has said is different from what he said himself. The Deputy began by saying that the Ceann Comhairle did not <Col N="1016" /> correctly represent the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle stated with reference to something said about the Comptroller and Auditor-General turning down particular cases that it is the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, when he examines files or evidence of any kind which he gets or seeks for, to bring matters which he considers necessary to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee, but that he does not himself disallow pensions.  Of course, I am aware that the whole point in this Bill is whether or not the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to have access to the files.  If the House decides that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to have access, then the particular investigation may begin.  But the point would appear to me to be that the House cannot carry out the investigation which, in certain circumstances, in a particular state of the law, the Public Accounts Committee might carry out.  That is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

If that is the case, surely in fairness to those who believe that such finality should not be given to these findings, we ought to be able to cite cases where the findings have not been made in accordance with the Act, or where the awards have not been justified by the facts.</P>

We can prove, according to the Act, that pensions have been granted to people who are not entitled to them.  We can also say that this is brought in in order to regularise that and to prevent any inquiry by anybody into the administration of the Act.</P>

      <P>I thought we got as far as that.  Suppose for a moment that it was necessary in order to prove a case against this Bill that cases should be brought forward. The particulars of these cases can be given from the personal knowledge of members of the House, but unless the name to which that case refers is disclosed to somebody it is impossible that this case can be tested and, therefore, there must be <Col N="1018" /> somebody to whom that name can be given.  Now whether this name is to be given to the Minister for Defence, to the Ceann Comhairle, or to somebody else, if the cases are to be decided the name must be disclosed to somebody, and if we are not allowed to disclose the name to somebody we are inhibited from putting forward the only absolute proof that can be put forward against the Bill.  That is the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out, bearing out what Deputy Flinn has just said, that we cannot give the addresses because we have not been provided with them.  We are not allowed to use the names; we have merely a number of names of men and amounts in bulk, and there are so many pensions of the same amount that it would be impossible even to specify any particular case by the amount, so that we have neither the names nor the addresses nor the amounts.</P>

      <P>That there should be a number of cases clearly identified and discussed in the House?  I want to get this quite clearly, because I have made up my mind as to what I think would be reasonable on the Bill.  I know the difficulty there is and I want to meet the difficulty to the fullest possible extent.  Deputy Carney's point is that the name and particulars may be given by any Deputy regarding a particular person enjoying a pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is: Pensions are paid as a result of a certain Act.  The amount of the pensions paid to certain <Col N="1019" /> individuals is based upon certain specific service.  Now there is nothing in the Act which suggested when it was passed through this House that in the awarding of these pensions the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be precluded from examining into the cases to make sure that they came within the Act, as he does in the other pensions Acts.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General demanded the records; they were refused to him.  It has come to the knowledge of many members of this House that there are numerous cases of individuals receiving pensions for services not provided for by the Act, and also individuals receiving pensions in excess of what they are entitled to under the Act according to their service.  The giving of the names of individuals is one difficulty, but could not the Ceann Comhairle suggest that a Committee of this House should be set up to examine the names that would be submitted, and if it was then found that our contention is correct, something could be done.  The difficulty is that if Deputies are precluded from proving cases they have in mind, how is the House to know whether their contention is correct or not?</P>

      <P>Say you take a specific case, that some Deputy from his own knowledge put forward, where a man is in possession of a pension that he is not entitled to.  Unless the Deputy is in a position to disclose the name of that man, then every other man receiving a pension in circumstances merely analogous to that is likely to be branded for that particular fault.  I think that is a perfectly serious and definite cause of complaint.</P>

      <P>I applied some time ago to the Minister for Defence, through a question in this House, and I got a written reply, but in the reply it was stated that So-and-so received a pension of so much, and that he resided in Cork.  Cork is a very big county, and it did not state whether he resided in North Cork or South Cork or East Cork or West Cork, or Cork City.  The information given was deliberately misleading.  It is very hard to find out whether the individuals of whom we are suspicious are in the list or not.  We have a very definite knowledge that a number of individuals are getting pensions although not entitled to them by any stretch of the imagination. We can give definite cases if the Minister wishes.  I think we are at least entitled when we ask for information in this House to get correct information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is quite clear that the view of the Public Accounts Committee was that the payments made up to the Comptroller and Auditor-General's reports <Col N="1021" /> were issued were not properly made in law under the interpretation of the Act that made it possible to pay pensions.  If, therefore, this Bill is brought in for the purpose of legalising payments already made under that Act, it is proof clear that this House is now asked to regularise that position.  Therefore, I contend it is open to any Deputy&mdash;although I do not intend to do it&mdash;to cite a particular case in reference to A or B, or Murphy or McCarthy, as the case may be, to show that the Act was not interpreted in accordance with the intentions of those who voted for it at the time.</P>

Now, since not only members of the Fianna Fáil Party but other Deputies in this House feel that that power should not be given to the Board of Assessors, and in order to prove that it should not be given to the Board, as many members as care to cite cases where the findings have not been in accordance with the facts ought to be able to cite them&mdash;that is to say, as many cases as are necessary to prove the contention that the findings of the Board of Assessors should not be final and conclusive should be cited to this House.</P>

      <P>The Committee is therefore of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken to remove this anomalous position and to regularise the audit of expenditure, amounting in a normal year to about £147,000, arising from the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924 and 1925.</P>

      <P>First and foremost, there is no statement in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee that certain payments were illegal.  That is to say, the House is not confronted with the <Col N="1023" /> position in which a Committee of the House has stated that it is the opinion of the Committee that of a number of payments made, some payments were illegal.

      <P>I am aware of all that.  What I want to get clear on is that the House is not confronted with that position.  I want in the first place, during the debate, to keep the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and of the Public Accounts Committee absolutely clear, because the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee are two institutions.  I do not want them to be brought into the discussion so that they would in any way be injured. The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, therefore, are to be kept quite clear, and statements must not be attributed to the Public Accounts Committee which that Committee did not make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is not all the same.  I gave some consideration to this question before.  The Military Service Pensions Act was passed by the Oireachtas for the purpose of awarding pensions to certain persons fulfilling certain conditions.  It was apparently considered, when the Act was passed, that it would be difficult to determine what persons were eligible for pensions under the provisions set out in the Act.  The point at issue in practically every case was pre-Truce service.  It is well-known to everybody that to determine the question of pre-Truce service is, to say the least of it, difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If they made inquiries they would have found it possible in more cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas, therefore, passed an Act, and under that Act set up a tribunal for the purpose of making these investigations. Thus apparently neither House of the Oireachtas was regarded as the best body to conduct these investigations.  Points of order have been made this evening which included statements such as that Deputies could prove particular things.  From the point of view of the Chair, all that means is that a particular Deputy thinks that he knows facts, and thinks that when he has stated his view of the facts that they will be clear to all reasonable people.  All our experience disproves that.  One Deputy said that the cases could be tested here in the House. That is precisely what the House cannot do.  It cannot test cases in any way, nor can we have&mdash;it was stated that we could&mdash;persons, particulars <Col N="1025" /> and facts.  Particulars and facts simply mean that a Deputy will rise in his place and, taking the case of an individual, will make a number of statements which may include accusations against that individual which nobody in the House may be in a position to rebut.  Even if any person in the House endeavoured to rebut them it would lead to no conclusion.</P>
      <P>The whole question of Military Service Pensions rests entirely upon the existing Act under which a tribunal was set up to decide the vexed and difficult question of whether a person had service and, if he had, what was the extent of that service.  That is the whole point at issue.  The tribunal made certain recommendations and pensions were paid.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, without making any reflection whatever on the findings of that tribunal, simply stated the fact that he was not in a position to audit these accounts because he had not received the evidence which the tribunal had before it.  That is the sum total of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's intervention in the matter.  It has been contended, or perhaps it has been established, that there is, in fact, a doubt under the terms of the 1924 Act as to whether or not the Comptroller and Auditor-General has the right to inspect these files.  This Bill is for the purpose of establishing that he has no such right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill goes further than the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It makes the findings of the Board of Assessors final, conclusive and binding on all persons whatsoever.  It makes the Board of Assessors the absolute authority in this matter.  The point for the House to decide, and the point upon which the House, I think, is entitled to have evidence, is as to whether the Board of Assessors, constituted as this Board was, is a proper authority to be vested with that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was <Col N="1026" /> contended that the tribunal had powers to come to final decisions. The position of a Deputy opposing this Bill has to be considered.  He has to make the case that the files, in fact, ought to go to another authority.  The only other authority is the Comptroller and Auditor-General. In making his case, the Deputy naturally desires to tell the House that in his view the pensions have been awarded under circumstances which merit review.  That is the point Deputy Aiken and other Deputies want to make.  Looking at it from that point of view I think Deputies must be allowed to say that within their knowledge there are people receiving pensions who ought not to have them, but I do think that I must adhere to the ruling I have given on a great many occasions. namely, that the case of an individual should not be put, by name, before the House.  If that were allowed, Deputies might state in the House, under cover of the privilege of the House, anything that they chose about an individual.  That, I think, would be a grave injustice to the individual concerned, and I do not propose to allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it ought to be possible for those who are opposing the Bill and who desire to make that argument, which I consider a relevant argument, to select one, or, at most, two responsible Deputies to make a case and put to the House a number of instances, without mentioning names, where they say they have evidence and where they know that the circumstances are different from what appeared in the awards of the tribunal. That is what, in my judgment, ought to be done, but it is impossible to conceive of a debate here in which every Deputy would be free to get up and say what he considered to be the facts about individuals. That would be unprecedented. A Deputy making a case will call it a statement of facts, and another Deputy will call it quite a different thing.  I do think that those who are opposing the Bill should have an opportunity of putting before <Col N="1027" /> the House in some coherent and related fashion their views as to groups of cases or of particular cases.  But not with regard to named individuals, and not by the process that has been quite clearly suggested, that every Deputy will rise in his place and give the House his view of a certain set of facts.</P>
    <P>That would lead us nowhere only into an enternal wrangle and which might result in grave injustice to the individuals concerned.  We must decide the question without doing that.  I do not know anything better that what I have suggested&mdash;that the case should be put by one or two Deputies in as clear a fashion as may be and without naming the persons concerned, although some of the cases will be clearly identified.  I do not think that sitting here to-night we are able to decide whether a particular individual took part in an ambush or not, which is the point in many of the cases.  I do not think we could decide that, and I think it would be foolish for us to endeavour to decide it.</P>

      <P>I am not going to mention any particular name.  According to the Act, a person who has taken part in the 1916 Insurrection gets a certain calculation for service. If it is within the knowledge of a member of the House that a person is in receipt of the maximum pension for service which includes insurrection service, and that it is within the knowledge of that member of the House that the individual in receipt of the pension was not in fact in the country at that period, what is the position?</P>

If any fresh matter came out the Board could be reconstituted if necessary.  If we have an award showing that an individual got a full pension for 1916 service and it could be proved that he could not possibly have given 1916 service, then we have material for taking the matter up.</P>

      <P>It is a very difficult position.  Some of the other Deputies who have raised points of order may be under the impression that it is the business of the House to decide whether an individual had pre-Truce service or not. It is not the business of the House to do that.  It is impossible for the House to do it, and the only way in which I can suggest that the case can be made is by having a case presented, not seriatim by each Deputy but by cases being collated in a particular way and presented by a particular number of Deputies up to a certain point.  I do not wish to prevent the particular argument being made that pensions have been awarded to people who should not have got them, because that argument is relevant, but I do wish to prevent our having an inquest on particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme which I have devised is, it seems to me, the only one by which we could satisfactorily deal with the matter.  If Deputies are prepared to deal with it in that particular way, I think they could <Col N="1030" /> get some time to enable them to do so.  The same point arises in regard to the Board.

It is the business of the Chair to see that Deputies get the best facilities possible but not on the basis of mentioning a limitless number of cases.

I do not see how anyone can make a case against this Bill unless he can say here in this House that the Board of Assessors have not acted in the way in which honest men would be supposed to act, and can bring forward cases to prove that that is so.  Here we are asked not only to give legal sanction in the future, but to give legal sanction to actions which the Board have already done in regard to these pensions.  We do not for a moment agree that the Board of Assessors was a board that should command confidence.  Definitely on that Board there were two men who were simply toadies of the Government, men who would do anything they were told, and who had been known to do whatever they were told by the prime movers in <Col N="1032" /> the Government before.  The whole atmosphere about the Bill goes to prove that these pensions are not given as a reward for past military service, but rather in the hope of future political service for the Cummann na nGaedheal Party.  When they wanted to examine who were supposed to get pensions, who should get pensions for military service in the past, they put on two political hacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>At present we have a Board which, I suppose, if the Government lasts long enough, will give pensions in future.  I, for one, am not convinced that that Board is going to come to its decisions strictly on the grounds as to whether men gave sufficient military service or not.  I believe that the Board will be influenced by considerations as to whether or not a man would in the future give political service to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I am convinced of that.  So far as we can make out, the list of people who receive pensions bears out that statement.  You have men who were terribly, desperately wounded turned down because they were opposed to Cumann na nGaedheal, and men who we know did not give the service that they were supposed to have given got fine fat pensions and fine fat jobs.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that we are not to give names. <Col N="1033" /> Really I cannot see for the life of me the justification for that ruling, but we have got to accept it.  It is one of the obstacles that we have got to get round or got to get over as best we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one gentleman I know on the list of pensioners, and I am absolutely certain that he did not give the service he is supposed to have given.  If a Committee of this House were set up to hear evidence we could bring evidence and convince the Committee, if they were men who could be convinced, that is, if they were not men of one political view who were determined to act in accordance with the instructions of Ministers, no matter what evidence came before them.  Not only has this House been refused an opportunity of hearing these cases, but the people throughout the country who have to pay the piper are not allowed to know for what money is being spent.  Surely the people who pay rates and taxes have a right to know how their money is being spent.  Here we have a sum of money, £159,000 a year, spent on military pensions alone and being distributed throughout the country by agents of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, while the people of the country do not know who they are. We asked for their names and addresses. We were refused their addresses. We know that a number of Paddy Murphys in County Cork and a number of Johnny So-and-Sos are getting sums ranging from £10 to £350.  We do not know who they are and we are not allowed to find out.  It is almost impossible to make a case against this Bill if we are precluded from bringing forward concrete evidence as to the illegal payments which the Board of Assessors made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have the impudence to come along here and ask <Col N="1034" /> the Dáil to legalise what could really be termed fraudulent payments up to this date.  Why on earth should the Comptroller and Auditor-General be refused admission to see the evidence upon which these pensions were assessed?  Surely to goodness the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to be a man who could be trusted to see the evidence. If the people as a whole are not allowed to know who are getting pensions, surely to goodness the man appointed by the Parliament selected by the people ought to be allowed to examine them on their behalf.  It is a most dangerous principle for members to agree to, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not have power to examine all the records and the accounts of a Department of the State.  All the Comptroller and Auditor-General can do is to look down the list he gets from the Board of Assessors and see that the payments made are in accordance with the list.  He is not allowed to go further and see whether that list has been duly drawn up in accordance with the Acts passed by this House.  We believe that he has a legal right to do that and that the exercise of that right was illegally refused to him up to now.  The Dáil is here being asked to legalise illegalities that the Government have practised up to now.</P>
    <P>I suppose that when we cannot discuss what is in the Bill very well, we will have to go ahead and discuss what is not in the Bill.  If there is one thing that I would like to see in this Bill, it would be a clause prohibiting the payment of pensions to people who are resident outside Ireland. There is no other Government in the world that would allow such a thing.  I do not see why we, a poor country, should be paying pensions to people who are earning money all over the world.  The American Government, which has so much money at its back, refuses to do it, and a person receiving a pension out of public funds there has to <Col N="1035" /> reside in American and spend the money that he receives there.  It is absolutely ridiculous that we should be paying such an enormous number of pensioners and have them spending their money outside.  The Lord knows it is bad enough to be paying people money that they never really earned or that they were never promised. It is bad enough to be paying men who are going round idle, or only doing political work for Cumann na nGaedheal, but it is even worse to be paying them and allowing them to spend their money outside the country.</P>

      <P>Deputies on this side of the House, I admit, are at a disadvantage, because we were the losers, and what is being decided now is the division of the spoils.  It is a well-recognised fact that the spoils go to the victors.  I do not personally complain about that, but I think that the rules the House has drawn up for the division of the spoils should at least be kept.  I asked the Minister whether he has made any effort to get evidence as to the statements made in claiming pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act.  I do not remember what answer he gave, but I understood that there was no determined effort ever made.  I know that I have been available for the last five years since I got out of jail, and people who were in the battalion to which I belonged have got pensions.  I was quite prepared to give first-hand evidence as to whether these people belonged to it or not.  As a matter <Col N="1036" /> of fact, I believe that in a few cases I did.  Deputy Aiken referred to a particular case.  I am going to state the details of a certain case without mentioning the name.  It may enlighten members as to what is being done, and as to the efforts made by this tribunal to get evidence corrobo rative of the statements made by these people, or to see if they are true.  These details concern one particular individual.  I can give the dates too.</P>
      <P>I happened to be in charge of a battalion in Co. Dublin, and an effort was being made to extend the organisation of the I.R.A. in that particular area.  In one part of that area, very near the city, we were hard up for men who would be capable of taking charge of a company. There was one particular man whose name now appears on the list of pensioners.  I will give you the amount he received, but I will not mention his name.  He had a sum of £836 9s. 2d. handed into his fist, and a pension of £78 15s. awarded to him. I found it very hard to get a company working in that area, probably due to the fact that we had not men really capable of taking charge. This man had been arrested on suspicion by a Sergeant Dunney in the Tallaght area.  Anyone who was active in the Dublin area knew him. I found there was nothing wrong with this individual after he was let out, and I went down to interview him.  I knew he was a pretty able man.  I am sure of the date, because it was on the Friday that Macready went to the Mansion House to discuss terms.  An ambush took place on the Naas road that very day, and the shots were being fired while I was speaking to him.  I asked him if he would take charge of the company. He hesitated, and finally I could not get any good out of him. He told me to come back the next week and he would give me an answer.  On the following Monday the Truce was signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I went back to him I went to the O.C., Dublin, to see if it was advisable to take people of that sort <Col N="1037" /> into the I.R.A.  He said: &ldquo;Oh, yes. We can put them on the run anyway if the Truce is broken.&rdquo;  That man was very near the statutory date at any rate.  The 11th July was the date.  He might say it might have slipped his memory, and that it was only a few days afterwards, but a few days made all the difference in the world in that case.  I was not in jail when that man's case was decided, and I was quite prepared to give evidence.  I would not have given evidence while in jail, but I was quite prepared to give it after I came out.  He is a fairly young man, and is getting a pension of £78 15s., and he has already got £836.  However, that has been given to people who have no pensions, and I suppose I have no growl about that.  That is only one case.  If my word will not be taken I believe that I could get evidence to corroborate what I say. I think when I happen to know one case of that sort there must be numerous others.</P>
    <P>I cannot say how many people are getting pensions.  We have not got the exact number.  I really believe that there would not be more than 50 per cent. who could properly prove their claim, even under this Act, for a division of the spoils. That is a serious position.  When I am able to state that, and I state it absolutely on my own knowledge, i am sure that there are many other such cases all over the country where people, who dodged the issue when there was trouble, sneaked in afterwards when they could get into an armoured car in order to attack and beat us.  Not only were they paid for doing that, but they got something that they were not entitled to at all&mdash;they got money for fighting against the British.</P>
    <P>I know something about the case that Deputy Aiken wished to raise. That particular gentleman is getting the maximum pension.  That means that he must have given the maximum service.  It means that he must have taken part in the 1916 Insurrection. For one week's service then they got five years added.  I happened to be in Belfast jail at one <Col N="1038" /> time and a man who is still a very high-placed officer in the Free State Army was there too.  Maybe I am wrong about him and I had better not say what I was going to say, because the I.R.B. is still in existence. I am not quite certain about that case and I will not say anything further on that line.  Anyway, at the time I could not speak to him without reference being made to the efforts of that particular individual in stopping the County Limerick Brigade from taking action in Easter Week.  How can it be contended that that individual is entitled to a maximum pension?  There are two cases which it would be well to investigate and I suggest that 50 per cent. of all the cases are on the same basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an important admission when he stated that he had not access to the files.  Seeing that there is no advertisement issued indicating that certain men are applying for military service pensions, I would like to know how are the public to be protected, particularly when the Minister's officials, and especially the Comptroller and Auditor-General, have not the right to inspect necessary documents?  I believe that the information should be made public that certain people are about to apply for pensions and this will give an opportunity for objections to be made.  I do not see how it is possible to control this thing at all under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards publicity and the giving of persons' names, there is nothing in that, because many names have been published in the Press all over the country.  Again, I presume that those gentlemen are proud of their records.  They have nothing to be ashamed of, and I do not see that there should be any objection to publishing their names.  If they are promoted in any service the fact is usually disclosed, and if they get a pension I do not think they have anything to be ashamed of.  I cannot see why there should not be an arrangement for an advertisement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> indicating that Major So-and-So or Sergeant So-and-So <Col N="1039" /> was about to claim a pension for his services.  Anyone who would have an objection to that could come forward. I think that would be a very desirable practice.  We are told here that the Minister has no power to look at records, and the man who should check all public expenditure has been precluded from looking up essential documents; he has been precluded by the Act that is still in operation.  What hope have we for the future when conditions will be made more drastic?  The decision of the Board of Assessors is going to be made binding on everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken referred to this Bill as one means of subsidising Cumann na nGaedheal, and I think there is no doubt whatever about that.  It is simply a device of the Government to keep in this country a well paid organisation so that they can call up the members of it whenever they want them.  They have them in every constituency and they actually have them in this House. There are people here who are getting military service pensions.  Some of their services could be called in question too, but we will leave that alone.  They are here, anyhow. There are army pensioners who decide very often what the policy of the Government is going to be.  On many occasions two or three votes decided what steps should be taken by the Government and on the majority side there have been as many as six army pensioners.  Is there any country in the world that would pension people for the amount of service that has been given in this country?  They would in other countries give a lump sum and finish at that, but here the men are given pensions.  These people, for a start-off, were supposed to be volunteers, imbued with the spirit of patriotism and determined to risk everything, even life, for the sake of the country.  We find them now trying to bleed the country white.  Is there any country that would give pensions to people who have actually improved their stations in life since they started in this Army?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I understood that the principle behind a pension was that on entering the public service, either in the army, the police force, or anywhere else, a man more or less handicaps himself for engaging in any commercial work or business or trade, and it is only right, when he has given the best years of his life in a specialised service, that the State would recompense him by giving him a pension.  What do we find occurring?  We find that people who started as dust-bin men&mdash;and I respect dust-bin men, because I would not like a week to go by without my dust-bin being emptied&mdash;drawing pensions of twice the amount that they were able to earn in private life.  In addition to that, I see them getting about £2,000, and that is an absolute outrage.</P>

      <P>I will leave that side of the question.  I do not think I can say a great lot more on the matter, but before the House is asked to agree to this amendment of the Pensions Act the Minister, or someone on his behalf, ought to make a case for it.  The Minister for Finance made no case when introducing the Bill.  It is up to him to tell us why he is willing to tie his hands in this case, and why he is not going to insist that his officer will have the right to see that all public money is spent in the way that it was intended by law to be spent.</P>

      <P>I did not know that. Thank you very much.  If he is the officer of the whole House it is better still.  I hope that we are not going to have the usual argument in this case.  It is up to the Independent Deputies to do something, and particularly Deputy Good, who always complains of having to foot the bill. It is up to people of Deputy Good's sort to insist, before they march blindly into the Division Lobby, that there should be a saving of public money.  After all, if Deputy Good and people like him were saved by these gentlemen, they have been well paid for it.  They were well paid by the Government for any work they did for them.  Deputy Good should say, &ldquo;We paid quite enough for them, and before I follow the Government Whip into the Government Lobby the Government ought at least to put up a good case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister explain to us what he means by the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; in line 11 of Section 4 (2)?  I do not know what he means by the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; at all.  I hope he will explain that.  I have been trying to follow the details of this Bill but I could not make them out at all.  Deputy Aiken said he would like to have something in this Bill dealing with people outside the country who were drawing pensions.  I must object totally to any person getting a pension for the short period of service they have given.  It is simply unprecedented and a scandal.  It is all well and good if you want to divide the spoils to give them a lump sum, but it is a different thing to fasten them on to the community for ever.  I hope there will be a provision in some Bill which will be brought in here preventing Army pensioners from sitting in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The members of this Party who voted for the passage of the Military Service Pensions Act have not, as far as I know, any intention of expressing their regret <Col N="1042" /> for having done so at the time.  Our complaint against the Government is that in pushing that Bill through the House they did so under false pretences. When that Bill was being pushed through this House by the Minister responsible at the time, it should have been made clear that the money that was being voted to pay pensions to those entitled to them would be free from the ordinary inquiries which should be made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General who is answerable to this House for all the moneys expended under the operations of Acts passed by the House.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to quote any speech by him or by any Minister or supporter of the measure which would go to show that it was the intention of the Government at the time not to allow the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have access to any information on his files and any evidence which would satisfy him on behalf of this House that the pensions that were being paid were properly payable under the Act. Further if that was the intention it should have been indicated when the Estimates were being brought in here for moneys voted from year to year; a footnote should have appeared on those Estimates to the effect that the moneys covering the expenditure under the Act were to be free from inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Neither of these things was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I claim that it is right to suggest that when we voted for the Military Service Pensions Act, and for the moneys subsequently brought forward in the Estimates for payment under that Act, it was clear to us at the time, and until quite recently, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had the same powers under that Act as he has under every other Act passed by this House.  I suggest, as a result of that, that this Bill is nothing short of a deliberate attempt to limit the constitutional right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the powers given to him by this House and by the Constitution.  That is a very <Col N="1043" /> serious issue, and that is the reason why we intend to oppose the passage of this Bill.  Coming to the question of the rights of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the reason why he should have access to the files in the same way as he has access to the files dealing with pensions under other Acts, I suggest that it would be quite right for this House to see that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should have these powers of inquiry.  I believe that complaints have been made under this head&mdash; that So-and-so, who is in receipt of a pension under the rank of captain, is not entitled to that grant.  In these circumstances is it not right for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have access to the files and papers and all the information which he could get at to satisfy himself that Murphy or McCarthy was entitled to receive a pension at the rate of so much per year, and that his rank was so and so under the terms of the Act. That was certainly in the minds of every Deputy of this House&mdash;even in the minds of members of the Government who voted for that measure.</P>

He audits the accounts, of course, but I suggest to the Deputy that when that Bill was passed nobody thought he would examine these files and papers on which the Board of Assessors came to a decision. I would like the Deputy to quote anything that would suggest the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is putting upon me the onus that lies upon himself.  The very fact that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is directly responsible to this House, feels that he is entitled to the files and evidence proves that there must be something in the case.  At any rate, that is the basis of our opposition.  I am not going to make a case in this House that So-and-so who has received a pension is not entitled to it.  But the Comptroller and Auditor-General is the guardian of the taxpayers of this country, responsible to this House and to the country for seeing that the money voted by this House is properly expended. On this matter, he is entitled to the same information as he is in the cases of pensions to R.I.C. men or in the case of pensions granted to ex-R.I.C. men under the Superannuation and Pensions Act. As an ex-member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, by bringing to the Minister's notice certain facts and evidence in connection with pensions paid under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, has led to the cancellation of certain pensions.  It was subsequently proved they were not entitled to them.  The same arguments apply with the same force to the case I am now making against this Bill.  Our opposition is a little different from the opposition of the chief Opposition Party, to this extent, that we say that this Bill is an uncalled-for interference by the Government after the passage of three or four years, and is an attempt to limit the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General under the Constitution. It is for these reasons that we are opposing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a case against the Bill which, I think, would hold valid even if every single award of the Board of Assessors was beyond question. There is no doubt that Deputy Aiken is correct when he says that the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act is the subject of a considerable amount of suspicion throughout the country.  That suspicion has been increased by the fact that the Government have introduced this Bill in order to preserve the secrecy of the proceedings of the Board, and to conceal the information upon which their various awards were based.  It is also increased by the fact that they have gone to considerable trouble to conceal the identity of the persons who are in receipt of pensions.  As Deputies are aware, when a question was tabled in the House to the Minister for Defence asking for information concerning the various persons in receipt of military service pensions, a list was supplied that was so compiled as to make it impossible, or almost impossible, to identify any person named in it.  The suspicion is further increased by the fact that the Government have shown that they are anxious to secure that a considerable number of their adherents in this House will be in receipt of military service pensions. As Deputies are aware, at all the recent by-elections the candidates nominated by the Government Party were Army pensioners; in fact it has been asserted that the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal is becoming, to paraphrase a sentence in a famous speech by a famous statesman, &ldquo;to secure that government of pensioners by pensioners for pensioners shall not pass from the earth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin has stated that this Act was passed on false pretences. Now, the Minister for Finance stated that it was never intended that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should examine the evidence upon which years of service were based or pensions awarded.  Deputy Davin has invited him to quote from <Col N="1046" /> any speech made by any member of the Government Party during the debates upon the Military Service Pensions Act when it was going through the House to indicate that that was the intention of the Government. Surely if the Minister for Finance had at that time the idea in his head that the expenditure of the money involved under that Act should not be subject to the ordinary procedure, he would have made that fact clear to the House, or, at least, he would have done as Deputy Davin suggested&mdash;he would have inserted a note in the Estimates every year to the effect that the amount indicated in the particular sub-head dealing with this matter would not be subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Minister for Finance shakes his head.  It is easy enough for him to stand up here now and say that it was not his intention three or four years ago that this thing should be as it was.  But he did not say so then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not contended, and it is not suggested now, that these should not be subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. It is, in fact, intended that they shall always be subject to audit, but it is intended to provide quite a different thing&mdash;that the findings of this Board shall be the same as the findings of a court.  It would have been contrary to any intention we ever had to put in a footnote to say that they were not to be subject to audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the findings of this tribunal were arrived at in the same way as the findings of a court are arrived at this question would not arise.  But the Minister must know that the suspicion concerning the administration of the Act is due to the secrecy that surrounds it.  Deputy Aiken's statement that the desire of the Government was not so much to reward services given in the fight against the British as to ensure the allegiance of a number of useful persons throughout the country to their Party, is generally believed, and if the Government are anxious <Col N="1047" /> to remove that suspicion they will withdraw this Bill and at least provide that some administrative check upon the actions of the Board will exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the case which the Minister made for removing the administration of these moneys from the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is sound.  He said, of course, that damage might be done if information supplied by applicants to the Board were published. Is it necessary that the information should be published?  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General has authority to examine the data upon which the service was awarded and the pension paid he would not bring to the notice of the Committee of Public Accounts any case except one in which he was satisfied that the pension was improperly awarded.  If there are grounds for believing that a particular pension has been improperly awarded, then there is also a case for publishing the fact.  But there seems to be an idea&mdash;I think it is also held by the Ceann Comhairle, judging by a remark he made in the debate on the point of order&mdash;that these pensions are given because an individual here or an individual there took part in a particular operation.  As far as I have been able to understand the Act, the intention was to give service pensions, pensions based upon the years of service, that if a particular individual fought upon the roof of the Post Office in Easter Week he does not get any more years added to his period of service on that account than an individual who fought during Easter Week in the cellars of Jacob's biscuit factory.  It does not necessarily follow that one individual gave better service than the other, provided that each did the duty he was told to do by those who had the right to order.  The same applies to the whole period of the Black-and-Tan war.  It is not the number of nicks on the butt of a man's gun that should entitle him to a pension; it is the service he gave, <Col N="1048" /> and if his commanding officer told him to stand two miles away to watch a certain bridge while an ambush was going on, that man took part in that ambush just as much as if he were working a machine gun. If the pension were properly calculated on the period of service given, then there should be no necessity to have statements lodged with the Board of Assessors as to the nature of the service.  If that procedure were followed there should be no difficulty whatever in having the whole procedure made public and all the information relating to the period of service made available for public examination.</P>
    <P>The Board of Assessors which examined into the various applications for pensions was, as we all know, a partisan Board; it could not be anything else, considering the time and nature of its appointment. It was undoubtedly interested in keeping in the country, and in keeping loyal to the Government, individuals with exceptional influence in particular districts.  The men who constituted the Board must have found themselves subject to considerations of that nature, in spite of themselves.  The very nature of the Board was in itself sufficient to arouse suspicion as to the work done by it.  I have looked over the list of pensioners supplied, and although I knew a very large number of those who were engaged in the Dublin Brigade during the Black-and-Tan period I could not identify, from the information supplied, more than one per cent. of those in receipt of service pensions from the Dublin area.  I was also struck by the fact that the number of pensioners in such counties as Meath is as great as, if not greater than, the number of pensioners in such counties as Cork.  That seems to indicate that some influence must have been at work, either to prevent those who are entitled to pensions from receiving them, or for the purpose of securing pensions for those who are not entitled to them. We all know the history of the Black-and-Tan period; we know <Col N="1049" /> where the fight was hottest, and I do not think that anybody, not even the Parliamentary Secretary to the President, will claim that the Meath Division gave exceptional service at that time.  And yet, because, perhaps, the individual who was in command of the Meath area was also a very prominent member of the I.R.B., we find that a very large list of pensioners comes from that county, much larger than in the case of counties where military service was given to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>I would like also to press strongly upon the Government the advisability of taking steps to ensure that pensions are awarded only to persons resident in the country.  In the present condition of affairs in this part of Ireland, I do not think that we can afford to be increasing our net adverse trade balance by sending pensions to individuals to spend abroad.  There may be some administrative difficulties in the way of providing that all such pensioners shall reside within the country, but if these difficulties cannot be got over in any other way, I would suggest to the Minister that the pensions be paid weekly at the post offices, and that the people in receipt of them get them in the same way as the old women get their old age pensions.  If the pensions were given out in that way those desirous of receiving them would, at least, have to live within the country.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, not relevant to this Bill&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I think also that it is bad nationally that there should be any considerable number of persons in receipt of such pensions members of the Dáil.  I think it is not at all unlikely that this particular Bill will pass through this House with a majority smaller than the actual number of such pensioners in the Dáil, and that is obviously a most undesirable state of affairs.  If there is any truth in the reports which have appeared in the Press that the Government are contemplating making it impossible for national school teachers and dispensary doctors to become members <Col N="1050" /> of this House, there is a much stronger case for making it impossible for army pensioners to be members of this House.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government's own interests and the interests of the persons in receipt of such pensions would be best served by the withdrawal of this Bill, and the giving of a much greater amount of publicity than was given in the past to the operations of the Board of Assessors so that we would know whether there was, in fact, any service justification for the pensions awarded by it.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not favour the giving of service pensions at all.  I think the giving of service pensions to ex-members of the I.R.A. is undesirable.  I think the placing of a cash value on that service is degrading the whole I.R.A. tradition.  I think the Government would have done a much better thing nationally if they had taken the view that the service was given voluntarily, and that no attempt should be made to reckon it in terms of money, for the purpose of rewarding those who gave it.  I know that there are a large number of people who would refuse to accept such pensions. I said before that adequate provision should be made for those incapacitated or wounded, and for the dependents of those who were killed.  I think that should be done, not merely in respect of those wounded and killed in the Black-and-Tan period, but also those wounded or killed in the National Army, or fighting against the National Army in the Civil War period.  But service pensions are undesirable and should not be given. If we are going to give service pensions we should give them in the open.  My case against this Bill, and against the attitude of the Government, is that they are doing this thing in secret, and doing it unnecessarily in secret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to try to stress the point of view that, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I hold on this, as distinct and apart from the view I hold as a <Col N="1051" /> member of this party on this Bill. The Public Accounts Committee view this matter, as I understand it, from the Public Accounts Committee point of view.  The first point I would like to make clear to Deputies is this, that if this Bill is accepted and passed by this House the country will be committed, for at least 40 years, to an annual expenditure of well over £100,000, without knowing whether they are getting a return for the money, even in the shape of compliance with the Act which originally brought about the introduction of military service pensions.  I would like to stress that point for this reason, that first of all we are faced at the present time with a serious situation as regards the expenditure of Government money where it is necessary.  We want to see money spent for the relief of unemployment. It cannot be done because the Government have not got the funds. On the other hand we should be careful, when we are not in a position to meet a demand like that, that we do not throw away money that we need not throw away.  The bulk of these pensioners are very young men.  Their length of life will mean that we will be faced with the payment of these pensions for a great number of years.  If we cannot succeed in abolishing pensions altogether for voluntary service, where people were not even maimed and have lost nothing, we should, at least, see that only those deserving of them in accordance with the Act get pensions.  That is from the point of view of the Public Accounts Committee. I oppose the payment of these pensions because Volunteers were members of the I.R.A.; no conditions were laid down as to future remuneration for past services, and the country is not committed to the payment of these pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the matter, we are asked by this Bill to say that it has been correct all along for the Department of Defence or for the assessors to refuse to give to the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="1052" /> the files containing details of all the cases in question. From these benches we have offered to give details of cases that are being paid pensions outside the terms of the Act.  I say they are getting more than they should under the Act, and I appeal to Deputies in good common sense to insist on forcing the Government to see that these accounts are audited and checked. If the position is regularised in that way we will only be paying pensions to those who come within the ambit of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse what has been already stated by my colleagues in opposition to this Bill. From my knowledge of the Military Service Pensions Act, I am aware that certain irregularities have taken place, and I have been able to identify, beneath all the camouflage, what has actually taken place. As one who held a position as a responsible officer in the I.R.A., I say that there were men who, when we parted from those who had taken up the position of the Free State, when they found the responsible officers gone, made it up amongst themselves to send in declarations, one declaring that the other had been so-and-so, that he had been in the Volunteers or the I.R.A. from 1916, when in reality he had been there only since 1921.  Two officers had to vouch for a certain officer or man, and I have known instances where officers signed a form stating that a man had been responsible for certain things, that he had been in the Volunteers since 1916, when in reality the man had not any service prior to the Truce.  I wish to record my opposition to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding vouching for people who were supposed to give service to the I.R.A., it has come to my knowledge that there is one kind of service put down in these documents as a guarantee that they are entitled to pensions, and anybody in this House who has any common sense will know how widely the term can be used.  That is intelligence work. It has come to my knowledge that <Col N="1053" /> people who were not, or could not be proved to be members of volunteer companies or to have given any active service to the I.R.A. during that period, applied for pensions, and when the people who vouched for them were obtained they fell back on the word &ldquo;intelligence.&rdquo; Of course, I will admit that the Minister or any other body practically is helpless in the matter when you get a man who is willing to tell a deliberate lie, and state that a man was giving information to him in that period, and was acting as an intelligence officer.  The Minister should pay particular attention to that word &ldquo;intelligence.&rdquo;  Anybody who has had any knowledge of the I.R.A. and of the people who are now getting pensions under that head will come to the conclusion that they must have had the greatest intelligence system in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the view expressed by Deputy Davin, namely, that there was no intention in the minds of those who supported this measure that they were handing over to a tribunal the absolute right to determine, without any further investigation of any kind whatsoever, and to decide without any check whatsoever who should get pensions and who should not get them.  The Minister, in reply to Deputy Davin, by way of interruption, said of course they must know that as they were setting up a tribunal, they were giving to that tribunal the powers which he now claims for it. But we have had experience of other tribunals; we have had various tribunals set up to determine the amounts to be awarded under the Malicious Injuries Acts and Personal Injuries Act, and various other tribunals of that kind, and in all those cases the Minister reserves to himself the right to examine the files, although these tribunals were in the nature of courts to decide and make recommendations as to a certain amount that ought to be paid.  The Minister reserves the right to reduce the amount or to refuse in his discretion <Col N="1054" /> any payment whatsoever in the case. He had full right of access to the files and to the evidence, and he could act as he thought fit in the interests of the general taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin made the point and I wish to emphasise it, that even on the assumption that every single one of these pensions was properly paid we would object to the procedure, that was sought to be imposed on the House.  I am not in a position to say whether any single one of these pensions is wrongly paid or not, but so far as my position is concerned that does not enter into it. It is the principle which is sought to be introduced into this Bill which I object to.  The Minister himself has no access to the files.  Even he must take the word of these three. He has no way of checking or satisfying himself even that the award is a correct one.  That is what I understand from him.  He has no right of access to the files except through the Board.  The Board are to say this man AB, is entitled to a pension and the Minister must accept the word of the Board.  Even the Minister himself may have considerable doubt as to whether or not the person concerned is entitled to a pension.  The person who is appointed by this House whose duty it is to see in the interests of the taxpayer that all moneys are properly paid has no right of access to the files, and he will not be allowed to say whether or not a certain person is entitled to a pension.  I have heard the Minister on previous occasions put up the reasons which he thinks are good and valid reasons why there should be no access either on his part or on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to those files, and to a certain extent I appreciate that, first of all that evidence was given that would not be advisable in the interests of the person concerned or perhaps the public interest to have disclosed, but there is nothing which the Minister has said that has satisfied me it is right to keep that information from the one officer who was appointed <Col N="1055" /> by this House and in whom this House has the utmost confidence.</P>
    <P>He might be very well trusted by the House not to disclose or publish anything that should not be disclosed or published, and as Deputy Lemass rightly said, and I thoroughly agree with him, if the Comptroller and Auditor-General is satisfied that evidence has been produced in accordance with the terms of the Act to justify the payment of a pension that case will not be mentioned or brought before the Public Accounts Committee in any way.  If on the other hand he finds a case which is not justified, is there any good reason why that case should not be mentioned to the Public Accounts Committee and the fraud, if there has been a fraud, exposed?  I think that there is a principle being sought to be established here that the House ought to oppose and to protest against in the strongest possible way.  I think the House would be wrong to do anything that would hand over not only to a Board set up in the circumstances in which they were set up but to any board set up in this way the absolute right and power to do just whatever they liked, without any check being provided either by the Minister himself and his Department or by the officer appointed specially by this House.</P>
    <P>It was said that this was a court. It bears no analogy to a court. There is no public hearing of the case, no person allowed who may be able to give evidence against the applicant; no notice given as somebody has already stated, of the fact that a certain person is an applicant for a pension.  It bears no analogy whatsoever to a court in the ordinarily accepted sense of that term.  It is a secret tribunal which can come to a decision, awarding a pension to a person, and that award is never to be questioned hereafter.  I think members of this House would be doing something that would be very wrong indeed and against all constitutional principles if they willingly agreed to give the Minister the <Col N="1056" /> powers which he seeks to establish in this Bill, and I certainly will vote against it.</P>

      <P>There is one point in Deputy O'Connell's speech with which I am in entire agreement, but I am afraid there is only one point, that is, that the Dáil has complete confidence in the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  When he went on to say that the Comptroller and Auditor-General might be trusted not to disclose or publish any information which he received I think he misinterpreted the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It is his duty to publish information he receives.  Moreover, even if he does not publish it in the first instance in his Report on the Public Accounts which is presented to the Public Accounts Committee, he is liable to be cross-questioned by any member of that Committee as to the basis on which he put forward his reports, and therefore it is not a case of giving the Comptroller and Auditor-General information in confidence; information given to him confidentially is valueless.  He must be in a position to produce detailed facts.</P>

      <P>I do not think that that is a correct statement of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's position.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is bound to bring to the notice of the Dáil, in his Report upon the Appropriation Accounts, those instances in which he thinks public moneys are being expended otherwise than in accordance with the authorisation of the <Col N="1057" /> Dáil and in accordance with the law. Therefore, he can only bring before the notice of the Dáil those cases in which public moneys have been wrongfully expended.</P>

      <P>I would accept Deputy MacEntee's definition with one word, that I think, contrary to the intention of the Oireachtas, is what the Comptroller and Auditor-General should report on.  That brings me to the second point of my disagreement with Deputy O'Connell. That is, what was the intention of the Oireachtas at the time the earlier Military Service Pensions Acts were passed?  Deputy O'Connell apparently visualises that these particulars should be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and, if necessary, to the members of the Dáil.  I confess I do not remember him or any of his Party saying so when the Bill was going through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I confess that when this matter came before the Public Accounts Committee in 1927, I was rather amazed to see that we had not raised this matter.  Deputy O'Connell apparently thinks we condoned it by the fact that we did not raise it.  I was inclined to think <i>mea culpa</i> that we ought to have made clear what the intention of the <Col N="1058" /> Dáil was, and we failed to do so.  I felt a certain responsibility for the first report of the Public Accounts Committee referring to this matter, because in the absence of the then chairman, through illness, I had to sign it.  Deputy Davin was chairman at that time.  That report, dated 24th February, 1928, recommended that the position should be regularised.  What did we mean by that?  I, personally, taking into account all the circumstances, taking into account the fact that we were told that the Board of Assessors, possibly somewhat exceeding their function, had sought information from private individuals, whose names were given as references, people not in the service of the State, and had assured them that any information they would give would be regarded as confidential, came to the conclusion that it would not be advisable to allow these things to be published, and if they were open to the Comptroller and Auditor-General they were liable to be published.  It was obviously somewhat difficult to establish a man's pre-Truce service.  For instance, they might have given as reference persons outside this State, and who might be made amenable for any information that they gave.  I came to the conclusion that it was impossible that this information should be given, but that that would have to be regularised, so that no precedent should be established, and that it should not be possible for any other public department in future to say to the Comptroller and Auditor-General &ldquo;under the Military Service Pensions Act no particulars were given, and we are not going to give them.&rdquo;  This Bill that we are now discussing makes it clear that it applies only to these past transactions under the previous Military Service Pensions Act.  It does not apply to the Board of Works, Fisheries, or any other department.  They will not be able to say: &ldquo;We are not going to let the Comptroller and Auditor-General see our accounts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree that I have never approached the work of <Col N="1059" /> the Public Accounts Committee from a party point of view.  Our utility in this Dáil is very limited, particularly limited in the case of private Deputies, but the one thing in this Dáil that I may have done of some lasting value was work on the Public Accounts Committee.  I did not approach it from a party point of view, and I do not share the view expressed by Deputy Davin that it is absolutely necessary, from the point of accurate public accountancy, to have these particulars.  I think if you gave them you would have much more difficulty in future, because if people are assured by a State Department that their evidence will be regarded as confidential and if that evidence is subsequently published you will never be able to get any evidence to investigate any claim in the future.  At least, it will be very much more difficult to do so.  What I am still concerned with is that other Departments should not take this omission of the Dáil to make provision in this sense under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 as a precedent.  That is met by this Bill.  I can quite understand that Deputies opposite feel bound to oppose it, but I do feel that it is in the best interests of national accounts. I think Deputy Corry has never studied national accounts.</P>

On the hustings they have pledged that when returned to <Col N="1060" /> office&mdash;which perhaps may occur in the millennium&mdash;one of their first acts will be the abolition of military service pensions that are paid under this Bill.

      <P>What I want to know from the Opposition is: if we set up a tribunal to deal with military service pensions which has certain rights and privileges and give it the right to come to certain findings and conclusions, what in the name of Providence do we want to go and reopen that for if the Act has been sanctioned by the Dáil?  I can quite understand the official Opposition objecting to the Bill.  They are perfectly reasonable and logical in the attitude they take up.  They are going to sweep everything that this Dáil has created out of existence when they come in, and the first thing they are going to sweep out of existence is the military service pensions paid to these unfortunate men who saved the country in its hour of need.  We, on this side of the House, feel that we owe a certain debt to these men and we are paying them that debt of obligation by means of this Bill.  As I have said, I have sat on the Public Accounts Committee along with Deputy Davin, and I have come up against the question of the intrusion of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as <Col N="1061" /> to the investigation of findings that have been already reached under a statute passed by this House.  What is the necessity, from the point of view of public finance, for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to inquire into matters made final and conclusive under statute?  What was the object of setting up the tribunal if we do not mean to honour the findings of that tribunal? As I have said, I can quite understand the official Opposition objecting to the passage of the Bill.  That has been their policy from start to finish and they are perfectly logical in their attitude.  But, the Labour Party, who voted for the passage of this Act, and who agreed to the setting up of this tribunal, want to turn down the following day the thing they voted for yesterday. This is a face-saving dodge.  What the Labour Party are going to gain by refusing these unfortunate men the pittance they are entitled to, I fail to see.  The Labour Party know as well as I do that these men are entitled to anything they get under the Act&mdash;they know they have earned it and deserve it.  The attempt of the Labour Party to justify their attitude in this House on this matter is one that the country in my opinion will accept at its true face value.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland tells us that these men should not have received pensions. That was a perfectly legitimate statement on his part, and I respect him for the logical attitude he has adopted.  He and his Party have all along taken up that attitude. I have met Deputy Boland on the hustings, and heard him time and again dealing with this matter. As I say, he is perfectly justified in taking up the standpoint that he has taken.  But I listened to what Deputy MacEntee had to say on the Bill.  The Deputy, I understand, is the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee at present, but he did not give the House a single valid reason why this Bill should not be passed.</P>

We all know that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is a very able and efficient servant.  He is a man that we all agree is one of the best and most valuable servants in the State.</P>

Why should we set up a tribunal to carry out certain things and then give to one man power to upset all the findings that have been arrived at according to law?  That is the whole thing in a nutshell, and the Labour Party cannot get away from it.  I never <Col N="1063" /> heard the Labour Party put up a poorer or more indefensible case since I came into this House.  I certainly did expect something from Deputy Davin, because I always find him to be sensible and generally fair.  He knows as well as I do that if you gave the powers sought to the Comptroller and Auditor-General it would not make one bit of difference, except that you give him certain formal powers that would have no real effect.  Objection is made to the findings of the Board of Assessors being made final.  If you gave these powers to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, could he upset what has been carried out by statute under the Act?</P>

      <P>We say many things in the heat of the moment at elections and perhaps we are sorry for some of them afterwards.  I should like to join issue with Deputy Boland on one point in his speech. He said that these men should not have received pensions, but he did not tell us why these men should not receive pensions.  These men stood up and defended the nation in the hour of its trial and they are entitled to the pensions they are in receipt of for the services which they rendered to the State.  The few thousands included in this Bill possibly saved this nation many millions of money.  The Labour Party know that as well as I do.  As I say, I can quite agree with some of the remarks of Deputy Boland, but the attitude of the Labour Party upon this matter appears to me to be absolutely incomprehensible. I would like now to turn to Section 3 of the Bill, and I should be glad if the Minister when he speaks would give me some information in regard to sub-section (1) of Section 3, which reads: &ldquo;In sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the Principal Act the word `rank' shall mean and be deemed always to have meant, substantive rank only and not to have included acting rank and the said sub-section shall be construed and shall have and be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.&rdquo;  I should like if the Minister would explain exactly what the word &ldquo;rank&rdquo; means there.  With regard to sub-section (2) which reads: &ldquo;Every reference in the Second Schedule to the Principal Act to the <Col N="1065" /> rank or capacity in which a person was serving at a particular time shall be construed as referring to the substantive rank held by such person at such time and the said Second Schedule shall have effect and be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to explain and to make more clear than the draughtsman has set out, the meaning of this sub-section.</P>

As I understood Deputy O'Connell's objections to this Bill, they were mainly what I might call legal objections to the form of the tribunal and to the method of carryout the purposes of the Bill.

      <P>It is to the methods and form of the Bill that the Deputy objects.  I listened very carefully to Deputy O'Connell, and the only alternative he had to put forward to the procedure that has been adopted and is being legalised by this Bill really comes to this on examination &mdash;that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should inquire into the merits of each case, and say whether in each case the pensions should or should not be granted.  That is what the alternative comes to.  It is said that all the files in connection with each of these cases should be available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  For what purpose? We ought to have some clear thinking upon this matter.  For what purpose?  For the purpose of examining.  I assume, the evidence contained in these files; for the purpose <Col N="1066" /> of seeing that the certificates brought forward are correct.  Does not that in fact amount to this&mdash; if the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to do any real work, is to be nothing more than a camouflage, does it not mean going into the merits of each case and doing over again the work that a semi-judicial body has already done?  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not to go into the merits of each case and to examine each certificate, and to weigh up the evidence pro and con given by each person, what is the use of calling for the files?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  Is the case of a civil servant applying for a pension analogous to the applications for pensions referred to here&mdash; are the considerations that arise when a civil servant is applying for a pension analogous to the applications here?  They are all fixed definitely by a certificate, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General in that respect is in exactly the same position as the Minister.  But in the considerations that arise here the certificates are the least important part.  Oral evidence, which must be given on oath, and given by persons who have been promised that their evidence was confidential, is really the important evidence.</P>

But there is no analogy whatever between the application of a civil servant, whose right to a pension is established by a simple rule, and applications of this sort, which are governed by no rules of any kind, and must be decided on the merits of each case by oral evidence, and in which certificates of various parties are of no importance whatever.</P>

I know that, though I do not agree with their formalism on a <Col N="1068" /> great many occasions.  As I have said a great deal of humbug has been introduced into this debate from the other side of the House. We are making no excuse for paying pensions to these people for they are entitled to them.  Some Deputy said that we in this Party wanted to see them paid pensions.  That is not the position.  The position is that the country wants to see them rewarded for the good value that they gave to the country, and I say that we are expressing the point of view of the people of the country when we give them pensions.</P>

I am not getting any pension because I was not entitled to one, but if I were I would make no excuse to anybody for taking it&mdash;none whatever.  To come back to the point I was dealing with. I want seriously to put this to the Labour Party.  Am I right in saying that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no functions worth anything in respect to these pensions, or in respect to access to the files connected with the pensions if he is not to go into the merits of each case and examine the evidence on which the pensions are based.  I honestly cannot see that he has.</P>

Suppose a definite case is put up by me or by some other Deputy in the House in which there is evidence that a man getting a pension is not entitled to it, and that the Comptroller and Auditor-General goes through the files and finds that that case is correct, would not the exposure of one or two such cases of fraud be very useful in the public interest?</P>

What I want to put to the House is this, was it really contemplated, when that Act was being passed, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was to duplicate the work of this committee?  That is the whole question and it is the real question As to Deputy Fahy's question, that in my opinion is really a question of procedure.  I confess that I do not know the procedure of the House very well, but on this I am perfectly satisfied that while I do not know the procedure there is some method of raising a question with regard to any pension. As I have said, I do not know what that procedure is.</P>

I am more familiar with the procedure, say, of the Circuit Court than I am with the procedure of the House. But in regard to the point put by the Deputy I have not the slightest doubt but that procedure could be outlined for dealing with it.  At the moment I am on the specific point which appears to weigh very heavily with the Labour Party.  I put it to the Labour Party that if the Comptroller <Col N="1070" /> and Auditor-General is to have the right to go into one case then he should have the right to go into all cases, and the only way in which he can in any sense examine any case under this Act that has been decided by this tribunal is to go into the merits of the case in exactly the same way as the tribunal itself did.</P>

      <P>Not being satisfied with the reply given to my question yesterday regarding the division of the estates of Mr. Nicko Green and the Baker Estate, Co. Tipperary, I gave notice to raise the matter on the adjournment.  I asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state (a) when it is intended to divide the estates of Mr. Nicko Green, Lattin, Co. Tipperary, and (b) the Baker Estate, Ballinard, Co. Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Mr. Roddy replied: &ldquo;A scheme for the division of the following lands is at present in the course of preparation, but the Land Commission are not in a position to state when they will be divided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Allen Baker Estate&mdash;Ballinard, 201a. 0r. 0p. Ballinglana, 89a. 0r. 0p. Illaunmeen, 15a. 0r. 0p.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Estate of Nicholas Green&mdash;Shronell, 50a. 1r. 27p. Ballynadruckilly, 50a. 2r. 0p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Deputy refers to the lands of Lattin East, the property of Nicholas J. Green, these lands were also included in the provisional list, but the owner having objected to their inclusion therein, and also to the inclusion of the lands of Ballinagleragh, the Land Commission allowed his objection as regards Lattin East and disallowed it as regards Ballinagleragh.  The price of the lands of Ballinagleragh was fixed <Col N="1072" /> and published in accordance with the Land Act of 1923, and on the owner's appeal it transpired that the tenure under which Nicholas Green holds both the lands of Lattin East and Ballinagleragh constitutes him a tenant within the meaning of the Land Act, 1923, and he has now been returned to the Land Commission as a tenant of these lands on the estate of Captain Charles Moore.  These lands will be dealt with in connection with the sale of the Moore estate under the Act of 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries would state the present state of the negotiations between the Irish Land Commission and Mr. Nicko J. Green, regarding the lands of Ballinagleragh and Lattin East, Co. Tipperary, 390 acres of which were gazetted for acquisition nearly three years ago. I would also like if the Minister in his reply would answer the following questions: How much of this land was Mr. Green permitted to retain on appeal; how much is still the subject of investigation, what price was offered for it, and whether a price has yet been definitely fixed; and, if so, what is the price; further, what objections, if any, were raised by Mr. Green at the hearing before the Land Commission?  Are the Land Commission aware that on these lands, to the acquisition of which objection was taken, upwards of 60 acres of meadowing lay uncut last year, that only two men are employed on 670 acres&mdash;Mr. Nicko Green's 550 acres and his uncle's 120 acres&mdash;all farmed by Mr. Nicko Green as a non-resident ranch?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that part of the lands not acquired are let on the eleven months system, and that most of the land is grazed by the cattle of another rancher, who has extensive tracts of land all over the south, and who, to escape seizure of these cattle for bank debts, removed them from the Lattin lands during the night?</P>
    <P>This ranch is surrounded by congests, unemployment is rife in the district and eighteen or twenty <Col N="1073" /> families in Lattin village have no space for vegetables or grass for goats, and many must go three or four miles for milk, while small farmers take meadowing two or three miles away.  Are the Irish Land Commission satisfied that the spirit and the letter of the 1923 Act were observed in dealing with these ranches, and, if so, will they furnish the reports of their own inspectors and of the hearing of the objections by the Land Commissioners?</P>
    <P>With regard to the property of his uncle, I would like to know what price was offered by the Irish Land Commission for the 100 statute acres of the lands of Shronell and Ballynadruckilly, near Lattin.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary also state what was the price fixed on appeal by the Judicial Commissioner, and at what date was that price fixed? I would also like to know whether a large quantity of ash and other valuable timber was sold off the lands of Shronell after the offer made by the Land Commission; whether this timber was cut down after the Judicial Commissioners' assessor had appeared on the lands for valuation; what was the date on which the assessor visited the lands, and did Mr. Green furnish a return of the value of the timber sold, and when is it proposed to divide these lands?</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary also to furnish the particulars regarding the estate of Mr. Alan Baker, veterinary surgeon.  These lands are situated at Ballinard and Ballinglana, Baronv of Clanwilliam, Co. Tipperary.  What was the price offered by the Land Commission for the 305 statute acres comprised in the estate; what was the price fixed on appeal by the Judicial Commissioner, and the date at which it was fixed?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary explain the cause of the prolonged delay in dividing this estate, surrounded as it is by a large number of uneconomic holders, many of them former tenants on the estate? In connection with this estate, I would also like to know when the Land Commission expect to be in a position to divide it.  Since the <Col N="1074" /> price was first offered a very big quantity of timber has been cut down and sold, and I would like to know whether the Land Commission are aware of that.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will state whether the Land Commission are aware that a big part of these lands is being meadowed for a number of years, that 89 acres were meadowed last year, and that the same ground, with about 25 additional acres, is meadowed this year, and whether they believe this continuous meadowing of dry land, not of the very best class, is likely to cause serious deterioration in its value to incoming tenants.  Also will the Parliamentary Secretary state whether the high price fixed on appeal in this case will not have the effect, even if it is not so intended, of bringing land division into disrepute, or of stopping it altogether?  It is an absolute scandal the way the Irish Land Commission are treating this area in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea made by Deputy Fogarty in this matter.  It has been hanging over for very many years and it is time that it should be settled and ended.  When the Minister for Agriculture introduced the Land Act in 1923 he got a great deal of support throughout the country, because it was expected that the ranches all over the Free State were going to be divided.  On these estates in East Tipperary, on the borders of Limerick, there is a large number of uneconomic holders&mdash;congests, and villagers who are practically cottiers.  As Deputy Fogarty pointed out, they have practically nothing to live on.  There is no employment in the district.  The people are nearly all uneconomic holders in the vicinity of these estates.  They took a prominent part in the struggle against the Black and Tans, and since that time these men, who had distinguished themselves particularly in the service of the country, have been let down.  Nothing whatever has been done to give them land to which they were entitled.  I believe that the <Col N="1075" /> land in question is not being properly maintained and is in a derelict condition.  Not alone the Deputies belonging to this Party but members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party before we entered this House took the matter up, and they had a promise regarding the division of these estates from the Minister for Agriculture when he was in charge of land distribution, but nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have a number of defences to make.  First, when they decided to take over the estate of Mr. Green they did not understand his position.  They thought he was a landlord apparently, and they did not consider that his land would have to be taken over as tenanted land.  A legal difficulty was created that gave Mr. Green the right to go into the court and fight the Land Commission. Mr. Green, like many other people, although he has 550 acres going derelict in that district and also 600 acres in another place, has been able to go into court, and that shows the hopelessness of the present administration of the Land Commission. There has been agitation with regard to these estates for many years and the whole countryside are up in arms against the present state of affairs.  Mr. Green has been able to go into the court and defeat the Land Commission firstly by rising the price on the small amount of land to be handed over, which is only a small fraction of the total; and secondly, by making the thing impossible and absolutely hopeless because the charges that were to be placed on the tenant occupiers if they got the land would make it impossible for them to work it, so that the whole thing would have to go back again into the hands of people like Mr. Green.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that it was decided in the Court of Mr. Justice Wylie that 188 Irish acres should be made available for distribution out of a total of 1,200 statute acres.  As regards the 188 Irish acres, the price was increased from £7,000 to £8,000 on the <Col N="1076" /> Baker estate.  In the case of Mr. Green, the price on 100 statute acres out of all the hundreds of acres that he has was raised from £2,300 to £2,650.  In addition to the Land Commission being defeated in court under the agreement which they themselves drafted, they were only able to take a small fraction of these lands at such a high price that it would be absolutely impossible for the tenants to make ends meet under the economic conditions at present prevailing in the country.  The Land Commission also decided that those villagers, of whom I have spoken and who have not a bite for their children to eat, are not going to get any of this land.  That indicates to us that as regards the present system of land distribution there is something fundamentally wrong when you have hundreds of families as you have in this area living on patches of land.  Some of them like the villagers in Lattin have nothing practically to live on. They are dependent practically on the charity of their neighbours and on an odd day's work.  This man, I understand, refuses to do anything with his land.  He refuses even to cut the weeds on it, to sow any crops or to pay any attention to drainage, fencing or anything of that sort, leaving the whole place practically to go wild.  When you have side by side with those conditions a whole community shrieking for some means to give them maintenance and employment, the only answer the Land Commission has to give is that under our Land Act we can do nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy Mr. T. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(Tipperary): I desire to support the remarks of Deputy Fogarty.  The Parliamentary Secretary should insist on the immediate division of the ranches both in Lattin and other parts of Tipperary.  To my mind the Land Commission have made very slow progress up to the present.  There are a great many ranches in Tipperary, and some of them which the Land Commission took over some years ago are set and have not been <Col N="1077" /> divided up amongst the uneconomic and landless men in the district.  I know two such ranches that have been taken over, and there are several others where the trail of Cromwell is very much to be seen. You could travel for miles through the county and see nothing but ranches.  I would strongly urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity of speeding up the division of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Sheehy has said is quite true, namely, that there are quite a number of untenanted ranches still in Tipperary with which the Land Commission has not yet been able to deal.  There are also a large number of untenanted ranches in other counties with which it cannot deal, and probably cannot do so for some years to come.  Tipperary, however, is a county where the Land Commission has done exceptionally good work, and where a larger acreage of land has been acquired and distributed than any other county with the exception of County Galway.  18,000 acres have been distributed in Tipperary during the past few years, and schemes are in course of preparation for the distribution of another 3,000 or 4,000 acres.  Deputy Fogarty raised a number of points which were not relevant to the question on the Order Paper yesterday, which I do not propose to deal with.  Schemes are in course of preparation in regard to the Baker estate and the Nicholas Green estate, and the position in regard to the Lattin lands is as I indicated in my answer yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927 the Land Commission gazetted these lands for acquisition as untenanted land, but the owner objected and his objection was heard in the ordinary way by the Land Commission.  The price of £3,500, which was fixed on the lands, appears to be quite reasonable.  The owner, however, appealed against the price to the Judicial Commissioner, and in the proceedings before him it transpired that the lands were held on a lease which would expire in 35 years.  Consequently according to the Land Act of 1923, <Col N="1078" /> Nicholas J. Green was merely a tenant on the estate of Captain Moore. These two holdings at Lattin and Ballinagleragh have to be dealt with in connection with the tenanted lands on the Moore estate.  In order to acquire the lands proceedings must be taken to retain and resume these holdings.  The whole procedure will have to be gone through afresh and the previous proceedings automatically lapse.  I cannot give any undertaking as to when the proceedings for the resumption of these holdings will be completed, as they have to go through a certain procedure laid down in the Land Acts.  Deputy Fogarty referred to the fact that timber was cut down on the holdings of Nicholas J. Green twelve months ago.  I am aware that some timber was cut down, but the Land Commission not having taken over possession of the lands could not interfere to prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Had not the Land Commission offered a price for the lands, and in the meantime the timber was cut?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but we had not possession and could not prevent the cutting of timber.  I think that the Deputy knows enough about land tenure and the Land Acts to recognise that the Land Commission cannot very well intervene to prevent a tenant of lands doing certain things with them until the Land Commission get possession. Deputy Derrig apparently is not acquainted with the position in connection with these lands, otherwise he would not have made some of the rather wild statements which he did make.  He stated that Nicholas J. Green was the owner of about 1,100 acres.  He is the owner of about 600 acres odd.</P>

      <P>From six to eight people.  These lands are particularly rich, and it is very doubtful if they would be as suitable for tillage as grazing.  I am satisfied, at all events, that they are specially suitable for the purpose of grazing and turning out high-class stock.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the owner.  The owner is quite entitled, under the provisions of the Land Acts, to object to the acquisition of the lands.  As I say, it is a matter entirely for the owner, and he can, either himself or through his solicitor, make his case before the Land Commission, and the Land Commission is bound to determine the case on its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were engaged in negotiations which got to the point when we had the price fixed, but we had not acquired the lands, as the Deputy should have understood from my answer.  We have not acquired the lands yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I explained that. We had them gazetted originally as untenanted lands and took the necessary proceedings to acquire them, but at a later stage it was discovered that they were not untenanted, that they were tenanted lands on the estate of Captain Moore.  Consequently we had to recommence the proceedings and revert to the procedure that is followed in such cases, namely, to retain the holding and resume it afterwards.  That is the procedure in these cases, and it means that we have to go through the whole course again.  Deputy Derrig raised a point as to the use of the lands and I am simply answering the question.  The lands are being grazed.  That is the information I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being used, I understand, for finishing off cattle. The Greenwell lands are not suitable for that purpose, but the Lattin and Ballinagleragh lands are used for finishing off cattle which are brought to a certain stage on the other lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>A large portion of those lands belongs to his uncle, a wine merchant here in Dublin, and he has only six men employed.  Sixty acres of hay were allowed to rot last year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mixing up the lands of Nicholas Green and Nicholas J. Green.  I explained that we are preparing a scheme for the division of the lands owned by Nicholas Green.  The other lands, according to our information, are grazed.  That does not affect the fact that we are taking proceedings again for the acquisition of these lands, but I am not giving the Deputy any undertaking as to when the proceedings will be completed.  We have to go through the usual procedure laid down in the Land Acts.  I do not think that Tipperary Deputies have any reason for complaint against the Land Commission, because, as I explained at the outset of my statement, Tipperary has been exceptionally well treated.  I travelled through the greater part of North Tipperary in August last, and got in touch with many allottees to whom lands were given in the last few years, and they all expressed satisfaction with the work done by the Land Commission.  I also travelled over some of the estates which are in process of acquisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number, and it will take us some years to deal with them.  It is only possible, after all, to deal with the acquisition and distribution of a certain number each year.  It is quite absurd for Deputies to expect all the land in any one county to be acquired and distributed in one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to calculate what time it will take the Land Commission to acquire any particular estate.

      <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, it seems to me that it is the policy of the Land Commission not to take over the Lattin lands and that it would be better to have them produce bullocks.  Personally I disagree with that.  I imagine that it would be better for the nation to have these lands divided and to have people put on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the policy of the Land Commission to divide land in accordance with the policy of finishing bullocks or of placing people upon it.  It is quite evident that in the case of the Lattin lands it is the bullocks and not the people that count.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary see that Nicko <Col N="1083" /> Green is not allowed to exploit the position by transferring his two herds to those lands in order to take them up while the villagers of Lattin who have not got a sod of land are left there unemployed?</P>

      <P>When the Land Commission is in a position to prepare a scheme for the distribution of these lands it will take into consideration the claims of all legitimate applicants, and will determine those claims in a fair and just way.  In regard to Deputy Derrig's question, the policy of the Land Commission is <Col N="1084" /> to relieve congestion irrespective of whether the land required for the purpose is suitable for the production of bullocks or for the production of oats or other ordinary farm crops.  I was replying to Deputy Derrig's question when I said that these lands are used for finishing bullocks, and the lands, according to the reports I have received from my inspectors, are specially suitable for the purpose.</P>
