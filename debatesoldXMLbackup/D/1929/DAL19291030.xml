      <P>asked the President whether he is prepared to state (a) when the Tribunal will be set up to decide upon the amount of compensation due to the Northern Nationalists who had their homes and property destroyed by the British during the Black and Tan war, and were refused compensation; (b) what will be the Tribunal's procedure; (c) whether he will fix a time limit for its report, and further, to ask whether the Government will adopt and pay in full the awards of the Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is prepared to consider applications for compensation lodged in his Department not later than the 30th November, 1929, in respect of damage to property sustained in Northern Ireland between the 21st January, 1919, and the 11th July, 1921, inclusive, in cases in which compensation was refused by the courts on the ground that the property in question was destroyed as a matter of military necessity.  After full consideration, I have come to the conclusion that such applications can be dealt with more satisfactorily by the Department of Finance than by an <i>ad hoc</i> Tribunal.  Until definite information is available regarding the number and magnitude of applications to be considered, it would be premature to form any conclusion as to the procedure which should be adopted or the time which would be required to complete the necessary investigations, or the amounts to be paid following such investigations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to set up a Commission to inquire into the question of de-rating in Saorstát Eireann; and, if so, if he will state the personnel of same and its terms <Col N="415" /> of reference; if he will state when he expects the Commission to report, and whether he has requested the Commission to report in time for him to give effect to its recommendations in the next Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to set up a Commission of Inquiry into De-rating in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>As regards personnel, letters have been issued to a number of persons inviting them to act on the Commission. Acceptances have not yet been received in all cases, and an announcement on the subject will be made at as early a date as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the terms of reference of the Commission, these will be as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To enquire and report to the Minister for Finance as to</P>
      <P>(1)  The effect on production and employment of local rates at present levied on agricultural land and buildings and industrial and freight transport hereditaments;</P>
      <P>(2)  The probable economic consequences, including in particular the effect on production, employment, taxation and the cost of living, of affording partial or complete relief from such rates by means of contributions from the Exchequer to local authorities, or alternatively by transferring to the Central Government the administration of particular services at present administered by local authorities;</P>
      <P>(3)  The effect of affording such relief on the existing system of local government, including local financial administration, and any modifications of that system which would thereby be rendered desirable;</P>
      <P>(4)  The basis on which Exchequer Grants are at present distributed to local authorities, and whether, and if so in what manner, that basis could be so modified as to secure increased agricultural and industrial production as a consequence of distributing the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> I do not intend to request the Commission to report before any stated date, and I am unable to say when the Commission is likely to present its report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in appointing the Commission on De-rating he has taken into account the position of the County of Donegal; whether he is aware that de-rating in Northern Ireland has increased the competition of Northern farmers as against the farmers of Donegal: and whether he will consider adding to the Commission a member who will be familiar with the conditions prevailing in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing the list of persons to whom invitations to act on the Commission of Inquiry into De-rating were sent the Government took all relevant factors into consideration.  It will, of course, be a matter for the Commission to have regard to any special conditions that may exist in Donegal when framing their recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that there is a greater percentage of arable land tilled in Donegal than in any other county and, in view of the fact that a number of people on the Commission from Dublin have no practical experience with regard to farming, will he give consideration to the question of appointing a representative from the County Donegal Committee of Agriculture, as suggested in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think it would be impossible to have all the interests represented.  There is one representative from a Border county, because, in some ways, the Border counties are most keenly interested, <Col N="417" /> shall we say.  One person has been asked from a Border county and he has accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it is only in the Border counties they feel this grievance at all?</P>

      <P>(c)  One.</P>
      <P>(d)  In cases in which proceedings in the District Courts for the recovery of tax are resorted to, the defaulters usually refuse or neglect to give information at the proper time, both as to their incomes and as to their family circumstances. In District Court proceedings the defaulter may produce evidence as to his circumstances, and the Judge, if the facts are proved to his satisfaction, may order the debt to be paid in suitable instalments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is <Col N="418" /> aware that William Roche, tailor, Cavendish Quay, Bandon, Co. Cork, has been lodged in Cork Jail for non-payment of income tax; whether he is aware that Mr. Roche is a poor workingman without means, and whether, in view of the circumstances of the case, he will have inquiry made into the matter, and have arrangements made for Mr. Roche's release from custody, pending such investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  (2) The answer to the second part is in the negative.  (3) The answer to the third part is that Mr. Roche's release will be considered immediately on receipt of a reasonable proposal for the liquidation of the debt.  The decree was obtained on 7th June, 1929.  Between that date and the date of execution &mdash;a period of over four months&mdash;no effort was made by the taxpayer to liquidate the debt.  As recently as 4th instant an offer made by the Revenue Commissioners to accept payment by instalments was ignored.</P>

Whether any compensation has been given to those who were flooded out and what action, if any, has been taken to prevent a recurrence of these floods.&rdquo;  The answer I received was: &ldquo;Flooding is a normal occurrence in the winter in this area. Claims for compensation in respect of additional flooding alleged to be due to the Shannon works have been received and have been examined by a valuer on my behalf.  His report is in preparation and I will have it examined with a view to prompt payment of such compensation as may be considered reasonable in the circumstances.

      <P>With regard to matters on the Adjournment, notices have been given of a desire to raise the subject matter of Questions 5, 6 and 18.  Merely on the face of the question the Chair would, perhaps, ordinarily recommend that Question 6 should be preferred, seeing that there appears to be some urgency in it.  The matter is in order, because although the person in question is in prison by a decree of the District Court, the Minister has power in certain circumstances to order his release.  At the same time there is considerable difficulty, as the Minister has stated, in discussing the case of an individual in the House, and it should not be done, I think, until all other means have been exhausted. I do not know whether the two Deputies concerned would postpone the matter until to-morrow evening, and see in the interval whether they could not come to a decision so as to prevent the individual's case being discussed in the House.  If that were done I would take the matter of Question 18 this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.  The Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, was passed to remedy the more serious defects in the existing law relating to the relief of the poor, and county schemes, involving in a large measure a total reform of the former poor law system, were adopted thereunder throughout Saorstát Eireann, with the exception of the poor law areas situate in Dublin city and county. The initiative in the preparation and submission of a county scheme under the Act of 1923, rests with the local authorities concerned, and the postponement of the preparation of a scheme in the case of Dublin was mainly due to the fact that radical administrative changes in this area were expected as a result of the reports of the Greater Dublin Commission and the Poor Law Commission. Meanwhile the question of the relief of the poor in the metropolitan area continued to present a special problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Act of 1923 removed restrictions on outdoor relief in all the counties to which the Act applied with the result that home assistance might be given to persons other than those incapacitated by old age or illness or to widows and children, that is to say, to able-bodied persons out of employment. The absence of this power in the case of Dublin city and county necessitated various temporary measures of special relief such as the putting into operation of Section 13 of the Local Government Act, 1898, and the provision of relief grants from Government funds.  Relief grants of considerable amounts were made available during the greater portion of the period since the passing of the Act of 1923 and further large local contributions were made by the City Commissioners and to a lesser extent by the local authorities in Dublin county to <Col N="443" /> supplement this relief.  A special Committee of the Seanad was set up to consider the matter in June last and they recommended that legislation should be passed without delay providing that, pending the adoption of a county scheme, the Poor Law Guardians in Dublin should be empowered to grant outdoor relief without the restrictions which were removed for the remainder of the country by the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>A Bill was accordingly introduced in An Seanad to remove restrictions on the granting of outdoor relief in the Poor Law Unions of Dublin, Rathdown, and Balrothery.  As it was desirable that the views of the local authorities concerned should be obtained, a conference on the matter was convened and a committee of local representatives appointed to consider the question of the extension of outdoor relief and it was hoped that their deliberations might result in the submission of an agreed joint county scheme under the Act of 1923.  It appears, however, that local opinion favoured the postponement of the joint county scheme until the Greater Dublin question should be settled by legislation.  The committee agreed to the proposed extension of outdoor relief but represented that 50 per cent. of the cost of the additional financial burden thereby imposed should be made from Government funds on the grounds that conditions in the metropolitan county merited special terms. They also proposed a division of the Dublin Union into three districts.</P>
    <P>At present there are three Poor Law areas in Dublin city and county.  You have the guardians in Balrothery area, the guardians in Rathdown area and the Commissioners in Dublin city area.  A special committee, consisting of representatives of the local bodies, recommended that relief in respect of the able-bodied should be made a separate charge for special areas. They recommended that as far as the Balrothery area was concerned, it should be a charge over Balrothery area, therefore it would be on all <Col N="444" /> fours with ordinary relief there. They recommended in the case of the Rathdown area, that the Rathdown district should be divided into two areas, an urban area and a rural area, and that the charge should be a separate charge in respect of the rural area and a separate charge in respect of the urban area.  In addition, they recommended that in the case of the areas controlled by the City Commissioners, the old North Dublin Union area, the old South Dublin Union area, and the Celbridge Union area, the City of Dublin and the townships of Rathmines, Pembroke and Howth, should be made one separate area of charge in respect of relief for the able-bodied poor, and that the remaining rural portion should be made another separate area of charge.  They further suggested the setting up of advisory committees in the city and county for the purpose of administering relief under that Act and of dealing with the work that might be required by the Guardians.  The setting up of these committees inevitably rose to the minds of the Committee arising out of the splitting up of the areas into separate areas of charge.</P>
    <P>As regards the contention of the Guardians that fifty per cent. of the cost of the relief granted under this Act should be made from Government funds, it would be impossible in existing circumstances to accede to such a proposal.  The mode of distribution of grants in aid of local taxation is clearly laid down by statute.  The present subventions of poor law expenditure form a large proportion of these grants, and no further relief could be given to local poor law expenditure, even all over the country, without a full examination of the whole question of local taxation and the adjustments that would be required in local government should further expenditure in this direction become operative.  Still less could the granting of a special measure of relief to one particular area be justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> I may say that the Bill which we are introducing now, while replacing the Bill that came from the Seanad, gives practically complete effect to what the Seanad Bill proposed; that is, it extends relief to the able-bodied in the city and county of Dublin in the same way as it is already extended to the rest of the country.  It is because there are some matters of detail that require to be dealt with by legislation that it is more convenient to substitute for the Seanad Bill the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the area of charge, the idea dominant in the minds of the rural members of the Committee who considered this particular matter was that the rural areas in County Dublin should not bear any portion of the charges that might be regarded as arising directly from city areas.  In the Balrothery area the question does not arise.  In the Rathdown area they asked that the townships as a whole be made a unit area of charge for this relief, and that the rural area be made a separate area of charge, too.  I have been unable to accept that, because I see no reason why, in the granting of relief to the able-bodied in Rathdown Union, a discrimination is made which is not made in the ordinary case of outdoor relief.</P>
    <P>As regards the City Commissioners, I do meet the Committee that has gone into the matter in this particular way.  The Bill proposes to make Dublin City, Rathmines and Pembroke, but not Howth, a separate area of charge for this particular class of relief.  It proposes to make the rural portions of the North and South Dublin Unions and Celbridge&mdash;the whole of that area&mdash;another separate area of charge.  I think that is meeting, to the fullest possible extent that I think it is advisable to meet it, the case the Committee wished to make for separate areas in the city and county.</P>
    <P>We have adopted so much as seemed feasible of the Committee's recommendations as to areas of charge.  Dublin County Borough and the urban districts of Rathmines <Col N="446" /> and Rathgar and Pembroke will, under the Bill, bear the whole burden of the additional relief granted in their areas, and suitable provisions are made for the apportionment of the costs of relief as between the city area and the rest of Dublin Union.  This is substantially in accordance with the view of the Dublin rural representatives that they should be free from any financial liability under the Act that would attach to the city.  Circumstances in the Unions of Balrothery and Rathdown would not justify any similar division of areas.</P>
    <P>In view of the extent to which public assistance resources are burdened in Dublin by the influx of needy persons from outside, it has been considered necessary to insert in the Bill a provision requiring a two-years' residence in the county or county borough or both as a qualification for relief under this Act.  To supplement this provision it is also proposed that a Union may pay the expenses of removal of a person who does not possess this qualification and who satisfies the Guardians that such removal is likely to enable him to support himself and his dependants elsewhere by his own industry or other lawful means.  These provisions will continue in force only until the 31st March, 1931, by which time it is hoped that they will be replaced by permanent legislation dealing with the relief of the poor.</P>

Balrothery must continue to be a separate area. The Guardians will administer relief there, having the same area of charge as in the case of ordinary relief. In Rathdown the area will be the same as for ordinary relief.  It will include the townships and the rural portion of the Rathdown area. It is only the portion under the City Commissioners that will be divided into a city area, taking in Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke, and the rural area will take in all the outside areas, including the urban district of Howth.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a serious proposition from every aspect that one might examine it.  Something of the kind has been very badly needed in the City and County of Dublin, especially in recent years.  There is some kind of explanation for the absence of the powers in Dublin that other counties have had since 1923.  To my mind the explanation given is not adequate, considering the need there has been in Dublin for such powers.  Other poor law authorities have had the powers which are now proposed to be given to Dublin City and County to provide for able-bodied people in want. There is not any part of the area under the Free State that has had as high a proportion of people in absolute want as the City of Dublin. There are places, no doubt, in which there has been a very high rate of unemployment other than Dublin. But in no place has there been such need, such dire want, as there has been within the confines of Dublin City and County, and Dublin City in particular.  Therefore, if such powers were needed anywhere they were needed in Dublin, and should have been provided before now.  We do not know how long the excuse that is offered&mdash;that legislation was being prepared to deal with Greater Dublin &mdash; may continue. Promises have been made for the <Col N="448" /> last two or three years in this connection, and these promises have not been kept.  Promises were made this year, and in all probability these promises will be treated in the same way as the promises of last year and the year before were treated.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill is giving these powers to the Commissioners. That is so much to the good from one point of view.  I might refer to a favourite topic of mine, that is, that my belief is that had the Municipal Council and the old Guardians been in charge of affairs the poor would not have suffered as they have suffered in the last four or five years, that some effort would have been made before now to bring under the notice of this House the shocking conditions of the poor of Dublin.  It would look&mdash;it may be a hard thing to say&mdash;as if the anxiety of the Commissioners appointed by the Minister for Local Government at the time was to save, above all, the pockets of the ratepayers and to save the face of the Government.  That may be too hard a thing to say, but it looks to me as if that thing is true.  We have been told in the Press and on platforms for years past that everything is rosy in the Free State garden; that we are all prosperous and that we have turned the corner. I do not know how many corners we have turned or where we have got to, we have turned round so often. Of course, it would not serve the powers that be, as far as the Commissioners were concerned, to have the real state of poverty that existed become known by being brought under discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My belief is that, if the figures given recently to the Chamber of Commerce by one of the Commissioners be true, this Bill will put an enormous burden on the ratepayers of the City of Dublin.  But my belief is that even so, even that the ratepayers will have to bear such an additional burden as was suggested by one of the Commissioners, if the full facts of the present conditions were known to the ratepayers, those who can afford to pay this additional burden would not grumble.  I am inclined to believe that people in <Col N="449" /> Dublin do not know, have not opportunities of knowing, or have not taken opportunities to make themselves aware of the shocking conditions in which such a high proportion of the poor of Dublin live at the present time.  That is the only excuse that I can find for the want of civic spirit in Dublin&mdash;that there must be existing amongst those who can afford to pay and who can afford to be more generous than they have been, appalling ignorance of these conditions.  The conditions are indescribable. That is not too strong a word to use in reference to the conditions in some parts of Dublin.  The conditions were bad before the European War, but since the war ended these conditions have become worse than they have been known in Dublin for generations.</P>
    <P>Within the last day or two I was speaking to a medical officer who attends an hospital for babies in the City and I heard his description of the number of cases he has to deal with and the number and variety of diseases that exist amongst children. He told me that the majority of these cases were not cases for the hospital. They are cases that arose out of starvation and out of want of proper nourishment for the babies and for their mothers.  If there were proper nourishment one-half of these cases would never have come to the hospital.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that.  There is shortage of employment and as a consequence shortage of food and scarcity of clothing, and, above all, there is scarcity of milk for the babies.  We know that there are worthy bodies trying to alleviate distress in the City of Dublin.  There are societies of men and women collecting and working hard to get money together, aided by philanthropic institutions, to get milk for the babies.  They do not touch a quarter or perhaps less than a quarter of the numbers that require their attention.  It is not their fault. They have not the resources.  Such are the conditions.  It is these conditions that make a Bill of this kind a necessity.  Poverty, starvation, hunger, cold, and misery of every <Col N="450" /> kind is the lot of a very big percentage of our people and the problem of how to deal with it is a gigantic one.</P>
    <P>I do not attempt to say that if there were any other Government in power that that Government, any more than the present one, could solve the problem of Dublin poverty in a year or two, or five years.  The problem is not of the making of the present Government, although my belief is that they have added to it. The problem is one handed down to us.  It is a legacy of the former régime.  It is one that the Government had to face when it took over control, but to my mind it has not faced it nor attempted to face it.  It does not even face it now in such a way as would provide a solution. We have to get, therefore, temporary expedients such as this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner who spoke recently on this subject to the Chamber of Commerce said that this Bill would, under certain circumstances, add an extra 5/3 to 6/9 in the £ on the rates in the city of Dublin.  That is an enormous sum.  What the citizens will say when the demand notes for this added rate reach them I do not know.  My belief is that if efforts are made to show the people and to show the ratepayers in Dublin what the true conditions are that the ratepayers will say: &ldquo;We will have to face it.  Such being the conditions, such being the lot in which many of our fellow-citizens live, some way must be found to provide relief for them.  This is a temporary expedient proposed by the Government, and we must put up with it.&rdquo;  I know that it will be a hardship on industry.  I know that it may have an effect on nascent industries in the city of Dublin and on industry generally.  But what is the alternative?  Are we to allow these people to die of starvation?  Are we to allow the 170 per thousand of the infants under 12 months to continue to die in North Dublin as they are dying, according to the recent census statistics?  We have on the one hand an enormous deathrate due mainly to starvation and <Col N="451" /> due to disease brought on by starvation, and on the other the possibility of injury to the city and to the industries of the city.  I think, as humanitarians, we are bound to feed the hungry as long as there is any money to be got anywhere.</P>
    <P>This Bill, even as it stands, will not be able to provide enough money to feed the necessitous poor of Dublin, not even with the assistance of the various philanthropic associations&mdash;the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other organisations that are working so hard in Dublin.  It will not be able to do any more than touch the fringe, I will not say of the starving people, but of the necessitous people in the City of Dublin. In the last four or five years, due to various causes, there has been an excess of unemployed, and whether that is due to people from the country flocking into the city, expecting to find the streets paved with gold, or not, I do not know, but it is probably one of the causes. Whatever the causes may be, the fact remains that there has been an increase in the numbers of unemployed in the city, and that no adequate effort has been made to meet that situation.  When the Commissioners were appointed they set out to cut down everywhere.  They cut down on poor relief, inside and outside the Union, and made matters worse in many respects.  Their object was to save the ratepayers, but for the savings they may have made in the last three or four years the citizens of Dublin are going to pay, and pay through the nose, through this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister evidently would have liked, if he could have done so, to put off legislation of this kind until the new Municipal Council had taken charge of Dublin, or whatever portion of Dublin is going to be given into its control, and allow that body to have the responsibility of increasing the rates, but evidently he found the pressure was so strong and the need was so great that he must introduce legislation now, even if he is to damage the reputation of the Commissioners, as <Col N="452" /> Deputy Good said recently.  I was interested in reading Deputy Good's speech at the Chamber of Commerce, where he said: &ldquo;I am afraid that their good character (the Commissioners', he meant) will be rudely shaken when the ratepayers come to know that the rates will be probably increased by 2/- or 3/- in the £.  It is very unfortunate that this increase will have to take place while they are in office.&rdquo;  He would have liked the increase to be held over until the Municipal Council came in for all the bad things that might be said about them.  But this increase ought to have been made years ago. If the authorities in charge of the poor were doing their duty, three or four years ago a demand of this kind should have been made on the Minister for Local Government.  The poor have been in need of it in the last three or four years, just as much as they are at this moment, but evidently the policy of saving the face of the Government at all costs and at the cost of the starving poor, appealed more to them.</P>
    <P>I believe that this problem is not a Dublin city problem; it is a problem for the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Dublin city is just what the Twenty-Six Counties has made it, because people from every corner of the Twenty-Six Counties and outside them, from every corner of Ireland and outside it, have been flocking into Dublin.  I suppose that the proportion of those people whom you would call citizens of Dublin, whose association with Dublin would go back fifty or sixty years, is very small.  The number of families in Dublin that have been in the city for three generations would probably not amount to twenty per cent.  So that the problem is not, strictly speaking, a Dublin city problem; it is a problem for the State as a whole.  I agree with those County Dublin ratepayers' representatives who asked that the National Exchequer should bear a proportion, and a large proportion, of the cost of meeting the shocking situation that arises out of the gigantic problem of the poor of Dublin with which we are now faced.  Dublin citizens will <Col N="453" /> perhaps have to bear that, and if they have to they will do it with a good grace.  If they have not realised the conditions that have existed up to the present, the demand notes that they will get when the rate is being collected will soon make them realise what the real conditions in Dublin are.  But I would say that it would really be unfair to ask the Dublin ratepayers to bear the whole of that burden.  As I say, it is not a Dublin city problem, strictly speaking; it is a national one.  If that be not admitted I would say that the whole of the county of Dublin ought to bear equally the burden that is now being placed on the ratepayers, or at all events, all the urban areas ought to do so.  I suppose we will go into the details of the Bill later, but it is certainly a step in the right direction to provide that the fathers of families who are willing to work if work were available should not have to break up their homes, such as they are&mdash;mostly, of course, one-room dwellings&mdash;separate from their wives and families and go into the Union in order to get the relief that is due to them by the State because of their impoverished condition. That is a step in the right direction, and it is one that ought to have been taken before.</P>
    <P>In Section 3, the section giving power to pay for the removal of a person from the Union, there does not seem to be any limit to the amount that may be demanded, beyond whatever limit the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; may put on it&mdash;&ldquo;to pay the reasonable expenses of his removal from such union to some other place.&rdquo;  A poor person with a family might believe that if he got sent to America, say, he would get work, or that some people would give him work, and that that would be a reasonable claim to make. There is no limit, beyond the word &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; to what might be demanded, and it might be well that the Bill should be altered to specify in some more definite way the amount that might be made available for such purposes.  Also it would be well that there should be <Col N="454" /> some definition of the kind of work that is referred to in Section 4. Among the unemployed there are many artisans, many skilled tradesmen, and the Bill does not state whether work in their own trades might be demanded by these men. If that is so, the Commissioners, or whoever will be administering the Bill, will find themselves up against the trade unions.  I think it would be well to have the wording of that section changed, and to put in something more definite to prevent difficulties of that kind arising.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to continue in operation until the 31st March, 1931.  I think that is too short a period, bearing in mind the fact I have already referred to, the broken promises of the past.  The Minister may say that the Greater Dublin Bill will be introduced this Session.  He can say that if this Bill is passed with the limited date of March, 1931, in it, there will not be an equally great necessity this time twelve months or between March, 1931, and whatever time the necessary legislation is passed with regard to Greater Dublin. I think the limit of time there is too short, and that it should be extended to, perhaps, March, 1932, unless the Minister can say that it is really his intention this time to introduce the legislation that he has so often promised.</P>
    <P>Again I would say that this is a serious problem for the city of Dublin.  If the Bill is passed as it stands, if the expenses set out in it as a likely charge on the city of Dublin are not met in some way out of the National Exchequer, the consequences for the Dublin ratepayers are going to be very serious.  For my part, I say that they will have to be serious, and that the money will have to be paid, if the Government does not feel called upon to help and I believe that those who are able to pay in Dublin, if they realise the conditions of their neighbours and their fellow-citizens, will pay.  But the problem is grave, great, and urgent, and even though the consequences to the city may not be in some respects advantageous, the <Col N="455" /> poor and starving people must be fed, clothed and looked after at any expense to the Government or the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has stated very wisely that this Bill is a very serious one no matter from what point of view we consider it. The point of view I am concerned with is the serious burden it is going to throw on the ratepayers of Dublin, and in the adjoining townships of Rathmines and Pembroke.  We are told the burden will represent something equivalent to 5/- of an immediate increase in the rates in these three areas.  When we recall that the rates in Dublin are something in the region of 15/-, and those in the two other areas something less, and that we are going to add to that burden a further one equivalent to 30 per cent.&mdash;5/- and 15/&mdash;we get some idea of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that while this Bill has been discussed at considerable length, I have not heard one single word of objection to any assistance being given those who are really destitute.  All are agreed that the really destitute should get assistance, but in endeavouring to assist them we must be careful that we are not going to do a very considerable amount of injury.  That is the aspect of the problem I would like serious consideration to be given to.  If we add this heavy additional burden to the rates in the city and the adjoining townships it is quite obvious that a number of struggling industries in those areas will be closed down by reason of such an increased rate.  To those who are considering the erection of factories&mdash;and there are some who have the matter under consideration &mdash;the added burden of 5/- will be a serious one, and in many cases it will decide the fate of these schemes adversely for the city.  The result will be that in our efforts to do good we are going to add a very considerable number to the unemployed in the city and townships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by Deputy O'Kelly that this burden is falling <Col N="456" /> unfairly on the City of Dublin.  Anybody who has any experience of the problem will agree with that statement. If inquiry were made, and if accurate information could be obtained concerning the inmates of our Union, we would find that a very large percentage of the inmates come from areas outside Dublin and that the burden of maintaining them is falling on the City of Dublin. That is unfair, and I am quite satisfied that the reason Dublin was exempted from all the liabilities under the previous Acts that fell on other counties was due to the expenses of the unemployed, the poor and the destitute who gravitated from other areas falling on the ratepayers of Dublin.  This problem should be dealt with along the lines that Dublin should not be called upon to bear any more than the burden of the unemployed and the destitute immediately within its area and those born within that area.  If that same principle were extended to the other counties in the Free State, so that each county should bear the burden of its own nationals, then we could get over some of the difficulties that Dublin has been suffering under.  If that principle be accepted, this Bill will need radical alteration, and I am not sure that it is not desirable that it should be so amended in order that this burden should be more fairly distributed.</P>
    <P>Now as to that clause which is being referred to requiring a person to have two years' residence in the city before qualifying for benefits, I am afraid that is too short a period.  The unemployed may have been in and about our city for a period of two years without obtaining any work, and having been about our city for two years that they should then qualify to become a burden for all time does seem unreasonable.  I would like to see that period very considerably extended, and even if extended to a considerable extent, I doubt if it is in itself a sufficient remedy.  I think in addition to that we should only have responsibility for those who were born within the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> In discussing the economic aspect of a problem of this kind, one does not want to get into a discussion on unemployment, but one might say that if a little more was spent upon prevention, and a little less devoted to the cure, the money would be much more wisely spent.  I am afraid when we deal with these problems that we are very much inclined to look upon them from the effect side rather than from the other end, that is, from the cause, and if we devote a little more money in prevention, as I said, it would avoid a great deal of expenditure in the other end in attempted cures.  But, dealing generally with the economic aspect of this problem, I do not mind whether the expenditure be national or municipal. It gravitates down to the one source.  It becomes a burden on industry, and we are in that unfortunate position in this State that we only have one industry of real importance; that is the industry of agriculture.  Now that industry is not in a condition, as we know it at the moment, to carry any further burden.  Therefore I would urge that in dealing with this problem we should keep that particular aspect of the question before our minds.  But whether we deal with it from the national standpoint or the municipal standpoint, the burden gravitates down to that industry that we are all anxious to promote, and the major portion of the burden will fall on that industry at a time when it is unable to carry any further burden. If we cast our minds for a moment to an adjoining State we will see there that efforts are being made to stimulate industry in order to try and help this particular problem of the unemployed, and we see there the difficulty of stimulating industry by reason of the burdening of industry with taxation to such an extent that it is unable to rise owing to the burden that has been put upon it.</P>
    <P>I leave that aspect of the question. There is just one other aspect of this problem I would like to say one word on.  It has been stated that there is a considerable amount of destitution, <Col N="458" /> and I quite realise it, in our city. But our city, unfortunately, has never been free from the burden of the destitute.  We have gravitated to our city a number of those who are really, from one cause or another, some from physical defects, unemployable, both in the past and in the present.  It is only right to point out that these people have been assisted by societies that have all done excellent work in this direction in our city for years past.  Those people have not been neglected, and as I see this particular problem, the work of those societies will be infringed on.  I am not so sure that the State is going to discharge the work any better than it has been done in the past by those societies, but I would like to know from the Minister if he has had any communication from them, if this question of overlapping of charity has been considered, and, if so, what arrangements have been arrived at, because you cannot expect the charitable people in Dublin to contribute, on the one hand, through these various charities, and, on the other hand, as ratepayers and taxpayers to the solution of this problem.</P>

Now that we have entered a little more fully into the realities of the problem, I think this House will agree that this is a matter in which it would be wise to hasten slowly, and I would urge that a reasonable amount of time should be given to the consideration of the different proposals that may be brought forward on the Committee Stage in order that industries which are struggling at the moment should not be closed up, and also in order that those who have in mind the starting of further industries in our city should get a little more encouragement than that got from Deputy O'Kelly this afternoon.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced by the Minister, and is before us now in substitution for the Bill which was introduced in the Seanad by Senator Johnson.  Perhaps I should express my belief at the outset that the Bill the Minister has introduced satisfies in the main the idea which Senator Johnson had in introducing his Bill.  While the original Bill left the Minister wide power to make regulations, he has put into the Bill some of the things that would be done by regulations if Senator Johnson's Bill were passed. I listened with a considerable amount of interest to Deputy Good and his complaint with regard to the serious burden this Bill is going to put on the ratepayers.  It is a serious burden undoubtedly, but if the burden is serious it only shows us that the problem which is to be dealt with is serious.  I waited with considerable interest to see what Deputy Good's solution of the problem would be, how would he propose to deal with those able-bodied people in the city and suburbs of Dublin who are willing and anxious to work but get no work to do.  Is his suggestion that rather than ask those who can pay rates to pay them for the relief of those, that those people should be left to starve?  It seems to be the logical conclusion of Deputy Good's statement as far as I can understand it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go at any great length into the economic problems involved in this matter.  Suggestions were made on many occasions from these benches for such a re-organisation of the economy of the country generally that work would be found for the unemployed. Always to any such suggestion we had an opponent in Deputy Good, who believes that private enterprise should not be interfered with in any way, We have here before us in this problem to-day the result of the private enterprise which Deputy Good and others with him would tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In reference to the Bill generally, I always like to find myself in agreement with Deputy Good and, to some small extent, I certainly agree with him that the way to tackle the problem is to prevent it rather than to try to cure it. I am with him in that.  That is a doctrine that we on this side of the House have always preached and will continue to preach, and I hope we will have Deputy Good to help us out.  In regard to his statement about the peculiar position of Dublin, I confess that I could not follow him in his enunciation of the principle that each county should bear the burden of its own nationals. I wonder how far Deputy Good would push that principle.  You could have a peculiar development if it were pushed to its logical conclusion. It seems to me that it is a plea for the establishment of twenty-six republics in the Saorstát.  If we build brass walls around the county boundaries, why not have district boundaries, parish boundaries, or even smaller ones?</P>
      <P>On this question of Dublin, I confess I do not find myself in agreement with Deputy O'Kelly either. There is a certain migration or movement of people towards Dublin, but it is not all the unemployed who move to Dublin.  Quite a number of people find employment in Dublin and help to build up the city.</P>

      <P>What I am rather cavilling at is why this special provision should be put in to apply to Dublin and not to other areas in the Free State.  If this is good for Dublin it ought to be good for other areas.  That is the point I wish to make.  I do not think Dublin is entitled to any special arrangements such as are provided in the Bill.  It does not seem to me that it is going to meet the case of the person who happens to be less than two years resident in Dublin&mdash;an able-bodied man who is destitute.  They cannot pay his expenses to any place&mdash;as I understand the Bill&mdash;unless they are satisfied that such removal is likely to enable such person to support himself and his dependants by industry or other lawful means.  I do not know what &ldquo;other lawful <Col N="462" /> means&rdquo; mean.  But it will generally be for the benefit of such person and his dependants.  Suppose they find a person who is destitute and they cannot satisfy themselves that there is a place that he could be so removed to what is going to be done with him?  Is he going to be allowed to starve?  That position, as far as I can see it, has not been provided for in the Bill.  They must be satisfied that he must be in a position to support himself wherever they pay his expenses to.  If they are not satisfied that he will be in a position to support himself they will not pay his expenses.  But what happens? There is no provision for him.</P>

I trust that it is not the intention of the Minister or of those who will be administering this Act that work which would otherwise be done at standard rates of pay will be done under the provisions of this section under these rates of pay.  I say that because I have a case in my mind of something that occurred in connection with it before in the north side of the city, where work was done and a rate of wages paid which was under the standard rate in the city and its surroundings, on the plea that the men were not able to work as long and as hard.</P>

I welcome the Bill generally as an effort to meet the terrible situation which has been described by Deputy O'Kelly as existing in Dublin.  Dublin, unfortunately, is not the only area in the Free State in which these conditions exist to-day.  This is only a palliative, something in the nature of a a temporary measure, to meet a very urgent situation, but, such as it is, the situation is one that cannot be allowed to continue.  It is rather a sad commentary upon the Government that they should have waited before taking this step, in spite of all the pressure brought to bear upon them from time to time, until a Bill to remedy this matter was introduced by a private member of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I think that in this matter, as well as geographically, I occupy a position midway between Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connell. I cannot see why a man, because he is resident in the City or County of Dublin, who is in a necessitous situation, should not be entitled to receive the outdoor relief that he would receive in any other city or county in the Saorstát.  I am in favour of the principle of the Bill to that extent. On the other hand, having regard to the great burden that must inevitably be placed on the ratepayers, I think it is very proper that such sections as Section 4, requiring work, and Section 3, giving power to pay for the removal of a recent comer to the city, should exist in the Bill.  My main purpose, however, is not to address myself to these points, but to the question of the area or areas of charge in the Bill.  Some of my constituents are dissatisfied with the Bill; some of them on the County Council are inclined to think that the Minister for Local Government has been hard upon them.  I wish <Col N="464" /> they could have heard Deputy O'Kelly's speech, because then it would have become clear to them that where the Minister for Local Government chastises them with whips, Deputy O'Kelly, if he was Minister for Local Government, would chastise them with scorpions. Deputy O'Kelly said&mdash;and it was a very important declaration&mdash;that he would prefer, in the first instance, to make the charge for the relief of poverty in Dublin a charge on all the taxpayers of the Saorstát&mdash;on the whole Twenty-six Counties; but, if that were not possible, he considers that the whole County of Dublin should bear the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly is speaking from the Front Bench of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Is that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Is it the policy of Deputy Brady and Deputy MacEntee?  If so, they have hitherto failed to make it very clear to their constituents.  Is it put up by the Fianna Fáil Party that the whole County of Dublin should bear the burden of poor law relief of the City of Dublin?  Deputy O'Kelly said so. Is that the Party's policy?  We ought to know that before we go any further.  I hope it is not their policy. I do not know whether I can convince Deputy O'Kelly but I do hope to convince at least some Deputies that it is an unjust and inequitable proposition.  The whole County of Dublin&mdash;not those districts adjacent to the city only, not merely those districts which almost form part of the city of Dublin, which are practically contiguous to it, only separated by a street or a canal, but the whole county of Dublin, including the rural ratepayers&mdash;should bear the burden of poor law outdoor relief in the City of Dublin!  It is not a just proposition. On what grounds can you base it?  On the ground of contiguity&mdash;of being near the city?  But there are areas in other counties much nearer the city than some parts of County Dublin.  The farmer living at Garristown or the Naul, whom Deputy O'Kelly wishes to saddle with this burden, is very much further from the City of Dublin than the farmer <Col N="465" /> at Leixlip or even Maynooth.  He gets very much less advantage from his neighbourhood to the city than the shopkeepers in Bray or Greystones. Both of these towns in Co. Wicklow get more advantage from their nearness to the city than the farmers in North Co. Dublin and part of the Rathdown Union.  As a matter of fact, there is not a great deal to be said for this argument of contiguity nowadays.  It may have been a good argument 30 years ago, but, with the development of motor and bus traffic, farmers thirty and forty miles away can send in their goods to Dublin in a motor lorry and sell them and come in themselves to shop and purchase their requirements as easily as the farmer sixteen or twenty miles away.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has, at any rate, dealt with the case of the farmer in the North County of Dublin.  The Balrothery Union, under the Bill, can give outdoor relief to the people in the Balrothery Union district who need it.  The Balrothery Union district is a homogeneous agricultural area with one or two very small towns, differing in no very great degree from other small towns in the country.  But the Minister has imposed on the Rathdown Union the duty of dealing with outdoor relief not only in its rural areas, but also in what is to become a coastal borough&mdash;the townships of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney.  I believe exception was taken to this proposal by the County Council, and I think with some reason.  There are these townships stretching along the shore, but Rathdown Union goes for some distance inland right up to the Dublin mountains. The ratepayer in Glencullen and Stepaside has very little to do with the coastal townships; he has practically no interest in their outdoor relief and he makes a very small demand for outdoor relief himself. The situation is complicated by the fact that we are to have legislation shortly creating a new Local Government area in the Rathdown Union.  I have seen it stated with some authority, and I have not seen <Col N="466" /> it contradicted, that it is proposed to create the townships I have named as a coastal borough.  You are going to have a situation if this Bill, in its present form, is passed, by which you will have a coastal borough and an adjoining rural area, and yet these two places are to be one for the purposes of poor law relief.  It seems anomalous.  I should have thought that it might be possible&mdash; it will not be easy; I do not say that I could draft an amendment to do it&mdash;but it might be possible either to extend the boundaries of the coastal borough so as to take in these rural areas in order that the dwellers there will have the advantages of the borough services, or if you cannot do that, to allow the dwellers in the mountains, who are comparatively small farmers, to go their own way and distribute their own poor law relief and pay for it, but not to pay for the poor law relief in more populous and wealthy districts.  The rateable value of these inland districts in the Rathdown Union is not very high as a rule, and it cannot matter very much to the success of the Bill.  I do hope the Minister will give the point further consideration; at any rate, that he will further develop his argument as to why it is impossible to divide Rathdown Union and relieve the rural ratepayers from some of this burden.  Farmers in Co. Dublin have not been having an easy time.  They have had to pay rates very much higher in proportion and degree than their neighbours in the Counties Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  While it is necessary to relieve poverty and unemployment we should place the burden on the shoulders that are best fitted to bear it, not on the shoulders of comparatively small farmers.  There are no votes in this.  I know very well that there are a great many more votes in the townships which are to make up the coastal borough.  These people are scattered on the Dublin mountains, but there is a question of fairness and equity, and it seems to me, in fairness and equity, that the Minister should give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connell prefaced their remarks by expressing their unwillingness to go into the economic issues involved in imposing this big additional burden upon industry and trade in Dublin city.  I am personally at a loss to understand their hesitancy, because it seems to me that if we are to pass an Act which involves increasing the rates in the city by five shillings or six shillings in the pound, we should, at any rate, examine the causes that make that impost necessary and the economic consequence it is going to have.  The introduction of this Poor Law Relief Bill is a terrible and I think a fitting commentary upon the industrial policy of the Government since they took office.  The fact that we have to-day, eight years after they first took control of the affairs of this part of Ireland, to alter the statutory provisions relating to the distribution of outdoor relief, so as to permit of 5,000 able-bodied destitute poor being brought within them seems to me an indication of the absolute failure of the Government to deal with the economic issues which confronted them while they have been in office.</P>
      <P>The burden upon the ratepayers of Dublin is going to be a heavy one, but I would like to say definitely that they very largely deserve it.  In my own constituency they have always, with the exception of one lucid interval, voted for Cumann na nGaedheal in the majority, and they will be interested to learn that this is one of the results of their stupidity.  Another result is that those of my constituency who are members of this House are not sufficiently interested to be present at its discussion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good said, at the opening of his speech, that if a <Col N="468" /> little more were spent upon the prevention of unemployment instead of upon its cure it would be much wiser.  How does Deputy Good propose that money should be spent upon the prevention of unemployment? The unemployment in Dublin is undoubtedly serious and it is the result of the inability or the unwillingness of the Government to deal with the question of industrial revival in this country during the past eight years.  Deputy Good appears to dissent from that?</P>

      <P>He said himself that if this problem was dealt with along the lines that it should be dealt with that Dublin would be only asked to provide for the relief of the destitute poor born in the area.  And he then suggested, as a solution of the difficulty, that those destitute in Dublin now who were born outside Dublin should be shipped back to the districts they came from and provided for there.  And he went on with his speech and in one sentence demonstrated as ridiculous the very suggestion he had made; because he said no matter how you distribute the burden, whether you take the funds required for the relief of the poor from national or local sources it is going to be a burden upon industry and particularly upon the agricultural industry.  It is because this burden is too heavy upon industry and particularly upon agricultural industry that it is going, as Deputy Good foretold, inevitably to result in an actual increase in the number of unemployed.  The reason the burden is too heavy upon agricultural industry is that that industry by itself, while operating under present methods, is not able to maintain the existing population of this country. If that is admitted, obviously the only real solution of this problem of unemployment is to develop the industrial arm so as to help agriculture to bear its burden of supporting our people.  The industrial arm could be strengthened if the Government chose to do it.  If instead of bringing in Bills to enable <Col N="469" /> relief to be given to the destitute poor they brought in measures designed to give them work they would be proceeding on right lines.</P>
      <P>On many occasions in this Dáil since 1927 we have pressed upon the Government the necessity of taking action for the development of industry. We pointed out that 12,000 additional workers were provided with work since 1925 in consequence of the tariffs imposed since that year. We argued that that signpost pointed to the road along which progress should be made if the remaining number of unemployed were to be taken off the rates.  The Government failed to take action.  They let matters drift, and as a result they come forward now with a proposal to take another quarter million pounds from the taxpayers of Dublin in order to prevent these 5,000 able-bodied poor from suffering through starvation during the coming winter and the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministry of Local Government, I said last week, always take the line of least resistance.  They did so on the National Health Insurance Bill; they are doing so in relation to this matter.  It is easy enough to say let the ratepayers put their hands into their pockets and provide another five shillings in the £ and increase their contribution by 30 per cent.  But does that solve the problem?  Next year the ratepayers will have to give more; it is inevitable that this burden is going to increase the number seeking outdoor relief.  Relief, at any rate, is only a method of temporarily bridging over the difficulty.  If we are going to make unemployment only a sad memory in this country we have got to tackle it in some other way than by altering the statutory provisions for the granting of institutional or outdoor relief.  Deputy Good appears to fear that one of the effects of the Bill will be to infringe upon the operations of certain charitable organisations.  Without in any way seeking to disparage the work of these organisations I hope to live long enough to see the day when they will have ceased to exist.  The duty of providing for those whom <Col N="470" /> industry or agriculture is not able to provide for is an obligation of the State and not of charitable citizens. In any case, I do not see that, fundamentally, it makes much difference whether the taxpayer pays for the relief in his rates or in contributions to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Public opinion in this country will not tolerate men and women dying of starvation.  If we cannot maintain them in one way, then we are going to do it in the other, and productive industry, particularly the agricultural industry, will foot the bill in the end.  The effect of this Bill upon the ratepayers of Dublin will be, I hope, to make them realise that while they continue along the road they have been going in the past this burden upon them is going to continue and to grow in volume.  If the Bill has that effect it will be well worth its passage here.  If it has the effect of awakening the national consciousness to the seriousness of the problem of unemployment, and of producing a vigorous demand for a proper solution of that problem, it will be one of the most useful Bills that has ever come before this Dáil.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, Deputy Good, of course, is seriously concerned with the fact that this Bill became necessary before the tenure of office of the Commissioners expired.  The account of their work which could be shown upon paper will not look half so bright after this additional impost upon the rates has been made as it would if that impost had never been thought of. I think it is possible that if the Commissioners were quite as good as Deputy Good represents them to be, the full increase of 5/- in the pound might not be necessary in order to provide the funds necessary to give relief to the 5,000 people involved in this measure.  Deputy Good was, no doubt, listening to questions that were asked to-day concerning pensions given to two rate-collectors. There have been in other directions indications that the handing of the paw to political friends was not altogether confined to the old Dublin Corporation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not relevant I may as well leave the matter.  It seems to me, in any case, that one of the reasons why this Bill has to be introduced is because the Commissioners managed the affairs of the City of Dublin as they did during the past four years.  If the old Corporation, not necessarily the old members of the Corporation, but if the old municipal council had remained in office, I believe that long before the year 1929 this problem of relieving distress in Dublin would have been tackled in a much more serious way than it is at the moment. The principal reason why this impost upon the citizens of the capital to provide for the relief of the destitute poor is going to have the result of increasing unemployment and discouraging business enterprise is because of the method employed of securing municipal funds by taxing rental values.  If the funds of the City of Dublin were raised by some other method, or if they were supplemented by funds raised by some other method, it would be possible to secure this quarter of a million of money without necessarily producing the same consequences&mdash;as will be produced by an increase in the rates.  I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government has ever contemplated giving powers to a municipal council to impose taxes of other kinds than on rental values. If, for example, the Dublin Corporation was empowered to levy luxury taxes upon dances, dog racing, picture houses and functions of that kind in order to provide funds for giving relief to the poor, these funds could be secured in a manner that would not impose the burden upon industry that an increase in the rates will involve.  It seems to me that if the question of municipal government and the question of raising funds for the relief of distress in municipal areas were properly considered, we could devise ways and means for getting those funds in a manner that would weigh much less <Col N="472" /> heavily upon the people of the city than the present method does. Whether or not the Minister has considered that, or whether or not he would be prepared to seek statutory powers to enable the Dublin Corporation to raise funds in that way either in this Bill or under any other Bill, there is a case, despite what some Deputies have said, for calling upon State funds to relieve the Dublin ratepayers in the matter of meeting the abnormal unemployment that exists in Dublin at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly a large number of unemployed from other counties gravitate to Dublin.  Of course, it is equally true, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, that people other than unemployed come to Dublin. But if Deputy O'Connell examines the census returns he will find that the movement from the country towards the capital has been very pronounced in recent years.  The increase in population which has taken place in the Dublin area in the last intercensal period is proof of that. Apart altogether from the question of whether it is fair or equitable to tax the whole body of the people in order to help to relieve unemployment in Dublin, it is undoubtedly advisable to do so, because of the consequences which an increase of five shillings in the rates will inevitably have.  We might argue for weeks here as to whether it was fair to ask for a contribution out of State funds for the benefit of Dublin ratepayers, but I fear we would not be any wiser at the end of our discussions than we were at the beginning. But I suggest to the Minister and Deputies that, leaving the question of equity out of it altogether, it is advisable to do so, because the problem that exists in Dublin is altogether different from the problem that exists in most other counties.  I do not think there is any other area in Ireland that has been called upon, or is likely to be called upon, to bear a five shilling rate for the purpose of providing relief for able-bodied destitute poor. That fact alone is an indication that the problem here in the City of Dublin <Col N="473" /> is an abnormal one, and that the abnormal burden involved by it is going to produce economic consequences that will react not merely upon the people of this city, but on the people of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, in his introductory remarks, pointed out that while the statutory powers intended to be conferred by this Bill upon the Dublin Corporation were withheld, the State had to come to the aid of the municipality by giving numerous grants to be used towards the relief of unemployment. Presumably the Minister for Finance hopes that, as a result of this Bill, the continuance of those grants will not be necessary&mdash;in other words, that the burden of providing for the unemployed will, in fact, be transferred from the Exchequer to the Dublin ratepayers.  The very fact that such grants were given strengthens the case for the continuance of aid from the Exchequer to the Dublin Corporation in its efforts to meet the abnormal problem that exists here.  The Committee, as the Minister pointed out, recommended that 50 per cent. of the entire cost should come from Government funds.  I am not suggesting that the Government contribution should be 50 per cent., 20 per cent., or 75 per cent., but I think that some contribution should be given because of the various reasons which I have stated.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Cooper is an important one.  I thoroughly agree with him that it would be unfair to ask the farmers of Balrothery area, for example, as it would be to ask the farmers of County Meath and County Kildare to contribute towards the relief of the unemployed in the City of Dublin area.  Whatever case can be made, as he points out, for imposing a charge on one can be made for the other.  I do not think that Deputy Cooper understood Deputy O'Kelly's point.  Deputy O'Kelly is of opinion, and I am also, that the urban districts in Rathdown, which Deputy Cooper mentioned, should be included in the area of charge for the <Col N="474" /> city.  It seems to me that we can group into one area of charge all the urban districts, and in another area all the rural districts.  The exclusion of the costal townships from the area of charge in the city is, in my opinion, inequitable and unwise.  The case, however, for helping the ratepayers of the municipal area from State funds remains, and that means that the small farmers, shopkeepers and traders of the rest of Ireland will be asked to help to meet the abnormal problem that exists here.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to assert that this problem is abnormal because the Government have failed in their duty as a Government, because they have watched this problem of unemployment develop during the last seven or eight years and taken no serious steps to deal with it.  This Bill should be interpreted by the House as a vote of censure upon the Department of Industry and Commerce, for if that Department had been actively at work endeavouring to stimulate industrial production, and working on the right lines to provide employment, the necessity for this Bill to deal with abnormal unemployment would not then exist.  I hope the ratepayers of Dublin, when they get the demand notes, as Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, will realise that is the true situation and take the first opportunity they get to indicate their desire for a change of Government policy in that regard.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly that we are bound to feed the hungry.  The Poor Law Relief Bill before the House is designed for that purpose.  I will draw the attention of the House to a very important statement made by Dr. O'Dwyer before the Chamber of Commerce.  He said: &ldquo;The presence in our midst of large numbers of men anxious and willing to work but unable to get it must be admitted.&rdquo; And he went on to add: &ldquo;The proper solution of the problem was a policy directed towards increasing industry and employment.&rdquo;  With these two propositions I find myself in complete agreement.  I would like to remind <Col N="475" /> Deputy Good, who pointed out one fact which nobody in this House can deny, namely, that the greater burden of the upkeep of this State is thrown on the shoulders of agriculture, that this country was at one time a highly industrialised State, and that it is quite possible to bring back that high degree of industrialisation if the proper means are adopted.  I suppose if I said to Deputy Good that in the year 1782 the foreign exports of Ireland were equal almost to the foreign exports of England, he would find it very difficult to believe that fact.  I would like to remind Deputy Good that this country has lost many industries which it could have, such as the manufacture of cottons, muslins, flannels, calicoes, glass, glass cutlery, and others.  These could be and should be made in this country.  If that could be accomplished it would provide work for the unemployed, and that is the only true solution of the problem.  It may be interesting to state that from 1782 to 1796&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that unless we find employment by means of industrial remedies the problem of unemployment will never be dealt with in this city.  This State owes a duty to the individual and the individual owes a duty to the State.  The introduction of this Bill is not performing the duty which the State owes to the individual.  Ratepayers of the City of Dublin should not be called upon to support the bulk of the unemployed of the whole <Col N="476" /> country, and in effect that is what this Bill means.  Dublin city is not unwilling to do its duty to the destitute poor.  The City of Dublin has always done its duty to them.  Under this Bill the ratepayers of the City of Dublin are asked to support the destitute poor from almost the whole of the country.  It has been admitted by various speakers in this House that there has been a continuous influx of people from every part of the country.  Nobody can possibly deny that statement.  That has been going on continuously day after day.  It has been pointed out by the leader of the Labour Party to-day that some of the people who come from the country do not become unemployed.  It must be remembered that there is only a limited volume of employment to be had in the City of Dublin.  If a man comes from the country to Dublin and succeeds in getting a job in the city, though he does not become a burden on the rates, it means that he deprives another man in the city of getting employment.  The exodus of the people from the country to the capital is the cause of unemployment in our midst.  If a man comes to the city from the country and fails to get employment he becomes a burden on the ratepayers.  Dublin under this Bill is asked to support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State does not take proper steps to deal with the unemployment question, speaking from this side of the House I consider it will be a very serious matter for the Government Party.  Two alternatives lie before the Government.  As far as the unemployment question is concerned they must either take some action to prevent the continuous influx of people from the country districts into Dublin, or they must shoulder the cost of the Bill if these people are to be maintained in the city.  No man could justify the fact that the ratepayers of the city are to support the unemployed from all parts of the country.  That is the actual position at the moment.  Anyone who paid attention to the statement made by Dr. O'Dwyer before the Chamber of Commerce will realise that the unemployment <Col N="477" /> problem is becoming more and more acute every day.  The amount spent on relief in this country in 1914 was £1,063,000, and in 1927 £1,596,000.  The cost to the ratepayers of the Dublin Union was in 1914 £133,000 and in 1927 £264,000.  This Bill will impose a further burden on the ratepayers of the city if it passes through the House.</P>
    <P>The ratepayers have already to bear a burden of £264,000 and the Bill proposes to place an additional burden of £250,000 on their shoulders for the relief of the poor.  Taking indoor and outdoor relief it means that the ratepayers of Dublin will have to find over half a million for the purposes of relief.  When the Shannon scheme is completed what will become of those who lose their employment and will be cast out on the streets?  They will have to gravitate to Dublin, swell the ranks of the unemployed in the city and add to the burdens placed on the shoulders of the ratepayers in the city.  I agree with the speakers who said that this is a national and not a local problem.  The ratepayers of Dublin should not, in the state of economic depression that prevails in the city, be asked to bear the burden of this Bill&mdash;this gigantic burden which it imposes of over £500,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I may be asked what are the alternatives to that.  Are there alternatives? There are, but they must be State alternatives.  If we are unable to bear the burden of over half a million for the upkeep of the destitute poor the State is bound, in my opinion, to give a very substantial contribution to enable the ratepayers of the City of Dublin to meet that bill.  As I have already said, if we are to support the unemployed of this country nobody can deny that the State must come in and help us. Reference was made as to what other countries are doing.  If we glance at what other countries are doing in regard to unemployment and see how they compare with this country, we find that in Great Britain, if thirty contributions have been paid within <Col N="478" /> the two last insurance years preceding the date of claim, the applicant can have benefit as long as his unemployment lasts.  Even across channel these measures were found to be inadequate to deal with the unemployment problem and the insurance scheme there has been modified so that any person contributing eight insurance contributions for the last two years, or thirty contributions for the whole time of insurance, is entitled to relief the whole time that he remains unemployed.</P>
    <P>In this country we give one week's benefit in respect of seven weeks' unemployment insurance contributions. I draw attention to the fact that last year the &ldquo;Trade and Labour Gazette&rdquo; stated that the unemployment insurance fund was exhausted by over seven million pounds.  There is one thing that cannot be denied by anyone who pays attention to what that means.  It is this, namely, that across Channel they recognise unemployment as a national problem, while here we are endeavouring to throw that national problem on to the ratepayers of the City of Dublin.  Deputy Good referred to the effect that the passing of this Bill will have on industry in general in the City of Dublin. Though I do not generally agree with what Deputy Good says, I must say that I am in agreement with every word he uttered from that particular angle.  When this Bill passes we will have to face the statement of the Commissioners that there will be an immediate increase in the rates of from 5/- to 6/9, bringing the rates of the city to over 20/- in the £. Will any business man contend that any industrialist would, under conditions such as those, set up a new industry in the city?  Will anybody contend that a foreign industrialist will venture to come here and set up an industry with overhead charges by way of rates amounting to 20/- in the £?  The only possible effect that this Bill will have, so far as industry and commerce generally are concerned, is the complete cessation of any industrial activity and the complete failure of any further development under that head.  I <Col N="479" /> would point out that this Bill only goes as far as 1931.  Does any Deputy, looking at the present economic position of the city, contend that in the year 1931 the unemployed in the city can go without the contributions that must be paid under this Bill?</P>

      <P>We will have got around another corner, but not around the unemployment corner. This is a national obligation, and it is unjust for the Government to put the burden on the ratepayers of the city.  I know how hard-pressed the ratepayers are now, and how difficult it is for them to meet their commitments, especially in the case of small business men, some of whom will have to pay rates ranging from £20 to £40 per annum.  As things are, they find it difficult enough to pay the present rates, and how they will meet the increased rates when this Bill passes is beyond my comprehension. They have families to keep, they are industrious and hardworking, and this burden is one which they will not be able to bear. It is up to the State to make at least a fifty per cent. contribution to deal with this abnormal situation as requested by the Commissioners of the city.  I have no doubt that if the Minister in charge of this Bill can see his way to make that contribution, so far as our Party is concerned it will not lose by the contribution not only in the city but throughout the whole country.  Deputy O'Connell asked why this should not be applied to other parts of the country, but he knows as well as I do that Dublin men do not go to the country to seek employment.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether we should recognise the contribution to the debate by Deputy Byrne as an indication of a division in the Government ranks.  It is nothing new to us on these benches to express the view that it is the duty of the State to provide work for the unemployed and sustenance for those unable to work.  Deputy Byrne has probably been reading the constitution of this Party, because he gave expression to many things which are in our programme.  Members of the Government have stated on more than one occasion that they do not regard the problem of unemployment as a national one.  It is only now, when Deputy Byrne feels that this matter is going to affect the ratepayers of Dublin that he raises his voice to say that these charges should be placed on the country at large.  It is only when the shoe pinches that Deputy Byrne finds sympathy with what we have been preaching for many years.  I do not say this in a personal way about the Deputy, but I say that it is time that he realised the position.</P>

The Minister in charge of the Bill has got the solution of this problem in his own hands, and if he is genuinely anxious to go some way towards solving the problem he can do so.  In Dublin grants have been made by the Government for the building of houses with imported bricks, while brick factories here are on half time.</P>

      <P>I say that the Government have no right to give subsidies for the building of houses with foreign bricks while native material is available and can be got quite as good and as cheap as foreign material.  If they encourage the use of native material for the building of the houses which I have in mind they would give some employment in particular areas.  A good deal has been said about unemployed people not being living for a certain number of years in Dublin.  I have no sympathy with that point of view. I sympathise with the people of Dublin who have to pay an increased contribution towards solving a problem that should be solved by the Government.  I do not say that any ratepayer in Dublin will cry and consider that he is doing wrong in contributing his portion towards the relief of distress, a situation which has been brought about by the Government in mismanaging the industrial and economic situation.  I agree that he has a &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; and that he will feel that a lot has been put on his shoulders.  I hope, when the general election comes, that the Government will get the answer they deserve for being the cause of putting this burden on the shoulders of the people of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will require some explanation when it is going through Committee.  It is all very well stating that certain things will be done, but this Bill will involve something about which there will be a lot of red tape.  When the Bill is going through Committee, I would like the Minister to make a clear and definite statement regarding the interpretation of Section 4.  Section 4 of the Bill means that an unemployed person can go to the union and seek relief, and the union in turn can demand work in exchange.  You may have a healthy, able-bodied man, as pointed out by Deputy O'Kelly, possibly a tradesman, and you are going to put him on work such as road building for a few days a <Col N="482" /> week.  You are going to make a sick man out of him after the winter season is over.  He will be doing spade and shovel work for a few days' pay, and he has got to nourish himself and consider himself lucky and consider that the State is doing well for him.  On the other hand, you have people who are very weak and who are constantly unemployed, and they are to be set working side by side with this other man.  I would like some explanation from the Minister as to what work is to be done and how he is going to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of charge, supposing an unemployed man comes along and, as is quite usual, has not an address in Dublin.  He has not lived in the city; perhaps he has slept in the Park sometimes and at other times on the roadside in the country.  To whom is he going to be charged?  Under this Bill that man can get no relief because he has no address and no home and there is no area to which the relief given him can be charged.  Again, you have widows with children.  How are you going to deal with them? We are quite serious in demanding something definite of the Government towards the alleviation of the distress which exists.  The Government is putting a big burden on Dublin, and we, in Dublin city, have a right to know what we are paying for.  I would like the Minister to be as clear as he can on that particular point.  The charitable institutions, too, are interested in the passage of the Bill.  They are interested to know what Section 4 of this Bill is going to mean.  I was glad to hear that Dublin will get some relief from some trouble they expected to suffer in the near future.  I was glad to hear that the Shannon Board will have to continue to pay rates on the Dublin property which it has taken over from the City of Dublin.  The citizens of Dublin were rather afraid that they were going to have increased rates in that respect, and I am glad to think that can be considered as a contribution towards this extra impost.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Connell <Col N="483" /> who referred to Dublin city in connection with people coming in from outside and not finding work here. I want to emphasise as far as I am concerned that I am not going to differentiate between unemployed hungry persons.  I am not going to ask the House to say: &ldquo;Where did this man come from?  How long has he been in Dublin?&rdquo;  All I want to see is that the hungry and needy will be dealt with without making any distinction as to where they come from.  I would say, however, that Dublin city has no say whatever, either the county or the metropolitan area, in the administration of the country as a whole.  They have no say in helping to bring about a change in the attitude of the Government as regards industrial development.  Nevertheless, the Government has a say over the city and over the different areas and is putting this impost on the citizens of Dublin, regardless of the fact that they themselves must bear the responsibility for the position with which we are faced to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. J. Byrne referred strongly to the fact that people were coming into the city from the country and were displacing people in the city.  I visualised what he wanted.  He wanted an inter-county customs barrier set up so that a man from Wexford would not be allowed into Wicklow, or a man from Wicklow into Dublin, as long as a man in Dublin was unemployed.  If Deputy Byrne knew a little more about customs barriers, he would realise that there is a good deal in what we say. If we can bring about an improvement in the industrial position generally, we can solve the unemployment problem, but in the meantime it is the Government's duty to provide relief not only in the city but in the country.  The sooner they realise that the better it will be, not only for the people of Dublin city, but for the people of the country who wish to find employment. <Col N="484" /> Deputy Good states that industry is going to suffer and that some outside firms who were going to open factories here will not do so.  If factories are going to be opened at the rate they have been opening, and if unemployment is going to be increased at the rate it has been increasing for the last five or six years, I say we will have to take the matter into our own hands, because great strides have not been made, as the Deputy suggested, and a great increase in the number employed has not come about.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to say that I am not recognising at all any relation between what Deputy Good was trying to develop&mdash;cause and effect.  I am facing this as it confronts me, that is, that something must be done to alleviate the condition of a certain number of people who live amongst us, and it is in that spirit I approach the matter.  That is why I particularly emphasise the fact that I want the Minister to give such information as he can in regard to Section 4, and particularly sub-sections (1) and (2).  The Bill will have a great bearing, not only on industry, but it will have a great bearing and effect on life in the city generally.  The city could, if it wished, and if the Corporation were in being, start some scheme of a reproductive nature.  We have always contended on these benches that the State should start some schemes of a reproductive nature.  At one time, a Lord Mayor of Dublin&mdash;I am not saying whether the scheme was good or bad&mdash;had an idea to reclaim a great portion of Merrion Strand. That would have given employment in the city and would have reclaimed for the ratepayers of the city a great deal of valuable property.  If the Government were to face the question on that basis, to see if they could not formulate schemes of a reproductive nature, and so provide work that would be of some benefit to the ratepayers of the city, we would be getting nearer a condition of things that we all want to see, the disappearance of unemployment in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I rise to support the general principles of the Bill, there are certain sections, notably Sections 2, 3 and 4 which I would like to see altered.  It was not my intention to intervene in the debate and I would not have done so were it not for what I might term the peculiar speech delivered by Deputy Good.  The Deputy is one of those persons who believes that human interests should be made subordinate to industry.  I hold the other way about.  In the course of his remarks Deputy Good made reference to the point that he was mostly concerned with the serious burden that would be placed upon the ratepayers. Apparently, he was more concerned with that aspect than with the destitution that exists in the Balrothery area in addition to Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Baldoyle and Malahide. I think destitution exists there to a very large extent.  I could only infer from Deputy Good's remarks that he believes unemployment and destitution are necessary evils which must always exist and, consequently, which will have to be remedied by charity or in other ways.  He does not believe that destitution is a very urgent problem as far as Dublin city and county are concerned.  Does the Deputy realise that this Bill, in essence, is only asking for the destitute in Dublin city and county the same treatment as is given to destitute people in practically every other county?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned that this would be an exceptionally big burden on industry and it might deter certain people in County Dublin, who are thinking of opening industries, from doing so.  Is the Deputy aware that in North County Dublin industries have closed, not because of any burden in the way of rates being placed upon them, but because of the endeavours of rings and combines to control the prices of particular commodities?  I will refer, as an example, to the Portmarnock Brick Works.  That industry was not closed down through any burden in the way of rates, but it was closed <Col N="486" /> down by the action of a certain master builders' association in order to create an artificial scarcity of bricks and in order to inflate the price of building material.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good has also mentioned that people who are destitute come in from other counties and those people should not be made a charge on the residents in Dublin city and county.  Arguing on these lines, would Deputy Good maintain that, as regards the rebuilding of the Four Courts or the Custom House, the money which was expended on that work should be borne exclusively by the people of Dublin? Does the Deputy not agree that certain employment was given in the city on that work for which counties outside Dublin were obliged to put forward money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good mentioned that a large number of people are unemployed owing to physical defects, and they are being helped by charitable organisations within the City and County of Dublin.  I quite agree, but the Deputy puts forward the peculiar suggestion that this Bill is going to infringe on the work of those organisations.  Does the Deputy believe that that work should be exclusively carried out by charitable organisations, and that it is not work for the State or for local authorities? Does the Deputy not know that those charitable organisations are only doing the work because the State <Col N="487" /> and the local authorities in some cases have actually shirked their duty?</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that the principal duty of a government is to look after the interests and the welfare of the people.  If a government is going to allow the people to go destitute and leave them in the position of not having sufficient to provide for wives and families, that government is certainly not doing its duty.</P>
    <P>I admit that this Bill goes a bit of the way; it does not go a sufficient distance.  Deputy O'Connell referred to Section 4, which provides that people who are getting relief may be called upon to perform a certain work, and power is going to be given to the local authority to acquire land and, if necessary, machinery for the purpose of giving such work.  What is actually behind that suggestion? Does it mean, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, that people in receipt of outdoor relief will be called upon to do work probably at a starvation rate of wages and so keep employment from others at the regular trade union rates?  It is suggested that an attempt may be made by the Government to do that in view of the fact that certain relief works were carried out in Dublin and in Donegal at wages less than the regular rates. I hope that is not the intention of the Government and that they will not run up against the trade unions in Dublin city and county by endeavouring to act upon these lines.</P>
    <P>It is stipulated in Section 2 that in order to get relief a person must be resident in the area for two years. I think that stipulation should not be allowed through.  If a person comes to Dublin in search of work after walking the highways and byways and is unable to obtain that work, and he, with his wife and family, is destitute, he should not be turned down.  Power is given under Section 3 with reference to a person who has been two years in residence that the Union can pay reasonable expenses so as to send that person to some other place.  To what other place? <Col N="488" /> I hope the Government will not adopt the policy of the Conservative Government in England when they endeavoured to get people to emigrate in order to solve the problem of destitution and unemployment. The Minister may say that that is not the intention, but if the section is passed it may mean that a union could pay a person's fare to America in order to remedy any destitution that may exist.  Such a tendency would depopulate a country which is already too far depopulated.</P>

      <P>It is said that open confession is good for the soul.  Certainly no one could deny that this Bill is a very eloquent confession of the failure of Government policy on most vital and important matters affecting the welfare of our people. We cannot but think of the professions of our leading Government spokesmen through the country during the last few years and we recollect the number of corners that we were told we had been turning almost annually.  We find we have arrived now at the real corner when we have to admit, as this Bill admits, that the position has become so dangerous that we must find some means of staving off something worse.  Here is the remedy, a temporary remedy of course.  We heard from Deputy Tierney two or three <Col N="489" /> weeks ago that when the history of the past eight years comes to be written it will be found that it was the most prosperous period in the history of this country.  Just think of that declaration from the leading spokesman of the Government Party and try to reconcile it with the conditions which make this Bill necessary. Is it any wonder that we have become the laughing stock of same and sensible people outside this country?  The circumstances that have brought this position about have been created and deliberately encouraged, by both the State and the administrators of local government in this city.  We had here some months ago in this City of Dublin a floating ballroom on the Liffey and on that floating ballroom we had an imported band, brought over from London.

      <P>And I will leave it to the House to say how far I am <Col N="491" /> accurate in saying that the City Commissioners are morally responsible by virtue of inactivity, gross carelessness or deliberate connivance with certain interests in this city in the creation of circumstances which necessitated this Bill this evening.  I did not get up for the sake of talking.  I rose because of what Deputy Good said here.  I felt I must retort.  Deputy Good has come forth again with a terrible wail on behalf of the industrialists in this country.  He talked for ten or fifteen minutes about the terrible difficulties under which industrialists are labouring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us also that a lot of poor, unemployed people have been gravitating towards the City of Dublin.  He told us that there is a terrible influx of the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; into Dublin.  But what about the influx of another set of individuals from different countries who have come to the city, individuals of the Deputy Good brand, who have come here and invested certain monies in industries, the profits on which are sent off to foreign countries?  Who are the greatest enemies of our society&mdash;they or the poor, unfortunate unemployed citizens?  I put that question to Deputy Good for serious consideration. We have, let us say, a man who, because through the accident of birth or some other circumstance, happens to come into possession of a certain amount of money, comes over here, happens to start industries and incidentally, of course, gives employment.  The profits of that industry are sent off to foreign investors.  I will leave it at that with this addition, that I have yet to learn where and when any industrialists of the Deputy Good brand ever happened to start an industry in this country in the belief that its primary object was the giving of employment to the people with a view to increasing their standard of living.  I have yet to <Col N="492" /> learn when and where that has been done by any of these individuals.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as Deputy Lemass has said, if the passing of this measure is to inflict a penalty on the ratepayers, they have richly deserved that penalty, those of them who are native born and who should be national, but who refuse to exercise their influence in their organisation and see to it that we have a proper national administration in control here.  Having failed to do that, they richly deserve the penalties which this measure is going to inflict upon them.  I hope that as a result of this Bill there will be an awakening brought about in their ranks, and that they will come to realise that there is only one hope for this country if it is to be saved from utter and inevitable bankruptcy. We are heading rapidly in that direction.  The only hope is that if the present Government are not prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure that our unemployment problem will be tackled, not in some haphazard manner, not for the mere sake of gaining political kudos for the time being, but for the sake of dealing with the problem as it should be dealt with, by facing it as a national problem&mdash;let them face up to their responsibilities as claiming to be leaders of national thought &mdash;the ratepayers will, when they find that this measure has been passed through both Houses, and that it is going to impose an increase upon their rates, have a remedy for that, and the remedy is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of our party on this Bill has been made clear, so that it is not necessary for me to deal with it at any great length.  We have made it quite clear that we regard this Bill as fulfilling a part of the duty of the State.  We believe that to allow people to starve in our midst is inhuman and unChristian, and should not be permitted, no matter what the burden of relieving it may be.  But at the same time we have made it quite clear that we do not think this is the way to deal with the major problem. We recognise this Bill as a temporary  <Col N="493" /> expedient, and as such we support it.  But we want everybody to realise that our attitude towards it is simply to regard it as a temporary expedient, that we believe it will in no way save us from having possibly greater burdens to bear.  In other words, we agree with Deputy Good to a certain extent that it is quite possible that the acceptance of this burden, if we depend upon measures like this, may lead to a situation in which we will be increasing the burden until it completely breaks our back.</P>
      <P>As for the burden itself, our view is that it ought to be distributed somewhat. I think that the Minister should have given us some indication of what the burden is likely to be. We have had to gather it from statements in the Press, and I think that is not right.  The Minister should have given us some indication, as the result of the researches of his Department, of what the total amount of the burden is likely to be.  It would appear from the statements that have been made by the Commissioners that it will amount to something like an increase of 30 per cent. on the present rates in the City of Dublin.  I think that that is not an overestimate; that it is, roughly, the figure that one would arrive at from the information given by the Commissioners. Is it right that the City of Dublin should bear that burden? We believe that it should not bear it unaided, that in a sense this burden is one that the community at large, all the people of the Twenty-six Counties, ought to bear a portion of. An exact apportionment might be a matter of some difficulty, but in a case like this, which involves the very sudden increase of 30 per cent. on the existing burden of Dublin, we think that the country as a whole ought to come in and help; that is, that the State ought to assist the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a way in which the State could do it.  We think that a considerable portion of the money which the State should give to assist Dublin could be got by a tax on luxuries and amusements.  Such a tax, properly graded so that it would fall on those who would best be able to bear <Col N="494" /> it, would bring in a certain amount at any rate, and we believe that that sum should be definitely assigned to assist Dublin in the relief which it should get.</P>
    <P>We are very clear on the other matter that was raised by Deputy Cooper.  As a matter of fact, he simply used the arguments that had already been used in our Party when we were discussing the matter.  We think that Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire, for instance, ought to be coupled with the other townships. As Deputy Lemass pointed out, that was what Deputy O'Kelly referred to when he said that the charge should be distributed over the county, and he spoke immediately after of the urbanised areas in the county.  That was what clearly he had in mind.  We believe that the urban areas ought to be grouped together to help to bear this burden, and that the State ought to give a substantial contribution, because we think it unfair that there should be a sudden increase of, roughly, 30 per cent. put on the city rates.  Of course it will be argued by Deputies from the country that the salaries are spent in the city, and perhaps there is a good deal in that argument.  It might be one of the reasons why the contribution from the Exchequer to the city should not be as large as we might otherwise think it should be.</P>
    <P>It was particularly to stress the fact that the State ought to come in at this stage, and also to point out that it would only be just that the State should get that money by way of a special tax on luxuries and amusements, that I intervened in the debate.</P>

      <P>Not being a Deputy for Dublin city or county it will not be taken that I am in any way looking for votes in rising to speak on this Bill.  Several points were raised by Deputies J.J. Byrne and Good to which I would like to refer.  I do not want to hit the industrialists.  I know that it is a vicious circle&mdash; that if you kill industry you kill employment and add to the unemployed list.  But when Deputy J.J. Byrne says he consults the interests of Dublin and of the citizens of <Col N="495" /> Dublin, I wonder if he thinks for a moment that those unemployed are also citizens of Dublin and that their interests must be consulted too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Wolfe Tone.  Thanks for the correction.  He appealed to the men of no property on whom Ireland relied many a time in her hour of need and from whom she found help.  We talk of the burden which will be put on the rates. Quite so, and as Deputy de Valera said, the State might bear some portion of it and not put the whole burden on the city.  But industrialists should realise, shopkeepers should realise, that by leaving the poor in the terrible conditions under which they now live they are indirectly paying, in the ill-health of these people, what they will pay directly under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a wealthy city; there are very few people here with great fortunes, and I am afraid that those with moderate means do not realise their responsibilities to their fellow-citizens. There are some thousands in the city that I know of who know nothing of the conditions under which people exist in the back streets; they keep to the show places and the places of amusement. I do not think they would go with such light hearts to these places of amusement if they realised how some of their fellow-citizens live, or try to live, for &ldquo;live&rdquo; is not a word to be applied to them.  I am not a kill-joy; amusement is necessary, and we are told that variety is the spice of life.  But there are some thousands at present in Dublin to whom life is all variety and all spice. All variety and all spice is not a wholesome diet, morally or otherwise. If less were spent on amusements it would be better, and there <Col N="496" /> would be more to help the poor.  If the whole State were roused to a sense of its responsibility and to a sense of the terrible conditions existing in the by-streets and in the lanes of Dublin the people would not be unwilling to contribute something to relieve that distress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good suggested that emigration might be a solution.  It might, but a howl was raised in the north-eastern corner of this country when emigration was suggested as a solution of their unemployment problem.  We are not going to have it as a solution in the Twenty-six Counties either, though it is solving the problem to a certain extent.  I was in Connemara on Monday; I passed, between Maam Cross and Galway city, four cars, two of which I believe were loaded with the trunks and boxes of emigrants leaving Connemara. That is a very bad trade to have down there.</P>
    <P>Finance must, of course, be taken into consideration and so must industry, but charity is greater than finance and is greater than industry. I am quite certain that when the country understands how these poor people live here, or starve here, it will not be unwilling to bear portion of this burden so that such a sudden increase would not be put on the rates of this city as would lead to the aggravation of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy Mr. T. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): Although not a Deputy representing Dublin city still, as an Irishman, I take a great interest in its prosperity and I was exceedingly pained to-night to listen to the speeches that were delivered on the opposite side of the House.  In place of applying themselves with energy towards trying to improve the Bill on behalf of the poor, they seized the opportunity to denounce and attack the Government. A few minutes ago a Deputy stated that for the last eight years the Government were doing nothing but promoting unemployment.  I challenge him now to state what condition employment was in eight years ago, and what the condition is to-day.  From close observation of <Col N="497" /> how things are going I have no hesitation in stating that to a great extent the men who are responsible for unemployment and for emigration are the Opposition.  Their policy for the last eight years has been a policy of upsetting the State.  No wonder that the young men and women of the Twenty-six Counties despair of the future when there is no improvement whatever in the policy of the people opposite.  They are in a narrow, garrulous and miserable mood all through, only anxious that a day would come that would place them in power with good salaries.</P>
      <P>Their action to-night, and their solicitude for the poor of Dublin I take cum grano salis.  I do so unquestionably because there was no sincerity in what they said.  When the Estimates were being discussed in this House a few months ago every single Deputy in that party, and a great number of Labour Deputies, opposed them, and if they had the power there would not be a man employed by the Land Commission or on drainage work, the Guards would be sacked, the soldiers would be sacked, the teachers would be sacked, and then we would have the Opposition in power.  God help the poor if they were dependent on those on the opposite side, who are so solicitous about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tell them that they have a remedy in their hands.  I tell Deputy de Valera here and before the people of the Twenty-Six Counties that they have a great opportunity if they would realise for once their duty to their country.  If they drop this cross-firing, criticism and jealousy and join with us hand in hand to build up the nation the world will look upon us with pride. During the last month I saw the representative of 130,000,000 of the great people of the United States present in the Strangers' Gallery. What did the United States send an Ambassador here for?  They sent him here, recognising that we are a sovereign State, one that deserves the credit and the approval of the world at large.  In a short time the greatest living monarch, Pope Pius <Col N="498" /> XI., will send an Ambassador to the Free State, recognising that we are an independent sovereign State. Under these circumstances why are we down-hearted?  To Deputy de Valera I would say: &ldquo;Raise up your heart, throw away all these little criticisms, join with us manfully, show the world we are a united nation, and that we are gaining as we go along.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies, Dublin Deputies in particular, have alluded to the large number of people that come from the country to Dublin, and the suggestion has been made by Deputy Good and others that those who are unemployed and who came from the country should be sent back.  I wonder do these Deputies realise that the movement to Dublin only followed the movement of business firms from country districts, and from other cities, to Dublin&mdash;portion of the policy of centralisation of the Government. When we saw Dobbyn Ogilvie, Crosse and Blackwell, and other firms leaving Cork and starting in Dublin it was only natural that the unemployed would follow to look for the employment that was taken away from them in Cork.  This is all portion of the policy of centralisation of the Government.  Why? The Minister for Industry and Commerce when speaking on the motion for a tariff on flour made a statement about flour mills throughout the country and suggested that if they were moved elsewhere they would do better.  There was the suggestion that if they moved them, perhaps to Dublin, they might get consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements were made that the country at large should bear the burden.  I think the country at large has enough burdens to bear for the City of Dublin.  The money of the country at large is going to pay some hundreds of civil servants who are working in Dublin and whose salaries are contributing to Dublin rates.  The policy of centralisation in the Local Government Department is now carried so far that if a sweeping brush is wanted for Cork Union <Col N="499" /> it must be bought from the trade list of a Dublin firm.  I think the present Bill is a sad commentary on Government policy, both the policy of centralisation, which occupies so much of the mind of the Minister for Local Government, and the policy of doing nothing, which has been the policy of the whole Executive Council for the last eight years.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I want to suggest that he is speaking under a misapprehension.  The policy of this Bill is that Dublin will bear its own burden.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  On a point of explanation.  I made my remarks to clear up that point.  The point is that the State Exchequer should do it, and I indicated how the State Exchequer could do it by special taxes on amusements and luxuries&mdash;the incidence of which would be mainly on Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who walks through this city can see a cinema or a theatre in nearly every street. If a tax was put upon these places it would help to contribute towards the support of the unemployed.  I would like to know from the Minister, as a member of the Executive Council, what he has done with all the millions that have been raised abroad for the purpose of starting industries.  Have they gone into the rapacious maw of the salaried officials, or have any of them gone to the starting of industries which would render a Bill like this unnecessary? If the Executive Council goes abroad every two years and borrows £10,000,000 to start industries, and again goes abroad in two years time and borrows more money to start industries, and if there are still no industries started, it is time <Col N="500" /> that people should know where the money is going.</P>
      <P>I regret that this Bill is necessary but I do not agree with those gentlemen here who state that all the country people are rushing up to Dublin looking for work.  Anybody walking on the streets of Cork today can see a great influx of Dublin people into Cork in connection with Henry Ford's factory.  If those people get unemployed in Cork we do not say that the City of Dublin should pay relief for them.</P>
      <P>I realise, unfortunately, this Bill is necessary, but I consider that the direct responsibility for the Bill rests with the Executive Council, who have mismanaged the finances of the State, who have made no effort whatever to relieve unemployment here and who now make this effort, which is not an effort but a sop.  Even the people of the City of Dublin cannot bear this burden for all time, but we see no effort being made to put an end to it in the way it can be put an end to, to start industries in this country with all the millions that they are borrowing abroad, avowedly for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have said, we are accepting this Bill without welcoming it, because no one can welcome a counter-irritant as a substitute for a cure, and that is precisely what this Bill is.  By irritating the psychology of the members of the Chamber of Commerce of Dublin to the tune, as Deputy Good said, of 5/- in the £, we are going during the coming winter to induce, if we can, the great mass of the unemployed of the city to forget the painful symptoms which they themselves have been feeling of an economic disease which is general to the whole State.  This Bill and the problems which we are faced with in Dublin are largely the result of causes which are operating everywhere throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  The symptoms of starvation, poverty and unemployment are more severe and possibly more likely to be chronic here than elsewhere throughout the country.  For that reason it has been argued since the <Col N="501" /> position here is a result of general causes and of a general policy, that the Government which has been responsible for that policy ought to take upon itself some of the responsibility not only of the poorer constituencies of Dublin city and of Dublin county, but of the constituencies throughout the Twenty-Six Counties for alleviating that problem.</P>
      <P>We have suggested that that responsibility should be accepted in a limited way.  It has been suggested by Deputy de Valera that some portion of the costs of providing this relief would be, or could be provided, by a special tax upon amusements and upon luxuries, a tax upon entertainments, a tax on hotels and restaurants where the service is a luxury service.  Nobody wants to impose a tax upon a dinner that costs, say, 2/- or 2/6, but we know that there are nightly bills for food in some of the restaurants of this city which amount to 15/- and 20/- per head for those who dine there. We do say one way, possibly on the whole the least injurious way economically, of helping to meet the destitution which wasteful and extravagant living has helped to cause in this city would be by taxing luxurious meals of that description.</P>
      <P>Again we have the dance halls crowded every night in the city; we have dog racing, one of the most popular sports in the city.  We have even if you like the public-houses. But I want to make this clear that I do not want to tax what may possibly be harmless amusements in themselves.  At the same time while I am making it harder to get into picture-houses I am not going to make the inducements to go into public-houses greater.  Therefore, where we are going to tax harmless amusements of the people now as distinct from the luxuries we must make sure that there will be something to counterbalance it as far as the City of Dublin is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If you centralise these in Dublin you will see as far <Col N="502" /> as their incidence is concerned that possibly nine-tenths is going to be borne by the City of Dublin, where this destitution is to be relieved. Therefore, when it was suggested that possibly some of this money might be found by the imposition, if you like, of a special tax on amusements and luxuries, the great burden of that taxation was going, I believe, to fall on the City of Dublin but was not going to fall on the shoulders of the particular section of the Dublin community which could best afford to bear it.</P>
      <P>That was the way in which we indicated that the Exchequer of the State might help to meet this problem. I believe it is the reasonable way.  I believe it is the only way in which we can immediately ease the destitution and relieve the suffering without effecting grave economic injury to the whole industry and structure of the State. Deputy Good was wisely alarmed when he saw this Bill.  This is a facile sham, two pages of print absolutely empty of thought because if this was going to be the Government's policy to solve this pressing problem then there was no future either for this State or for this country!  Quite justifiably he raised his voice in alarm, because until we do something more than provide palliatives&mdash;unless we go to the root cause of the trouble and as well as providing bread and work&mdash;there is no hope, no future either for the Deputy Goods, Deputy Cassidys and the Deputy MacEntees in the city.  That is the attitude we take up in this matter.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I would like to answer.  It has been said by Deputy Good that he is anxious because of the burden that this Bill was going to cast upon the ratepayers. The fact of the matter is this that this Bill imposes no additional burden upon the ratepayer that he has not already had to bear directly or indirectly.</P>

      <P>Those who have been engaged in industry in this <Col N="503" /> country at present are carrying on their shoulders the burden of the unemployed, and the only thing this Bill does is, as it were, to uncover that burden and make it plain and clear for those who are carrying it to see it.  They are removing, if you like, taking away, stripping the old man of the sea of his invisible cloak and the Chamber of Commerce, which has been carrying this burden for the last five years, was only able to see it when Senator Johnson produced his Bill and compelled the Government in very shame to take it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I say we are accepting this Bill without welcoming it.  We want to see a radical change in the policy of the Government which will make Bills of this description unnecessary. We are not going to oppose it, and I, for one, am not very much concerned as to how the burden is distributed, because I know that ultimately the burden will be borne generally by every citizen in this country.  Those who are living in Dublin have to bear the burden immediately, but, ultimately, they do transmit some portion of the burden of unemployment in Dublin city to every man and woman throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  For that reason, therefore, I am very much concerned with the immediate incidence, but I do think it is only just that since the greatest number of unemployed are to be found in urbanised areas that the urbanised areas ought, at any rate, to bear that burden, as I said before, in the first instance.  Undoubtedly they will transmit portion of it to Dublin county, but that will be a natural transmission.  Ultimately the burden which Dublin county will be called upon to bear will be the natural portion of the burden; it will be the fairest share of the burden.  At any rate, so far as first appearances go, it is only just and right that the urbanised areas should bear their share of the burden, in the first instance, by doing that.  Possibly it will ease a great portion of the opposition which this Bill has met with <Col N="504" /> in certain districts in County Dublin. It will not, I believe, affect the position ultimately, but it will make the passage of the Bill easier.  For that reason I would recommend that the urbanised areas should be included in the Dublin Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>To attempt to follow the discussion over the many by-paths it has gone through, I think, would not be very profitable. I think it will serve the subject we are discussing here best to keep pretty close to the Bill.  I have to thank Deputy Sheehy for replying to a lot of the criticism that might otherwise have to be replied to Along that particular line I just would like to say for myself that there are some of our faces that were not made to be saved, and, therefore, we can dispense with a lot of unnecessary talk that might otherwise have to be indulged in.  One of the points upon which there has been an amount of criticism is the area that will bear this particular class of charge.  What could indeed be fairly well defined as the coastal borough is one that should particularly be discussed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper suggested that the urban area should be divided from the rural area in the Rathdown Guardians' area, and that these two areas should be made separate areas of charge for the purpose of relief to the able-bodied.  The whole of the Rathdown area is a separate area of charge, without any distinction between the urban districts and the rural districts in respect of ordinary poor relief, as has been paid up to the present.  Some of the remarks of the Deputy would suggest that portions of the rural area are, perhaps, sufficiently urbanised to be brought in in any separate urban unit with the urbanised parts of the area there.  But making it a separate area for a particular class of outdoor relief, where the whole area at present is the area of charge, requires a very considerable amount of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a temporary measure. Exception has been taken to the fact that it runs only until the 31st <Col N="505" /> March, 1931.  That date may be changed if necessary, but that date does not so much depend upon the Greater Dublin Bill to bring these provisions to a conclusion as upon the introduction of a complete codification of the poor law which is being put into legislative form at present.  The Act of 1923 was a temporary Act, and the poor law system that it enshrines requires to be put into permanent legislation.  It is recognised for some time that it is desirable, in order to assist administration as well as to put the matter into permanent form, to codify the system as early as possible, and I expect that the necessary legislation will be introduced before the 31st March, 1931.</P>
    <P>However, this is a temporary measure, and we are asked to split up in a temporary measure an area acting under a board of guardians at the present moment, and that will continue to act as a unit until, if at all, it is changed in any Greater Dublin legislation.  I do not propose to do it, and I do not think it would serve any purpose either to the townships or to the rural districts in the Rathdown Union to do it.  The difference in valuation between the townships and the rural districts will have the effect that the rate of charge will not be materially different over the whole area compared with what it might be over two separate areas.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that has been argued from the benches opposite is that in any area of charge the urban areas should go into the city.  That, again, in a temporary measure would be to take for one particular class of outdoor relief an area which is being operated at the present moment by a board of guardians and transfer that area, for that particular purpose, to an area which is being controlled by a different body, the Commissioners acting for guardians. It would mean the duplication of relieving officers, and the position of the Dublin Union Commissioners to establish what the circumstances were of the able-bodied people in the Dublin townships seeking outdoor relief would not be such <Col N="506" /> as to enable them properly to discriminate and to deal with the problem of people who ought to be dealt with.  The people who ought to deal with that are the people who are dealing with general outdoor relief in the Rathdown district at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The next point that has been considerably laboured is the question of Dublin city.  Whatever be its area, Dublin city is Dublin city, in the same way as Galway county is Galway county, and what this present Bill does is it puts on Dublin city the responsibility which by the 1923 Act was put on Galway county, Cork county, Limerick county, and on the different county boroughs.  I fail to see how any one speaking for Dublin wants to make the argument in connection with such problem, whether of poor relief of the able-bodied or ordinary poor relief, as it exists in Dublin, that Dublin ought not to be asked to face in the same way the responsibility for dealing with that problem as Cork is asked to face in respect of Cork, Limerick in respect of Limerick, or any of our county areas in respect of the county.  I am afraid that any thought that there has been on the matter has been very superficial.  At any rate, if we are going to have local government there is no part of the work that is being carried out by local bodies at the present moment that should be more local, and that the responsibility for which should be more local, both financially and in the matter of dealing with the problem, than poor relief, whether for the able-bodied, or for the people who are incapacitated.</P>
    <P>If the financial responsibility for dealing with any problem of poor relief is going to be taken away from the local bodies on whose shoulders it is at present and made a ten or twenty-five or fifty or seventy per cent.  State problem, then you are bringing about a state of affairs that should be well considered before any party or individual would say that that was the right way to <Col N="507" /> deal with the problem.  If the financial burden of poor relief, either for the able-bodied or others, is going to be made a State charge, then you are going to loosen the sense of responsibility by which that matter is going to be dealt with in local areas.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that this is going to impose a burden.  No doubt it is.  No doubt there is a point at which the State has to make up its mind as to the extent to which it can give poor relief.  There is a point above which the producers in the State cannot offer sustenance to people who are non-producers.  But I suggest that there is another line along which the problem arises which requires very careful consideration&mdash;and the line cannot be lightly drawn&mdash;that is the line at which, if an individual gets brought into the poor law system in any way, he gets permanently brought into it. There is a danger that the administration of poor relief at a particular part of the spectrum of population is going to prevent the individuals concerned relying on their own energy to get into productive work, but, on the other hand, is going to drag them over to the poor relief side.  I suggest that that is quite as much a problem as the problem of how far productive industry is or is not able to bear the burden of poor relief.</P>
    <P>The extension of this Bill to Dublin is simply doing in respect to Dublin what was done in respect to every other local area in 1923.  It was done, to use the word used by Deputies in respect of these areas, suddenly then.  It is done now, to use the same word, suddenly in Dublin.  I sympathise with those responsible for the administration of the city if they are called upon, after having struck their rate, to incur an additional large expenditure for poor relief, but I insist again that Dublin should be as well able to shoulder its own burden in this matter as any other place in the country.  The problem will not be looked straight in the face and fully realised by those responsible for the administration of this class of relief <Col N="508" /> in the City of Dublin unless they shoulder the full burden that is theirs.  To suggest, as Deputies have suggested, that an entertainment tax or some other tax should be put on the whole country for the purpose of providing relief for the able-bodied in the City of Dublin is not to solve in any way the problem in Dublin, but is to open a very big problem in the rest of the country, so that our policy in this matter of poor relief is that Dublin must support its own burden.</P>

I cannot sympathise with Deputies who argue that the provision contained in this Bill, that this particular class of relief will only be paid in respect of people who have had two years' residence in Dublin city or county, is not a sufficient safeguard for the city. The period is a reasonable period to provide all the reasonable safeguards that the city should ask.  A question has been asked by Deputy O'Connell and others as to what is going to happen in the case of a person having been less than two years in the city or county of Dublin who applies for relief and who has no home and does not know where to go to.  The relief provided for that particular class of person is relief in the union in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not know if either of the two Deputies interested in this matter will suggest <Col N="509" /> that the financial burden involved in that is a big one.  Personally, I do not think that it is.  The question has been raised that persons may know that they will find work, or may be able to go to their homes, in a particular part of the country, but that under this Bill travelling expenses only can be provided for them.  Provisional relief under the general Poor Law Act can be provided for any person in circumstances in which provisional relief is demanded, and it would be possible to provide provisional relief for these persons as well as sending them to the part of the country to which they want to go.  A question has been also raised as to whether the terms here are not too wide and that people may want to be sent to foreign lands.  The Bill is purposely left wide.  Under the ordinary poor relief it is possible for a local body, with the consent of the Minister, to pay the expenses of a person or family, in circumstances that appear to warrant it, who want to emigrate. These powers have been used on one or two occasions.  So that leaving this Bill as open as it is does not really confer any additional powers, but the doing of it, the paying of any expenses under the Bill, or the giving of any relief, is entirely a matter for the local body administering the Bill.  I suggest, therefore, that there is no necessity to tie up the local body in that matter, that no case will be dealt with by being sent to any great distance away except after mature consideration by the people responsible for administering the Act.</P>

I suggest that we should take the Committee Stage next Wednesday.  That would give a week in which to submit any amendments.  When we see these amendments, and when we hear such discussion as may take place upon them, then we can decide whether a long period might be necessary between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, so that such amendments as after the discussion in Committee Stage are seen to be required can adequately be discussed and can be thought over and prepared between Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>

There are a number of bodies <Col N="511" /> interested in this matter and a certain time must elapse before they can be called together to consider amendments, and after that, the amendments to be put forward will require consideration.  That cannot be done in a few days.  The Minister suggests giving seven days between this and Committee Stage.  Amendments must be put forward some forty-eight hours before the expiration of that time, so that if you take the summoning of the meeting of those local bodies and then the time that must elapse in order to get the amendments in, there is practically no time to give to their consideration.</P>

Although this Bill practically embodies what was in the Bill which came from the Seanad, nevertheless when we are finished with it here it has to go back to the Seanad.  I do not like the idea of presenting the City and County of Dublin on, say, the first day of December, with a Bill of this kind. If it will meet Deputies I shall put it down for Thursday next.  Then we would be in this position: that we shall discuss the Committee Stage on Thursday next, and I would ask the Dáil to take the Report Stage on the following Wednesday and to get the Bill to the Seanad that week.  The extra day may be of some use.  The alternative to that would be to put it back another week, and that is simply to discuss the Committee Stage here on Wednesday week and keep the Report Stage back for another week.</P>

The Minister knows as well as I do that these bodies move slowly.  Nothing that we can do will urge them beyond a certain speed, and I think in view of what has been said here to-day that it is not unreasonable to ask for a fortnight for the consideration of the different proposals that may be embodied in the amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure the repeal of the section of the Electoral Act, 1927, imposing an obligation on candidates for election to make an affidavit to the effect that they intend to comply with Article 17 of the Constitution.  It may possibly be argued by the Minister for Local Government that it is foolish to endeavour to secure the repeal of that provision in relation to the Seanad bye-election if it was to continue <Col N="514" /> in operation in relation to the ordinary triennial election to the Seanad or the ordinary elections to the Dáil.  But all great movements have small beginnings.  It may be possible to start a movement to sweep away those various restrictions which have been imposed during the past two years upon persons seeking membership of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some two or three weeks ago the Minister for Education spoke at a public meeting in Dublin under the auspices of the League of Nations Society.  He stated that the policy pursued by the Free State delegation to the League of Nations was designed to ensure that no action taken by the delegation would hamper the successors of the present Government in ascertaining the Irish national position.  That statement indicated a very welcome change of policy on behalf of the present Government, and most of us were glad to see the report of it in the Press.  I want to suggest, however, on this amendment, that the mentality thus displayed should be translated into action in internal affairs as well as in external affairs. We are giving the Government the opportunity in this amendment, if they are anxious, as they have said, not to take any action designed to impede their successors in ascertaining the national position.  They can take a small step in that direction by deleting the provision in the Electoral Act of 1927, designed to ensure that persons cannot be nominated for election to the Dáil or Seanad unless they make an affidavit to the effect that they intend to comply with Article 17 of the Constitution. I think it is generally admitted that compliance with Article 17 of the Constitution is not mandatory by the Treaty of 1921.  The Treaty of 1921 does specify that if an oath is taken by members of the Dáil and Seanad it shall be in the form specified in the Treaty, but it does not provide that no members can be elected to, or sit in, the Dáil or Seanad unless they take that oath.  The one thing that Article of the Treaty ensures, so long as it remains in operation, is that no other oath except the one <Col N="515" /> mentioned there can be taken by members of the Dáil or Seanad.  If, therefore, Article 17 of the Constitution were deleted, or if compliance with that Article was not enforced, it could not be held by those who advocate, and continue to advocate acceptance of the Treaty, that such action would be a breach of the Treaty likely to lead to immediate and terrible war.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Minister for Education, in his speech at the League of Nations Society, represented the attitude of the Executive Council, but if he was speaking for the Executive Council, I think that the request that the line of action which he claims was followed by the Free State representatives at Geneva should also be adopted in the various matters of internal concern. Of course, the vexatious provisions in the Electoral Act of 1927 are not the only restrictions imposed upon people in this country. They are not made mandatory by the Treaty, but are designed to facilitate the political progress of the anti-Republican Party that has at present a majority in the country. Whatever case they could make to their own supporters for the creation of these restrictions at the time they were originally devised, I think they cannot now, in the changed circumstances at the moment, be sustained.  In fact, if all the circumstances were taken into account, a very strong case could be made for the abolition of all those various tests and declarations that are required from civil servants, local government officials, members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>What the amendment is seeking is the deletion in sub-section (3) of Section 4 of all words after the word &ldquo;repealed.&rdquo;  That, if agreed to, will effect the repeal of the section I referred to in the Electoral Act, 1927.  I am making, in that connection, a case for the abolition of the restrictions <Col N="516" /> imposed by that Act based upon the necessity for abolishing all the restrictions imposed by various Acts of a similar character.  If, however, it is the wish of the Chair that I should confine myself to this particular restriction, I am quite willing to do so. I do not intend to delay the Dáil discussing it, because I think the case is quite clear.  The circumstances that existed in 1927, when that Act was passed, do not exist now.  The need for that affidavit does not now exist at all.  To keep it in existence is merely to attempt to make the greatest possible number of vexatious regulations designed to impede political opponents.  I thought when I read the statement, to which I have referred, of the Minister for Education, that we were going to witness in this session in the Dáil a change of attitude on the part of the Ministry.  I do not know whether that hope is to be realised or not.  If it is not, I think the ordinary members of the Dáil, who possibly have a greater amount of horse sense on matters of this kind than members of the Ministry, should indicate their views by supporting this amendment.  Obviously no great harm can be done if persons seeking election at a bye-election of the Seanad have got to go through the formality of having to make an affidavit before being nominated.  I do not think the foundations of the State will be destroyed if the amendment is carried, and neither do I think that any great revolution in national affairs will follow.  It will merely be the abolition of an unnecessary formality and the simplification of the method of election.</P>

      <P>I would direct attention to the Electoral Amendment Act, 1927. In Section 4 of that Act it is provided that when a person is elected for the Oireachtas if he does not take his seat and make the necessary compliance with Article 17 of the Constitution inside two months he automatically vacates his seat and a vacancy is created.  The present Bill provides that a person before being <Col N="517" /> nominated as a candidate in a bye-election for the Seanad shall declare his intention that he proposes to comply with Article 17 of the Constitution. This provision of the Bill is to ensure that persons will not be nominated for purely destructive political purposes as members of the Seanad, possibly be elected, and then refuse to take their seats and bring about a further election.  If the Deputy wants to do what he suggests and remove the necessity for complying with the Constitution then I think he should attack it face on and bring in legislation to remove Article 17, or at any rate to deal with the Electoral Amendment Act, 1927.  It is only wasting time unnecessarily to deal with the matter in the way he proposes, and preventing the case he wants to make from being fully, properly and frankly made.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the Minister prefaced his remarks by making a much better case for the amendment than I did?  He pointed out that Section 4 of the Electoral Amendment Act, 1927, provides that if a person does not take his seat <Col N="518" /> within two months the seat is declared vacant.  May I also point out this is a Bill providing a certain procedure for the filling of vacancies in the Seanad?  It involves that any person to be nominated must be proposed and seconded, and in addition, receive the assent of ten other elected members of the Dáil and Seanad.  Therefore, only those can be nominated who have the support of twelve who have already accepted membership of the Dáil or Seanad, and the possibility of any such number of Deputies or Senators nominating a person for the Seanad with the intention that he should not take his seat is, I think, very remote. Even if such a remote possibility could come about the only inconvenience that would be caused would be that a second election would have to be held after the lapse of two months.  I suggest that the formality of having persons nominated sign an affidavit is out of date and should be abolished.  There is no necessity for maintaining it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill the object of which is to make the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support.  It enables a District Justice, when proof has been given to him that a man is the father of an illegitimate child, to make an order that so much a week should be paid by the putative father for the support of the child. The amount which can be ordered is limited to £1 a week and the age at which such order must cease is sixteen.  Deputies, no doubt, are aware that at present a father is not liable for the maintenance of his illegitimate child unless that child is being supported by the poor rate. In that case the guardians or other public body can take proceedings against the father of the child.  That is the only remedy at present.  If a woman has an illegitimate child she herself cannot compel the father to make any contribution towards the maintenance of that child. There is, of course, another remedy available in some cases, namely, an action for seduction, but such action cannot be brought by the woman and can only be brought by her father, or her employer if she be in employment.  In the case of services lost to an employer the amount of damages is only nominal, but substantial damages can be given where the father of the girl is plaintiff. The Bill does not do away with the action for seduction, but enables proceedings to be brought by the woman in her own name for the <Col N="521" /> support of an illegitimate child.  I must draw the attention of the House to one or two very short provisions in the Bill.  One is in sub-section (2) of Section 3, to the effect that no Justice of a District Court shall be satisfied that a person is the putative father of an illegitimate child without hearing the evidence of the mother of such child and also corroborative evidence.  That is the law as it exists at present when proceedings are taken by a public body who are supporting such a child against the father.  The evidence of the mother requires corroboration. I think that that is a wise precaution, because it would leave open a very wide door for blackmail and false proceedings if corroboration were not required.  Further, not alone must the putative father pay for the support of the child until the age of sixteen, but in certain cases the District Justice has power to order him to pay an apprenticeship fee to enable the child to be taught a trade.  That is under Section 6.  I do not think that I need go into the details of the Bill at any further length.  That is an outline of what the Bill endeavours to do, and I ask the House to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House, like the Minister, recognise the necessity for a measure such as this.  As the Minister pointed out, the Act of 1863 did not make provision to deal with this matter in a way that our experience in this country shows that it should. As to the other remedy to which the Minister refers, namely, a seduction action, we have often realised from experience that there are so many loopholes and so many defects in that Act it is quite possible that a good deal of hardship might result. The Minister is conversant with the decision in the case of Hamilton v. Long in which the father, subsequent to bringing an action for seduction, died, and the people in loco-parentis had no remedy.  I have come across a number of such cases. I think that the Minister might bear in mind that legislation might be enacted for the purpose of providing <Col N="522" /> for that aspect of the question.  In other cases, such as Davies v. Williams, and Hedges v. Dagg, the girl was in the service of an employer at the time the seduction took place and the birth took place at her parents' home.  In that case there is no action, and neither the father nor the employer could maintain an action.  That demonstrates the futility to some extent of trying to secure, through legal means, redress for the unfortunate aggrieved party.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, as the Minister has tackled this problem, he might also consider social evils that are not very far removed from this particular evil.  I believe the Minister has or will have representations made to him from certain social workers or bodies like that.  I have had communications from time to time in regard to that matter, and these social evils are not very far removed from this particular evil.  I hope that legislation will be forthcoming to try to deal with them.  As I say, we welcome the Bill.  I have gone through the sections and I think it is a very simple measure.  There may be some minor alterations necessary&mdash;one or two occur to me&mdash; on the Committee Stage, but the Bill as a whole is simple and it covers fully what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in regard to Section 3, that corroborative evidence is necessary.  That has been maintained in breach of promise cases and actions of that kind.  It has always been necessary, and it should be necessary in such cases as this.  Under the Act of 1863 the Minister will note, that although it does say that it is subject to the provisions in the court procedure, it also adds an additional clause that there is a right of appeal.  I was wondering whether the Minister would consider whether there might be added to Section 16 a provision that there should obtain the right of appeal.  Perhaps the Minister would consider whether there is anything in that point.  I would imagine, taking the Act of 1863 as it is, that it would be better to follow on the lines of the provisions in that Act <Col N="523" /> so that there may be no doubt about it and no trouble in court afterwards about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, on behalf of our Party, that we welcome this measure.  We strongly approve of the general principle embodied in it, and our only complaint is that it has been too long delayed.  It is an urgent social reform that has been asked for on many occasions.  We can say, of course, that it is better late than never.  I do not wish to discuss it from its legal aspect, but there is just one point I had in mind as an ordinary layman.  I do not know much about it, but Deputy Ruttledge's references towards the matter increased the doubt I had in mind.  Perhaps the Minister would give me some information on the point.  Is there a right of appeal from the decision of the District Justice in cases of this kind?  I took it for granted that there would be a right of appeal in this as in all other matters.  I think if there is not that it is the kind of a case in which there should be a right of appeal.  I think it is just possible that measures of the kind might be used, as the Minister himself admitted is possible, as a means of blackmail or fraudulent action in order to obtain money.  The necessity for corroboration is, of course, a very valuable protection, but even with that, I would like to be sure as to whether or not there would be a right of appeal from the decision of the District Court.  I think it is necessary for the protection of people who might be brought to court from motives of blackmail or fraudulent prosecution, that that right should be provided in the Bill.  This is perhaps a matter that would be best discussed in Committee, but it is a point which occurred to me as a layman on reading the Bill.  I assumed when Deputy Ruttledge raised the point that the right of appeal existed as a matter of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very comprehensive measure dealing with a <Col N="524" /> difficult and delicate subject.  Much complaint has been made on the ground of the inadequacy of the protection afforded to the unmarried mother.  Many people will assist in passing the Bill who know little or nothing of the psychology of the mother in such cases.  I have had some opportunity of studying these people in the course of my professional work in institutions where these people are treated, and I want to say that it appears to me that the male section of the population will require some protection under the terms of the Bill.  The vast majority of these mothers are more sinned against than sinning, we will all agree, but there is little doubt that some of them would use the powers conferred by this Bill for the purposes of blackmail.  Broadly speaking, the application for the affiliation order may be made under the Bill as it now stands, before the birth of the illegitimate child or within twelve months after the birth.  Paragraph (b) sub-section (2) of Section (2), provides that the application can be made within twelve months after the birth.  I am strongly of opinion that the Bill would be improved by the deletion of paragraph (b), sub-section (2) of Section 2.  I will go further and say that it should not be possible to seek or obtain an affiliation order unless the application were made, say, three months before the birth of the child.  It is an undoubted fact that these mothers have been known to try to blackmail in desperation, and many perfectly innocent men would settle out of court rather than face the ordeal of a trial.  After the birth of the child the mother is an outcast to a certain extent, and she is in a desperate plight.  Her disgrace has become public and her condition is such that it cannot become worse. People in such circumstances are liable to become the victims of unscrupulous schemers who have been known deliberately to select a victim.  I believe that the Bill would be improved by the deletion of that paragraph.  There is one other aspect of it that I would like to bring before the notice of the <Col N="525" /> House and of the Minister in charge of the Bill, and that is, in cases where it is possible, marriage is the best solution.  Marriage as a solution would be much more likely to be adopted if the order were sought three months before the birth.  The influences which are used to unite the parties in matrimony are much more likely to succeed then than they are afterwards.  I hope the Minister will take these few points into consideration on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are just a few points that I want to raise on this Bill.  The first is that the Act of 1863 will be repealed if this Bill becomes an Act.  I would like if the Minister would make clear what chance a public board would have, if an affiliation order is obtained, of obtaining expenses incurred if the expectant mother is kept in the institution a month or two before the birth of the child?  Another point is whether these cases are heard in camera or not.  As regards Section 3 (2), the Minister rightly spoke of the possibilities of blackmail.  I think it would be advisable&mdash;and I think representations have been made to the Minister to that effect&mdash;to have a woman as assessor in court.  I have great faith in the intuition of women in such cases as these.  I do not believe it would entail any expense, as there are social workers who would be willing, I am sure, to provide a panel, from which panel the assessors could be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with what Deputy Fahy has said at all.  I think the duty of a judge is to hear a case and decide upon the evidence before him.  To have one woman brought in to act as a species of judge is to me a very novel suggestion, and I do not think it is one that could be carried out at all in practice.  As far as this question of blackmail is concerned, the only safeguard you can have against the bringing of a false action is first, that the woman herself must swear to the parentage of the child, and, secondly, she must be corroborated <Col N="526" /> on some material point.  She may swear and she may be corroborated in some material point, but it does not follow at all that she will be successful in the case.  After all, the judges will have to weigh the evidence. They will hear both sides; they will hear the evidence for the defence.  The present law as far as seduction is concerned requires no corroboration at all.  I do not think that to any large extent actions of seduction have been used as a weapon for blackmail.  I have no fear myself that this Act will be made a weapon of blackmail.  I think it is very good to have these provisions in it, which, to my mind, make it almost impossible to be used for blackmail purposes.  Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Ruttledge spoke upon the question of appeal. I take it that that means an appeal to the Circuit Judge.  My view, as the Bill stands, is that an appeal would lie.  If there is any doubt about it I would be willing to make that still more clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy MacEntee I would like to say a few words on this Bill.  The House is aware that in this Bill is embodied an agreement between the Government of the Free State and the British Government.  So far as that agreement is concerned, it will be impossible to have it amended&mdash; to have the Bill containing it amended during its passage through the House.  The Bill must be rejected in toto or accepted by the House.  The position of the Government has been stated on several occasions.  It has been stated that this Bill, or this agreement, does not involve any acceptance of the <Col N="527" /> decision of the British Privy Council; that a certain arrangement has been come to between the two Governments by which the Irish Free State Government will not be responsible for any additional expenses beyond that which was first contemplated by them, and that the extra compensation which is now to be allowed will be indemnified by the British Government.  The Minister for Finance, in a statement in connection with the first placing of this case before the Judicial Committee of the English Privy Council, said that the Irish Government had two reasons for allowing the Wigg-Cochrane case to go before that Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reason was that they believed it was a matter for the British Government.  I think I am not interpreting the Minister incorrectly when I say that he said on that occasion that these were British civil servants and therefore the British Government was interested in the question.  The second reason for placing the matter before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was that the Irish Free State Government believed that they had given a fair deal to these civil servants who were transferred under the Treaty, and that the attitude and the terms of compensation offered by this Government would be upheld, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  The expectations of the Minister, however, were not fulfilled and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council delivered a judgment upsetting and over-riding the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State.  It was on that occasion when the decision was made that the Minister for Finance stated that not a single penny would the Free State Government pay beyond the amount that was originally proposed to be paid as a result of the Supreme Court's decision. But he now asks us to believe that no recognition of the decision of the Judicial Committee was involved, and that the only question of importance for us here to decide, and <Col N="528" /> the only matter really affecting the community, is the question of extra compensation.</P>
    <P>The British Government is paying the extra compensation, but they are paying it in indemnification of a previous payment being paid by this Government.  The Government in the first instance has to pay and, according to the terms of the agreement, I believe that this Government has accepted the principle of the supremacy of the British Privy Council in this matter.  The Privy Council decision definitely overrides the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State.  That decision is really the one embodied in this agreement.  It is on the basis of that decision that the new payment of compensation is being made.  Even though the Minister for Finance can point out that the British Government will subsequently indemnify us and recoup that amount, the fact is that in the first instance we have definitely accepted the basis laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  The Free State Government claim they are trying to abolish the right of the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council to interfere in matters connected with the internal affairs of the Dominions and of the Irish Free State, but I claim that in this case they have definitely accepted that principle and, no matter what verbiage or qualifications may be introduced into the actual wording of the agreement, nothing can get us away from the fact that the agreement is based definitely on the decision of the Judicial Committee.  I will leave Deputy MacEntee to continue the discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee is slightly at a disadvantage in so far as he was not present when this debate began.  So far as I can learn, however, I have not missed much.  I hoped the Minister would have given some explanation of the Bill which he is sponsoring in the Dáil. Whether he is ashamed of it or afraid of it, or because he does not understand it, he ushers this Bill into our midst in silence.  He has <Col N="529" /> good reason to be silent when we remember his former statements upon this matter.  When the first decision of the Privy Council was announced, the Minister for Finance was deluged with questions as to the attitude which the Executive Council proposed to take in regard to it.  To these questions he gave various replies, but in most of them he stated that the judgment raised not merely financial but constitutional and legal questions of far-reaching importance. It is clear, therefore, that the Minister realised the gravity of the constitutional position which the decision of the Judicial Committee had raised.  Therefore, we may assume that he did not speak lightly when, on the 22nd February, 1928, according to the Official Reports (Vol. 22, cols. 108-9) he made the following declaration:&mdash;&ldquo;The Government have had under consideration the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Wigg and another versus the Attorney-General. The Government are desirous of honouring to the fullest extent their obligations under Article 10 of the Treaty.  It is clear, however, that some of the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee in the case referred to would, if given effect to, result in more favourable treatment under Article 10 of the Treaty being accorded to transferred officers in the matter of bonus than they would have received had they remained in the British Civil Service or than transferred officers who elect to remain in the Civil Service of the Saorstát would receive on ultimate retirement in the normal course under the Superannuation Acts.&rdquo;  Such a result, the Minister stated, was not intended by Article 10 of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he went on to state that the Executive Council proposed to set up a certain Committee and to introduce legislation in the Dáil making the awards of that Committee binding. He continued: &ldquo;The determination of this Committee on any application or question referred to them will be final and conclusive.  In <Col N="530" /> assessing compensation the Committee will be required to adhere in the treatment of bonus to the basis applicable to officers in the British Civil Service immediately prior to the transfer of the officers to the service of the Provisional Government.&rdquo; The Minister thus thundered forth his defiance of the Committee of the Privy Council, and, if the British Government did not join in his fulminations, at least they were sufficiently terrified, so we are led to believe, to overthrow in their minds the decision of the Privy Council, because, following the Minister's statement, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs made the following declaration in the British House of Commons: &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the intention of those who framed Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement that the civil servants in question should be put in a more favourable position in respect of the matters in question than if they had remained in the service of the Crown under the British Government.&rdquo;  He further indicated that it was proposed to amend the Article, to bring it into conformity with the intention of the farmers.</P>
    <P>Thus we see that both the Minister for Finance of Saorstát Eireann and the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs joined in a denunciation of the Privy Council, but that august body seems to have been little affected by the cannonade, possibly because they knew our Minister for Finance and their Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. At any rate, scarcely had the Minister's big words died away when very significant movements were discernible across the Channel.  On April 25th, 1928, in the British House of Lords, two members of the Judicial Committee which had heard the case, admitted that a mistake might have been made by the Judicial Committee, and Lord Birkenhead announced that the British Government was satisfied that a mistake had been made and expressed its willingness to assent to such legislation as was necessary to rectify the mistake.</P>
    <P>He said that the attention of the <Col N="531" /> Judicial Committee had not been directed to a minute in relation to which, in his judgment and that of those who were advising the Ministers of the Government, the decision should have been made.  Then followed what was afterwards discovered to be an extraordinary manifestation of the noble Lord's imaginative powers.  He informed the House of Lords that within twenty-four hours of his death, Lord Cave, the Lord Chancellor, who had also sat on the Judicial Committee, authorised the Prime Minister to state that, in his opinion, the conclusion which he had drawn was probably wrong in law, and that for this error the persons who drafted the information were principally responsible. Now, I would like the House at this stage to bear in mind that the whole of this statement&mdash; the statement that Lord Cave had admitted that, because the attention of the Judicial Committee had not been drawn to a certain minute, they had arrived at the conclusion which they expressed in their judgment&mdash; was afterwards declared by those who were familiar with the circumstances to be fictitious, and I think that at the very outset this shows the laying of a trap to get the Executive Council to eat the declaration which the Minister for Finance had made in this House on 22nd February, 1928, to withdraw from the position which they had then taken up, and again to come before the Privy Council at a re-hearing of this case of Wigg and Cochrane, and that it was merely designed in order that the position and the right of the Privy Council to interfere in judicial affairs in this State should be acknowledged and should be secured.</P>
    <P>Lord Birkenhead went further. He said that he would go the length of saying that no really competent lawyer who read this case, with the addition of the relevant minute, would differ from the conclusion that was formed by Lord Haldane, Lord Dunedin and Lord Cave.  As I have said, the trap was set and nicely baited.  Four noble Lords, all <Col N="532" /> members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, three of whom had held the office of Lord Chancellor, announcing beforehand the inevitable decision of the court in favour of their good friends of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State if only that Council would be good enough to come again and humbly supplicate for justice which this time would not be denied them. And I am sorry to say that the trap was successful, that the bait was attractive, that this precious minute, which Lord Birkenhead fortuitously but fallaciously told us had so disturbed the last hours of Lord Cave, lured them on.  The Executive Council saw an opportunity to retreat gracefully out of the situation which their magniloquence had created, but which they now feared to maintain. So, just as a matter of form, as the Minister for External Affairs informed the Dáil in the papers which he laid before us some time in June, 1928, the whole matter was again referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and this State was represented at the hearing. But when once the Executive Council of the Free State appeared again before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the minute which Lord Birkenhead had told us was so potent, seemed to have lost its power.  It was not even considered by the Judicial Committee; it was brushed aside as of no weight, and at the second hearing, on the 13th November, 1928, the Judicial Committee in every particular confirmed the earlier findings, but this time with added emphasis and added authority.</P>
    <P>In view of all that had gone before, it was quite obvious that the Executive Council, if there was still a spark of manhood left among those who constituted it, could not accept the second decision lying down, and accordingly we find the Minister for Finance, in the first fury of his indignation, expressing himself without restraint regarding it.  In the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of the 14th November, 1928, he is reported to have stated: &ldquo;We certainly will not pay any more beyond what was <Col N="533" /> originally found to be due in our own Supreme Court.  We will not pay a farthing more in consequence of the decision of the Privy Council.&rdquo; Now, I know that those words are ambiguous; I know that they are capable of bearing two interpretations, but I do submit that the words at the time they were uttered were a declaration of intention and purpose, and not of hope or expectation. The Minister's statement was a deliberate statement, that, despite the decision of the Judicial Committee, the Executive Council would not pay these moneys, which were not justly due.  Now, turn to the Bill and you will find that these moneys in the first instance have to be found and have to be paid by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In another interview, which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on the following day, the Minister went even further in condemning the action and the judgment of the Privy Council.  He said: &ldquo;It has nothing to do with us.  When the original decision was given we made our position perfectly clear.  We said that it was an entirely inequitable decision, a decision such as we could not accept and which we have no intention of accepting.  Really we are not interested.&rdquo;  If the Executive Council of the Irish Free State are not interested in this judgment, why is this Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance to-day?  Because he is anxious to honour, and the Executive Council are prepared to honour, the judgment and accept the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is the opinion of the Dáil that proposals for legislation should be introduced by the Executive Council to provide:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> (a)  for the establishment of a Wheat Control Board, which shall be a limited liability company, charged with the purchase of imported wheat for re-sale to millers and the fixing of a minimum price to be paid by Saorstát millers for home-grown wheat sold to them for milling purposes;</P>
    <P>(b)  for the prohibition of the importation of wheat by any person other than the Wheat Control Board and such persons as may be authorised by the Board;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the payment by the Board to Saorstát millers of such sums as may be necessary to make good the difference between the price paid by the millers for home-grown wheat and its market value compared with Pacific wheats, taking into account its higher moisture content;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to subscribe to the capital of the Company, and to make good any losses incurred by the Company in the administration of the scheme, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the importation of flour be permitted only under licence issued by the Wheat Control Board, and subject to an import duty: provided that there shall be no restrictions on flour imported for biscuit manufacture.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that a Wheat Control Board be set up, to be a limited liability company; that the Board would have the sole right of importing wheat; that it would have the right of selling that wheat at its own price to millers in Saorstát Eireann; that it would have the right to fix the subsidy on home-grown wheat that would be given the miller, taking into account the difference in value between home-grown wheat and imported Pacific wheat; that it would have the right to fix the percentage <Col N="535" /> of home grown wheat to be used by millers, and, further, that it would have the power to regulate the import of flour.  We have been asked why we have chosen wheat as the crop to be picked out for special mention.  We believe that it is the primary purpose of agriculture in this country to produce human food, and wheat being the raw material of the principal item of human food, we believe that special attention should be paid to the production of wheat for our own use.</P>
    <P>The import of wheat and wheat products is a very large item.  In the year 1927 it cost this country £7,393,000, and in 1928 £6,043,000. Evidently the reason for the falling off in 1928 was that there were big imports towards the end of 1927 owing to the fact that the question of a tariff on flour was under consideration by the Tariff Commission. We may take the normal import of wheat and wheat products as being valued at about £6,500,000.  We believe that it should be our purpose in our agricultural policy to provide the greatest possible comfort for the largest possible population on the land.  From figures that were supplied at the Economic Committee we find that a larger population could be maintained on land under tillage than on land under pasture.  The figures showed that a hundred acres of potatoes will maintain 418 people, one hundred acres of wheat 208 people, one hundred acres of the finest pasture devoted to the production of beef, 40 people, and of pasture devoted to the production of milk, 41 people.  We find further, when we compare this country with one which has a much larger percentage of tillage, namely Denmark, from the table which is given in the Trade and Shipping statistics for 1928, page 13, Roman numerals, that Denmark maintains a population of 478 per thousand acres, as against 246 in the Free State.  In addition to that we find that Denmark has a net export, that is exports of agricultural products over imports, of agricultural products of <Col N="536" /> £5 10s. per acre while our exports are £1 12s. 8d. per acre.</P>
    <P>If we look into the question of wheat and the production of bread stuffs alone, and take the production of wheat and rye in Denmark as against the production of wheat here, we find that Denmark actually produces sufficient wheat and rye to maintain her total population, while we produce enough to maintain 3½ per cent of our population.  The Danish people, however, use a considerable portion of the wheat and rye produced for feeding farm stock, so that actually they import some wheat.  We import £2 7s. 6d. worth of wheat per head of the population as against £1 8s. worth per head in Denmark, the difference being that Denmark tills 65.5 per cent. of her land while we till only 12½ per cent. We believe that increased tillage is necessary to maintain a larger population here if we are to follow the example of countries like Denmark, which has practically a completely agricultural population like our own. If we want to maintain a larger population and maintain it in greater comfort we must turn to increased tillage.</P>
    <P>In order to increase tillage we believe if we deal with the question of wheat that we will be dealing with one of the most important items in that tillage programme.  It would not be advisable, I believe, to deal with oats and barley, for instance, in the same way as we propose to deal with wheat.  Those who produce wheat here at the present time, and they are very few, produce it principally as a cash crop.  On the other hand, a big percentage of the oats and barley produced is not produced as a cash crop, but for use on the farm for feeding.  If wheat is being produced at present as a cash crop, under this scheme no difficulty would arise, because the producer would naturally bring his wheat for sale to the nearest miller.  On the other hand, if the scheme were to be applied to oats or barley a difficulty would arise, because the buyers of oats or barley would be feeders of live stock, and we would have farmers selling oats to one another <Col N="537" /> in order to get the subsidy, and that might merely result in an exchange of grain between one farmer and another.  In that way these two crops would not lend themselves to this scheme.  There are, however, other proposals for these two crops, but I need not go into them now. Another reason why we consider that the growing of wheat would be a benefit to this country is the fact that it would give employment where employment is badly needed, because there are many people unemployed in the rural districts, just as there are in the urban districts, and many people are only partially employed in the rural districts.</P>
    <P>Even taking the official figures that were supplied by the Department of Agriculture it is estimated that the amount of manual labour necessary for the cultivation of one acre of wheat came to £2 6s. 6d. per acre.  If we were to produce sufficient wheat for our own needs it was estimated that we would require about 860,000 acres, so that on the figures supplied by the Department there would be a distribution of £1,999,000 in wages.</P>
    <P>It might be argued perhaps, and it has been argued, that the amount of wages paid, for instance, for the production of milk is just as large as would be paid for the production of wheat.  But why should one be incompatible with the other?  There is no reason.  I have already said that Denmark has 65.6 per cent. of her land tilled, while we have only 12½ per cent.  Denmark is only a little over half the size of this country, and yet, taking the figures for butter and bacon alone, Denmark, in addition to feeding twice the population per thousand acres that we have, is able to export £48,000,000 worth of butter and bacon, which, of course are her principal exports of agricultural produce, while the Free State total exports amount to £30,000,000.  So a country like Denmark, which has gone in so extensively for tillage, is not in any way losing her production of milk or bacon.  Therefore, the argument put up to us that the wages paid in the production of milk are as good as <Col N="538" /> the wages paid in the production of wheat does not arise in any way. These are some of the arguments which can be advanced why it would be a good thing for the country as apart from the farmer to produce more wheat or, in fact, to aim at the production of our total requirements in wheat.</P>
    <P>Some time ago this question arose in the Dáil, and the Minister for Agriculture accused us of making wheat a patriotic crop owing to the fact that we tried to prove to the Dáil that it would be a good thing for this country if it were to produce sufficient wheat for our own needs. If we succeeded in proving that to the satisfaction of this House we would perhaps have proved that it was a patriotic crop.  On looking back over some of the debates, I find we have no less authority for making wheat a patriotic crop than the Minister for Agriculture himself.  He said in a previous debate, which I mentioned, on the Agriculture Estimate of the 4th June, 1925:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They can produce wheat for 7/- or 8/- per cwt. cheaper than they can purchase flour.  They can, if they wish, bring back the tillage and pasture land into good heart.  They must think in this direction, and, if they do, it will be all the better for the country.  If I am wrong in that, I want to be shown where I am wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was not a Deputy even in the Farmers' Party at the time that could show him where he was wrong. If, therefore, we advocate the growing of wheat, and try to show the advantages it would have for this country, there is no reason why we should be accused of making wheat the only patriotic crop, because, as I have shown already, it is quite possible to produce more bacon and more butter with increased tillage, and I hope before I am finished to show that it will be quite possible, and in fact almost necessary, to produce more of other crops if you go in for increased production of wheat.</P>
    <P>To show that it would be an advantage to the country to grow <Col N="539" /> wheat is not getting us perhaps any further.  Until we can show the farmer that it is an advantage to him we cannot get the wheat grown.  At the Economic Committee, when this question was fully discussed and gone into in detail, we were asked to suggest a figure that would induce the farmers of Ireland to grow more wheat.  We suggested that we could base our calculation on the figure of 30/- per barrel.  We have never held that we were in a position to say definitely what would be sufficient to pay a farmer to get sufficient wheat grown, because if we were able to tell all those things there would be no necessity for a Wheat Control Board.  But we said we can base our calculations on that and see how they would work out.</P>
    <P>The figures supplied to us from the Department of Agriculture at the Economic Committee showed that the profit to be derived by farmers in this country from one acre of pasture when that pasture was put to the production of milk was £3 8s. 9d., and when it was put to the production of beef, £3 9s. 3d. per acre, and when it was put to the production of wheat, £2 18s. 7d. an acre, and oats, £1 16s. 6d.  That was on the basis of wheat being sold at 24/- per barrel.  If that were changed to 30/- per barrel there would be a profit of £5 3s. 6d. per acre, and that would compare very favourably even with the profits on this acre of pasture.  I think some of the members here who have read the report will recollect that there were certain points made on this acre of pasture.  For instance, the acre of pasture was supposed to produce 3 cwt. of beef in one particular year &mdash;that a bullock of 7 cwt., I think, going in would come out at the end of the year at 10 cwt. on the one acre of pasture.  I think there are very few Deputies here who would be able to stand by that figure and would be able to say that, as they know the land of this country, it would be capable of that production of 3 cwt. of beef in one year Further, this bullock was to be bought at 36/- per cwt. and sold at 38/- per <Col N="540" /> cwt.  It is a most unusual thing in this country for the graziers, who usually buy their cattle in April or May and sell them at the end of the summer, to get a higher price per cwt. when selling them than they had to pay when buying.  The case for some years past has always been the other way about.  Then we find that the cow just taken into calculation was a 600-gallon cow, which is not the average cow at all, and the 600 gallons were sold at 8d. per gallon. I am not sure if it is the average either, but Deputies from the creamery districts will say that they are not getting 8d. per gallon, even taking into account the value of the separated milk.  This cow which is producing 600 gallons of milk at 8d. per gallon is to be fed for the whole winter at £4 15s. 3d.  If she gets hay and turnips to keep her for the winter, that is as far as £4 15s. 3d. will go, and it is not a proper way to treat a 600-gallon cow.</P>
    <P>Some of the departments of agriculture in the various universities have been working at the accountancy of various farms, and I have read the report of two of them. One of them was from the Department of Agriculture, Cambridge University. It is a book entitled &ldquo;Four Years Farming in East Anglia,&rdquo; by R. Carslaw, a member of Cambridge University School of Agriculture. He states: &ldquo;On holdings where the production of fat beef and wholesale milk were the chief pursuits loss ensued.&rdquo;  The average profit over all the farms which were accounted for by him was 8/- per acre.  The profit from wheat was £2 per acre.  There is a similar report from the University of Leeds by A.G. Ruston, accounts kept from the years 1921 to 1927.  There were 55 or 56 farms. The last paragraph in his report is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although the animal products represented 67.7 per cent. of the output on the successful farms, the profit derived from the stock was only 51 per cent. of the profit made.  On the other hand, the profit made on the crops was 49 per cent. of the total profit, though the total crop products only <Col N="541" /> amounted to 32.3 per cent. of the total output.  From this it can be understood that the farmer who relies mainly on the rearing and feeding of cattle may easily find himself in an unsound financial position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this particular case where £2 per acre of profit was made on these 55 or 56 farms over a period of six years, wheat was produced and sold at the prices which ruled for these six years.  It may be held that the price of wheat was higher then, that it was high enough to give a profit, and that it has not been so high since 1927.  I saw, however, on the 23rd October&mdash;a few days ago&mdash;an interview in the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; with the Secretary of the National Association of Corn and Agricultural Merchants, Mr. Herbert Smith.  He said that if the farmers got 48/- to 50/- a quarter for their wheat they could give good wages and would be encouraged to develop.  That would be 28/- or 29/- per barrel. Some of the Deputies here will be able to bear me out in this statement. A few weeks ago we were down in South Wexford, in a co-operative store.  A number of farmers were present and were explaining to us how they were disposing of their grain to this co-operative store.  The question of wheat arose, and one farmer told us that he had grown 20 acres of wheat for several years up to last year.  Last year was the first year he ceased to grow it.  He told us that so far as he personally was concerned he would be prepared to go back to the production of wheat if there was a guaranteed price of 25/- per barrel.  He said he believed that would pay him better, or pay any farmer better, than 16/- per barrel for barley.  So that we are still, at any rate, within the 30/- per barrel mark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that question can be settled by some of the Deputies on these Benches who had to sell milling wheat this year.  They will be able to say what they were offered for it.  In the speech of the Minister for Agriculture which I quoted a few minutes ago, he gave it as his opinion that wheat could be grown profitably by the farmers in the year 1925, when prices were higher than they are now, at 30/- or less per barrel. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The farmer may have two or three sons who would not be working terribly hard.  What has that man been giving for flour, for instance, for the last two or three years?  He was paying £1 or £1 0s. 6d. for the bag.  He could produce that for about 12/- off his own land if that land was in good heart.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister meant a cwt. of wheat would correspond with a bag of flour.  That is, if ground into wholemeal.  At that rate it could be produced for 30/- per barrel.  In the same statement he said that barley could be produced at 8/- per cwt.  Our information at the Economic Committee, from the figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture, was that there was very little difference in the cost of production of wheat, barley and oats.  So that it is questionable if there could be that difference of 12/- for wheat against 8/- for barley. The production of wheat would appear, therefore, from any authorities that we can find on the subject, to be a profitable thing to the farmer at 30/- per barrel.  If we could induce the Dáil to pass this resolution and have a Wheat Control Board set up, and if that Wheat Control Board, after going into the <Col N="543" /> question and consulting the various interests, which we did not do in the Economic Committee&mdash;millers, bakers, and so on&mdash;were to decide and fix the price of home-grown wheat at 30/- per barrel, I am quite confident that they would get a considerable amount, if not all, of the wheat required in this country.</P>
    <P>A further advantage of this scheme, if adopted by the farmers of the country, would be that they would have cheaper offals.  At the present time we know how the offal trade is regulated, that offals come principally from Britain, and if offals at Liverpool, say, are 7/- per cwt. they will be at least 8/- per cwt. in Dublin, and in the counties surrounding Dublin, which get their supplies from Dublin, there will be an increased charge, so that by the time the farmer in the midlands gets his offals it will probably mean 10/- per cwt.  Under this scheme of increased acreage of wheat there would naturally be mills for the grinding of wheat set up more generally throughout the country, and the result would be that these mills would have to sell the offals more cheaply than they are sold at present, because the sale of offals depends, like everything else, on demand and supply.  If we were getting all our wheat ground in the country, even if not grown here, we would find that the demand for the offals would not be equal to the supply, and at the commencement, at any rate, offals would fall suddenly in price. They would probably settle at 1/- or 2/- per cwt. below their present price when compared with the price of maize, oats, barley and other feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>These are, in general at any rate, some of the arguments that might be adduced for the growing of wheat here.  There are, however, many and various arguments put up against the growing of wheat.  I am sure the opposition to this scheme is crystallised in the Majority Report of the Economic Committee against the proposals for the growing of wheat. In that report there are thirty-one <Col N="544" /> pages of objections.  Some of these objections are, in my opinion, altogether unfounded, and some of them, I believe, have been suggested by minds prejudiced against the growing of wheat.  For instance, the very first objection tells us that &ldquo;flours manufactured from imported wheats, if sold without restriction, would appeal more strongly to the public taste than flour made wholly or partially from native wheat&mdash;that the people of this country will demand foreign wheat as long as they can get it, and that if we allow certain millers to grind foreign wheat only that they will be in unfair competition with millers who have to use a certain mixture of native wheat.&rdquo;  First of all, of course, that is not in the scheme.  Even so, I do not know if even that contention could be borne out by the fact, because we find, for the last three or four years at any rate, reports from the Department of Agriculture itself pointing out the good varieties of wheat that can be grown in this country.  For instance, in the Journal of the Department in the first quarter of this year there is a report on Red Stettin wheat grown in Co. Tipperary which stated: &ldquo;The flour produced from this variety of wheat again showed that it is capable of producing loaves of good size and flavour, and that in this respect it compares favourably with bakers' flour.&rdquo;  In the Tariff Report we have the same thing from Messrs. Odlum &amp; Odlum who were given flour milled from native wheat to report upon.  Their report stated: &ldquo;Wheat of the type reported on above can be incorporated in the average Irish millers' grist to great advantage both in the matter of colour and flavour.&rdquo;&ldquo;To great advantage,&rdquo; they state; they do not go to the length of making any excuse for the native wheat; they do not try to excuse it by saying it was almost as good, but they say it can be incorporated to great advantage. So that at least we have millers with the reputation of Messrs. Odlum and Odlum. who have evidently taken up this question with an unprejudiced mind, and have reported that the <Col N="545" /> native wheat is quite suitable for incorporating in the ordinary millers' grist.</P>
    <P>Another very strong point made by the Majority Report was that we do not grow strong wheat in this country.  They make the point that &ldquo;popular taste demands bakers' bread of a kind to be made only from flour milled from grist composed wholly or almost wholly of strong wheat.&rdquo;  That is not a fact. The popular taste may demand a certain sort of bread, but it is not a fact that the popular taste demands bread made from flour which is derived wholly or almost wholly from strong wheat, because the popular taste has never been supplied with any such thing. If the signatories to this Majority Report had known anything about the subject before signing the report, they should have known that no baker incorporates more than 60 per cent of flour from strong wheat in the mixture.  There is 40 per cent. of flour from weak wheat in all bakers' mixtures, so that the popular taste cannot be demanding a thing that it does not know.  Then they go on to say &ldquo;neither this variety&rdquo;&mdash;that is Manitoban&mdash;&ldquo;of wheat nor any other of the strong Canadian wheats is reasonably productive in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  If we can produce a strong wheat, whether Manitoban or Red Fife, or some other strong wheat, we ought to be quite satisfied.  We know that the millers are satisfied, that the bakers are satisfied, and that, in all probability, the popular taste will be quite satisfied, because the people will not know the difference between the two.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to quote on this question a gentleman who was then an official of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Caffrey. Reading a paper in March of last year before the Congress on Wheat Growing, he said: &ldquo;Ireland was as capable of producing wheats well adapted to modern milling methods and perfectly conformable to the modern taste as she was when the stone mill was in vogue.  From the old Red Stettin wheat which belongs <Col N="546" /> to the County Tipperary, a selection had been obtained which was a good cropper and of excellent quality. Having been under test for several years, it has always produced a beautiful quality of grain, and it was evidently as capable of producing a loaf of as good volume, colour, flavour and crust as ordinary strong bakers' flour.  In appearance and quality the grain resembled Manitoba No. 2.  It also possessed good winter hardness and a good yield on suitable land, but the straw was not very strong, and it would not, therefore, be a suitable variety for cultivation on rich soils.  Some millers have stated that this wheat is worth five shillings or six shillings per barrel more than the ordinary wheat grown in Ireland.  The best sample of wheat grown in Ireland was grown last year, and some of the best lots came from the counties Kerry and Clare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few days ago we had also a report on this year's crop of Red Stettin wheat.  A demonstration was given by a Mr. O'Donoghue, who has a farm near Kanturk, of certain crops to a number of farmers in the district.  The report says: &ldquo;The new variety of Red Stettin greatly impressed, and, judging from its appearance, it is very likely to solve the problem of winter wheat varieties best suited to our climate and to our soil conditions.&rdquo;  We need not, however, lose any more of our time over this question of strong wheat, because, as I have already stated, the amount of strong wheat required for bakers' bread is only 60 per cent., and the other 40 per cent. comes from weak wheat.  The amount of our flour used by bakers is only one-third of the total coming into the country, and all the flour used for domestic purposes&mdash;that is, 66 per cent. of the flour coming into the country is from weak wheat.  So that, putting the two together, we find that 80 per cent. of the wheat required in this country is of the weak variety.  It is only when we reach the stage of growing 80 per cent. our own wheat in this <Col N="547" /> country that we will be up against the question of strong wheat.</P>
    <P>We find also, from a table supplied as to the improvement in the production of various crops for the last seventy or eighty years, that the improvement in the production of wheat has been better than the improvement in the production of either oats or barley.  The yield of wheat in the years 1847-1860 was only 12.9 cwts. per acre, whereas in the years 1921-28 it was 19.1.  That is a much better increase than in either oats or barley.  The majority who signed the report tried to explain this away, saying that the reason why the yield of wheat was better now in comparison with those years back between 1847 and 1860 was because of the small amount of land under wheat.  In other words, that the best land was given to the production of wheat, and that if the area was increased we would not have the same good yield.  In that connection I would like to come back again to what Mr. Caffrey said in that paper.  He, speaking as an official of the Department of Agriculture, said &ldquo;that no unsupported theories should be allowed to prevent farmers from producing as large a proportion as possible of the 500,000 tons of wheat which are necessary to feed our population.  It had been proved by his division of the Department of Agriculture that not only could good quality wheat be grown in this country, but that it can be grown all over the country.  It was difficult to maintain that any country could remain politically independent if it was of necessity forced to rely for its very existence upon imported food supplies.  There were no other cereals, or, in fact, no other agricultural crop, which could be cultivated under as wide a range of soils and climates as could wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The majority who signed this report stated the objections in tabular form against the growing of wheat from the farmers' point of view.  They say that the first thing that must be taken into consideration is the economy of the farm.  Of <Col N="548" /> course that is not disputed; it must be taken into consideration.  It says &ldquo;wheat is regarded as a more exhausting crop on the soil than other cereals.&rdquo;  There was a good deal of controversy about this statement before.  It appeared to be taken for granted that that is so, but we should not fall into the error that we have been warned against by Mr. Caffrey of the &ldquo;unsupported theory.&rdquo;  There is one authority at least that I could call in against that theory on this occasion, and that is the authority of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  Their correspondent&mdash;he is also it appears correspondent to the &ldquo;Daily Telegraph&rdquo;&mdash;visited Denmark and he tells us that they have 46 per cent. of their land under cereals and that they have a yield of 23.8 cwts. of wheat per acre.  He goes on to say that they have 17 per cent. of their land under roots and then winds up.  &ldquo;And the observer notices an almost complete absence of the dirty field and the starved piece.&rdquo;  So that the field was neither starved nor exhausted after all this tillage and neither was it dirty with weeds as has been asserted by the majority of reports.  However, we cannot, I suppose, place our whole reliance upon a correspondent of that sort so we must leave that a disputed question whether it is a more exhausting crop or not.</P>
    <P>The next objection is the point about the field growing wheat likely to be more foul with weeds than under any other crop.  Personally I have not seen that.  It may be the case in some parts of the country but for the counties with which I am rather intimately acquainted so far as agriculture goes&mdash;Wicklow and Wexford&mdash;I have not seen any wheat patch that was any more foul with weeds than a patch under oats or barley.  I think it depends on whether the crop is a good one or not.  If the crop is a good one weeds cannot grow, if the crop is not good there will be weeds.  But the same applies to any other crop.</P>
    <P>The next thing from the farmer's point of view is that he is limited in the particular area that he can put under wheat because of the fact that <Col N="549" /> he must have land suitable for the growing of wheat.  Of course that applies to every crop; you must have land suitable for that particular crop, itself, but, certainly, that argument could be brought forward with much more force against barley or potatoes than against wheat&mdash;perhaps not so much against oats.  Then they say &ldquo;If corn is grown as a cash crop the return likely to be derived from a wheat crop as compared with a crop of oats or barley,&rdquo; and so on.  But even taking the price for wheat as it was without any subsidy, and taking the yield of the three crops wheat, oats and barley in 1924-5-6-7 we find that the acre of wheat was worth £12 4s. 2d, the acre of barley £9 6s. 11d. and the acre of oats £7 10s. 7d. so that as a cash crop wheat was much superior to the other two, and that without any subsidy.  Then they go on to this other vexed question of the nurse crop.  It has been stated by many that wheat is not as good a nurse crop as either of the other two.</P>
    <P>We find, however, in connection with that, that the only witness who was examined before the Economic Committee, and who had grown a considerable quantity of wheat every year, was the manager of the Agricultural College at Athenry.  He told us that he saw no difference whatever between the meadows following wheat and the meadows following oats or barley.  As far as my personal experience goes in the County Wicklow, where wheat is practically invariably followed by grass, I would say that it is considered by the farmers of that county as good a nurse crop as any of the others.</P>

      <P>The next objection is that wheaten straw cannot be used for fodder like oats or barley straw. There are two answers to that.  The first is that some of the witnesses who came before us, County Instructors from the counties of Tipperary and Waterford principally, said that it was quite a common practice, <Col N="550" /> some years ago, to feed wheaten straw to stock, with what result I cannot say, because we do not see it done now.  Even apart from that, it is always necessary for a farmer to have a certain amount of straw for bedding for his stock, and it is not likely that the amount of wheaten straw will be too much for his requirements.  The next statement is that there is no really prolific variety of spring wheat available.  That, perhaps, is quite true, but we hope the Department of Agriculture will make that right. The report also says that &ldquo;there is greater risk of total or partial failure of crops in the case of wheat than in the case of other tillage crops.&rdquo; There was a questionnaire sent out on this subject to the three agricultural colleges&mdash;Albert, Clonakilty and Athenry.  Taking an average year, the questions asked were (1) what was the percentage of total failure in the wheat crop in each of the three colleges; (2) what was the percentage of partial failure&mdash; partial failure being described as 50 per cent.&mdash;and the answer from the three colleges to each of the questions was none, so that the evidence, as far as we could get it, was against this statement, that there was a greater danger of partial or total failure in the case of the wheat crop. Talking of the limited area that can be put under wheat, and taking into account the farmer's economy, the report says that the growing of wheat on lea land is not attended with success, save in the case of land which has been under grass for one year only.  Now, I believe that is also what Mr. Caffrey referred to as an unsupported theory.  I do not know if there is any Deputy here who will support that; that wheat cannot be grown on lea land except on lea land that is only one year under grass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a wheat grower. The report says: &ldquo;On the other hand, the area of land capable of producing wheat satisfactorily as a second corn crop is limited.&rdquo;  On that I wish to say that if we are to pay any attention to the witnesses who were called before us at the Economic Committee, that point was not only contradicted, but at least one County Instructor said that he had seen wheat grown for two years in succession&mdash;not only wheat grown after oats and barley&mdash;but wheat grown after wheat on the same lea land in the counties of Tipperary and Waterford.  Another objection&mdash;I do not know whether it is really meant to be an objection, but at any rate it is a consideration&mdash;says that &ldquo;unless the price of live stock and of live stock commodities, to the production of which the country is, beyond question, admirably adapted, should fall considerably in relation to that of wheat,&rdquo; and so on, that wheat would not be produced at the price.  As I have already stated, I do not see how one interferes with the other.  In countries like Denmark, which have a much higher percentage tilled than we have, they are able to produce more live stock products than we are.  Therefore, why <Col N="552" /> the question of replacing live stock by the growing of wheat should come in I cannot see, because it is evidently possible to do both at the same time.  Paragraph 25, in brief, means that if we ask our farmers to grow more wheat they will be compelled to sow more roots in order to comply with their proper rotation; that it will be necessary then for them to buy more live stock to consume those roots, and that, the wheat being sold, it will further be necessary for them to grow more cereals to feed the live stock.  According to this not only would our farmers be compelled to grow more roots, but they would be compelled to increase their tillage to a considerable extent. If they were induced to grow more wheat under this scheme we would at least achieve one of the principal objects we had in view in putting down this motion, and that is the increase of tillage in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It says that in good husbandry the proportion of cereals to roots should be in the proportion of two to one.  If we look at the statistics area we will see that cereals covered 814,000 acres and roots 700,000 acres, so that there is, keeping within the limits of good husbandry, room for expansion to the extent of almost another 600,000 acres of cereals, and it would not be absolutely necessary to change the farmer's economy, as far as rotation goes, to produce practically the amount of wheat we require.  If what the majority report says is true, that it would change the economy to such an extent as to lead to considerably increased tillage all over the country, then all the better.  Another point is that although the average price of wheat in the three years 1924-5-6, exceeded 30/- per barrel, the average area of wheat annually grown did not exceed 30,000 acres.  I think the argument just used of the relative price of live stock, and more especially the relative price of other grain crops grown as compared with wheat would have a bearing on that, but I believe apart from that the most important point about this whole matter is the fixed price.  The <Col N="553" /> farmer, for instance, sowing his wheat in 1926 did not know, very likely, what he would get for his 1925 crop, for usually it is necessary for the farmer to sow his wheat almost immediately after he has threshed the crop of the previous year, and he does not definitely know what his wheat is worth.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that the big danger in this scheme is that it would not lead to increased tillage, and that in fact it would lead to substitution&mdash;that wheat be substituted for barley and oats.  If the majority who signed this report do not turn out to be right, that it will upset the farmer's economy by making him go into increased tillage, they are sure to be right in this, that barley and oats will be substituted by wheat.  Again, the report states that &ldquo;it would be a desirable thing in some dairying districts if we had more tillage, and the production of wheat as a cash crop would not tend towards a better economy in such farms,&rdquo; because it states: &ldquo;It is unlikely that farmers will turn to the production of wheat as long as they make a profit out of their present system of farming.&rdquo;  I have already pointed out what the most optimistic figures of the Department of Agriculture show as the profit on dairy farming or the production of beef, and it certainly cannot reach the figure of £5 3s. 6d. per acre which would be reached by wheat on the figures supplied to us at 30/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>They go on to tell us that this is going to be a profit to certain districts only, that is, the wheat producing districts, and they remind us that the farmers themselves, including the farmers in the Gaeltacht, will have to pay.  It is quite true that the farmers themselves will have to pay for a considerable part of this subsidy, but the very same argument could be used against all the other schemes brought in here with much more force.  It could be used with much more force against beet, which is localised to seven or eight counties around Carlow, or against any money spent on the development of creameries, which <Col N="554" /> are principally localised in two or three counties in the South of Ireland. Wheat would be grown to some extent, at least, in every county in Ireland, and it would be better distributed than either beet or creameries are distributed at present. At the conclusion of the majority report they say &ldquo;that the farmers who are making most money for themselves and creating most wealth for the country as a whole are those who do mixed farming and who are tilling a much higher percentage of their land than the average.  These farmers are the minority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the principal arguments put against us on this was that in our scheme we were attempting to point out things that might be done in agriculture, that the farmers know their own business best, and that the farmers will do what pays them the best.  We find that the seven gentlemen who signed this report point out that the farmers who are doing the best for themselves as well as for the country are the people who are going in for mixed farming.  Still they say they are in the minority in the country, so that in that particular case, at least, the majority of farmers do not know what is best for themselves.  The point is that the Ministers can discover certain things where the farmers do not know their business best, but if any other person attempts to point out any such thing he is told the farmers know their own business best.</P>

      <P>They go on to say that we made a ridiculous claim at the Economic Committee when talking about the possibility of this country being left without food in case of the interruption of communications between Great Britain and Ireland. The case was mentioned of a strike that occurred a couple of years ago. They told us that the difficulty would not be how to get food into Ireland, but how to get it out of it; that the food could come from other places such as Canada and the <Col N="555" /> Argentine, and that our difficulty would be to get food out to Great Britain.  If that is the case, if there is any possibility that we could ever be up against a difficulty like that, we should try to alter our economy in some way.  If there is ever the possibility that we may be in the position that we will require to get wheat from the Argentine, the United States or Canada, that we would have no money to pay for the wheat because Great Britain could not take our cattle or our bacon, then we should try to alter our position somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the easiest way to alter that position is to try and produce the wheat, or whatever else we may require, for our own needs in this country.  They tell us that we could easily exist on the food in the country for any length of time and, if we were put to it, we could turn to the sowing of wheat ourselves.  We find, however, that the average amount of wheat which we would have on hands in this country, in the case of an interruption of communications, would not be sufficient to sow as seed to produce a crop capable of maintaining the population for anything like twelve months.  Why we should be in a better position to compete in the case of beef, butter, bacon, eggs, or anything else in the British market, against the whole world than we are in the case of our own market for grain, wheat or anything else, I cannot see.  It is a puzzle to me why we should not direct our efforts in that direction and try to produce these commodities ourselves.  In the majority report they are, of course, certain to be right in some things. In one part of the report they say, for instance, that the subsidy is going to be too costly, that it will amount to a million, and that the farmers and others will have to pay for it.  In another part of the report, however, they say that the farmers will not grow wheat, and that, therefore, there will be no subsidy at all.  They say also in regard to the amount of wheat grown that the fact that the area under wheat has <Col N="556" /> remained constant, for 1924, 1925 and 1926 in or about 30,000 acres, shows that the price does not tempt the farmer, because the price in some of these years was over 30/- a barrel, so that no price would induce the farmer to grow more.</P>
    <P>In another part of the report they say that in some years the farmer cannot grow wheat owing to the bad season.  They say that 1926 was a bad year, but, in spite of the assertion that in some years farmers cannot grow wheat owing to the bad season, the area under wheat has remained constant.  In one part of the report they state that it will not lead to increased tillage, that there will be nothing but substitution, and that the farmer who is going to grow wheat will get out of barley or oats. Then again in another part of the report they say that the whole scheme of farming will be upset, that the farmer will have to grow more roots in order to rotate wheat, and in order to find more consumption for roots will have to increase his live stock, grow more cereals, and the result will be that he will have to grow three or four times as much as before.  We can take it, of course, that there are alternatives to the report, so that if they are not right in one way they will be right in another.  Another thing to which attention was drawn in the report was that not only would it put up the price by the people having to pay the subsidy, but also that the price of bread to the consumer would remain at its present level when it should fall, or that it would go up when it should remain at its present level.  If we examine the report of the Tribunal on Prices we will find that it was stated that the 4 lb. loaf was selling in Limerick at 9d., in Dublin, Waterford and Sligo at 10d., in Dundalk at 10½d., and in Cork and Galway at 11d.  If the 4 lb. loaf could be sold in Limerick at that time at 9d. there is no reason why it should not be sold in Dublin at the same price, and no reason was given why it should not.</P>
    <P>That would have made a difference in the price of a barrel of wheat of 5s. 3d., so that here we had one of <Col N="557" /> these various Commissions, which have been set up during the last few years to enquire into this question, giving an instance where the consumers of bread in Dublin are paying at the rate of 5s. 3d. per barrel of wheat too much, and in Cork and Galway at the rate of 10s. 6d. too much.  Nothing has been done to remedy that state of affairs since the Commission reported.  Objection is made here to a scheme which may increase the price of a barrel of wheat by 3s. 6d., and even a little more but not much more.  We have the objection put up that not only will the people have to pay the subsidy in that case but also that they will have to pay in a secondary way, owing, perhaps, to the price of bread being kept up more than it should be.  As a matter of fact when these figures were made out the price of imported wheat was at its very lowest level and since then the price has gone up.  During part of this year it has gone up considerably over the price given in these figures.</P>

      <P>During the last few days the price of wheat collapsed, but there is not a collapse in Wall Street or London every day.  As the Minister knows, that is a matter of only a few days.  Before the collapse, for three or four months past, the price of wheat was a good deal higher than these figures disclose. The Minister in his speech on the question of a flour tariff said that the Fianna Fáil Party were wrong in their predictions that the price of wheat was going up.  The Fianna Fáil Party did not make predictions in their report but said that the price of wheat at the time the report was being drawn up was abnormally low, as compared with that prevailing three or four years previously, and that it was possible that in the next few years it would be higher. The Minister said that the Fianna Fáil Party were wrong in their prediction because the price went down, but we could say that some time ago the Minister was wrong in his prediction. How is it going to work out <Col N="558" /> for the twelve months?  That is the question.  At any rate we can say that it is not true that the price of wheat came down definitely, as was maintained by some of those who signed the majority report.</P>

      <P>They maintain that the price of wheat had come down definitely and was going to stay down on account of the larger areas in Canada and elsewhere under this crop.  That has not been proved to be true.  There have, at least, been a few months during the summer when the price of wheat went much above that level, and that shows that it is possible that it may go up again.  The figures given in the majority and minority reports are based on the abnormally low figures regarding imported wheat.  Therefore the subsidy required to pay the farmers looks abnormally high and, according to the majority report at any rate, is sufficient to deter any Deputy from voting for this scheme. If the prices were inquired into and if the figure was made out by any Deputy on the prices ruling for the last two or three months it would be found that the subsidy would not cost as much as it was thought it would under these figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want deliberately to misrepresent the Deputy.  Other Deputies were listening to him.  Farmer Deputies were listening, and his speech conveyed all that to me.  He said it in a great many different sentences, and attacked it from a great many different angles, but that is what it all came to.  Apparently the farmers of the country do not know all that.  It is a pity that they do not, because, if they did, you would have the same area under wheat as under barley&mdash;in fact, a bigger area. As it is, you have only 30,000 acres of wheat and 130,000 of barley.  If the farmers knew all that, you would, as I say, have a bigger area of wheat than oats, but, as they do not know it, the result is that you have only 30,000 acres of wheat and 640,000 acres of oats.  I hope when it is announced in the newspapers in the morning that farmers will take advantage of it next spring, and, if they do, you would have about a million acres of wheat and about 30,000 acres of potatoes.  Deputy Dr. Ryan spoke about unauthorised theories, unsupported theories.  I thought that the Deputy was a practical farmer, that he had some land and farmed it, but, listening to him quoting irrelevant statistics from Denmark, the United States, Canada and elsewhere, I am reluctantly and <Col N="560" /> rather sorrowfully forced to the conclusion that his only knowledge of agriculture is based on unsupported theory.  Judging from the deductions which he draws from English, Danish, and Canadian agriculture, he is entirely at the mercy of Mr. So-and-So who farms in East Anglia, Herr So-and-So who farms in Denmark, and someone else in Canada. I cannot believe that any practical farmer would make the sort of speech which Deputy Dr. Ryan has just made on wheat-growing.</P>

      <P>I am not relying on unsupported theory.  I may say that we will have only to agree to differ, and let the farmers, even those on the Fianna Fáil Benches, judge, if they like to do so.  I say that wheat is more exhausting and dirties the land more than any other crop.  I say that a farmer who sows wheat after another grain crop is ruining his land and knows nothing about his business.  I say that wheat impoverishes the land more and requires a choicer soil than any other crop.  The evidence in support of that is the evidence of every farmer in this country.  The figures speak for themselves.  Wheat in the last sixty years has reduced in area to a greater extent than any other crop. It was 700,000 acres in 1840, and it is now 30,000, whereas there are 600,000 acres of oats, 300,000 of potatoes, and 150,000 of barley.  I say that when you take that on one side, with the acknowledged facts as they are known to every farmer, that it is a difficult and exhausting crop, that it is absolutely certain that the conclusion that wheat pays the farmer less than any other crop is the true conclusion.  There is no answer to that when you take on one side the admitted facts and on the other side the practice of the farmers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Deputy to state what subsidy he thinks would bring about the area of wheat which he wants. The Deputy referred to the minority report.  I remember reading the <Col N="561" /> figures, but I have forgotten them. I thought, however, at the time that they were perfectly absurd.  I gave my figures.  The Deputy says that he is quite satisfied that you could get a big area of wheat at 30/- a barrel.  What has made him think that?  Has he anything but unsupported theory for that statement? Irish wheat fetched 30/- a barrel for some years, but the area remained about 30,000 acres.  The Deputy explained that there was no guaranteed market and that the price of oats and other cereals as well as live stock would have to be taken into account.  I admit that.  But surely, whatever else these figures prove, the figure of 30/- on one side and the still permanent acreage of 30,000 on the other, they cannot be adduced to prove that 30/- a barrel will secure 300,000 or 400,000 acres of wheat, which would be half the requirements of the country.  In fact, they indicate the exact opposite, if they indicate anything.  Even taking into account the considerations which the Deputy mentioned, they make it clear that to depend on 30/- in order to increase the acreage under wheat from 30,000 to 350,000, which is half the area required, is absolutely absurd.  There is no possible chance that you would get half the area of wheat required for 30/- a barrel.  We got £24 per ton for sugar beet, and how much extra land did it bring into cultivation? Very little.  It merely brought about substitution.  I make Deputies a present of these figures.  Assuming for the sake of argument that you had a guaranteed price of 32/- per barrel, I do not believe that you would get 10,000 extra acres of wheat.  Let us assume, however, that you would get half the wheat which the country required, what would that amount to by way of subsidy?</P>
    <P>You must add to the 32/- a barrel the sum of 3/- in order to compare Irish wheat with Pacific wheat.  The exact figure mentioned by the millers was 3/6.  I am, however, taking 3/-, and that is to account for seven per cent. more moisture and the cost of taking it out.  That gives you 35/-. <Col N="562" /> What is the price of Pacific wheat at present?  Assume that it is 30/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it is about 27/6, but in order to make room for the rise that is to take place I will assume 30/-.  I cannot deal with certainties.  I know Deputy Lemass can.  I have never attempted to predict what is going to happen in the future.  I am putting the figures absolutely against myself.  It all means a subsidy of 5/- a barrel.  It would take about 4,500,000 barrels of wheat to supply the needs of the country; to supply half the needs of the country it would take 2,250,000 barrels.  That would mean about £500,000 a year for the purposes of substituting one crop for another.  I beg to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned until Wednesday, 6th November.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long with the remarks that I wish to make at this stage.  The Minister this afternoon, in reply to the question raised by me as to why he refused sanction to the Rathmines Urban District Council to accept the lowest tender for a road repair contract said: &ldquo;In the case of a road improvement contract I have refused to the Rathmines Urban District Council sanction to accept a tender of Messrs. Grainger Brothers, which was the lowest tender offered.  It has been intimated to the Council that in the event of this tender being accepted a grant from the Road Fund allocated towards the improvement of this road will be withheld.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in so far as we Independent Deputies know the facts that are relevant they are very brief indeed. This particular road improvement was part of a scheme which was approved of some time ago by the Local Government Department, and to enable the Council to carry out that scheme I understand that a grant of £2,900 was to be made from the Road Fund.  On the strength of that the Council invited tenders and <Col N="563" /> met to consider the tenders submitted under the approval of their engineer.  Those tenders were remarkable in that the lowest tender was over £1,500 less than the second lowest.  A sum of £1,500 in a contract of £7,000 is a very substantial figure.  During the past three years I understand that the Council have carried out road improvement work to the extent of £35,000, and never before during that period have they been asked to submit a tender that they accepted for the approval of the Local Government Department.  But it seems remarkable that on this occasion, on the very day that the Council was going to consider the tenders that were submitted, a letter was written by the Local Government Department stating that it would be necessary for them to submit the tender for the approval of the Department.  The Minister went on in his reply to say: &ldquo;I do not accept the implication that my action will cause an increase in the township rate.  The action is intended to secure that road improvement in the Rathmines Urban District will be economically and efficiently carried out.&rdquo; That is precisely the object of the Council. What the Independent Deputies want to know is why the Urban Council will not be allowed to effect a saving of over £1,500 in a contract of this kind.  They have been assured that the tender is submitted by a substantial firm which is able to carry out the work efficiently and economically, and they have been given evidence to that effect.  I may state that the contract was to be carried with a ten years' guarantee as to the excellence of the work, and the firm undertook to provide bank guarantees up to £50,000 as to their financial position.</P>
    <P>On the face of these facts, some of the Independent Deputies want to be given some reason which they could not guess, but some reason which ought to be made public if there was any just cause for refusing permission to the Council to effect this economy.  The Minister, in his reply this afternoon, however, <Col N="564" /> seemed to suggest that this saving of £1,500, if not permitted, would not lead to an increase in the township rate.  If the Minister carries out his intention of refusing a grant of £2,900, it is perfectly clear that the Council will have to provide £1,400 in excess of what otherwise they would have to spend, and though that would not be provided immediately out of the rates, ultimately it would have to be provided and would lead to an increase in the rates struck in the township.  These are the facts as we know them, and we have drawn attention to the matter in order that the fullest publicity may be given to the Minister's reasons for refusing sanction to the tender.</P>

      <P>On the 25th May, 1929, the Rathmines Urban District Council were advised that the sum of £2,962 had been &ldquo;provisionally allotted&rdquo; to the Council for road improvement on the Rathgar Road.  This amount was part of the total cost of the proposed improvement, the balance of any money necessary being provided by the Rathmines Urban District Council out of a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resultant tenders were due to reach the Rathmines Council on the 24th June, and alternative tenders were to be submitted, namely, for mastic asphalt and for sheet asphalt. Now perhaps it is better to say a word on the question of mastic asphalt.  Mastic asphalt is laid by hand.  It is emptied from buckets when hot and fluid and compacted with a wooden float; then crimped with a hand-crimping machine.  All other asphalts are compressed by rollers.  For this reason, and because the ingredients of mastic asphalt are specially prepared to a uniform excellence, mastic asphalt is superior to two-coat or one-coat or sheet or asphaltic concrete.  It does not become rugose, corrugated or wavy.  All these words describe practically the same thing, except that wavy means a surface more gone to pieces than a corrugated surface. Even good two-coat asphalt recently laid shows a wavy appearance <Col N="565" /> under head-lights in wet weather.  Mastic asphalt does not show this, and endures longer in perfect condition.  Waviness is a fatal defect, even when very slight.  An impact effect is produced and the road is hammered to premature destruction.  Its elimination in places where traffic is heavy is most desirable. In Dublin it has been laid down in such places as Upper O'Connell Street, Dame Street, Nassau Street, Dawson Street, Merrion Row, Upper Merrion Street, Lower Baggot Street.</P>
    <P>Now as I say the tenders were due to reach the Rathmines Council on the 24th June and the tenders received were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Associated Asphalt Co., Ltd., London, 22/6d. per sq. yd.</P>
    <P>G. Wimpey &amp; Co., Ltd., London, 20/9d. per sq. yd.</P>
    <P>T.J. Moran, Ltd., Dublin, 19/8d. per sq. yd.</P>
    <P>South of Ireland Asphalt Co., Dublin, 19/5d. per sq. yd.</P>
    <P>Grainger Bros., Co. Down, 16/- per sq. yd.</P>
    <P>This latter tender is the one that I have refused to approve and it is the one that the Rathmines Urban District Council accepted.</P>
    <P>I propose now to show, first, that Messrs. Grainger's general work for us has been unsatisfactory in the past, and in many cases very unsatisfactory. In the second place I will show, in spite of this, that it was thought to be our duty in the Department in view of the difference of price to approve of Messrs. Grainger's tender if it could be established that this firm had previously satisfactorily laid mastic asphalt.  I will show in the third place that despite a rather exhaustive inquiry no evidence was produced that they had previously laid mastic asphalt; and in the fourth place I will show that on the other hand there was a widespread and elaborate implication to the contrary, an implication that they had carried out work of this kind and that they had laid mastic asphalt.</P>
    <P>In dealing with these particular matters, however, I am in the position <Col N="566" /> not so much of stating the reasons why in a particular instance the lowest tender submitted for a piece of road work was not accepted, as in the position of replying to a general charge of corruption in administration and charges of political discrimination.  Deputy Thrift, though he made no reference to it in his opening statement, will realise that.  Some members of the Rathmines Urban District Council in the first case, the Editor of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; in the second case, and following these, some of the Six County Press have all thought fit to charge the Department in the matter of this contract with being guilty of financial corruption and political discrimination.  I want to refer to these charges so that we can keep them in the forefront of the case.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of the very greatest importance that public confidence in the probity or efficiency, and particularly the probity, of a Department like the Department of Local Government, which deals with the control of the expenditure of so much money, and the expenditure on roads and such business as the general expenditure and supervision of general local expenditure, should be maintained.  The Local Government Department has, in addition to these duties, such work as the getting of tenders for Combined Purchasing, and such work as being the Appeal Board in old age pensions. I think you would want to be clear as to the type of charges that are being made in this connection against the Department.  In the light of these charges relating to these circumstances as to what has actually taken place, the spectrum of the charges can, perhaps, best be seen by quotations from the editorial comment of the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; which has dealt with this matter on three occasions, on the 5th September, on the 5th October, and on the 24th October.</P>
    <P>On the 5th September, the comment of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At yesterday's meeting of the Rathmines Urban Council attention was called to the interference <Col N="567" /> of the Free State Department for Local Government in respect of a contract for the asphalting of Rathgar Road.  It seems that tenders were invited for this work in the ordinary way, and that the firm of Messrs. Grainger, of Belfast, had submitted a tender which was £1,500, or 21½ per cent. lower than any other bid.  The Public Health Committee naturally recommended the acceptance of this tender, which duly was approved by the Council; but the Department for Local Government refused to sanction it, having first asked for documentary evidence of the firm's financial standing&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I may say that the Department never asked for such evidence&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and its ability to perform the job according to the conditions of the contract.  The Surveyor of the Rathmines Council went to Belfast, where he satisfied himself completely concerning the solvency and efficiency of the firm, but the Local Government Department, ignoring these facts, persisted in its refusal to sanction the contract.  We agree heartily with those members of the Rathmines Council who declared yesterday that further explanation was necessary. Apparently some quibble about the difference between mastic and sheet asphalt has been raised; but no intelligent citizen will be deceived by such a childish excuse.  The fact that Messrs, Grainger have their headquarters in Northern Ireland makes the matter worse.  It will encourage the suspicion that the Local Government Department's action has a political basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A month later, that is on the 5th October, the editorial in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why has the Minister banned this tender concerning which three things are established&mdash;that it is by far the lowest tender, that it guarantees the material which the Department itself demands, and that, by expert testimony, Messrs. Grainger are thoroughly competent <Col N="568" /> to fulfil the contract?  There are three&mdash;and only three&mdash; rational explanations of the Department's conduct.  One is that it has some personal animus against the firm of Grainger, and another is that some member of the Department has a financial interest in one of the rejected tenders.  Since, of course, we must scout both suggestions, we are forced back upon the third&mdash;that Messrs. Grainger are condemned solely because they are a North of Ireland firm.  For this strictly political reason, then, an important road must remain unrepaired, and employment must be withheld from needy citizens of the Free State.  The matter has not merely a local, but a national interest.  Is this boycott of Northern firms the accepted policy not only of Mr. Mulcahy's Department, but of the Free State Government?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, on the 24th October, in a further editorial in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; the matter is dealt with.  I will read these extracts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Rathmines Urban Council in defying the mysterious ukase of the Local Government Ministry has performed a national service.  The Ministry refused to sanction the proposed contract, on the ground that Messrs. Grainger could not fulfil it satisfactorily. This objection, as the council showed, was ridiculous.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Rathmines Council made several efforts to induce the Ministry to revoke, or at least to explain, its decision.  They were futile.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, the Ministry condemns without rhyme or reason a tender&mdash;which happens to be the lowest tender&mdash;from a competent firm.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that some strong motive inspires the Ministry's action.  To suggest any personal motive&mdash;such as an interest in some rival tender&mdash;would be to assume an almost inconceivable return to ancient wallowings in the mire.  We must conclude, <Col N="569" /> therefore, that the motive is political, and that Messrs.  Grainger are condemned because they had their headquarters in Northern Ireland.  An important question arises instantly, when and by what authority was this boycott introduced?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will, as I say, get from these articles somewhat the full spectrum of the charges made against the Department.  The full gamut of these charges will be found, perhaps, in less flowing terms in the discussion that took place at the Rathmines Urban District Council on the various dates on which they discussed the matter.  I want to give this sample.  It is from the report of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 5th October, of the meeting of the Council on the 4th October.  Mr. Benson, dealing with the matter, answering a member of the Council, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were convinced that the firm was reputable and highly efficient, and, on the authority of the Chief Engineer of Belfast, we knew that they had done mastic asphalt and done it satisfactorily. However, the Government still adhered to their original decision not to allow the contract to go to Graingers.  They had done a thing that they had never done before&mdash; that was to insist on the tenders being sent to them, and to dictate to us how we should deal with them.  Any outsider who went into the whole question, and who was not assured that the Department is the soul of probity and honour, would have come to the conclusion, either that there was some personal animus against the firm or Grainger, or else that some person in the Department had a financial interest in one of the other firms.  We, knowing the Department, know, of course, that neither of these could possibly happen, but the Council considered that they would not be doing right in giving the contract to the next contractor, whose tender was so much higher.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, speaking in public we see <Col N="570" /> that Mr. Benson says that, &ldquo;knowing the Department, we know, of course, that neither of these things could possibly have happened.&rdquo; But, speaking in committee on this particular matter, Mr. Benson thought fit to remark that &ldquo;there was somebody in the Local Government Department getting a right hand-over.&rdquo;  Another member of the Rathmines Urban Council, referring to Mr. Benson's publicly made remark, said that she could not share Mr. Benson's confidence in the Department, while a third stated that &ldquo;he would be glad to accept a tender from a North of Ireland firm, that he hated the Boundary, and he thought that an Irish firm should get the contract without taking into account whether it was from the North or the South.&rdquo;  That is a sample of the mind disclosed in the Rathmines Urban Council on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Press of the Six Counties naturally has a great deal of material for comment on all this, and they made full use of it.  On the 14th September, referring to what had previously transpired in connection with the discussions on the matter, the &ldquo;Irish Builder and Engineer&rdquo; wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems very unfair to contractors who go to a great deal of trouble in preparing competitive tenders for public works, if they are to be passed over when their tender is the lowest, and a preference of £1,500 given to a rival firm in a £5,000 work.  The loss to the ratepayers is, of course, obvious, but their claims seem to receive little consideration at times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is an important thing when a series of charges like these are levelled against the Department, in which probity and efficiency of administration are so vital for the general interest, that it should be answered fully and without regard to the consequences of any other person's reputation or interest.  One thing that has particularly marked the conduct of all the officials with whom I have been connected in the Local Government Department is, in the first place, if we speak simply of <Col N="571" /> roads for the moment, their absolutely detached and up-to-date outlook on the technical and administrative aspect of their work and the scrupulous regard that they have as to the prestige of the various firms with which they necessarily come into contact.  If the reputation of any of these firms is to be damaged now let those who bring about the situation unnecessarily blame themselves. Messrs. Grainger cannot complain if their interest or reputation is hurt by anything I have to say, because from July of this year until the winding-up of this matter they could have given a straight answer to the one question asked them, and that was whether and when had they ever done a mastic asphalt job.  The Rathmines Urban Council cannot complain.  Their surveyor was in close touch with the Roads Section of the Department; their members do not live very far from the Custom House, and any information that they required could have been had there, and the Editor of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; cannot complain, because I think that the Press cannot make any complaint that in the normal and responsible discharge of their Press functions they are ever refused any information that could reasonably be asked by them.  So that none of the people I have mentioned has a complaint if anything that is said hurts anyone's reputation or anyone's interest.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of our experience of Messrs. Grainger, our attitude as to the acceptance of the tender, and what transpired afterwards.  I have said that our experience of Messrs. Grainger's work was that it has been very unsatisfactory.  Messrs. Grainger have been carrying out road contracts for the past twenty-five years.  They had almost a monopoly of steam-rolling contracts in pre-war years.  Their work lay far more in the southern counties than in the Belfast area.  During the past four or five years we have had more difficulty and disputes with Messrs. Grainger than with all the other contractors combined, with a <Col N="572" /> legacy of poor work and much waste of valuable official time.  Messrs. Gregg Brothers, of Larne, and Messrs. Moore &amp; MacCartan are also North of Ireland contractors.  We have had no difficulty with them. They have done good work and have been paid in full.  From 1923 the plain steam-rolling has been progressively curtailed, and asphalt, concrete, and tar bitumen surfacings adopted.  Messrs. Grainger's firm was one of the first to undertake tar bitumen macadam for us.  This was on the Dublin-Swords road in 1925. There was the utmost trouble in getting proper work done.  Messrs. Grainger's men were found to have very little knowledge of how such work should be done when a commencement was made.  Final payment was only made many months after the completion of the surfacing, and was only then made when Messrs. Grainger had laid a mile or so of the road with an inch depth of top coat over and above the depth specified, so as to make up for the inferior stuff underneath.  The work was badly done and was, even with the additional penalty work, bad value for the money.  The contractors were, however, treated leniently and with consideration for difficulties encountered.  I have to read to Deputies a letter showing the difficulties created for the Dublin County Surveyor and what his opinion of Grainger's work then was. The letter is dated 7th February, 1925, and is addressed to Messrs. Grainger Brothers, 74 Ranelagh Road, Dublin.  It is headed &ldquo;Swords Road Contract&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,&mdash;</P>
    <P>I duly received your letter of 28th ultimo asking for a payment on above contract.</P>
    <P>Together with Mr. Quigley, Chief Engineer, Road Dept., Ministry of Local Government, I made an inspection of the bituminous macadam work.  Something over half a mile of raodway is completed and the work is proceeding rapidly.</P>
    <P>The result in the &ldquo;finished surface&rdquo; is so utterly disastrous that a complete stoppage of the work <Col N="573" /> should, in our opinion, be made. We cannot possibly certify for payment.  The surface does not in the least resemble a bituminous or tar macadam roadway, it is like an ordinary waterbound macadam about to go to pieces, being covered with a light slurry of ordinary whitish mud.</P>
    <P>Potholes half an inch deep are common enough, but the worst and most disastrous feature is the working loose of patches of the &ldquo;finished&rdquo; roadway, resembling shingle on a beach.  On these loose patches the macadam has lost all semblance of tar or bitumen covered particles.  The whole surface of the work threatens to go loose in this way.  The work is not being carried out according to specifications:</P>
    <P>1.  The arrangements for the proper heating and mixing of the tar and bitumen are unsatisfactory, as no means of ascertaining the temperature is on the job.</P>
    <P>2.  A good deal of bad soft stone, including a quantity of &ldquo;calcite,&rdquo; is being allowed to go into the crusher.</P>
    <P>3.  The spreading is being badly done without rakes and forks, and a good four inches of material should be spread as specified.</P>
    <P>4.  The binding.  The stone crushed chippings do not conform with the specification.  The chippings being used by you are dirty and contain a large volume of moisture; in fact, they resemble mortar more than stone crusher chippings.</P>
    <P>5.  Sealing coat.  No proper attempt has been made by you to properly carry out this portion of the work.  The sealing is done in an irregular fashion, and I have seen several parts of the road which have not been sealed at all.</P>
    <P>The chippings used for this work are also very bad, and the use of material of this kind must be discontinued. I would prefer that <Col N="574" /> you should use spramex for the sealing coat.</P>
    <P>With further reference to our conversation of this date and your suggestion to slow down work, I am quite agreeable to facilitate you in every way I can to enable you to carry out the work satisfactorily, but unless a complete change is made in the quality of the work I shall reluctantly be compelled to order a stoppage of the work.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">J.A. RYAN,</P>
    <P Just="Right">County Surveyor.</P>
    <P>Under the National Road Scheme these contractors undertook three contracts, the first in Longford town and Dublin Road near the town&mdash;tar bitumen macadam, £6,430.  In this case, final payment was made only after prolonged wrangling with the contractors as to making good defects. The surface now after a year's wear is pitted and lumpy in many parts and is one of the worst results we have had under the scheme.  Secondly, Kilkenny&mdash;tar bitumen macadam on main roads south of the town, £15,272.  This is the best work done by these contractors. They had a good engineer in charge here.  They were paid in full, but the surfacing compares badly with the first-class work done for us by English contractors.  Third, Ballina&mdash;streets of town.  Grant, £8,668, tar bitumen macadam.  This contract was approved on 25th July, 1927.  This work, though begun in August, 1927, has not been paid for in full up to the present as this letter from the County Surveyor of Mayo will show.  It is addressed from the County Surveyor's Office, Castlebar, and dated 4th July, 1929:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Messrs. Grainger Bros.,</P>
    <P>Hollywood, Belfast.</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,&mdash;I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo asking for payment of the amount due under your contract for laying the streets of Ballina in tar macadam.  The total area of tar macadam laid by you amounted to 29,941 square yards at 5/8 per square yard&mdash;value for £8,483 5s. 8d.  You have received <Col N="575" /> to date £7,786 12s. 6d. leaving a nominal balance of £696 13s. 2d. I withheld payment of this amount pending inspection by a responsible engineer from the Government Department and this inspection was carried out on the 2nd July.  My reason for holding up this sum was because I was very much dissatisfied with the deterioration which is already apparent in your work, and I felt that the work was very much inferior to the work carried out in Sligo and other works which I have seen carried out at a much lower price.</P>
    <P>Frequently during the progress of the work I had to make complaints about the way in which the work was being carried out, and on one occasion, on which I found absolute scamping going on, I had to demand the removal of your foreman, who was responsible.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of your maintenance period several defects were apparent, and I pointed those out to your representative, Mr. Green, who undertook to have them remedied.  The repairs which he then carried out were not satisfactory, and the road at present is in very much worse condition than it should be after five years' wear.  On both sides of the road along by the kerb, and along by the fence from Rehins Bridge to the Railway Station, the road has completely perished for about 4 feet on either side.  Again, opposite the Courthouse, there are several defects.  Along Bury Street the surface is very lumpy, and there was absolutely no excuse here, for the foundation was quite good.  Again, from Atkinson's Bridge to Bunree Bridge, and particularly in front of the College and the Palace, the road has absolutely failed, and is now up to the standard of waterbound macadam.  I cannot agree that satisfactory work has been done, and you had no excuse, as you had quite a satisfactory price. You still have your plant in Ballina, and I think, in your own <Col N="576" /> interests, it would be well if you would even now have matters put right.</P>
    <P>Pending a reply to the effect that you will put matters right, I am issuing a certificate for £345 13s. 2d., and am retaining £350, which I consider is the least sum for which the necessary repairs could be carried out in Colfix grout and spray.  Kindly let me know whether for the sake of your reputation you will have matters put right, or whether, in the interests of the public, I am to expend the amount now withheld in repairing the road in the best way I can.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</P>

    <P>Mr. Flanagan is the County Surveyor who was selected by the Local Appointments Commission recently in open competition as County Surveyor for Offaly when there was a vacancy there.  The County Mayo people were not satisfied to lose him, and increased his salary in order to keep him.  Ultimately in the Ballina case there was an inspection on 24th October, 1929, and in the meantime the firm had made a reasonable effort to carry out the improvement work that was suggested, and it was agreed to pay the firm £300, but the balance of £50 is being withheld, because of the general unsatisfactory nature of the work done.  I may say that at the time the contract was accepted for Ballina at 5/8 from Messrs. Grainger there was a tender at 5/8¾ per square yard from another firm.  In spite of what might be thought about not accepting the lowest tender, particularly the lowest tender from a North of Ireland firm, I feel that a very great mistake has been made in everybody's interest in not taking the tender of the firm that was ¾d. per square yard higher than Messrs. Grainger.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon, on a grant of £6,422, notified in February, 1924, Messrs. Grainger Brothers did some steam-rolling work between Athlone and Ballinasloe on a &ldquo;time and material&rdquo; basis, and it worked out <Col N="577" /> at £1,350 a mile.  The County Surveyor immediately afterwards undertook similar work by direct labour, and the cost worked out at £800 a mile for exactly similar work, being a saving of £550 a mile.  When, in March, 1927, competitive tenders were received for the laying of a concrete road from Ferryearrig to Enniscorthy, Messrs. Grainger Brothers' tender was £35,841.  The next lowest tender was that of the Pioneer Road Construction Co., £39,424, a difference of £3,583.  On this occasion the Chief Engineer felt it his duty to attend the Wexford County Council meeting, and to advise that as Messrs. Grainger Brothers had not given satisfaction in fairly big works carried out by them they should not accept their tender, but should accept the next lowest.  This proposition was approved by the Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>This is the Department's experience. I would ask people who have the type of mind that they will not accept the experience of anyone on this side of the Six County Border, to ask, what is the experience of firms in the Six Counties, and I would particularly ask them why in June, 1928, when Down County Council invited tenders for 22,000 sq. yds. of two coat sheet asphalt, and when the lowest price was in a tender submitted by Messrs. Grainger Brothers at 8s. 9d. per sq. yd. the next lowest, being a tender from The Limmer and Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co. at 11s. per sq. yd., the Down County Council accepted the tender of The Limmer and Trinidad Lake Asphalt Company, rather than Grainger Brothers' tender at 8s. 9d., and I would ask them if that was political discrimination against a North of Ireland firm? I put that experience of the Department of this particular firm in the front of our discussions too, so that we may see things in a better perspective. I said that tenders were to be received on 24th June.  On 3rd July the Town Surveyor of Rathmines called to the Department of Local Government and stated that these particular tenders had been received, and that they were at the prices <Col N="578" /> shown.  It will be seen that there are four firms tendering at 22s. 6d., 20s. 9d., 19s. 8d., and 19s. 5d.  These were the tenders from four firms, that to the Department's knowledge are firms of experience, competent to do the work, and fairly normal in the matter of prices.  The next firm is Messrs. Grainger with a tender of 16s., that is 3s. 5d. per sq. yd. below the lowest of the normal firms, as you might say, and 6s. 6d. per sq. yd. below the highest. I said that when giving the tender for the concrete road in Wexford it arose that Messrs. Grainger were £5,600 lower than the Company that actually got it.  The position was similar there.  There were three or four other companies all about the same figure and Messrs. Grainger were down below these.  Here you had a similar position and the Town Surveyor came to the Department. He said these figures had been received. He asked advice and the Department's attitude was that the difference in price was so great that if it could be shown that Graingers' firm had laid mastic asphalt it was their duty to approve of their getting the contract.  That was on the 3rd July.  On the 4th July the Chief Engineer wrote to the Town Clerk and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further to your interview with me in which I was disposed to accept the lowest tender, I have made inquiries and as far as I can learn Messrs. Grainger have never carried out mastic asphalt laying.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the simple work of laying tar bitumen macadam on the Swords Road, 1924, the work done by this firm was unsatisfactory, largely for the reason that the men employed had not suitable plant or sufficient experience.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mastic asphalt is work requiring skilled asphalters, and I consider you will be running too great a risk in accepting inexperienced men.  If Messrs. Grainger make good elsewhere as asphalters I will be only too glad to accept their tender here, but I cannot have them experimenting here at our expense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was signed by the Chief <Col N="579" /> Engineer.  The question still was that if it could be shown that they had done this work the departmental mind was that we would not be justified in not approving of their tender. On the 10th July, 1929, the Secretary of the Department wrote to the Clerk of the Urban District Council asking for particulars of the tenders received by the Rathmines and Rathgar Urban District Council for the carrying out of the proposed work and asking if they would be good enough to submit them to the Department, and saying that no contracts should be entered into without the prior approval of the Minister. The question has been raised that the Department has taken up a different attitude in regard to this matter, the issuing of the tenders and the approving of their acceptance, from that which is usually taken.  That is not a fact.  In expending money on the Road Fund one of the conditions of the giving out of these grants is in the first place that the specifications will be specifications that have been submitted to the Department.  Cases will occur where specifications have been already approved and are in standard form, as in the case of the City of Dublin.  But specifications will have to be submitted to the Department.  Anyone will understand the reason of that and will feel that the Road Department would not be doing its duty if it did not require at this hour of the day to see the specifications.</P>

      <P>Did the Council submit specifications in this case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The practice is that specifications are required to be submitted, that we require to approve of the tender and that we inspect the work.  Tenders were not submitted in this case, and the Rathmines people may be confusing the practice that exists when they do road improvement work out of a loan, their own money, with doing work when they get a grant from the Road Fund.  At any rate, we asked them to submit the tenders <Col N="580" /> The tenders were submitted, and it was said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The successful contractors have been informed that the acceptance of the tender is dependent on the approval of the Ministry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 17th July the Secretary wrote again to the Clerk of the Urban District Council:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th inst. forwarding particulars regarding the tenders received by the Rathmines and Rathgar Urban District Council in connection with the Road Fund grant of £2,960 notified to them on May last.  It is understood that the Council propose to accept the tender for the laying of asphalt on a six-inch reinforced concrete foundation from Messrs. Grainger Bros.  The Minister would be glad to be furnished with documentary evidence that this firm has previously satisfactorily laid mastic asphalt to a reasonable extent on a public road.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 27th July the Town Clerk reports that he has informed us that Mr. Lambert, Town Surveyor, proceeded to Belfast on the 23rd inst. with this object in view.</P>
      <P>On the 16th July one of our inspectors discussed at Rathmines the matter with the Town Surveyor, and the Town Surveyor told him that he had a letter from the City Engineer of Belfast stating that Messrs. Grainger had laid mastic asphalt on three streets in Belfast, but he was unable to find the letter; that he telephoned Belfast Corporation and found that the names were Garfield Street, Upper and Lower Queen Street and Brunswick Street, and that engineers had promised to send copies of the specification from which the work had been carried out. Rathmines Council reported that the Town Surveyor had gone to Belfast with the object of finding out that Messrs. Grainger had previously satisfactorily laid mastic asphalt.</P>
      <P>On the 31st July the Council submitted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As requested in your letter of <Col N="581" /> the 17th inst. (that is where we asked for documentary evidence) I enclose herewith by direction of the Council the following documents regarding the carrying out of asphalt work by Messrs. Grainger Bros.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Copy report, Surveyor, Rathmines District Council, dated 7th July, 1929.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This report is to Mr. Robinson, and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As directed, I visited Belfast last Tuesday and I inspected four streets, namely, Queen Street, Upper and Lower; Garfield Street, and Brunswick Street, laid down by Messrs. Grainger Bros. in 1926. The surfaces are exceptionally good, but in my opinion are laid down in sheet asphalt on concrete, and not in mastic asphalt.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I interviewed Mr. MacMurray, Assistant Surveyor of Belfast, and I asked him to let me have a statement in writing that the material laid down by Messrs. Grainger is mastic asphalt, and also to let me have a copy of the specification. He said he would let me have both, but I have not yet received them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And I have never seen them.</P>
    <P>This report from Rathmines also included this letter.  It is dated City Hall, Belfast, 29th July, 1929.  It is addressed to William H. Lambert, Surveyor, Town Hall, Rathmines, and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Asphalt surfaces.  Further to our conversation I find on reference to the contract what inspection failed to reveal that Queen Street was partly surfaced by mastic and partly by rolled asphalt, as per attached copy of letter.  Therefore I consider it but right to acquaint you of the fact.  From inspection it was evident that the suitability of the surfacing was equal and satisfactory in each case.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;(Signed) R.B. DONALD,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;City Surveyor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Town Surveyor of Rathmines went from Rathmines to Belfast to <Col N="582" /> find out if Messrs. Grainger had laid mastic asphalt to any extent in Belfast, and the only mention we get in his report is this letter in which it was stated, in reference to Messrs. Grainger, that Queen Street was partly surfaced by mastic and partly by rolled asphalt.  But the mastic asphalt that was laid in Queen Street was not laid by Messrs Grainger.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister evidence of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I will produce evidence supplied by Messrs. Grainger.  One thing has to be kept in mind.  We have now come to the end of July and Messrs. Grainger themselves have not said that they have ever laid mastic asphalt.  On the receipt of that letter we asked for documentary evidence that they had laid mastic asphalt and the Rathmines Council sent us in this batch of letters.  On 7th August the secretary wrote to Rathmines District Council:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to state it would appear from the correspondence that the Council proposed to accept the lowest tender in the absence of essential inquiries.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister attaches the highest importance to the necessity of experience in the laying of a roadway of the type needed, and he does not find in the documents which accompanied your letter of the 31st ult. any evidence that the firm whose tender it is proposed to accept have furnished directly or indirectly any statement to show that they have previously satisfactorily laid mastic asphalt to a reasonable extent on a public road.  In the circumstances the Minister cannot approve of the acceptance of the tender.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Rathmines Urban Council wrote on the 15th August:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Your letter of the 7th inst. was duly submitted at a meeting held yesterday, when I was directed to refer you to a letter <Col N="583" /> from the City Surveyor, Belfast, to the Surveyor Rathmines, dated 29th July, 1929, with regard to the laying of mastic asphalt, copy of which was enclosed in my letter of 31st ult.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time, I was instructed to ask you to be good enough to state what course the Minister would advise the Rathmines Urban District Council now to take, in view of the difference in the amount of the tender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked for documentary evidence, and I am referred back again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rathmines Council were then informed that the normal thing they could do would be to accept the next lowest tender. They decided that they would not do that.  They decided they would advertise again, with another specification, a specification which was not submitted to us, and which was of such a kind that two of the contractors tendering&mdash;experienced contractors&mdash;remarked, with reference to the asking for a ten years guarantee in connection with the matter, that they would not give a ten years guarantee that a road built to that specification would stand up. This was regarded as another terrible intrigue on the part of the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 4th October, I got this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 1st inst. and former correspondence on the subject of asphalting Rathgar Road, I have to state that at a special meeting of the Council held this day the following resolution was adopted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the letter from the Department expressing a preference for mastic asphalt in the reconstruction of Rathgar Road, and the letter from Messrs. Grainger Bros., dated 3rd October, 1929, regarding similar work carried out by that firm, the Council hereby postpone the consideration <Col N="584" /> of the tenders received for sheet asphalt, and would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision and approve the original proposal of the Council to accept Messrs. Grainger Bros.' tender, dated June 21st, 1929, at 16/- per square yard and 20/- per square yard for opening.'</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Enclosed herewith I send you copies of letter from Messrs. Grainger Bros., dated October 3rd, 1929.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 3rd October, 1929, Messrs. Grainger Bros. wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As you are aware, we have again submitted a tender for the asphalt surfacing of the Rathgar Road.  If your Council accept our tender we can give you any financial guarantee you may require, and we undertake to lay either hand-floated asphalt or steam-rolled sheet asphalt with the best and most experienced foremen and layers.  We have within the past month laid some mastic on one of the most important roads near Belfast, and would be glad if you would come and inspect it.  We have in our employ a mastic floater with great experience both in England and in Ireland, and have at our hand a plant foreman of the highest technical skill, who has been for years with some of the largest firms of asphalt layers in Great Britain, and (we assure you) we would have no difficulty in providing qualified experts in making and laying mastic asphalt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Graingers' first documentary appearance on the scene was on the 3rd October.  We asked for evidence, by letter on the 4th July, and in conversation on the 3rd July, that mastic asphalt had been previously laid.  It turns up on the 3rd October that a month before they had laid mastic asphalt on an important road in Belfast.  We are not prepared to take the statement or even the fact that mastic asphalt was laid by a firm a month ago in Belfast, as showing that the firm had sufficient experience for us to warrant the carrying out of this work here.  The <Col N="585" /> question will be raised, are we going to refuse to give the contract to a particular firm if that firm has not done that particular work before? The answer is no.  We have to judge a firm on their merits and their reputation, and, on our experience of Messrs. Grainger, we are not prepared to entrust the carrying out of work like that to them here.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have made it plain that evidence had not been produced that this firm had laid mastic asphalt or carried out work of this particular type, highly technical work that requires to be carried out in the most careful possible way, that we have a background of unsatisfactory work on their part, and it is in the light of these facts that we have refused to approve the Rathmines Council giving the contract to them.</P>
    <P>The Rathmines Council, in their discussions and their letters, state that they are going to have this work done by Messrs. Grainger, and they are going to have this done because they have been advised by their expert advisers to have it so done.  I want to suggest this, that some mentality in Rathmines has completely overawed and submerged their technical adviser, and that the technical adviser is not in a position to give plain and straight advice to them.  They have put the telescope completely to their blind eye in this matter, and yet see visions of wonderful and competent firms laying mastic asphalt for miles all round the place.  It is a most unsatisfactory way to have these matters dealt with.  The last resolution in this matter was proposed by Mr. Ireland and seconded by Dr. Lynn:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Rathmines Urban Council, having considered the tenders received for the reconstruction of Rathgar Road in <Col N="586" /> mastic and sheet asphalt, hereby accept the tender of Messrs. Grainger Bros., dated June 21st, 1929, for the laying of mastic asphalt at 16/- per square yard, and 20/- per square yard for openings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That resolution was passed by 13 votes to 3.  For: Benson, Eyre, ffrench-Mullen, Hely, Ireland, Johnson, Kettle, Lynn, Metcalfe, Moloney, Sibthorpe, Culloch, and Whewell.  Against: Gogan, Madigan and Mulvey.</P>
    <P>The proposer is a person who has not been at a single meeting of the Rathmines Urban District Council since perhaps December last.  This is a meeting held on the 23rd October.  It is difficult to deal with every aspect of this particular matter.</P>
