      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass (for Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a large number of cigarettes are being sold from automatic machines which have been installed in public offices, institutions, private offices, lodging houses, hairdressing saloons, hospitals, garages, private residences, etc.: further, to ask whether the premises in which such machines are installed are licensed for the sale of tobacco, and, if not, why they are not so licensed, and whether, if not required to be so licensed under the existing law, he will consider introducing proposals for legislation to compel the licensing either of the machines or of the premises in which they are used for selling purposes.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the facts stated in the first part of the Deputy's question. Tobacco dealers' licence duty has been paid in respect of certain of the automatic machines referred to, and the necessary steps are being taken to secure the payment of licence duty in all such cases.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether interest on an advance, secured by a bill, for the purpose of purchasing cattle to stock a farm is <Col N="1230" /> allowed as an expense by the Surveyor of Taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the allowance of an expense does not normally arise in an assessment under Schedule B, which is based on the valuation of the lands, the subject of assessment.  In the case, however, of a person who makes application to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax under Rule 6 of the Rules applicable to Schedule B, Income Tax Act, 1918, the question of allowance of interest would be considered and dealt with on its merits.</P>
      <P>The question is one to which a general answer cannot be given; but if the Deputy has a particular case in mind and will let me have the particulars, I shall be glad to have the matter inquired into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given on the 4th August, 1927 and 17th November, 1926, to similar questions asked by Deputies Davis and O Conaill respectively, in which I indicated my attitude in this matter.  The information which is needed before effect can be given to the recommendation is not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state when he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Blind Persons Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter, which is highly technical in some aspects, has received further consideration, and <Col N="1231" /> I am reluctantly being driven to the conclusion that it is practically impossible to frame an amending Bill which will relieve the few cases of hardship which the Committee of Inquiry had in mind without opening the door too wide and enormously increasing the cost as well as creating many grievances in other directions.  I cannot, therefore, indicate when it will be possible to introduce a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Minister's answer that he is not going to introduce the Bill which he promised two years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might almost take that.  It has not been proved possible so far to find any formula that would amend the Act without opening the door too widely and increasing the cost beyond what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister admit that under existing legislation there is a great deal of hardship?  Does the Minister not agree that the Committee dealt with the question fairly effectively and that it was proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that great hardships have been inflicted on certain persons owing to the tight way in which the present Act has been drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are hardships in a certain number of cases.  If we could relieve those hardships without doubling or without adding 75 per cent. to the number of the pensioners, we would certainly be glad to do it.  In the meantime, while legislation has not been introduced, the Act has been administered in a spirit which gives the maximum of benefit and which gives the benefit of the doubt in all cases to applicants for blind pensions.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Effect of Lower Railway Valuation (Westmeath).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJKillane" hpid="Mr. Killane Mr. Killane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the amount of the reduction made in the valuation <Col N="1232" /> of the Great Southern Railways Company, Limited, for rating purposes, and how same has been apportioned on the various counties through which their system runs; further, if he is aware that the new valuation affects County Westmeath more than any county in the Saorstát, and whether any steps are being taken by the Government to relieve the ratepayers from this new burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction made on first appeal in the valuation of the Great Southern Railways undertaking amounts to £56,456, and a table showing the apportionment of the reduction made in each county will be printed in the Parliamentary Debates.</P>
      <P>The County Westmeath has not been exceptionally treated</P>
      <P>The facts are that on first appeal in 1928, by agreement arrived at between representatives of the Railway Companies, the Valuation Department of the Saorstát and the Valuation Department of Northern Ireland (in cases of railways operating in both States), a uniform proportionate reduction was made in the valuations of the Great Southern Railways and the Great Northern Railway Company in the Irish Free State as they appeared in the year 1923.</P>
      <P>Before making this reduction all dwelling-houses, hotels, refreshment rooms and workshops were eliminated, as well as all portions of railway entered at the agricultural value.</P>
      <P>The remaining valuations were reduced by a uniform percentage of the 1923 figure.  Consequently the valuations as fixed in the County Westmeath are relative proportionately to the 1923 valuation with those in other counties.</P>
      <P>The apparent discrepancy in the result is due to the fact that at the revision of 1926 the Midland Great Western section received a less abatement in valuation than was given to the other sections of the Great Southern Railways in 1924, and was, therefore, liable to a greater reduction now in order to have the valuations uniform over the whole system.</P>

      <P>The frequency of delivery in rural areas has not depended upon the quantity of correspondence alone.  The time necessary for delivering the correspondence has also been taken into consideration. During the fishing season at Ballyduff the number of items for delivery in the area, to which a six-day delivery has been afforded, has been more than double the number during the non-season.  I may add that the special facility will cease on the 1st proximo in connection with the general restriction of delivery in rural districts to three days a week.</P>

Under the Act Mrs. McCarthy might, if she so desired, secure the return of the goods by paying the cost of the removal, 3/-, but she refused.  In the circumstances the Commissioner had no option but to exercise his powers under Section 11 of the Act and order that the goods be sold. The amount realised was 3/-, which was credited in aid of the Gárda Vote.  It is not possible to make any refund to Mrs. McCarthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the following sub-section in lieu of sub-section (6) now contained therein and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)  No fees shall be receivable in the office in respect of any such patent as is mentioned in this section unless or until all copies and documents relating to such patent shall have been furnished to the Controller pursuant to sub-section (4) of Section 45 (which relates to the register of patents) of this Act, but the failure to lodge such copies and documents shall not relieve from the liability <Col N="1258" /> to pay any fees or from the consequences of the non-payment thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of a group of four which were brought in recently, and the four have to be read together.  This, it will be noted, refers to the new sub-section which it is proposed to insert, and to certain things which have to be furnished to the Controller&mdash;&ldquo;until all copies and documents relating to such patent shall have been furnished to the Controller pursuant to sub-section (4) of Section 45.&rdquo;  That refers to the next amendment of the four of which notice has been given.  The new Section 4 insists that instead of the simple amendment which was being made in the Principal Act there is now going to be a completely new sub-section.  That completely new sub-section has been so drafted as to set out in the paragraph itself all the documents that may at any time be requested.  If I might go back again to the first amendment, it states: &ldquo;That no fees shall be receivable in respect of any such patent as is mentioned in this section unless and until all copies and documents relating to such patent shall have been furnished to the Controller pursuant to sub-section (4) of Section 45.&rdquo;  It goes on to state that failure to lodge such copies and documents shall not relieve from the liability to pay any fee or from the consequences of the non-payment thereof.  That amendment has in the practice of the office been discovered to be essential.  Now I must refer to the second amendment. The Controller has found it necessary to call for more documents than what he actually could have called for.  Under the Act as previously drafted, under that particular rule of the Industrial and Commercial (Protection) Act, more documents were even called for than what were absolutely obligatory under the old section.  These documents have been in fact lodged, and no complaint has been made to date, because it has been realised by those who are looking for the benefit of different patents here that the particular documents called for were <Col N="1259" /> quite reasonable.  This amendment which is before the Dáil simply states that fees for these documents when they are lodged cannot be received by the office until such time as all the copies and documents relating to such patents shall have been furnished.</P>
    <P>Previously when I was speaking on Section 4, which it is proposed to amend by the second amendment.  I pointed out that the practice of the office had made it essential, for the carrying on of the office business, to get copies of all documents pertaining to patents lodged here, even though the patents became operative in the Free State without any registration. In that way the patent became operative, but the Controller had power to call for documents only on the occasion of the payment of renewal fees.  Renewal fees fall due in the fourth year.  It was discovered under that particular section that in connection with what is described as &ldquo;a patent of addition,&rdquo; for which there are no renewal fees payable, there was a gap in the Act, and that patents of addition need not be registered here, that the Controller had no power to enforce registration here.  That was the effect of the old clause 4, the clause which is now going to be amended by the second amendment.  This amendment simply refers to that, and satisfies this point with regard to the payment of fees.  &ldquo;No fees shall be received in respect of any such patent unless or until all copies and documents relating to such patent shall have been furnished.&rdquo;&ldquo;All copies and documents&rdquo; will now bring in copies and documents relating to patents of addition.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to. New section ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on the Second Reading of the Bill, undertook to give the Dáil an explanation of the term &ldquo;any fee,&rdquo; as substituted for the words &ldquo;the first fee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1260" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, again, is a difficult point.  The first part of clause 3, in so far as it amends the Principal Act, merely effects a substitution of a period of time&mdash;a twenty months' period instead of a six months' period.  Sub-section (2) will then read as it is, except that we insert twenty months for the six months, so that it would run, &ldquo;for any period not exceeding twenty months from the commencement of this part of this Act, the prescribed time for the payment of the first fee which becomes payable under this Act in respect of such British patent.&rdquo;  We are now moving, in addition to that, to change &ldquo;first fee&rdquo; into &ldquo;any fee&rdquo; and to put at the end of the Section &ldquo;during such twenty months,&rdquo; so that it would read, &ldquo;extend for any period not exceeding twenty months from the commencement of this part of the Act the prescribed time for the payment of any fee which becomes payable during such twenty months.&rdquo; That is to meet this case which might occur.  Let us assume that the British patent year expired on the 15th October, 1927.  The renewal fee would become payable between the 1st and the 15th October, 1927.  The time for the payment of that fee might be extended for six months. Another renewal fee for the succeeding year, which would start on the 16th October, would become due before the expiry of the year preceding that in which the renewal fee is payable. Say it would fall due on 15th October.  That period cannot be extended as the Act stands.  Even if we substitute twenty months for six months, it only gives power for an extension&mdash;if the words &ldquo;first fee&rdquo; are replaced by &ldquo;any fee&rdquo;&mdash;of the period for the first fee payable. We want to get over that difficulty. There are cases actually known in the office in which this particular clause is necessary, because you will have the peculiar situation in which the Controller can only extend the period of payment of the fees by six months for the first fee payable, and the second fee, which would fall due for payment in the same fortnight, cannot be extended.  The office would <Col N="1261" /> find itself in the peculiar position of insisting on the payment of the second fee and being able to extend the period of payment for the first. Consequently, we are moving to eliminate the words &ldquo;first fee&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;any fee,&rdquo; and the addition of &ldquo;during such period of twenty months&rdquo; puts a definite limitation on it.  The Controller can only extend the time up to 1st June, 1929, and the fees for which extension can be made, whether first, second or succeeding ones, fall due within the twenty months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On page 3, lines 1 and 2, to delete the words &ldquo;certified copies of all entries in the British register of or&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;all copies and documents.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This again is, instead of demanding certified copies of entries in the British register, in relation to such patent, we insist upon getting copies of all documents relative to such patent, the point being that there are times in which the Controller finds it necessary to call not merely for certified copies, but for a certified copy of the British specification <Col N="1263" /> with drawings.  In fact the Controller has called for, under the rules and regulations, an additional officially presented copy of the specifications drawings.  Although these have only been called for in exceptional cases by the Controller, the Controller thinks it necessary that he should have the power not merely to call for certified copies of the entries, but, as is now proposed by the further amendment, that he should be given power to call for all copies and documents.  The House is asked to give the responsibility to the Controller of deciding what documents he wants in order to have the formalities complied with.  He is not confined to certified copies, as would be asked for here.  Under the Principal Act he was left in a worse position in regard to documents called for.  Indeed, if applicants had stood on their rights under the terms of the Act, a certain number of applications would, in fact, have had to be refused, or would have been left in a suspended state, because the Controller could not have been satisfied that he had got all the evidence which he thought necessary. As I say, the applicants, because they were looking for benefits did, in fact, accede to the Controller's request. We are now seeking retrospectively to give power to call for the particular type of documents which the office has thought necessary.</P>

      <P>Assuming that a provisional specification had been put in at the beginning, in which a man covered a good deal of ground, and which afterwards, on examination, he decided to abandon, in that particular case there is an amended specification.  Would this cover the fact that the Controller could then require the original provisional specification, even though it might never have been fully pursued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, because the phrase has to be interpreted. Under the amendment he has power, instead of calling for certified copies of all entries, to call <Col N="1264" /> for certified copies of all documents relating to such patent.  I do not think, in that case, that the document which the Deputy referred to would be considered a document relating to the patent.  I do not think that the full specification which, in fact, was not intended to be covered afterwards, could be considered a document relating to the patent.  It is a new patent&mdash;it is a different patent that has been applied for, and that, I think, would rule out the Controller in any case calling for the full specification which has never been followed up.  In any event, that would be for a court afterwards to decide.  I think it is clear that the document to which the Deputy refers could not be called for in that case.</P>

      <P>Sometimes it happens in connection with a patent that you put down certain things and afterwards abandon them, and they are not then disclosed.  They can be afterwards taken as a separate patent.  It sometimes is an embarrassment to a patentee that he should have to make complete disclosure of something that he might decide it was not the appropriate time to pursue.  We think that the Minister should have all the relevant documents, but we are not anxious that that should be too widely extended.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 4, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Any inventor or patentee may (either for or without valuable consideration) make to a Minister on behalf of the State <Col N="1265" /> and such Minister may take on such behalf an assignment of the whole of or any share or interest in the benefit of an invention and of any patent obtained or to be obtained for such invention and where a Minister has taken any such assignment such Minister may (as the case may be) do or join in doing on behalf of the State all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  develop and perfect such invention;</P>
    <P>(b)  take an assignment of any patent or of a share or interest in any patent theretofore or thereafter obtained for such invention;</P>
    <P>(c)  sell or lease either for or without valuable consideration any such patent;</P>
    <P>(d)  grant either with or without valuable consideration licences under any such patent;</P>
    <P>(e)  work any such patent commercially;</P>
    <P>(f)  form or promote an incorporated company or an unincorporated association of persons to develop and perfect such invention or to work commercially any such patent;</P>
    <P>(g)  do all such things as may be necessary for the maintenance or preservation of any such patent or be otherwise incidental to the ownership thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  All expenses incurred by a Minister under this section shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means a Minister head of a Department of State established under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    <P>(4)  Section 46 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>(5)  This section shall have and be deemed to have had effect as <Col N="1266" /> from the commencement of Part II of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be remembered that there was considerable discussion with respect to this section when the Bill was being debated on Second Reading.  This section proposes to give the Minister power to take an assignment of the whole or any share or interest in the benefit of an invention, or any patent obtained in respect to an invention; and it further gives him power to expend State money in the development and the perfection of such invention or the commercial working of it.  It gives him power to sell or lease either for or without valuable consideration any such patent or grant a licence for any such patent.  The very wide nature of the powers which it is proposed to give the Minister were adversely criticised by a number of Deputies, and the Minister more or less invited the House to submit amendments for its consideration when the Bill came forward on Committee Stage.  It appears the Minister is anxious to have a try-out, in the discussion on this section, which will help him to draft the Bill that he is said to be preparing to deal with mines and minerals affected by Article XI of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two courses of procedure possible of which we have had experience.  There is the procedure laid down in the State Lands Act of 1924, and the procedure suggested here.  One imposes fairly considerable restrictions upon the Minister, and the other gives him very wide powers.  The Minister is, apparently, anxious to get some medium course which, without being as wide as this section indicates, would at the same time not bind his hands so tightly as the State Lands Act of 1924.  Apparently he hopes he will get some suggestion that will help him in that matter from Deputies here.  We have been considering this question since the Bill passed its Second Reading, and it seems to us practically impossible for anyone except <Col N="1267" /> a highly skilled draftsman to frame an amendment such as the Minister requires.  At any rate, it appears that in respect to this section there can be no very serious objection to putting in an amendment restricting the Minister to practically the same extent that he is restricted under the State Lands Act of 1924.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants money to perfect and develop an invention, he has to get the sanction of the Oireachtas finally for the expenditure, and the Oireachtas will, therefore, have an opportunity of considering the wisdom or otherwise of the action he is taking.  If he secures or purchases a patent and it is proposed to sell or lease it or to grant a licence for it without valuable consideration, there is nothing to provide that the Dáil shall be taken into consultation &mdash;there is nothing to provide, for example, that the Dáil will exercise any control over the Minister with a view to seeing that he has done the best thing by the State.  If the Minister takes an assignment of a patent, it becomes State property, and under this section he is empowered to give away that State property for nothing if he thinks fit, without having to come before the Dáil and to justify his action.</P>
    <P>Now, we think, although the Minister should have power to do that, he should only exercise that power subject to the approval of the Dáil.  The State Lands Act provides that where property has been leased by the State, or the State proposes to lease property, a statement in regard to it must be laid upon the Table of the House&mdash;a statement has been laid upon the Table to-day&mdash;setting out the person to whom the lease is proposed to be granted, the property included in the lease, and the rent or other payments proposed to be charged for such land or licence, and a statement also as to the conditions and the agreements proposed to be inserted in the lease.  That lease or licence does not become operative until each House of the Oireachtas shall by resolution authorise it, with <Col N="1268" /> or without amendment, or on the expiration of 21 days after the statement is laid upon the Table of both Houses, that is to say, 21 ordinary days or 12 sitting days.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in respect of the powers the Minister will exercise under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a procedure similar to the procedure laid down in the State Lands Act could be adopted, but could not of course be adopted in respect of the powers of the Minister in paragraph (f), which would require a different form for the supplying of the information.  We do think that a strong case could be made out to put the Minister under an obligation to inform the Dáil and to secure the approval of the Dáil, if he proposes either to give away State property or to grant a licence to use State property, or if he is going to engage in a commercial enterprise for the working of a patent the benefit of which is assigned to him.  As I said, we find it practically impossible to draft an amendment that would embody our ideas. It is a very technical piece of legislation, and only a highly skilled draftsman could undertake that task.  Apparently the Minister himself is inclined to shirk it.  At any rate, he finds it so difficult that he is trying to put the onus on somebody else to make suggestions.  But it seems to me it is not unreasonable to ask that the procedure laid down in the State Lands Act should be followed in this case, that the information I have indicated should be given, and that there should be a period at the end of which the lease or licence will come automatically into operation, unless the Dáil has, by resolution, declared otherwise.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider that matter, and, if he thinks a strong case exists for such an amendment, to get the Government draftsman to prepare it for the purpose of having it submitted to the House on the Report Stage.  We are of opinion that the Bill would be improved by such amendment, but that we ourselves cannot produce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in the same position as Deputy Lemass in this matter.  The Minister has taken over the job of developing and perfecting an invention.  There he is, undoubtedly, dealing with a highly speculative occupation.  The experience of those who have had anything to do with it&mdash;and I unfortunately have had&mdash;is that it is practically impossible to say beforehand what is going to be the cost of developing an invention.  You may run yourself into what seems to be a very good field, which may be followed for a considerable distance, but which may wind up in a dead end.  The Minister has power to work any such patent commercially.  Roughly speaking, the average number of patents that do work out commercially successful is extremely small.  My feeling is that some machinery should be got by which the Minister would have some means of consultation commercially in relation to this matter.  In relation to the particular invention which the Minister has in view the question is not a very big one, because he told us it is £5,000, and he envisages other expenditure of possibly £1,500.  If that was the only case at issue my feeling would be to be extremely liberal in the power; but here you are setting down a system for the future, and, without any disrespect whatever to the Minister or his staff, the experience which they would have in evaluating an invention or deciding what was the best commercial way of operating it would not be very great.  While my difficulty is that any amendments I felt like putting in always broke down on the ground that they were too rigid, Section 2 of this Bill says that all expenditure incurred by the Minister under this section shall to such an extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are, I take it, the moneys which the Minister for Finance would come for previously, but the difficulty with relation to an invention is that once you have started <Col N="1270" /> on a certain stage it may take charge of you to the extent that if you have spent £20,000 the only chance of making it good would be to spend a great deal more, and without restraining the Minister, and certainly without restraining him in this particular case, because I think the particular case he has has possibilities, the procedure here does seem to be altogether too open.  No commercial man, as far as I know, would allow in the possession of his own subordinates or managers a power as broad as this in relation to so highly speculative a property, and certainly I think some restraint should be put upon the Minister, but if possible that restraint should be of such a character that you allow him some considerable latitude.  I take it that the Minister's policy&mdash;I think he said it the other day&mdash;is that he did not envisage the Ministry going into this thing very frequently or to a very large extent.  For that reason possibly we do not need to be as rigid in the matter as we otherwise would, because I take it that the procedure of the Government doing what the Government proposes to do in this matter will be tried out on this particular invention, and from the experience which the Minister would get from this particular case both he and the House might be in a very much better position to form legislation for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>As was pointed out on the Second Reading, this is a section giving exceedingly wide powers, and as the Deputies on the other side have pointed out, there was a desire expressed, in some way, to limit these powers, as it was thought unwise to confer such exceptional powers on a Minister without reference to the Dáil.  Like the previous Deputies, I have given some considerable consideration to the matter in the interval, and one finds oneself in a very considerable difficulty. Thus Section 5 gives the Minister power to take two steps.  One involves expenditure, large or small. The Minister for Finance has told us to-day that before any expenditure <Col N="1271" /> is authorised by him it should be brought before the Dáil and the sanction of the Dáil secured.  That gives us, to a certain extent, an opportunity of discussing any proposal which involves expenditure, but then, as has been already pointed out under sub-section (c), we have &ldquo;To sell or lease for or without valuable consideration any such patent.&rdquo; That is a matter that is quite different from one involving expenditure. The Minister might say: &ldquo;No expenditure was involved.  Consequently it was not incumbent on me to bring the matter before the Dail.&rdquo;  But important considerations may be involved without involving expenditure, on which the Dáil might like to express an opinion.  There is no obligation in that case for the Minister for Finance or the Minister in charge of this Bill to bring the matter before the Dáil and to have the Dáil's view on it, and these are things in which, as anyone who has had anything to do with patents knows, that at certain stages, that is, the early stages, finance may not be involved.  In the subsequent stages finance may be involved, so if we allow the Minister to take certain action without the approval of the Dáil we may find ourselves ultimately involved in an expenditure which it is possible the Dáil might not approve of.</P>
      <P>Therefore for that reason I would like a clause inserted in this which would, in some way, place an obligation on the Minister to consult the Dáil from both points of view.  I see some difficulty in drawing a clause to meet the particular matter we have in mind, and I would like if the Minister would see his way to approve generally of the principle and refer the drawing of a clause to those who are able to assist in the matter of these appointments&mdash;that is, to the drawers of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the difficulty really in this clause that we are authorising the Minister to engage in rather speculative commercialism? Our difficulty is to draft a restriction which will not make it impossible <Col N="1272" /> for that speculative commercialism to be successful.  When you are engaged in commercialism in ordinary cases you want a considerable amount of liberality and freedom of action.  Our difficulty is to find a point where you would restrain the Minister.  To take the particular case, I frankly think we may draft a clause in relation to this which would be more or less good, but it will take a certain amount of experience by the Minister himself in working this particular episode out to find the real difficulties in relation to that clause.  For instance, the Minister would, in relation to the particular case which he has in mind at the moment, as far as possible take the Dáil into his confidence as he goes along.  A restrictive clause need not possibly be as severe now as otherwise it would have to be.  My feeling is to regard this present thing as merely an experiment, and from the experience of it possibly to amend legislation later.  I, personally, cannot draft a clause which is watertight and which does not put upon the Minister restraints which, as a commercial man engaged in the same activities, I would not find extremely hampering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good said that the Minister for Finance said to-day that the House would be consulted prior to any expenditure being incurred under sub-section (2) of Section 5.  By the way, any words the Minister for Finance spoke have to be taken as not having reference to the particular thing which I referred to on the last day because that has gone a certain length and I hope the House will not ask that the Minister's words be taken as imposing on me the obligation of coming here and giving a full statement to this House within a short period of what has been done on this particular thing to date.  I take the Minister for Finance's promise on sub-section (2) as applying to the future.  Deputy Good says &ldquo;Where it is a matter of incurring expense the Minister promised to consult the House.&rdquo;  It is not merely a question of promise.  He must consult <Col N="1273" /> the House, except again that the Contingency Fund is going to be availed of as I availed of it in this particular case.  I must say that I would not like to rule out the possibility in another exceptional case of a resort to the Contingency Fund. The Minister for Finance was speaking of the general rule and the general rule will be that the Minister will come here.  What he is going to say puzzles me, if it is going to give enlightenment to the House and not to rivals.  He will say &ldquo;I have an invention which is a valuable one.&rdquo;  He will name a sum of money.  There will have to be even delusion about the sum of money required.  Next one might make a case as to the matter of the invention or the sum of money required and the Minister might come in and ask for four or five times more or might only ask enough to enable him to carry out a preliminary investigation or even the first stages of development.  What is the Minister for Finance or any other Minister going to say when coming to the House in regard to an invention? He is simply going to say that it is an invention, that it is a good thing and that he wants money.  What is the House going to say to him?  The House is going to say: What is it? Is it a good one?  Who has told you?  What is it all about?  What are you doing with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more detail that will be given in reply to these questions the more danger there is that the whole thing will become public.  Deputy Good fears that although expense may have to be authorised here if it comes to item (c) and (d) of Section 5, that as there is no expense to the State consequently the House would not be informed.  But the House would have been informed previously under sub-clause (2) of any invention unless it happened to be one which the State had got without valuable consideration.  In that case I do not know if Deputy Good would be so outraged at the State giving away for nothing what the State has acquired for nothing, but if the procedure of which the Minister for Finance has spoken is going to be <Col N="1274" /> followed it will be before the House. There is always a Parliamentary Question to discover what has happened since.  As to the actual powers given, I take it from what has been said that there is no objection to a Minister having received a patent doing what he is allowed to do under sub-sections (a), (b) and (g).  (g), I suppose, being an omnibus sort of clause, will meet with whatever objection there is to any of the details. There is objection to (c) and (d), particularly to the words &ldquo;without valuable consideration.&rdquo;  There is objection to the Minister working a patent commercially, working a patent being considered highly speculative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I call attention to (a)?  (a) might involve very heavy speculative expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The only paragraphs to which objection was taken were paragraphs (c) and (d) and (e) and (f) in a general way.  (a) could involve a good amount in the way of expenditure.  (c) and (d) contain these peculiar words, &ldquo;may lease or sell or grant a licence without valuable consideration.&rdquo;  Strike out those words and say &ldquo;with valuable consideration.&rdquo;  Remember the word &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; will have a very limited significance.  In that phrase five shillings may mean &ldquo;valuable consideration,&rdquo; and the difference to the State between the Minister selling for 5/- or for nothing does not mean anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could hardly see the thing being sold without some nominal consideration being demanded. I think if the Minister is going to be given power to develop and perfect an invention you have gone a long way.  Actually stopping him then from selling it or leasing it, or granting a licence is not going to be very much of a restriction upon him.  Whatever restriction he has may easily turn out to be a very <Col N="1275" /> unsound thing.  For instance, one may grant a licence to get a thing worked in order to see whether it was going to be a commercial success, and to entice somebody to take up some invention where there might be some industrial benefit gained from the application of it.  We might have to inveigle someone into using it by saying: &ldquo;You are skilled in this particular thing.  Look after the accidentals of this particular invention. Get this used in some way and let us see if it is useful as well as having some idea in it.&rdquo;  It may be necessary to grant a licence without valuable consideration.  In the selling of a lease without valuable consideration one may look for restrictions. I am merely taking the words &ldquo;without valuable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the powers that are asked generally, I want to preface my remarks by saying that the whole thing is very exceptional.  It looks forward to a procedure that will occur very rarely.  With that as a preamble, supposing the Minister is, in exceptional cases, given the power to intervene on behalf of the State and take over the benefit of some invention, it is not much good his being given the power of taking it over unless he is allowed to perfect it and develop it.  And the perfecting of it may drag in sub-section (f), the forming of a company to do it.  The Civil Service, as ordinarily constituted, could not do it.  The company is not going to be formed of the heads of a department of the Civil Service.  It will be necessary to get the thing properly developed, to see whether there is a useful application of whatever the idea is. Giving power in that way I think drags in sub-section (f) and I personally do not see any objection to (f).  (b) is necessary also.  It is simply allowing the Minister to take an assignment of any patent or of a share or interest in any patent, theretofore or thereafter obtained for such invention.  To use it commercially there may have to be certain experimental workings which <Col N="1276" /> might be done under (a)&mdash;developing and perfecting it&mdash;but it might just cross the borderline, where it would have to be adjusted to ordinary conditions. Suppose someone brings an invention for perpetual motion.  In its application to transport one would have to see that it worked under ordinary conditions on the roads or rails to see whether there was a useful application of it.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not see that there can be much objection to sub-section (e), remembering all the while that if the whole of the Contingency Fund was going to be raided for the purposes referred to in sub-section (e) it is only a sum of £20,000 in all and there are nearly always claims on that Fund in any year to the extent of about £10,000 for ordinary purposes. So that there is a limitation to the extent of £10,000.  Whatever additional sum the Minister for Finance may require he will get it by coming to the House and get it under a special heading or a special vote.  So that the Minister is limited practically to a sum of £10,000, save what sums he may get by an extra vote or a special sub-heading.  (c) and (d) would seem to me to be the phrases about which there may be some question of amendment.  I am helpless myself to suggest an amendment. I do not know what the ideas are that people want to bring in, and I would like to ask the House to deal with it somewhat on the lines on which Deputy Flinn spoke.  It is no secret as it has been talked of here, and it is going to be pursued, I am sure, here.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am going to be asked about it from time to time until it proves either a success or failure. There ought to be an end to it one way or another quite soon.  After that this matter will fall to be investigated and questions will be asked about what I have done in the way of so-called irregular procedure. The matter will be investigated by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  In any report that the Committee may draw up about this matter it will be, of course, for them to suggest the limitations <Col N="1277" /> that in their opinion ought to be put upon a Minister in the matter of expenditure in particular circumstances.  Of course certain explanations will have to be made to the Committee and then it will be possible for them to suggest what restrictions should be put upon a Minister.  I cannot make any definite suggestion at the moment.  I would hesitate to go back to the State Lands Act and, as in the case of a lease, for example, lay all the terms and conditions before the House.  As another matter has been referred to, the question of legislation that may be brought on later, I would like to make one point.  Let one imagine the property which would be affected by Article 11 of the Constitution.  Let us say that some mineral development is on foot&mdash;the discovery of something in the nature of important mineral deposits in a certain area and under Government ownership.  Is it really considered a desirable thing that one person should come forward with an offer, that there should be a certain amount of haggling with the Department, that the Department have, say, a good offer, the best that could be got in the circumstances, that the whole thing should then come before the House and that the House, on a discussion, could refuse to pass it?</P>
    <P>The position might easily be that a certain man, knowing a good thing was coming, would not make an offer, but would allow some other person to go ahead.  The matter would come before the House and there would be a process of lobbying on the part of this man who is biding his time.  He could hint broadly that he was offering something better to the State than what was about to come under the consideration of the House.  Then the man who originally developed the idea of making the discovery good, and who would have reached a certain point, whose plans would be prepared and who probably would have a tentative lease ready for the consideration of the House, would be turned down because the man waiting in the background was ready to <Col N="1278" /> go one better.  I do not think that we will get much development that way, or that there will be much in the way of a scurry over the development of good business propositions if the full details have to be placed on the Tables of both Houses for thirty sitting days and are to be subject to various motions and criticisms and a whole course of cross-examination of the Minister in both Houses as to what was expected to come from the schemes about to be developed.  Obviously there would be an attempt to get at the applicant's plans and ideas.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the procedure under the State Lands Act would work at all.  State property, which is controlled by Article 11 of the Constitution, is administered in accordance with legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  It was really because I was feeling my way towards suitable legislation that I was anxious this particular measure would be drafted in the widest possible way.  If Deputies give me suggestions I will certainly endeavour to get the draftsman to deal with those suggestions and see if they could not be embodied.  That would be preferable to falling back upon the State Lands Act simply because people might feel themselves incapable of approaching this very difficult and technical matter from the point of view of drafting suitable proposals.  We should try to get away from the State Lands Act.  That Act is all right where it is a question of houses or fixed buildings&mdash;something that is to be sold and where the economic value is readily ascertained.  The outlook is quite different where it is a matter of property that is going to be developed.  I do not think the State Lands Act will aid us very much there.</P>
    <P>When we get back to Section 5, I may say there is the danger of its being applied in exceptional cases.  It does not bind anybody except myself, but it may be used by me to do all sorts of things.  What is the best the House could ask for?  There could be a secret session, if the House felt that every Deputy could <Col N="1279" /> be relied on not to disclose one single item of what had passed at that secret session.  At the secret meeting the House might ask for the details of an invention, and then, after these details would be put before them, you would get over one hundred people fighting, not alone about the details, but as to whether or not it would be a good bargain and whether a little more could not be got.  One Deputy might propose that a little more should be sought than what another Deputy would be agreeable to accept.  On the other hand, the Minister might give away, without receiving valuable consideration, an invention which he had previously purchased out of moneys passed by the Dáil.  You may say that he can prevent the unauthorised use of powers, but there is the possibility that the Minister might come gaily along and say: &ldquo;I have done this thing, and I am going to walk the plank for it; but I have done it, and you people will have to put up with it.&rdquo;  There must be some sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>A Minister takes his political life in his hands when he engages in any transaction such as this, and if he is not successful he almost inevitably damns himself.  If he hands over anything that is valuable and that has been bought with State moneys, and does not get good value in return, he almost inevitably damns himself.  I admit it is a meagre sort of explanation to offer to the House for the granting of these large powers.  I may say I would not like to see Section 5 lasting for all time. There is only one invention under consideration at the moment, and a certain amount of money has been passed towards it.  I do not say that there will be any more money asked for the development of this invention.  If it is a question of working it, then possibly there would be some other application made to the House.</P>
    <P>If this invention is to be a tremendously successful one it might be possible to go on with the working of it without coming to the House.  Again, there arises the question <Col N="1280" /> of money.  Can the Minister spend out of the Contingency Fund? I think the matter might very well be left where it is.  I could consider any suggestions put forward between this and the Report Stage in the sense that I would get the draftsman carefully to consider them.  I think it would be really wise to leave Section 5 as it stands.  The Committee of Public Accounts could have its attention specially directed to the matter, and the House could afterwards direct its own attention to the matter when it had so far advanced that there might be more information given about it.  Then there could be an amendment and a tightening-up so that the Minister could not operate to the detriment of the State, as, undoubtedly, at the moment, he would have power to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister need be afraid that the House will be too inquisitive.  I think what he has in mind is, if one is to judge by his remarks, that the members of the House are going to inquire into all details before they approve of expenditure.  Now, let us take the case that was before the House last week.  The Minister asked for approval of a sum of £5,000 for the development of a particular patent.  I do not think that the Minister can claim that the House was unreasonable in the details that it asked for in connection with that £5,000.  I do not think that the Minister can claim that the members of the House were on that occasion in any way unreasonable.  I think that that is a precedent that ought to assure the Minister that the House in the future would possibly be guided very much by the action taken in the past.  I feel, with Deputies on the other side, that there is a responsibility cast on the House of approving of expenditure before that expenditure is embarked upon.  In every department of State this House is going to approve of expenditure before that expenditure is embarked upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the Minister coming along and saying in this Bill: &ldquo;Here I am going to ask you to <Col N="1281" /> give me unlimited powers.&rdquo;  He has circumscribed that by saying that it is confined to the amount available in the Contingency Fund at the time.  That will rarely exceed £10,000.  When one gets into the matter of patents, progress may be slow and expenditure slow.  In the total, however, it may amount to a very large sum, and, as Deputy Flinn has said to-day, the number of successful patents is exceedingly few. If I might add to that, it would be, that the amount of money sunk in patents that have been reproductive has been exceedingly small in proportion to the gross amount of money spent on patents.  More money has been lost in patents in this country and in most other countries than in almost any other enterprise in that way.  That being so, I would most certainly say that some limitation should be placed on the Minister.  Now, the Minister has suggested that the matter might be allowed to stand as it is in the Bill, and then let the Comptroller and Auditor-General make suggestions as to how limitations might be provided. I do not know that that is quite a fair duty to cast on the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I am sure if we cast that duty on the Comptroller and Auditor-General that he and the Committee that supervise public expenditure will do all in their power to make suggestions.  But I do not know that they are at all the best people to make suggestions in connection with a matter of this kind.  I would press on the Minister, in view of what has been expressed from different sides of the House and in view of the fact that we are legislating for a great many years, to reconsider this matter.  The Minister says that it is not advisable that legislation of this character should exist in this particular form for a number of years.  I do not know what he has in mind with regard to the number of years for which legislation should exist, but if there are limitations to be placed on these, I think now is the time to place them and not have the probability of cases occurring and then having to deal with the matter subsequently.  I <Col N="1282" /> would much prefer to deal with the matter in the first instance and if the Minister agrees to the limited nature of the limitations proposed by this House, I do not think that he will have any reason to complain of the action of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as concerned as Deputy Good with the power of the Minister to spend money under this section.  As the Minister himself has pointed out, his power to indulge in expenditure without the prior sanction of the Dáil is exceedingly limited.  If he wants to exceed the limits of the Contingency Fund, he has to come to the Dáil, and the Dáil can, in its wisdom, give or refuse to give the power to him.  The fault I find in the section is not with the amount of money which might be expended on a patent and on its development, but with the ultimate fate of the patent after it has been developed. I might discover the secret of perpetual motion and come along to the Minister and make an assignment of that patent to him.  The Minister could develop and perfect it.  He might, in that case, go to the Contingency Fund for the money for that purpose, or he might come to the Dáil and ask them for that £5,000&mdash; he might say that he wanted £5,000. He gets the £5,000 to develop that patent.  Later on, he comes back to the Dáil and gets a further sum in order to work that patent effectively. There is nothing in this section to prevent him, after he has received from the Dáil a fairly substantial amount of money for the purchase and perfection of the invention and for the working of it, to give the entire property thus created away to some private firm or individual, for valuable consideration, or without valuable consideration. It does not matter whether he gets valuable consideration or not; that is not the point.  The point is that the Dáil should know before the property that was created with its money is finally disposed of, and it should have an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the disposal of that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> The Minister brought forward objections to the procedure laid down in the State Lands Act, which are worthy of consideration.  The objections he made to that procedure in respect of this Bill are equally forcible with respect to the Bill itself. We had a discussion here a couple of weeks ago concerning a matter of that kind.  If that procedure cannot be followed in this case, cannot we get some other procedure which would ensure that by the formality of laying the documents on the Table of the House, the Dáil would become informed that the Minister proposed to dispose of property designed or created by him with the money given to him by the House? The House should have an opportunity, by resolution, of stopping that transaction if the House or the two Houses think that the Minister is acting unwisely.  I do not think it is too much to ask the Minister to agree to amend the section in that respect.  We have no objection to his developing any patent assigned to him, and we have no objection to his going to the Contingency Fund in special circumstances, and using it for that purpose, though we think it is better that he should come to the Dáil in the first instance.  We have no objection to his exercising any of the powers that this section gives, but we do think that if the Minister proposes to exercise these powers for the purpose of taking out of the hands of the State the property that that State has created by the moneys given to the Minister, then we think the House should be consulted and asked to approve of the transaction.  The procedure should be somewhat similar to that laid down in the Weights and Measures Bill which we discussed here a few sessions ago.  Certain details should be laid upon the Table of the House and the matter would become automatically operative at the end of twelve sittings of the House or twenty-one ordinary days, unless, in the meantime, both Houses by resolution instruct the Minister not to proceed with the transaction.  There are very few Deputies in the Dáil <Col N="1284" /> who normally take any interest in the papers that are laid upon the Table of the House.  Only those who have been examining the matter and know the specific objections to the transactions would go to the trouble of putting down a resolution on the matter.  In nine out of ten cases, the proposals would go through without discussion or reference in the Dáil at all, but in the tenth case it would be desirable that the Dáil should have power to say to the Minister, &ldquo;No; you must not proceed with this transaction; you are giving away State property which should not be given away at that price&rdquo;; or say to him, &ldquo;Property is being given away by you that should be retained by the State and not sold for any consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many reasons which might induce the Dáil to pass such a resolution in this case.  But in the ordinary case there should be no interference, just as there is no interference in 99 cases out of 100 when property is leased or granted under the State Lands Act of 1924. The difficulty of drafting such an amendment has prevented us from tabling it.  If the Minister would take that suggestion and mention it to the official draftsman and see if the official draftsman can embody it in Parliamentary terms and have it put down on the Report Stage, we would be satisfied.  Then we would be enabled to discuss it, and help to do something useful even if the Minister himself decides to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring this a point further.  As regards the point raised by Deputy Good, the House was not unreasonable the other day in its demand on me.  I was received in a way which I did not think was possible.  I did not contemplate getting a sum of £5,000 with so little fuss and questioning. Deputy Good then said that the House has a right and a duty to approve of expenditure before it is embarked on.  It has, but it also realises that there may be certain expenditure which has to be embarked upon owing to some emergency and there is a recognised practice <Col N="1285" /> that whatever moneys are taken out of the Contingency Fund are voted later to be repaid to that Fund The House has a settled form of finance by which it recognises that there are occasions on which money has to be spent for matters for which there is not a special sub-head.  That may happen, for instance, during the Recess when the Dáil is not sitting and when it is not possible to consult it.  That remark would also apply to Deputy Lemass in regard to the State Lands Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the procedure in the case of the State Lands Act.  A provisional lease is granted, and the person to whom the lease is granted can enjoy the privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point that was brought up in discussion here recently.  The people who applied for the lease were warned that if they did anything under that provisional lease they did it at their own risk.  In that case it was pointed out that if they were to exercise rights which were afterwards to be given to them some people had to be evicted.  A provisional lease gives no rights.  The procedure under the State Lands Act will have to be further examined to get clear what is involved. Even though a lease is passed by this House there is no contract made. There is the peculiarity that under the State Lands Act the House cannot change a lease and can only apparently refuse to pass it.  Deputy Lemass has now confined this to the two little clauses to which he objects. I am taking it that he has no objection to (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g), and that (c) and (d) are the two points to which he objects, the disposal of State property by way either of licence, lease or sale.  If I take the one thing that happened as being typical, I would require power to do or join in doing on behalf of the State certain things, namely, to develop and perfect an invention and to do anything necessary for that purpose, and, secondly, to take an assignment of any patent or of a share or interest in any patent obtained for such invention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> I may also do what is contained in (f), namely, form or promote an incorporated company or a non-incorporated association of persons to develop and perfect such invention or to work commercially any such patent.  Sub-section (e) goes a step beyond that, and it says that the Minister should get power to work any such patent commercially and that that can be done in either of two ways, by either sale or lease or the granting of a licence.  Deputy Lemass referred to a perpetual motion invention.  That has an application to road transport.  In that case the invention would have to be taken out and fully protected.  The invention, if full protection is required, has publication, so that there would be knowledge about the whole thing.  There are patents of such a type that it would pay big companies to go to any expense by way of legal action to break them and take away the monopoly grant or to use the invention themselves.  It may be worth their while to come in and buy them in order to suppress such patents. Suppose this had an application to road transport it would pay petrol companies to go to enormous expense in order to have the patent broken or to purchase the idea in order to suppress it.  It might well be that the State might find it necessary to get on their side one of the big petrol or motor combines in order to have a corporation supporting it that had the usefulness of the article demonstrated to it.  It would then have the resources of that corporation to fight rival companies.  I do not think that the Minister should be prohibited from &ldquo;selling, leasing, or working in conjunction...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Minister would have to come to the Dáil.  Let us assume that the invention is being developed, and that you have got to a certain point.  Then the Minister comes here and says that this invention is to be applied <Col N="1287" /> in a particular way, and as it is useful to certain groups he wants to enlist one of them on his side.  Therefore he says that he wants power to sell.  The Minister could make a statement like that, but is that all that is required?  We would then have got to a point further than that we were at previously, and the consideration shown to the matter now, realising that it is delicate matter, would not then apply.  The House would then be entitled to become more inquisitive, and would say to the Minister: &ldquo;What are you proposing to get and what is this being devoted to?&rdquo; Perhaps a committee would be set up to inquire and report, and in that event the more people who got the secret revealed the more danger there would be of information leaking out.  I do not say that it would be given away deliberately.  However, if Deputy Lemass says that (c) and (d) are to be objected to I think that (e) will have to be included.</P>

I know that the feeling will be that the Minister is very much on his trial and that he will be very careful, but it is the contingent liability in the development of these things which is really serious.  We might find that after this contingent liability was taken on they did not come in under expenses incurred by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Take this particular thing which is vaguely under discussion.  I have got the right to purchase.  I have taken certain rights in regard to an assignment of <Col N="1288" /> a patent or of a share of it.  Remember that one ought to look beyond the documents and to the point where the company is being formed to work the thing commercially. I had to see that my rights are protected right along the line. I had not merely rights in the invention but rights in the patent and in any company formed to work the patent.  I am afraid that there will always be over-lapping, especially if there is insistence on a reference to the Dáil before anything is done.  I will, however, look into the points raised under (c), (d) and (e), and bring the matter up again on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I would direct the attention of the Dáil to the last two lines of Article 39 of the Constitution which states that a Bill having been initiated in Seanad Eireann and passed by the Seanad, shall be introduced into the Dáil but that if rejected by Dáil Eireann it shall not be introduced again in the same Session but the Dáil may reconsider it on its own motion.  I think it was explained at the Joint <Col N="1291" /> Committee, which considered this amongst other matters, that that was an unnecessary restriction and served no useful purpose.  The only purpose which it could be said to serve would be to deal with the abuses of Bills&mdash;that is to say if a Bill came down from the Seanad and were rejected here and were brought on again in a month's time, again rejected and brought on again in another month's time.  That is very unlikely.  This Bill deals with the recommendation of the Joint Committees. It has for its object the removal from Article 39 of the Constitution of the provisions which prohibit any Bill initiated in Seanad Eireann and rejected by Dáil Eireann, being introduced again in the same Session.  It may be that a measure initiated in the Seanad and sent to the Dáil might be rejected by the Dáil.  A reason might arise for its re-introduction.  I presume it is to deal with such a situation that the Committee made such a recommendation.</P>

There is a prohibition on that at present.  I think it would not be unreasonable that a Bill of that sort should be brought in.  I do not know if the particular recommendation in this case will meet with the approval of the Dáil.  It does not follow that if this Bill were to pass, Senators would be appointed members of the Executive Council.  It is on the nomination of the President to the Dáil that the Executive Council is formed, and it is on that occasion, even if this Bill were to pass, that the question has to be decided as to who should comprise the Executive Council&mdash; whether they should be Deputies or Senators.  I do not think it is at all likely within the next twenty years, even if this Bill were passed into law, that any more than one&mdash;possibly not even one&mdash;member of the Seanad would be either nominated or accepted by the Dáil as a member of the Executive.  I do think, however. that, as we have two Houses. it would not be unreasonable to have at least the power to nominate a Senator for the Executive Council, if it were thought desirable by the person appointed by the Dáil as President of the Executive Council so to do.  However, as I have said, the matter will be left open for the discussion of the Dáil. In my own view, there ought to be, as I have said, provision for the nomination of one member of the Seanad, if the person appointed as President of the Executive Council thought fit to make that recommendation.</P>

      <P>We intend opposing this Bill.  First of all, there is no indication in the Bill that there is any restriction as to the number.  I agree with the President that in practice a very large number of the Executive Council would not be chosen from the Seanad.  But the House knows our attitude with regard to the Seanad, and we think that even while the present arrangements stand it is only <Col N="1293" /> right that the Executive Council should be completely composed of members of this House, who have to face their constituents afterwards and would be able to face criticism here.  Members of the Seanad are in a specially privileged position.  As far as I can make out, the Constitution originally envisaged having an Executive Council, and also extern Ministers.  Recently there has been an amendment of that which makes it possible for the President to nominate all the Ministers as members of the Executive Council.  There is no reason why, under the existing arrangement, if there is a particularly able member of the Seanad whose services the President wants for the Ministry, he could not use his power and get an extern Minister appointed as such.  But just as you have three specially mentioned Ministers here, namely, the President, Vice-President, and Minister for Finance, who must be members of the Executive Council, so I believe that the idea which was at the basis of that should be extended completely to the members who have joint responsibility.  I do not think it is necessary to argue the matter at great length.  The main point is that we think that those who have joint responsibility should all be members of the Dáil, and secondly, that if there should happen to be some outstanding members of the Seanad, these can be availed of as heads of departments by the President.</P>

      <P>It will be remembered that the Party opposite secured election very largely upon their stand with respect to this Constitution.  They maintained that they were the one party that really desired to preserve this Constitution and all it stood for.  I think, <Col N="1295" /> therefore, that it is rather deplorable, when a Bill to amend the Constitution in a very important clause is before the House, there should be only half a dozen members of the Government Party present.  I should like, therefore, to have a count of the House to see if we could fill it up.</P>

      <P>Now that a number of the upholders of the Constitution are here to be informed of its fate, I want to make some objections to this Bill which I do not think should be overlooked.  The main purpose of the Bill is to enable Senators to become members of the Executive Council, but it goes a step further. It sets out to provide that while the President of the Executive Council, the Vice-President, and the Minister for Finance shall be members of Dáil Eireann, all the other members of the Executive Council shall be members of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas, according to Article 12 of the Constitution, consists of the King and two Houses.  Therefore, one purpose for which this Bill could be applied would be to enable the King, who in this Constitution I have no doubt is the King of Great Britain, to become a member of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.  We have a strong objection to the King becoming a member of the Executive Council.  We do not think that he has either the ability or the intimate knowledge of affairs in this country to justify any Government in including him amongst its members.  I think it a very extraordinary proposal for the Executive Council to bring before us&mdash;a proposal to enable them to appoint the King of Great Britain Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or Minister for Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that those who went campaigning during the year 1927 on the ground that they stood for every syllable and comma of the Constitution did not at that time contemplate that the Constitution might, at one time, provide for the election of His Majesty the King of <Col N="1296" /> Great Britain to a position on the Executive Council.  There are, however, decided objections to the taking of that course.  Deputy de Valera said that one particular section of this Bill, if passed, might mean that we would have not merely unrepresentative persons on the Executive Council but, also, persons of very doubtful ability.  Of course, we have those at the present time but the danger that the number might be increased, as a result of the passage of this measure, is fairly substantial and should be borne in mind by all those interested in the preservation of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Do Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies seriously think that the value of the Constitution would be enhanced, or that the ability of the Executive Council would be enhanced, if the King of Britain became a member of it?  Do they think that the British King would be more effective in dealing with the Department of Fisheries than the gentleman who now occupies the position?  A number of members on this side of the House are convinced that that would be so but we hardly expect a public admission from members of the Cumann na nGaedheal party that that would be so.  A number of them perhaps would be quite prepared to substitute the King of Great Britain for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as the King of Great Britain has probably a larger number of followers than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this House &mdash;but whether that is so is doubtful. Even if they included in the position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the King of Great Britain they would not have strengthened their position in any way, because those who stand for the British King here can be relied upon to support the Government.</P>
    <P>In fact, we have this morning's edition of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; to remind us that not merely do they support the Government, but as it says every voter in North Dublin who wants to see Ireland retain its place in the British Empire should come <Col N="1297" /> out and vote solidly for the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate.  But even if the President is prepared, as I suggest he ought, to amend this Bill so as to exclude the possibility of the British King becoming a member of the Executive Council, there would still remain very decided objections to it.  As I pointed out before, there are six good men in the Seanad, and one good woman, but if the situation should ever arise in which the Executive Council might desire to include amongst its members one of those six good men in the Seanad, we think that other machinery could be devised to secure that end, and machinery different from that suggested in the Bill.  These six good men, out of the sixty Senators, do not constitute an argument for the retention of that body, nor an argument for this Bill.  If the Executive was constituted of members picked merely because of the political influence which they exercised it is not unlikely that some persons would be brought forth from the seclusion of the Seanad Chamber into the turmoil of the Dáil as Executive Ministers who possessed no ability whatever except the ability to pull strings when their own interests were at stake.  The members of that body, even the six good men to whom I have referred, are in no sense representative of the people.  We think it is a very wrong principle that there should be placed in charge of any of the big spending departments of the State persons who cannot claim that they themselves received a direct mandate from the people to act on their behalf.  Not merely have we got to provide against the danger of inefficient Ministers in the consideration of this Bill, but we have also to provide against the dangers of damaging the foundations of democratic government.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle of democracy is that all power comes from the people.  The people themselves decide what is to be the amount they will pay in taxes, in what manner that amount is to be expended, and what are the laws under which their lives are to be regulated. <Col N="1298" /> They decide that by proxy through elected representatives.  But we find an Executive Council endeavouring to take out of the hands of the elected representatives of the people these essential powers and to give them, in part at any rate, to individuals in the case of a great majority of whom their only claim to occupy the position is that they have rendered good service on some particular occasion to the present Executive.  There are in that Seanad over 50 members now in a position to influence the course of legislation here, but if they had to go into an Irish constituency and get a vote of the majority of the people in order to give them that power they would never get it.  We must take it because that is so that the people do not wish to see these individuals exercising any influence whatever in the making of the regulations which are going to order their lives.</P>
    <P>This is a proposal to do by a backstairs method what cannot be done by straightforward methods, a proposal to give these, rejected of the people, powers which they could not otherwise secure.  We have already given them considerable power. During the last two or three sessions we have been passing Bills to increase their power, but not satisfied with increasing the powers of the House to which they belong, we are to get selected individuals from amongst them and bring them down here to influence the Dáil in their deliberations.  When they come here they will not, it is true, have the right to vote on any questions, but the right to vote is a very minor matter.  We know from our experience in this House that the Executive Council do all the thinking and talking for the Party which elected them.  Those who sit on the benches behind them are mere voting machines.</P>
    <P>The President or a Minister of the Executive Council stands up and says white is black, or black is white, and all the Cumann na nGaedheal Party troop into the Division Lobby and vote to confirm what the Minister <Col N="1299" /> or President said is true, and whether it is true or not, it becomes true, having received the impress of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  A Minister from the Seanad, if he cannot record his vote in the Lobby can influence the Dáil to a much greater extent than 55 members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who never attempt to influence it at all. We therefore ask those who are interested in the Constitution, and who are anxious to make it one that people will read with respect, those who do not want to see idiotic action taken by the Government, to vote against this Bill.  Deputies on this side of the House who are not particularly interested in the Constitution, and who do not care what way people regard it, and who expect nothing but idiotic action from the Executive Council, will vote against this Bill for no other reason than that it is a Government measure, but we think in this matter we are entitled to expect, that which we do not hope to receive, some assistance from the silent members opposite.</P>

      <P>We are all acquainted with the eloquence of Deputy Lemass.  We are acquainted with his ingenuity, which is even greater than his eloquence, and the fact that there is no more to be said against this Bill than he has said, proves that there is a strong case for it.  I need not follow his fantastic suppositions, as to the fact that the King may become Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He does not himself believe it.  He would not try that argument even at a by-election. If Deputy Lemass is seriously concerned I think I can promise him that an amendment to substitute for &ldquo;members of the Oireachtas&rdquo;&ldquo;members of Dáil or Seanad Eireann&rdquo; would be accepted.  That is to meet a danger that simply does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major Cooper Major Cooper">
      <NameTxt>Major Cooper</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, subject to the leave of the Party <Col N="1300" /> meeting, support that amendment. Deputy Lemass is very concerned about past elections and how we stood for every word in the Constitution. I do not know any Deputy in this Party who said the Constitution was incapable of amendment.  I certainly did not.  In fact, in the First Dáil, I had advocated this particular amendment as a ground for making the Seanad more efficient.  I know Deputy Lemass does not want to make the Seanad more efficient. It is his desire to make it thoroughly inefficient, to abolish it as soon as possible.  One cause that it is not as efficient as it might be is that it has not enough guidance.  There is not a Minister or even a Parliamentary Secretary to give it a definite lead.  The Seanad probably might vote down that Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, but it would have definite guidance.  I will not take a hypothetical case.  I will take a definite example.  Imagine, as might arise, a Government formed from one of the smaller Parties in the Dáil subject to the tacit support of a larger Party.  Imagine the Leader of the Labour Party forming a Government assured of the support of Fianna Fáil.  It is less than two years since that possibility arose. How could a Labour Party form an efficient Executive Council if it were politically limited to the Dáil?  If they could call on the help of one or two Labour Senators they would form a very much better Government. They would form a Government that would have some power of continuing in such a manner as to retain Fianna Fáil's support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass last week told me that he did not understand me because my argument was inconsistent. I did not quite understand Deputy Lemass to-day, because he was inconsistent. One moment he said that a Senator may come down here as a Minister, address us and influence hundreds of votes.  The next moment he said that members of the Cumann na nGaedheal party paid no attention to speeches.  The Senator is not going to influence fifty Deputies of a party who pay no attention to <Col N="1301" /> speeches.  I think Deputy Lemass knows he exaggerates the power of the spoken word in a parliamentary assembly.  I do not think that this hypothetical Senator-Minister is going to be so terribly powerful as all that.  I certainly say you will not get a good Senator if you say to any man who goes into it &ldquo;whatever happens you cannot be a Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass talked to us about the possibility of having in the Executive Council a member of no party whatever because Senators may be allowed to be in it.  Can he show us any safeguard, if we continue to confine membership of the Executive Council to the Dáil, against having members of no party whatever in it.  I can imagine a Fianna Fáil Government containing one or two members of no party whatever if they are swayed by the back benchers to the extent that they are now swayed in debate.  There is a safeguard.  Of course Deputy Lemass ignored it.  It would not suit his case.  There is a safeguard for democracy, a comparative safeguard for efficiency, and that is whether a Senator becomes a member of the Executive Council or not his nomination by the President has got to be approved by the Dáil.  The Dáil has the last word, and if any hopelessly inefficient Senator is nominated the Dáil would have the power of rejecting the nomination of the President, not the individual nomination but the nomination of the whole Executive Council.  It is at least a safeguard for democracy.  I think when Deputy Lemass reflects on one or two recent debates that took place in the Dáil and Seanad, for instance, on the confirmation of the Kellogg Pact, he will have to recognise that there are certain Senators who are not entirely devoid of ability.</P>

There might be very much-needed reinforcements of them here <Col N="1302" /> when eventually some of their members come from the Seanad.  But there are some Senators who are not entirely unknown and who are not entirely incapable.  In fact, I believe if a citizen of the United States or of Italy read over the names of the Seanad and Dáil he would probably find that he heard of more Senators than of members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>If I were to find a typical personification and embodiment of it its name would be Deputy Cooper.  Deputy Cooper cannot understand how Cumann na nGaedheal people could be influenced by a Senatorial Executive Minister of whom they had not heard.  How are they now influenced by non-Senatorial Executive members of whom they have not heard?  The procedure is that the bell rings for prayer. They come in, they ask what division they are to go into: then they ask what it is about, and then they legislate with their feet.  It is the only part of their bodies or minds which they are accustomed to use, and they can use them in relation to a Senatorial Executive officer in exactly the same way as they use them in relation to a non-Senatorial <Col N="1303" /> Executive officer.  I hope that Deputy Cooper has now completely understood, after my clear disquisition, that which he was not able to follow from my friend Deputy Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I cannot see any justification whatever for an Executive Council which is made up or can be made up of people who have had no contact with the ordinary electors of this country.  In another country where they have a House of Commons and a House of Lords, as Deputy Cooper is perfectly well aware, those two Houses are used for certain purposes.  Where a Minister has become ineffective or inefficient he is sent to the House of Lords.  That is a way of getting rid of him.  Another use that is made of it&mdash;and this may become part of the machinery in this particular case&mdash;is where someone who has not been elected is wanted in by the existing Executive in the Parliament.  Someone is persuaded to go to the House of Lords and provide a vacancy.  We are improving on that machinery.  We are in the position under this Constitution amendment not merely to make a Senator a member of the Executive Council, but to pick up anybody in the street we want so long as there is a majority in the Seanad and the Dáil of a particular Party, and put him straight into the Executive Council.  All we have got to do is to arrange that one of the people whom, for one reason or another, you have sent to the local House of Lords is to cease to be a member of the local House of Lords.  There are other compensations.  The Seanad has got to be compensated, as you know, for vested interests; that has been laid down as a constitutional principle and as a principle of honourable conduct in this State.  The part cannot be greater than the whole, and the morality of any particular Senator cannot be regarded as any higher than the doctrine that has been laid down in relation to the whole.  If the Seanad is entitled to compensation for the invasion of invested interests&mdash;that is what all this litter of Constitution amendments is for&mdash;<Col N="1304" /> in the same way a member of the Seanad is entitled to compensation for invasion of his particular position and he can be persuaded by compensation to remove himself from the Seanad and provide a vacancy.  Now the road is perfectly clear.  You can pick up anybody on the street, elect him to the Seanad, and by that means bring him straight into the Executive Council.  I do not know whether that is part of the idea.  I do not know whether that is an alternative to the job which, I understand, is now being attempted by which a member of the Dáil was sent to the Seanad in order to provide a vacancy for a contingent Minister.</P>

      <P>Most of the arguments that we have listened to are really not directed to the Bill before the House.  Many of the arguments would not apply to a Bill to amend the Constitution.  If Deputies consider the Constitution they will see that a good many of the arguments actually apply to the Constitution and not to the Bill.  I think I am interpreting Deputy Lemass rightly when I say that one of his principal objections was that if the Bill gets through it will allow men to occupy positions as heads of Departments and be elected to a Ministerial position without having had the privilege of being elected at an ordinary constituency election.  I think that was one of the principal arguments that Deputy Lemass put forward.  Well, that is the position under the Constitution as it exists, as the Deputy knows.  The head of one of the big spending departments may be a Minister.  That is, a man may be appointed to be a Minister for one of the big spending Departments <Col N="1306" /> and yet not be a member of the House&mdash;not be elected by the people. I think a proposal was more than once put forward by Deputy T. O'Connell, who was rather keen on the point, that the head of the biggest spending department should not be a member of the Executive Council. If that proposal were adopted it would mean that that particular Minister need not be a member of the Dáil.  He would need to be a member neither of the Seanad nor the Dáil.  Therefore, so far as what I consider one of the principal arguments put forward by Deputy Lemass is concerned, it applies with equal weight to the Constitution as it does to this Bill.  After all, the control of the Executive is got in one particular way; that is, the Executive is approved by this House when nominated by the President.  No member of the Seanad can be a member of the Executive Council unless the approval of this House is got. That is the real control the people have over the Government.  The control, according to our Constitution, is exercised through this House, and, as long as the Government is responsible to this House, it does not diminish that indirect control that the people have through the House over the Government, whether an individual member happens to be a member of this House or of the Seanad.  At the present moment it is possible for a majority in this House to appoint a number of Ministers who are members of the Seanad. There is nothing to prevent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change the Bill proposes to introduce is to allow a member of that kind, the head of one of the big spending departments, to use Deputy Lemass's words, if he is so approved by the House for the position, to become a member of the Executive Council.  That is the main change that the Bill introduces.  It in no way interferes with the great principles brought forward by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Flinn. Deputy Flinn seems to think that it is an unheard of thing that a member of an Executive should not be a member of the popularly elected House, and yet in some of the big <Col N="1307" /> democracies of the world that is so. In the case of the American Executive that is so, and in the case of the German Executive it is so.  They are both countries in which nobody would suggest there is not full democratic control&mdash;full democratic Government.</P>
    <P>If you take the individual sections of the Bill&mdash;they are not very many &mdash;there were certain points raised with which I would like to deal.  One point was raised about the power of a Minister, who is not a member of this House, to address this assembly. Everybody will admit that the Constitution would require, not exactly, perhaps, the amendments that are down in Section 2, but a similar amendment, if it was thought well to appoint a person as Extern Minister. Strictly speaking, he would have no right of audience here, but a member of the Executive Council has the right of audience in the Seanad.  An Extern Minister who is not a member of this House would not have the right of audience or the right to speak for the Department of which this House would have made him head.  The main purpose of the Bill is not of the far-reaching character suggested by certain Deputies. It is limited to one particular purpose, namely, to allow Senators to be elected members of the Executive Council.  As things stand at present, there is nothing to prevent Senators being appointed Ministers and being placed at the head of the principal spending departments. Nothing can prevent that. The Bill, in my opinion, aims at a very reasonable thing.  If men are in a position of trust of that kind they can also become members of the Executive Council.  That is the main object.</P>

      <P>When a sheaf of Constitution amendments, numbering up to 16, were rushed upon this House, and amongst the number this particular amendment of the Constitution which we are now dealing with, I did think that on mature consideration the Government would at least have withdrawn this Constitution <Col N="1308" /> amendment which I regard as a most revolutionary amendment. The Constitution in its second Article says that all power is derived from the people of Ireland.  I think I read in an election speech a few days ago that the people own the country.  Now we are asked to pass a change in this Constitution which means that with the exceptions mentioned in this Bill&mdash;the President, the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance&mdash;all Ministers may be men who have never gone before the people for election. That is the proposal, although we have it in the Constitution that all powers are derived from the people, and we have it from the Minister that the people own the country.  To my mind this is Constitution amendment gone mad.  It has been stated by the Minister for Education that in some of the big democracies of the world there are people at the head of spending Departments who are not elected by the people.  Surely members of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would regard a country that elected Ministers who are not the elected of the people as a very undemocratic country and it would not deserve the title of being democratic.  It has been customary in this House to reflect on the people. The people, in fact, according to this <Col N="1309" /> change in the Constitution, are not capable of selecting men who will deal with Free State affairs.  This is a further evidence that the people do not know what they are doing when they are voting, when they cannot select by their own votes ten or twelve men who are capable of carrying on the Government of the country.  If this form of Constitution amendment goes on, we will have the Constitution so reconstituted that there will be no Constitution at all.</P>
      <P>I most strongly oppose any system by which the governors of this country, those who are to be at the head of the spending departments of this country, are not in touch, and in very direct touch, with the people who pay the piper.  I am not quite clear whether this measure was introduced before or after the new form of election to the Seanad&mdash;and it does not really matter whether it was before or after&mdash;but it was brought in in such a way that the President when making up his Executive Council is in this position: &ldquo;The people have elected to this House a certain number of representatives, who, in my view, are not fit.  Not one of them is fit to occupy the position of Minister in a spending department.  Therefore, I will change the Constitution in such a way as to give me a free hand to put in charge of the government of this country men who have not been before the people but who are likely to give satisfaction.&rdquo;  I am not now speaking of the present President of the Saorstát, but of any man who may be elected to that position.  This Bill places him in the position of being able to say: &ldquo;I do not agree with the people's choice of representatives. I am going to another House to constitute my Cabinet, and I will do it despite the votes of the people.&rdquo;  That is a thing I will never stand for and I will vote against this Constitution Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy O'Hanlon, in quoting Article 2 of the Constitution, got on rather a fundamental issue.  If all power is derived <Col N="1310" /> from the people, surely the Ministers should be themselves elected directly by the people.  If we are going to amend this particular article we will have as big an anomaly as Article 51 is at present. Article 2 says that &ldquo;All powers of government and all authority, legislative, executive and judicial in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland, and the same shall be exercised in the Irish Free State through the organisation established by or under and in accord with this Constitution.&rdquo;  This would appear to be one of the organisations which we are about to establish.  Having a Senator appointed a Minister will, as I said already, be almost as ridiculous as Article 51, which says that &ldquo;the Executive authority of the Irish Free State is hereby declared to be vested in the King.&rdquo;  If we regard the King as one of the organisations established under this Constitution in whom all power is to be vested, it is not altogether surprising that we should select a member of the other House as one of our Executive Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper in talking about the members of the other House said as a sort of apologia that if these men's names were mentioned along with the names of the members of the Dáil in America it would be found that the members of the other House would be better known.  It is quite possible that they would be better known for various reasons. They are known in organisations in America, such as members of Rotary Clubs, and in that way they are better known than members of the Dáil.  And they would be better known for another reason.  There are in America many descendants of the Irish people who were driven to America during the Land War, and they would possibly recognise some of the names of those members of the Seanad, having heard them from their fathers or mothers.  Deputy Cooper declared that Deputy Lemass said that we had put our best men into the Seanad.  I do not think that Deputy Lemass said that.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that we have <Col N="1311" /> put good men into the Seanad&mdash;the best men there&mdash;but we have good men left here and in other places.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper's big objection to the present arrangement was that there was no inducement, as it were, to a man to become a member of the Seanad; that there is no promotion; that a Senator cannot expect to be anything but a Senator, and that, therefore, there is no inducement at present to any man to go into that Chamber.  That may be, and perhaps it is as well that it should be like that.  Perhaps it is as well that men should be left in the Seanad until they get ambitious.  If they are really efficient, if they become ambitious enough to become members of this House, they can in that way work their way up and become Ministers eventually.  No matter what we have in this House we cannot have too many good men who are worthy of promotion.  In spite of the explanation given by the Minister for Education that it is at present possible for a member of the Seanad to be at the head of one of the departments and that this makes it possible for a Senator to be a member of the Executive Council, I think that we ought to vote against this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Constitution stands at the moment it is quite possible to have seven extern Ministers appointed.  Those seven extern Ministers would, I presume, be eligible for appointment as heads of spending departments.  Nobody who mentioned the word &ldquo;spending&rdquo; gave any explanation of what it meant. I presume what was meant was a department that would have a considerable sum of money to be disposed of in accordance with the regulations or statutes of the Oireachtas. We had some extern Ministers in the Dáil from 1923 to 1927.  One of the departments in question spent very considerable sums of money.  I think the amount was in the neighbourhood of two millions.  Another very important Minister who was an extern Minister was the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. <Col N="1312" /> It is possible as things stand at present if this Bill were not passed that if the President of the Executive Council were not to nominate as Ministers a sufficient number from the Dáil, members of the Seanad would not be entitled to be considered for those various posts.</P>
      <P>The only alteration in this is that a bar, which hitherto existed against members of the Seanad being appointed members of the Executive Council, would be removed.  I am not one of those who agree with all this talk about ability which comes from the other side.  To hear some Deputies opposite speak about ability one would think that all the ability in the country reposed in them.  They have given no evidence of any ability&mdash;I, at any rate, have never seen any suggestion of it&mdash;in the whole course of their political activity.  Until they make some progress in that direction they ought not throw ridicule on people about whom they know nothing.  It is not fair and it is not just.  The solutions they offer for every problem which comes before them is to set up a Board.  In regard to housing, about which they speak so much at election times, their solution is the setting up of a Housing Board.</P>

      <P>As I say, there is a bar on Senators becoming members of the Executive Council.  I think that that bar ought to be withdrawn. In the case of one Minister, it would have been within the competence of the Ministry during the last six years to appoint a Senator to the position of Parliamentary Secretary. It has not been done.  This is simply removing the bar.  It is unlikely, as I have said, if this Bill becomes law, that some time in the next ten, fifteen or twenty years a Senator would be nominated as a Minister. Deputies have not read this report very carefully.  There is one Senator who voted for this proposal who got many more votes in a contest than any Deputy who is criticising him.  He got more votes than the highest number of votes cast for any Deputy on those benches opposite. Senator O'Farrell got something like thirteen or fourteen thousand votes.</P>

      <P>Yes, on the direction of the Joint Committee, who said that election by the people to the Seanad was undesirable.  That was subscribed to by most important members of the Fianna Fáil hierarchy. The position with regard to administration generally is what is for the best interests of the State. One would think, if it were possible to find more capable administrators in the Seanad, it would not be fair that the fact that they had not been elected by the people should be a bar to their inclusion in the Executive Council&mdash;men who would be of considerable benefit in the counsels of the Executive Council. That is a proposition that I do not agree with, that there should be a bar on the person nominating the Executive Council taking some person from the Seanad who would be of national use or national benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I do not subscribe to that.  But the fact that it is possible to get an extern Minister from the Seanad is conclusive evidence that there was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution an idea that there was some advantage in that proposal.  This amendment of the Constitution proposes to place the same opportunities at the disposal of the Dáil because the Dáil has to approve of the nomination which is made by the President of the Executive Council.</P>

We propose to act quite consistently with that view by objecting to the inclusion of Senators in the case of casual vacancies.  It is quite consistent with our attitude right through.</P>

      <P>I should like to say with regard to this that Deputy de Valera and his Party are now, after all this time, finding out the danger of walking into the trap laid for them by the representatives of the opposite Party.  When they joined with Cumann na nGaedheal in saying that election by the people was undesirable they sowed the wind and they are now reaping the whirlwind. They should have been sure that they would get what they were looking for before they agreed to have what Cumann na nGaedheal offered them.  They should not have taken the first step before they saw where they were going to land with the second one.  I agree that the Bill is one which ought to be opposed.  I think the next best thing is election by the Dáil alone and for that reason I am opposing it.</P>

      <P>As far as I have been able to read the report, I have not seen that any suggestion was made by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party at this Joint Committee that casual vacancies should be filled by the vote of the Dáil alone.  This carries out exactly what was decided by the Joint Committee.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Connell when he talks of walking into the trap laid by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. There has been too much talk about parties in connection with all these Bills.  It looks as if the Deputies opposite and Deputy O'Connell had nothing but party in their minds from morning until night.  That is not the atmosphere in which one should consider this question.  I would be sorry if in considering a question affecting the Constitution of the State generally one had that sort of thing in mind.  It so happens that the alterations which have been made were at the cost of the party I represent&mdash;very much at their cost.  We would have swept the Seanad election if it had been held, and Deputy O'Connell knows it.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 (Amendment of Article 35) stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A point raised here on the last occasion that this Bill was before us was not met satisfactorily by the President.  It was with reference to the time.  I looked up the Article of the Constitution dealing with it since, and I do not see how anybody could conclude definitely, from the Article of the Constitution, that the Committee which would be set up to give a declaration whether or not a Bill was a Money Bill could not continue to sit indefinitely or for such a long period as would seriously hamper and obstruct the Dáil or the Executive of the day in respect to a Bill held to be a Money Bill.  I did not get it directly from the President, but I made some inquiries to find out what was at the back of his mind in respect to the case in regard to which his explanation here was so unsatisfactory, to find what theory he was working on when he said that if the Bill did not come back in twenty-one days it would automatically be sent forward for signature and become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be all right if the question was finished with as to whether or not it was a Money Bill.  But surely the matter would be sub judice until the Committee had definitely decided and reported it was a Money Bill; I do not know whether it would be possible to have an injunction, for example, to prevent the Executive sending it on for signature after twenty-one days until this Committee had reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the President is simply depending on probabilities and so on instead of making it perfectly definite, as he can by a slight <Col N="1322" /> alteration, that the report of the Committee should come back within a specified period.  I have no objection to the minor changes which have been suggested here, to make it possible to give facilities to the Senators to meet and consider the matter, but I certainly think it very wrong of us to allow a Bill pass out of our hands which may lead to considerable trouble afterwards and hamper the Executive when, by careful drafting and consideration of that point, it could be made perfectly definite.  I think the theory on which the President is working at present is that the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle goes unless it is reversed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I have been looking through the Articles of the Constitution to see if that would follow definitely from those Articles; in other words, that the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle held unless it was reversed.  It seems to me the Articles indicate quite a different mode of procedure and that the matter is in suspense from the time the Committee is set up.  Once the Committee is set up, the question of whether it is or is not a Money Bill is in abeyance.  Therefore, the twenty-one days do not follow, and therefore the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle is abrogated the moment this Committee is set up unless afterwards it confirms the judgment of the Ceann Comhairle.  I have not been convinced by what the President said, nor have I been convinced from another source from which I inquired that the President's interpretation is right, and I think the House ought not to let it go until that matter is cleared up definitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the question as to whether or not a Bill is a Money Bill is not one which affects, or is likely to affect, quite a number of clauses.  It is more than possible, in fact it is quite probable, that the only point in dispute will be perhaps a single line or a single paragraph of a Money Bill.  It is most unlikely, and it is most improbable that there <Col N="1323" /> will be quite a number of points in dispute in that connection.  It is, therefore, a question which will fall to be easily resolved by a Committee consisting of three members of the Dáil, three members of the Seanad, with a Judge of the Supreme Court. The question to be settled there is one which should not call for a day's consideration at all.  We approach the consideration of the trouble Deputy de Valera has suggested, with this in mind, that there is a difficulty there to be resolved and that they might take a longer period than the 21 days.  Apart from other considerations altogether, it is exceedingly unlikely that such scant courtesy would be shown to the principal institutions in the country, particularly by those persons who are members of the two institutions, and again particularly in view of the fact that the highest judicial person of the country would also be a member. So I think that of itself disposes of the question of unnecessary delay.</P>
      <P>Now, as to the trouble of resolving the question, I think that is unlikely. The Deputy had, I presume, before him a case in which a doubt might arise as to whether or not a Bill was a Money Bill.  He has had an example of the kind before him in considering the question.  As I said, I think it is most unlikely that more than one single objection would lie in respect of any measure.  It retains its character, as I said, of a Money Bill until the contrary is proved.  I will undertake to have that particular point examined in more detail before the Report Stage, but at present I must say I think it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the attitude of the President is most unsatisfactory. It is all &ldquo;he thinks.&rdquo; His argument, in one case, is that he thinks it would take a long time; he thinks it unfair to put any limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands me absolutely in respect to that.  I said, number one, if there is an objection to a Bill being called a Money Bill that objection will be in respect of a very short clause.  Number two, in consequence <Col N="1324" /> of that the matter to be resolved is a matter that can be resolved quickly. Number three, the persons to resolve it are six out of seven members of the two institutions in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, I misunderstood the trend of part of the argument.  I clearly understood the part of it that said it was going to be a simple matter.  I could not understand why he could not see his way to introduce a limit to the time period.  The other part of his argument was that we would not like to rush them in determining the matter and therefore time may be necessary. Therefore, his argument now satisfies me at least that he should agree that it is possible to indicate a time limit here.  Why not make it quite clear that the Committee shall report within 21 days or add some phrase to make it clear that the Committee cannot hold this up over a long period?  You know very well when you have three members of the Seanad and three members of the Dáil that it is possible that the question at issue might be one on which the Houses as Houses might take sides.  It is possible to conceive a case like that.  Suppose they take sides in this matter and argue it at length, I can very easily see the prolonging of these disputes between them for a considerable period. Why should we be dealing with what is likely to happen and all the rest of it?  It is a bad principle in legislation.  It seems to me we should set down in black and white as definitely as we can what we want.  There ought to be no difficulty for the President.  The Executive Council ought first to satisfy themselves as to what is a reasonable time and then get the draftsman to insert the clause here.  If 21 days is considered a reasonable time for the various considerations which the Committee have to go through, why not get 21 days inserted so as to be definite that the Committee must report back within 21 days?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The representative character of the Incorporated Law Society meeting has been questioned from time to time during this debate.  I think I can set all doubts at rest about the representative character of that meeting by reading for you the following extract:&mdash;&ldquo;The meeting had been summoned by the Council to consider the Legal Practitioners Bill, and 118 members present included representatives of the Sessional Bar Associations throughout the Free State deputed to attend and represent their associations.&rdquo; It has not been questioned that there was not a full representation of those Bar Associations.  Lest there may be any other point raised on the matter, I will relieve the mind of any Deputy, who is in need of knowing, that a Bar Association is not coterminous with a county. Somebody may get up here and say, &ldquo;So many Bar Associations were present for twenty-six counties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises again, is there a necessity for this Bill?  I say there is no necessity for it.  I believe it will cause young lawyers a lot of trouble and cause them to spend a lot of their time learning a very difficult language in which they will get practically nothing to do afterwards. There is only the provision made that the lawyers should speak Irish.  There is no provision in the Bill, or in any other Bill, that the judge and jury should know anything about Irish.  Where a jury is empanelled to try a case I would like to know what will become of the judge and jury while the legal advocates are disputing in Irish?  Are they to leave the courts and enjoy themselves any way they like? Deputy Anthony here has sometimes spoken with great courage.  He has described many things as shams and <Col N="1328" /> hypocrisies.  I really believe that we have surpassed ourselves in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is apparently brought in as a fillip in the restoration of the Irish language.  Why would we not be more general in the application of this principle of compulsion?  On the Second Reading I said that if the Bill in its application were more general I would be milder when speaking on it.  I could at least respect the Bill and I could almost support it.  But it singles out one section of the community for penal treatment.  I am ready to introduce a Bill into this House to make Irish compulsory on every wage-earner.  I will have that Bill apply to the plumber, the painter, the agricultural labourer, the farmer, and everybody else.  I would not have a very high standard.  But my introduction of that Bill will be contingent on my receiving from Deputies an intimation of their readiness to support that Bill.  Candidly, I do not expect to get many names.  If Deputies were consistent and if they were really concerned about the growth of the Irish language, they would support me in that Bill.  There is one very good reason why they will not give me their names in support of such a Bill.  They would know the electoral consequences.  They would know that if they imposed Irish on the working people of this country they would never again come back to this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Irish is a difficult language to learn.  We have that on the authority of Deputy Hugo Flinn.  I cannot imagine Deputy Hugo Flinn being a success at Irish.  He bartered his sweet Cork accent for a gorgeous Saxon one.  It is an accent that makes his oratory very attractive, I admit.  But still he is not qualified to speak Irish.  Deputy Hugo Flinn told us that a man of his age finds it hard to learn Irish.  Irish has been imposed on men of as advanced years as Deputy Hugo Flinn.  I will refer to that later on.  I do not deny the right that Ireland should have a language of its own.  We are told the Babel of tongues was the curse of God for the sins of early man.  I <Col N="1329" /> suppose if Ireland wants to have a distinctive curse of its own there is no reason to object to it.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the study of the Irish language interfering with the legal profession in the acquisition of a proper knowledge of law it is quite another thing.  The Incorporated Law Society and the King's Inns exist for teaching people the profession of law.  When you enter such places your preliminary education is supposed to be completed, and you enter such places to learn the profession of law, just the same as you would enter a plumber's or a painter's establishment to become a skilled tradesman.  If, as is provided in this Bill, you make those lawyers learn a very intensive course of Irish it will certainly interfere with them in their acquisition of legal knowledge. Nothing less than a very intensive course of Irish would be any good for a lawyer; that is, if we really mean that he is to plead the cases that will come his way in Irish. I fear, however, that even no matter to what extent he acquires the language, after a year or so he will require constant refreshers to bring his memory up to date so that he could plead with any advantage for his client.  I fear that in the end his knowledge of Irish will become so musty that I would not like to see it put at the disposal of the greatest old roué of a tomcat that every stole milk or meat from a pantry.</P>
    <P>The legal profession has been insinuating that this Bill is meant more to penalise them than to promulgate the study of Irish.  To a great extent I am inclined to agree with them.  They, however, make a mistake when they say they are specially singled out.  Whilst I agree fully with the impairment it will be to their profession, I would remind them that the medical profession has been infinitely more drastically treated.  If you want to form any conception of the impairment that the intensive study of Irish will do to the legal profession, you have only to recall what it has done to the medical profession.  At the moment there are rules and regulations made in connection with the Local <Col N="1330" /> Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  I have no doubt they apply to lawyers, but at any rate they apply to medical men of all ages.  These regulations give, in the case of some medical appointments, 100 per cent. preference.  In other cases they give 25 per cent. preference.  In 1,000 marks a man with a competent or incompetent knowledge of Irish&mdash;I am not concerned to say which&mdash;will start with a lead of 250 marks.  That in itself shows you that the giving of so many marks to a man who knows Irish is detrimental to the interests of the people to whose districts he is appointed.  Of course, the appointments that Irish is made a condition of&mdash;I mean medical appointments&mdash; are entirely concerned with officers for the poor.  Will any Deputy here, when he requires a medical man for his own family, be satisfied, for the same money, to get a man who is only three-quarters as good as the man who does not know Irish?  All that is what is aimed at in this Bill. I see that Deputies find it hard to believe this, but I have a letter here that will give every detail.</P>
    <P>Now, I am not anti-Irish, though I have been treated to every variety of abuse and have been called a West-Briton and a traitor.  I learned Irish voluntarily 35 years ago.  It was not then necessary for people to be induced to learn it by bribes of appointment.  My children are learning Irish to-day.  Still, of course, I will be called a West-Briton and a traitor, perhaps.  However, such abuse sits lightly upon me.  I believe that all this intensive scheme of Irish for lawyers and professional men is simply humbug.  It is not fair, and it should be resented by them.  I will challenge this House to bring in a Bill making a knowledge of Irish mandatory on every wagecarner. When you do that I will say you are sincere.  By simply singling out a profession which will only add seven or eight more members annually to those having a knowledge of Irish in the whole population, I do not think you are going to achieve very much for the language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Again, I think language should not be made a test of patriotism.  In support of that contention I will quote an extract taken from an article written by Arthur Griffith in the first number of the &ldquo;United Irishman,&rdquo; March 10th, 1899.  This is what Arthur Griffith said: &ldquo;The resuscitation of our national language is a work in which everyone of us should help and at the same time we would regret any insistence on a knowledge of Gaelic as a test of patriotism.&rdquo;  I subscribe fully to the principle enunciated by the late Arthur Griffith.  I believe every Deputy here subscribes to it; but when you begin to pick and choose simply all the time with your eyes on the electorate, and when you fear to have mandatory or compulsory Irish for the multitude because you know they have the power to express their opinions very forcibly, and you also know they will do it if you impose Irish on them, there you lose your sincerity.  I do not think I need say any more.  I do not expect to make one convert, but I have satisfaction in showing that this House is not sincere.  If it were, it would make Irish compulsory and mandatory for every working man in Ireland.  You would tell every working man, just as you would tell the lawyer and the doctor, that he shall not eat the bread of physical life unless he has a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <P>I would not detain the House at all only that Deputy Hennessy more or less attacked the ability of the aged to learn the national language.  I know one or two people who are not exactly spring chickens, and who have got a very fair knowledge of the Irish language at a rather advanced stage of their existence.  Of course, it is not the same knowledge that would be acquired by a young man of 20 or even 25.  Still, it is possible.  For myself, I can say that at the mature age of 61 I began to learn Irish, and although I have not, I suppose, what would be called a competent knowledge of the language in that I cannot understand everybody who <Col N="1332" /> speaks, I can understand some people who speak clearly.  I can also read and write it fairly well, to a certain extent.  I think Deputy Hennessy was rather unfair towards us, and it is for that reason mainly that I rose.</P>
      <P>As regards compulsory Irish all through the country, it is not being carried out with a sweep of the wand.  It is being done gradually. In regard to this particular Bill, it will be many years before it will really take effect.  It will only affect people of the age of fifteen years in September of this year.  Then only will it begin to affect them, and it will be a very long time, as far as I can see, before it becomes operative. I am glad it is so, because it would be most unfair, to my way of thinking.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hennessy alluded to doctors having to learn Irish, but they are not asked, I take it, to have a competent knowledge of Irish.  They are compelled to pass examinations and to understand the language, but the same degree of competency is not expected of them as would be expected from the legal <Col N="1333" /> profession in the years to come, according to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Irish is the native language of the country, and we all desire that in time to come it shall be in common use.  There must be a beginning made.  This is the right way to begin, in my opinion&mdash;by degrees, and with the profession which is, and always has been, very much to the front in the life of Ireland.  No doubt it will spread to the other professions by degrees&mdash;I hope it will be done gradually&mdash;and in the life-time of our sons, or our sons' sons, the old language of the country will be spoken universally.  We cannot, however, expect that to be done at once.  This Bill does not bring it into immediate operation.  As I said before, many years will elapse before it comes into full operation, and by that time a fair chance will have been given to those who come after us to acquire that competent knowledge, and to make preparation for it, so that no injustice will be done. The morale of the country will, to my mind, benefit by this general study of our language, by the enjoyment of the many beauties which are at present withheld from people who do not understand the language, among the old documents and papers which will then be available to those having a knowledge of the language, I am glad to see this Bill brought in. So far as I can see, no unfairness will take place.  A long time will elapse before it will become operative, and by that time any approach to injustice should be made impossible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper and Deputy Dr. Hennessy are agreed upon one thing.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy in his speech, to which we have just listened, said that he did not expect to make even one convert as a result of his arguments.  Deputy Cooper stated that it was a thankless job to argue against the Bill when it was sure of a majority. It will be a very good indication of the return to sanity on the part of those who oppose this forward move for the revival of the Irish language as the spoken language of the <Col N="1334" /> country if we can take that acceptance of what will be in the near future a <i>fait accompli,</i> namely, the Irish language triumphant over all opposition.  I am very much afraid, however, that we cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper put his finger on the kernel of the whole matter when he stated that there was a majority in the Dáil for the Bill, a majority that was certain.  The vote on Second Reading proved that.  I have no doubt that if a division is taken on the Report Stage the majority will be just as high in favour of the Bill as it was on the Second Stage. If the comments made in regard to Deputy Conlon's speech on the Report Stage are to be taken as an indication of the strength of the opposition then it is very weak indeed. There seems to be no real punch behind the fight put up against this Bill.  Deputy Cooper said if there was to be compulsory Irish let it be a real and thorough knowledge of the Irish language and not eye-wash.  For once I am in agreement with the Deputy, and I am sure that everyone who is in favour of the Bill is in agreement with him.  We do not want it to be eye-wash.  We are not supporting the Bill because it is a gesture in favour of the language which a number of people believe to be either dead or dying.  We support it because we believe it can be made an instrument whereby at least, one profession will be persuaded to adopt the native language as an everyday medium of communication. We support the Bill also, in the words of the preamble to the document issued by the legal profession, namely, &ldquo;If the Bill is to be effective for its ostensible purpose it must be assumed to be the forerunner of attempts to make Irish compulsory in all walks of national life.&rdquo; Deputy Doctor Hennessy said that he would be very glad if some Deputy introduced a Bill applying the same principles to members of this House, but that he did not believe there was much possibility of getting the same support for such a Bill because of the fear of what the electorate would do at the next <Col N="1335" /> appeal to the people.  Deputy Doctor Hennessy, I am sure, realises that the people&mdash;no matter how certain persons may try to camouflage it&mdash; have made up their minds that Irish has come to stay and that the revival of the Gaelic nation, about which there has been so much talk and so many articles written, is not going to be used merely for propaganda purposes but is going to be made a practical and economic reality so far as it is in the power of the present generation to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper said that this was legislation in a hurry, and that there was no urgency for it.  &ldquo;Legislation in a hurry&rdquo; is a phrase which makes one smile, in view of the fact that Deputy Cooper was a member of this House for five or six years and is thoroughly acquainted with all the enactments of this Dáil, and with the declared policy of the Government of Saorstát Eireann in setting up the Gaeltacht Commission recommended by the President, and the declared policy of every political party worth its salt in this country for the last fifteen or twenty years, and also, no doubt, the declared policy of the two great political parties at every election since the Treaty&mdash;the revival of the Irish language.  This is one way in which the language can, if you like, be commercialised and made the medium of expression through which the professions will be able to conduct their business, and through which the people will get a high regard for the language which many of them have not at present.  Call it the slave mind if you like.  As some people say: &ldquo;The better people do not use it.&rdquo;  They will be made to use it.</P>

I accept his statement that he bought <Col N="1336" /> his first book of O'Growney twenty years ago.  I do not quarrel with that statement.  He states that by passing this Bill we will be perpetuating the partition of the legal profession in Ireland.  We heard talk of partition during the Second Reading of this Bill, and now we have had that statement again, both in the document issued by the legal profession and in the speech of Deputy Cooper.  There is no doubt, to put it plainly and candidly, that it will perpetuate the partition of the legal profession so long as one section of that profession is pigheaded enough to come up against cold, hard, metallic facts, which, in the words of Deputy Flinn, mean that there is in the South of Ireland a permanent majority in favour of nationalising the country.  So long as that section of the legal profession is content to pit itself against that hard metallic fact there will be partition among the legal profession. It will not be caused in any way by any action on the part of the people but by the pigheadedness of that section itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond asked whether it was ever suggested that anything in the nature of compulsory Irish would be instituted against one particular profession in this country.  It was suggested.  It was often suggested in speeches, in newspaper articles, and in many reports submitted during the past five or six years. It was suggested that it should apply not to one profession in particular, but to every branch of educational and economic activity in this country.  Deputy Redmond should realise that in his own constituency of Waterford, within which there is part of the Gaeltacht, the two great political Parties at the last two elections made no bones whatsoever about their attitude towards the Irish language and towards many recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission.  He stated, further, that he did not see why this Bill should be brought in referring to future solicitors or barristers, and why this or another Bill should not bring about the same conditions for other classes, and he described it as <Col N="1337" /> the thin end of the wedge.  Undoubtedly, it is the thin edge of the wedge.  Undoubtedly we hope to see, not a Bill such as this Bill, but a comprehensive Bill which will fulfil the hopes of Deputies Dr. Hennessy and Cooper, involving even membership of the Dáil and the Seanad. Undoubtedly we hope to see such a comprehensive Bill, and I will be only too pleased to support it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice approved of the Bill, but there was one statement of his with which I should like to quarrel.  He said he was glad that nobody could say that Deputy Flinn was typical of the Gaelic League or the Irish revival mentality.  I do not know whether he would class me as a nobody or not.  I am one body who can say that Deputy Flinn's remarks, in particular two paragraphs of them, were certainly typical of the Gaelic League and Irish revival mentality which every honest-togoodness man who does really believe in the revival of the Irish language and who is prepared to stand for adequate measures to bring it about, should be prepared to stand over.  One of the things with which the Minister for Justice quarrels, and which Deputy Flinn said was: &ldquo;I ask the House, in this particular small matter, to start doing what it will be its business to do, in relation to membership of the Dáil and membership of every profession in this country, and in relation to every commercial and educational activity. Certainly that is the Gaelic League and the Irish-Ireland revival mentality, and nobody can quarrel with it.&rdquo;  He stated further, dealing with the attitude of a certain section in this country in relation to the nationalising of the country, that &ldquo;they must face the fact that there is in the south of Ireland a permanent majority, however otherwise divided, which is determined, that in this matter, and in all matters, not merely the tendency of movement but the actual movement, shall be in that direction, and that the forces which are going to measure themselves against that must be prepared to measure themselves against the vast majority of the people and <Col N="1338" /> to take the consequences of deliberate obstruction of that movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I stated something similar in the course of the Second Reading, that the time had come in this country when those who were against the question of the revival of the Irish language must make up their minds on one of two things&mdash; either to accept it definitely and irrevocably, or to fight it by every means at their command.  I stated further, and it will be no harm to state it again, that because the Irish language was killed by a variety of forces, and as it was brought into its present precarious position as the result of long continued coercion and persecution by every available force that could be used from outside, to ensure that that object would be achieved, if it were necessary, and I do not believe it is, I see no reason in the world why we should not stand for a policy of the same kind and for the same methods that were used to kill the language in order to bring it back.  I see no reason why a penalising of Irish professions should not be applied, in fact pursued, if these professions refuse to recognise the fact that much water has flown under the bridges of Ireland for the last seven or eight years.  I see no reason to be ashamed of it, if it were necessary to institute something approaching the penal laws.  Probably the Minister for Justice will describe these remarks as being as injurious to the cause of the revival of the Irish language as Deputy Flinn's speech.  I see no reason why we should not stand for laws which might be described by Deputy Dr. Hennessy as penal if the Irish language were in such a condition that such laws were necessary to bring it back.  I believe when the legal profession sets its back against this measure, which does not effect present solicitors, it is setting itself against the two big political Parties which are united on this issue and have been united always despite the opposition and the troubles of the last four or five years.  It has always been possible to get men of the most diverse <Col N="1339" /> political opinions to agree on that issue, and while they are capable of being united on that one issue, there is certainly hope for a national revival movement that will have as its basis a Gaelic-speaking Irish nation.</P>
    <P>Some remarks were made by Deputy Jasper Wolfe, my colleague from West Cork.  His speech was more correctly described by Deputy Davin as a little bit of laundry work which should be done outside this Dáil.  In the course of it he made great play of the fact that most of them believe that no good comes out of anything in the nature of force and that coercion has always done, and will always continue to do, harm.  I only wish that Deputy Wolfe, and those who believe with him, would carry these theories, which he expounded in the course of that statement, into practical effect by not supporting this idea that nothing good comes out of anything in the nature of force.  He is inconsistent, and those who believe with him are inconsistent, in that many things that they believe to be good came out of this idea of force.  This is a measure which the majority of the elected representatives of the people believe to be good for the country and for the future welfare of the children of the country, and yet he will not support it.  I hope this Bill will be passed by such a majority as will give to the opposition to it a death-blow in this part of the country anyway.  Remember that no later than a few weeks ago there was a meeting held in the City of Dublin in regard to the Gaeltacht. Some Deputy asked what was the urgency of the measure.  At that meeting the necessity was pointed out for some action to be taken if the Gaelic-speaking people were to be saved.  It was pointed out by one of the Deputies who spoke at the meeting that the Government had done all in their power to put the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission into force.  This is one way in which people in the Dáil can demonstrate, without any fear of contradiction, that they meant what they said when they ratified the Constitution <Col N="1340" /> of Saorstát Eireann, which in one of its Articles stated that the Irish language was the official language of the State.</P>

      <P>Certainly I will vote for that Bill if you introduce it.  That is one way in which Deputies, particularly the members of Cumann na nGaedheal, can demonstrate their support of the policy adopted, for instance, by the Minister for Local Government when he states that after a certain period secretaries to county councils in certain areas must possess a competent knowledge of Irish.  The legal professions are not going to be made the lambs on the altar of sacrifice.  The same policy is being applied in every department and every walk of life.  If the Bill which Deputy Hennessy envisages as the logical outcome of the passage of this Bill comes off, the same policy will be carried into effect in every walk of public life.  I hope this will be the forerunner of that Bill, and I shall certainly vote for the Bill, and I hope that Deputy Hennessy, even if he votes for it out of spite, will give it his support when it does come forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the passage of this Bill into law.  No case, in my opinion, has been made for it.  As I said on Second Reading, I consider it is tyrannical legislation which imposes an unnecessary disability on the legal profession.  It is, as some Deputies have said, legislation in a hurry.  I do not think there was ever a case in which the motto &ldquo;Hasten slowly&rdquo; was more necessary.  It is unnecessary interference in the settling of their curriculum by a professional body who ought to have control of their own curriculum. I have no doubt that it means the lowering of the standard of legal knowledge.  Deputy Conlon stated that Irish had been included in the programme of all the political organisations for many years past. I admit that, but I do not think that there ever was in the political programmes <Col N="1341" /> compulsory Irish, and it is only to the compulsory part of it that I have any objection.</P>
      <P>In my professional capacity I see people from all parts of the Free State, people of different shades of opinion and of different social status, and I can say quite honestly that I have not found amongst all these different classes of people any desire for this measure.  I believe that the present policy of compulsory Irish is not acceptable to the great majority of the people.  Unquestionably, this rushing of the matter is not going to produce the effect that its supporters hope for.  I want to say, at the same time, that while I meet people of all shades of opinion and varieties of social status who tell me that they are opposed to it, I have not found amongst them one single person who has any objection to the fostering or furthering of the Irish language.  As I stated before, I am one of those who believe that the study of Irish should be fostered and encouraged in every possible way, but I cannot agree to compulsion in the matter. On the other hand, I have to admit that while the public generally know something about the principle of compulsory Irish, they have not very much knowledge of this Bill. Therefore one would not expect very much criticism from them.  We do expect criticism from the people who are most severely hit or to whom the Bill is going to apply, and we have received the criticism of these people. The Incorporated Law Society, as we have heard, had a meeting to which 110 people took the trouble to come and record their opposition to the Bill, but no such number of people came to declare their adherence to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, my point is clear.  I understand it was a delegate meeting.  As I say, 110 people took the trouble to record their disapproval of the Bill, and that is surely a very much stronger argument than the fact that not one turned up to support the Bill.  This <Col N="1342" /> Society says that the Bill is not wanted either by the public or the legal profession.  We must surely give them some credit for knowing what they themselves want.  They say that it is oppressive and unworkable; that it must lead to inefficiency and that it should not be made compulsory.</P>
      <P>I think the most extraordinary statement was made by Deputy Flinn.  Believing these facts, as these solicitors did, Deputy Flinn would have them either hold their tongues or agree to the Bill.  He would not have these men coming forward and expressing their opinion, any more than he would allow me, if he could shut my mouth, to express my opinion now.  At all events, the opinion of the people intimately interested ought, in my opinion, be seriously considered.  I do not think it is fair for a body here, three-fourths of whom know nothing whatever about the Irish language, to make Irish compulsory as regards the legal profession. With regard to Deputy Flinn's statement, that those who are opposed to this measure are anti-Irish, one of the reasons I stood up was to repudiate that statement.  It is absolutely untrue and it is pure bunkum.  When people repeat a statement often enough they come to believe it, but that statement is not a statement of fact.  I do not think that I ever heard a more futile argument than that used by Deputy Flinn, when he said that because he himself had been unable to learn Irish, therefore other people should be compelled to learn it.  It is a comfort to know that his children are going to teach him.  It is said somewhere, I think it is in Holy Writ, that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings cometh wisdom. We are all very glad that Deputy Flinn is going to benefit by the instruction of his children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one of the most objectionable provisions in the Bill is that it places on the Chief Justice the right to determine whether or not the standard of Irish possessed by candidates is sufficient.  I think it would <Col N="1343" /> be a most deplorable condition of affairs to give either the Chancellor or the President of the National University or the Chancellor or the Provost of Trinity College the right to decide whether candidates in connection with any school, whether legal, medical or Divinity, have a sufficient knowledge of their subjects, and I hope, if the Dáil do not see their way to change this, that something will be done to prevent it.  Who knows whether the Chief Justice knows any Irish?</P>

The fact remains, as pointed out by Deputy Cooper, that on another occasion when a Chief Justice is being appointed it is quite possible that the Executive Council will have to take into consideration whether a man has a good knowledge of Irish or whether he has good legal knowledge. I would not for a moment put the two things on an equal footing. I am opposed to the Bill because it shows we are in far too great a hurry, and I think the Dáil would have been better advised to wait a little until a little more had been done.  I should like to reply to certain remarks made to-night, but I do not wish to enter into any contest about penal laws being established against those opposed to the Bill.  It is not a good way to talk when we can show that institutions with which we are connected have been doing work for the Irish language for hundreds of years while other people were doing nothing for it.</P>

I wonder if the Deputies who introduced this Bill think they have any real mandate from their constituencies to bring forward a measure of this kind.  I have no such mandate from my constituency, but rather the reverse.  I think if it were possible to have a general election fought on the one issue whether or not compulsion of this sort should be introduced into any profession, the anti-compulsionists would win.</P>

I am unable to understand why these particular Deputies have been able to generate in themselves the amount of feeling and even heat against the Bill that they appear to have generated.  I think the Bill is by no means a harsh Bill, and I do not think the passage of the Bill can be described as &ldquo;rushing the matter.&rdquo;  If it had been introduced three or four years ago, one might have said that there was some rushing, but, since early in 1922, we have had the policy of having Irish taught in the primary schools.  Then last year or so, Irish was made a compulsory subject of instruction in the secondary schools, and, consequently, nearly all the people likely to be affected by this Bill will have been taught Irish in school, and, if a reasonable standard is set in the entrance examination&mdash;a standard somewhat equivalent to the Leaving Certificate standard&mdash;a solicitor's apprentice, for instance, need really do no very arduous work in the way of improving his knowledge of Irish during his apprenticeship.  He will have five years, if not a University graduate &mdash;if he comes direct from school.</P>

If he starts that apprenticeship with <Col N="1345" /> a good foundation knowledge of Irish, such as he ought to have, in view of the schools programme now in operation, he would only require to give a quite reasonable amount of time to the study of Irish during his apprenticeship in order to obtain the standard set down in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies have said that there is no mandate for this Bill.  Of course, the Bill is a matter of detail.  It is not one of those matters of importance for which any Deputy could have a specific mandate.  Deputies can only say they have a mandate about something of major importance, some measure of very great importance. No Deputy can have a mandate for some matter of detail. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that most Deputies have a mandate to do what seems to be necessary to preserve and to foster the Irish language.  As has been stated, it has been on the programme of the great political parties for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when the National University was founded, undoubtedly the population of the country was in favour of making Irish compulsory at the matriculation examination. Much the same arguments that are being put up against this Bill were put up against making Irish compulsory in the matriculation examination of the National University, yet very clearly the country showed it was in favour of using such a measure of coercion as was involved in making Irish compulsory for matriculation.  For my part, I have not the slightest doubt, if this were an issue big enough to be put to the country, a verdict would be obtained, and very easily obtained, in favour of the Bill, and in favour of a more drastic Bill, and many more Bills of the same character than this.  I have not the slightest doubt that a big majority of the electors of the country would favour all reasonable measures for the preservation and restoration of the Irish language.  I think this is an eminently reasonable measure.  It is laid down in the Constitution that Irish is the national language.  It is <Col N="1346" /> provided that any person who desires to use the Irish language in the courts may do so.  We ought to make it easy for anybody, either in the Irish-speaking districts or outside, who cares to use Irish in the courts to do so.  We ought to see that the machinery in the courts is as quickly as possible adjusted to give full effect to the Article of the Constitution dealing with the Irish language. There are places where witnesses and litigants would be willing to use Irish, and where they cannot use it because, as was indicated in the Gaeltacht Commission's report, there are no lawyers able to conduct cases in Irish.  Some people have asked: &ldquo;What is the use of lawyers having Irish when the judges have not Irish?&rdquo; We will not have judges who will have Irish unless we begin by having lawyers who have Irish.  I think this matter, having been delayed until now, cannot be described as &ldquo;rushing&rdquo; or &ldquo;drastic.&rdquo;  It imposes no undue burden upon any student.</P>
    <P>If a student's parents had chosen to send him to an English school where he learned no Irish, of course, he may experience some difficulty. He may have to lose a year before he can take his final and qualify, but as far as the average boy, brought up in an Irish school with the programme that is in existence, is concerned, he should not have to lose a year.  I think, even if it were a fact that a considerable number of people had to lose a year before they could enter the profession, it would be necessary that a sacrifice should be made, as the position of Irish in the schools is being strengthened.  The teachers are becoming more competent in that matter.  Teachers who are better trained to give instruction in Irish and in subjects through Irish are entering the ranks of the profession.  With that development it will be soon quite easy for any boy who went through a secondary school here to pass the examination required by merely improving, by a moderate expenditure of time and <Col N="1347" /> energy, the knowledge of Irish he had in the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The Incorporated Law Society said it would be impossible to argue certain cases through the medium of Irish.  I do not agree with that at all.  I believe a person with a good knowledge of the Irish language can argue any case through it.  It may be that he would have to quote certain judgments that were delivered in English. It may be that he would have to use certain English words, just as now he sometimes uses some Latin or French words which have some technical meaning or which have been the subject of adjudication or judicial interpretation.  There is no reason, apart from the quotation of judgments or the use of occasional phrases in the same way as Latin and French phrases are used, why the arguments in any case should not be all conducted in the Irish language. I do not believe this thing is going to reduce the number of lawyers, the competence of lawyers, or their efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether a particular Chief Justice has or has not Irish is of no consequence.  I do not assume that any Chief Justice operating under the Bill would himself carry out an examination in the Irish language.  What a Chief Justice would do if he were not satisfied with the examination, conducted for instance by the Incorporated Law Society, is: He would appoint other examiners with whose standards he would be satisfied to conduct the examination for him.  I, for one, if a reasonable attitude had been taken by the Incorporated Law Society in connection with this Bill, would have been prepared to acquiesce in amendments in matters of detail.  I think the attitude that was actually taken up by the Incorporated Law Society was unjustified and unreasonable, and while I felt when this Bill was before the Dáil on Second Reading that it was a <Col N="1348" /> little difficult, at any rate, to defend the introduction of the Bill when the Incorporated Law Society had not been consulted, I feel, in view of the resolution which they subsequently passed, that really the neglect to consult them was something that could easily be overlooked, because consultation with them could not have resulted in anything useful at all.  Members of the legal profession are not really being singled out. People cannot enter the Civil Service now without having a knowledge of Irish, and the standard is being raised year by year.  It was a low standard to begin with; it has become higher, and it will, I presume, become still higher.  People cannot enter the teaching profession without a knowledge of Irish at present in this country, and I see no reason why any particular feeling should exist against those requirements in connection with lawyers.  I do not want to do more than to touch on the general policy in regard to Irish, but we cannot consider a Bill like this without having some regard to what is national policy.  It is perfectly true that the Irish language was driven out of the major part of the country and reduced to the position in which it now is by extreme official discrimination against it.  I think it is necessary, if it is to be preserved and restored, that there should be some reasonable measure of official support and encouragement for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary, if the Irish language is to be saved, that the learned professions and people in official positions&mdash;all whose habits are going to influence people, who are going to be looked up to, to some extent, as models of conduct and all that sort of thing&mdash;must not have the attitude of mind in relation to the language which almost everybody who is ignorant of it has.  My experience is that while a man who does not know Irish may frequently express very favourable opinions in regard to it and in regard to its preservation, when it comes down to practice he really is very hostile to any attempt to use it.  He dislikes <Col N="1349" /> people making speeches that he does not understand.  He dislikes even seeing advertisements and notices or documents which he does not understand. In practice, with the best will in the world, most people who do not know Irish are against its actual use.  They may be in favour of its preservation, theoretically, and perhaps very sincerely, but when it comes down to hard tacks the man who does not know Irish is nearly always out to kill it.  And if you do not see that the members of your learned professions and other people of influence in the future have some knowledge of Irish, their actual operations and influence on the community will be in favour of killing it.  I think this sort of Bill is consistent with the general policy that has had support in the country, beginning, if you like, with the movement to make Irish compulsory in the National University and coming on to the action that was taken to make it compulsory in the Civil Service.  It is consistent with the general policy.  It is very reasonable. It only applies to people who are under fifteen.  It gives them time, and I think it is absolutely necessary, if the expenditure in money and in energy on the preservation of the Irish language is not to be entirely wasted.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think the attitude taken by the Incorporated Law Society in regard to the Bill was unjustified and unreasonable.  But I feel quite satisfied when the Bill has been passed and has become an Act, as it will, that they will recognise their duty in the matter and will loyally do what they can to give effect to the enactment of the Oireachtas, both in the letter and in the spirit. If they do that, then I think nobody will want to interfere with them, and there will be no danger that the Chief Justice or anybody else will try to penalise anybody.</P>

      <P>If I had not intended to make any remarks on this stage of the Bill, I should have felt it my duty to do so after the various things that have been said for the last few days.  The Minister has deprecated the introduction of any heat into this discussion, and has wondered that there was any heat in it.  I hope I shall not speak in a heated way, but I think if he had heard some of the remarks that were made he would not have been surprised that Deputies spoke with heat and resented the charges and imputations that were made against them. One Deputy went so far as to say that the Government should have a policy, and should indicate to anyone who disapproved of it that they were going to carry it out and that he might say nothing but make up his mind to put up with it.  I do not think that muzzle policy will find favour with many Deputies in this Dáil.  I willingly admit that it has not found favour with the Government. The Government have, I gladly admit, patiently heard the views that the minorities, on various occasions, have thought it their duty to express.  They have been prepared to discuss the views held by these minorities, but that they should tell these minorities that they are not entitled to express their opinions is, I think, a new doctrine in this Dáil, and one that I hope will not be repeated. I protest against that, and I further protest most strongly, as my colleague, Deputy Sir James Craig did, against the imputation that opposition to this measure indicates an anti-Irish attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a general fallacy in the reasoning of various Deputies here that opposition to this method of fostering the Irish language must be anti-Irish. The confusion in thought is: It is one <Col N="1351" /> thing to foster the Irish language; it is quite another to approve of any method that may be suggested to foster that language.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is a strong, convincing weight of opinion throughout Southern Ireland in favour of compulsory Irish.  I deprecate the introduction of that general question into this particular Bill, which merely deals with candidates for the legal profession, but I do not think it is quite possible to separate the general policy from discussion on this Bill.  It has been said that there is a marked weight of opinion throughout Southern Ireland in favour of the fostering of Irish.  I might be prepared to admit that.  I would not oppose it, but when that statement is carried on to say there is a marked weight of opinion in favour of compulsory Irish I challenge it altogether.  I challenge the Minister's statement.  If a plebiscite were taken throughout Southern Ireland on the question of whether the country wanted compulsory Irish or not, I challenge the Minister's belief that there would be a majority of the country for it.  I go further.  I say the time will come, and come sooner than most people think, when this policy of compulsory Irish will be condemned.  It will be only the next generation that will bring condemnation on the Government for their part in the matter.  I ask those who wish to look at the matter calmly to consider what has been the effect up to the present of compulsory Irish.  I say it has given a smattering of Irish to most young people in Southern Ireland, and most of those who have got that smattering have forgotten most of it inside twelve months.  It has done more than that.  It has interfered with the standard of education that most of those children have had when they left school.  I do not think there is any question about it.  I say this Bill is suicidal for those who want to reintroduce the Irish language into this country.  It is suicidal to the Government themselves.  They are damaging themselves throughout the <Col N="1352" /> country.  They have brought here a united profession against them.  They have lost weight by the support they have given to this measure.  It is no use in saying that the meeting of the legal profession did not represent the whole legal profession throughout the country.  It did.  One delegate alone was authorised to speak and vote for 40 members of the legal profession.  I believe every county in the Irish Free State, except one, was represented at it, and that county sent a letter of the strongest kind, because it was not able to send a delegate.</P>
    <P>I say the Bill is suicidal from that point of view, but it is not from the political point of view that I want to discuss this matter at all.  I say it is suicidal from the point of view of those who want to encourage Irish.  It will bring rather hostility to the language than a love of it. The growth of Irish is like the growth of a delicate plant.  It will have to be nurtured carefully, and with wisdom.  If you try to force it you will kill it as you are doing now. If I were anti-Irish I would gloat over compulsory Irish and over this measure of forcing Irish as a compulsory language on the legal profession, because I honestly believe that the effect of this Bill, and of the compulsory Irish policy generally, will intensify feeling against Irish. I am not anti-Irish.  I did not oppose, and the University for which I stand has never opposed, the fostering of the Irish language.  Its methods have been different, and are different from the methods for which the great majority of this Dáil stand, but the majority of the Dáil in the vote they have given, do not represent the great weight of opinion throughout Southern Ireland, and if a plebiscite on that matter alone could be taken I believe the result of it would be very different from what the Minister for Finance believes.  The point of view from which I would prefer to criticise the measure would be the educational one.  I am bound to say that those who are bringing forward the Bill, to my mind, are asking an impossible <Col N="1353" /> task of those whom they wish to study for the legal profession.  The Bill, as it comes back to us from Committee, is changed in two ways.  One of those ways makes the Bill less drastic; the age has been reduced from sixteen to fifteen.  The other makes it much more drastic, because it states explicitly, what was left ambiguous in the Bill originally, what standard of Irish is required for members of the legal profession.  It is definitely to be a standard that will enable them to do a very difficult thing, to conduct a case in Irish.</P>
    <P>If the measure required a high standard of Irish for anyone who proposed to enter the legal profession, I could have said much less against it from the educational point of view than I could say now.  But it does not stop there.  It requires, in the period of the student's course, that he should devote himself not merely to what ought to be at that time his primary object&mdash;to make himself adept and fully qualified in legal matters.  To do that properly his whole time would be taken up in the years of his study, whether these years be three, four or five; they are not found at present to be one jot too much.  These years are really found to be too short for the student in order to develop the adequate and proper knowledge of legal matters which are to be attained.  But if, in addition to that, you are going to put upon the student who may have a moderate knowledge of Irish&mdash;a knowledge which he could have forgotten in twelve months&mdash;the task of improving his knowledge so as to enable him to use the language in working his cases in court afterwards, I say you are asking an utterly impossible thing.  If you require him to make himself efficient in legal matters when the time comes for him to enter the profession, you are making it utterly impossible for him by this compulsory Irish.  I know what it means when a young man tries to do two things together. The result is that he does both badly. If you insist on doing this, then you are taking steps to make the legal profession an indifferent profession <Col N="1354" /> later on, and I maintain that what you want most in the legal profession is a profession of eminent and well-qualified lawyers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he favoured and the country favoured all reasonable measures.  I quite agree.  Where he takes a big jump, and takes it in his stride, and does not see that there is any great argument required to pass from one stage to another, is when he says that this compulsory introduction of Irish is a reasonable measure.  That is where I differ from the Minister and where I believe that even at the present time and in a few years a great many more will differ from him fundamentally.  I regret this Bill very much.  It is a backward step instead of a forward one.  I think it will damage what those who introduced it desire most to encourage.  I think it will damage the status of the legal profession.  I think it will damage that profession even abroad and in Northern Ireland. I regret that, but I do not want to labour or stress the political side of the question at all.  I do stress that I consider it is regrettable that this sort of Bill should be brought in, that a measure of this kind should be brought forward which tends to sharpen rather than to slur over the line which at present separates us from those we would like to have with us.</P>

      <P>I listened with great regret to the speech delivered by the Minister for Finance.  It was an exceedingly unwise one to utter with regard to the great learned profession of the law.  The threat by the Minister for Finance, occupying a responsible position, is a threat that I must regret.  I believe, as some of the speakers in the course of this Bill have said, that this Bill, so far from developing or promulgating the interests of the Irish language, will do considerably more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was a guest at the Law Students' Society meeting some time ago.  He knows from his presence there what occurred as far as speaking the Irish language was concerned.  An <Col N="1355" /> address was delivered by the Chief Justice in Irish, and the Auditor read a paper at considerable length in the Irish language.  The mover and seconder of the address spoke at considerable length in the Irish language, and the Minister knew that as far as the spoken tongue was concerned in that particular Society there were plenty of Irish speakers. Those who are opposed to this Bill have asked: &ldquo;What is the need of the Bill?&rdquo; They have not been met with a satisfactory answer.  Anybody connected with the legal profession will tell you that not alone are there sufficient men to handle anything that may arise as far as dealing with legal matters in the Irish language in court is concerned, but that there is actually an overplus of these people existing in the higher and the lower professions of the law.  I have said before here that if anybody who desired to foster the language by means of the legal profession has got a brief to deliver, if he will only mark that brief, &ldquo;This is to be dealt with by an Irish speaker,&rdquo; there are plenty of speakers available to do all that is required.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that in his opinion there were not sufficient lawyers to conduct cases in Irish. Speaking with some little knowledge of the legal profession, I say that not alone are there sufficient lawyers but there is an overplus I assure you a very large section of them will have been done an immeasurable amount of good if the suggestion that I make to the House is carried out&mdash;that the briefs be sent to the Law Library marked &ldquo;Irish speakers only.&rdquo;  Some of them who do not get a great deal to do now would possibly become very busy.  No harm <Col N="1356" /> will arise if the Minister wants to test this particular fact for himself. I think the words quoted by Deputy Hennessy cover the whole situation &mdash;the words of Arthur Griffith.  He said that people would resent any knowledge of Irish as a test of patriotism.  What does the whole thing amount to?  It means that an undue preference is being given to those with a knowledge of the Irish language as against the majority of the people who have no knowledge whatever of it.  Is that not a test of patriotism?  Is that not a bribe for the propagation of Irish?</P>
    <P>Have we not sufficient confidence in the nation as a whole to believe that the people of the country will do things voluntarily that they will not do by compulsion?  How was it possible for this thing to be achieved in Wales?  Was there compulsion on the Welsh people?  I passed through Wales and I know that Wales was practically a bilingual country.  I met there men who were unable to converse with me in the English language. I found in the Welsh law courts that lawyers were not forced to practise in the Gaelic language, and I did not find them compelled to utilise Welsh for commercial purposes. Wales accomplished all this thing, and it dealt with the same apathy amongst the people and had the same difficulties as confront this nation.  We could easily deal with the situation in the Saorstát if we were content to wait for a little while.  As Deputy Sir James Craig says, we should progress slowly. I beg to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that acute congestion exists on the Eileen Dillon estate, Irishtown, Co. Mayo; that lands were acquired on the Churcher and Bourke estates for the relief of congestion on Dillon's estate, over five years ago, and are still let in grazing by the Irish Land Commission; if he will state when those lands will be divided, and when the Eileen Dillon estate tenants will be vested.</P>

      <P>The (late) Congested Districts Board resumed possession of a large holding on the estate of W.E. Churcher, C.D.B. 129, Mayo, for the relief of congestion, and the tenants on the Dillon estate at present <Col N="1254" /> occupy the lands under temporary agreements pending the Land Commission being in a position to make permanent allotments to them.  Owing to pressure of urgent work on other estates it is not possible to say when the Land Commission will be in a position to carry out the resale of the holdings on the Dillon estate, including the lands of Lisduff, on the W.E. Churcher estate.</P>
