      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the reasons for the suppression of last week's edition of &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; by members of the C.I.D. Force, the number of copies seized, and whether any compensation will be made to the proprietors for the loss sustained by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the weekly paper known as &ldquo;An Phoblacht,&rdquo; bearing date the 23rd February, was seized because it was generally treasonable, and in particular contained matter which amounted to the encouragement of the murder of jurors who carry out their duty.  The answer to the last part of the question is in the negative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>A newspaper is not a document.  Does the Minister take up the attitude that a police officer has the right to seize any newspaper and to prevent its publication by the subterfuge that it is a document? Freedom of the Press surely is allowable under Article 9 of your Constitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a further supplementary question.  Am I to take it that there is now a permanent prohibition of this newspaper? According to to-day's Press there has been a further raid and a seizure before the actual publication of the paper was made.</P>

      <P>This is a matter in which I have no power beyond that of sanction.  Under the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the School Attendance Act, 1926, the power to propose the appointment of a school attendance officer for the area mentioned rests with the School Attendance Committee, subject to the approval of the City Commissioners. Proposals satisfying these provisions have not come before me. When they do so, I will see that the matter is dealt with without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is now no station-master or other official on duty at stations on the Great Southern Railways on Sundays; that the stationmasters have instructions to leave the gates leading from the public roads open from Saturday night to Monday morning; that there is no protection against cattle, horses, etc., straying on to the line to the danger of the public travelling on this railway, and if he will make representations to the railway company in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Dolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that on some branches of the Great Southern Railway there are no Sunday trains and the stations are accordingly closed.  On some other branches, although there is a Sunday service, tickets are issued by a conductor on the trains and there is consequently no necessity for the station-master to be on duty.  To secure all possible <Col N="595" /> economies, having regard to the fact that many Sunday train services do not defray expenses, the gates are in such instances left open, but I have no reason to anticipate that danger is caused thereby to the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that on one of the lines which I mentioned, or to which I have referred in this question, there is a very good service of Sunday trains, that gates leading to the station in cases where these officials are not on duty are left open, and that cattle, horses, etc., do stray on the line and does he not consider that dangerous to the travelling public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Employment Exchange at Kinsale has been closed down for almost six months in consequence of the resignation of the manager, with the resulting inconvenience and delay to the large numbers of men on the register; if he is further aware that an examination to fill the post was held over four months ago, and if he will state the result, and take steps to expedite the re-opening of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the last branch manager at Kinsale gave notice of <Col N="596" /> his intention to resign from the service, an effort was made by the Department to find a successor.  The candidate who was selected as suitable for the post, however, withdrew his application, and as none of the other candidates at the time was considered suitable, the office was temporarily closed and the work transferred to the Employment Exchange at Cork.</P>
      <P>Another effort will probably be made at an early date to find a suitable branch manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind one candidate to whom the Parliamentary Secretary obviously refers as one who was not suitable for the post, and, according to the qualifications and the necessary knowledge desired in the candidates for this post, he certainly could fill the position. Will the Parliamentary Secretary state why the result of the examination was not circulated to the local Council which made the request to him in the matter, and will he give any undertaking as to when this position will be filled, as the delay in filling it is causing considerable inconvenience?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will state on what grounds Messrs.  Reilly Brothers, Fairgreen, Westport, Co. Mayo, were prosecuted and fined for being in possession of diseased sheep; whether he is aware that the defence of Messrs.  Reilly Brothers was that they had just bought the sheep from the stock manager of Lord Sligo, Westport House, Westport, Co. Mayo, and whether he will state if the Department intends to take proceedings against Lord Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm in question were prosecuted because fourteen in a lot of ninety lambs presented by them for shipment at Dublin Port on 6th July were found on examination by two of the Department's veterinary inspectors to be affected with sheep scab.  The inspectors were satisfied that the disease should have been detected if ordinary care had been used.</P>
      <P>The Department are aware that Messrs.  Reilly purchased the sheep from Lord Sligo's stock farm at Westport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the existence of sheep scab on the farm was reported on behalf of Lord Sligo to the Gárda Síochána in accordance with the Sheep Seab Order, proceedings do not lie against Lord Sligo. In cases of sheep scab only the owner or person in charge of the diseased <Col N="601" /> sheep can be made amenable.  No action lies against the previous owner unless he has diseased sheep actually in his possession, and has failed to report them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether this report was lodged with the Gárda before or after the sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been after the sale.  The sheep were presented at the Dublin port on 6th July, so obviously they were bought previously.  It was on 6th July that Lord Sligo reported that there was sheep scab amongst his flocks.  The veterinary surgeon who examined the flocks after that report found that the disease was in its initial stages.  Lord Sligo carried out the duty imposed on him by law.  The view of the Department is that a man does not handle sheep without detecting sheep scab if it is present. Messrs.  Reilly Brothers must have detected that these sheep had scab. The scab was obvious to anybody and could be readily detected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not equally obvious to the Minister that Lord Sligo's steward must have been aware of the fact that the sheep were diseased before the sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  The facts are that on 6th July Lord Sligo reported that there was sheep scab amongst his flocks.  That was the correct procedure, as far as he was concerned.  When the sheep were examined by the veterinary surgeon the scab was found there in its initial stages.  No prosecution within the law lay against Lord Sligo.  On the other hand, in the case of Messrs Reilly, the scab was detected in certain sheep leaving the Dublin port.  The procedure was to prosecute the owner in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these sheep were in the possession of Messrs.  Reilly only 24 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be; but the facts are that they broke the law; that they had in their possession, without reporting, sheep that were <Col N="602" /> suffering from scab.  They did not report that.  That was detected by the Department's Inspectors.  I have suggested to the Minister for Justice that the fines should be reduced very considerably, though I am not satisfied that Messrs.  Reilly did not know when buying the sheep that the sheep were suffering from scab.  I am not satisfied of that, and it is not clear to me that when they brought the sheep to Dublin and delivered them at the Dublin port they did not realise that the sheep were suffering from scab.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required in order to finish a transaction left to be finished under the Railways Act, 1924, that is to say, the absorption of what is called the colliery railways <Col N="605" />&mdash; Arigna, Wolfhill and Castlecomer. Under the Railways Act, 1924, it was provided that these three railways, which were constructed out of Government funds, were to be brought into the general scheme of absorption provided by that Act.  The terms were to be agreed upon as between the Government and the Great Southern Railways Company, or, in default of agreement, the matter was to be brought before the Railway Tribunal.  Terms have now been agreed upon, and the moneys are required to meet portion of the payments which are necessary under these terms.  These railways are not and cannot ever have been regarded as economic concerns, and the particular circumstances surrounding them brought about most of the difficulties that were experienced in arranging suitable terms of settlement. It has to be remembered that under Section 8 of the Railways Act it was provided that where there was a transfer to the amalgamated company of property belonging to any absorbed company all the circumstances had to be taken into account, particularly the value of the absorbed concern, on a revenue-earning basis. The second thing to be looked to was the value of the new concern as a component part of the larger undertaking. As these were obviously the terms on which the Railway Tribunal would view the circumstances afterwards, they were also the two points which had to be adverted to when terms were being negotiated between the Department and the railway company. Under the circumstances, it is considered that a good bargain has been struck &mdash; a bargain that is fair and reasonable both to the Government and to the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The property will have to be leased under the State Lands Act, 1924, in accordance with a schedule, the particulars of which have been laid before the House.  The leasing terms and the other terms agreed upon are: (1) Whatever lands and buildings constitute the three undertakings of the Castlecomer, Wolfhill and Arigna railways are to be leased to the company for the full term of 99 years at a nominal rent.  (2) The <Col N="606" /> Government agrees to settle all outstanding land claims and to indemnify the company against any liability in this connection.  The estimate of outstanding liability is put down at about £1,000, the money for which is not being found on this Vote, but under the ordinary railway Vote which I present from year to year.  (3) If at any time any part or the whole of the lines has to be closed and the material recovered is scrapped, the value of the material so recovered is to become the property of the railway company.  (4) If the railways have to be abandoned, or any part of them, there is to be provision made for obviating any claim in respect of the non-maintenance of the railway fences and drains, and there is to be attention paid to certain drains.  We have agreed to indemnify the company to the extent of one-half against such claims.  That liability has been commuted by the company for a payment of £3,000, and it is really to meet that figure that this Estimate is required.  The whole of it will not fall for payment at once.  (5) The company, on the other side, are to abandon the restoration of the double line which was projected between Cherryville Junction and Athy, and in consideration of this they are to withdraw the contingent claims they have against the Government for payment of compensation in that connection.  Again the sum was difficult to arrive at. There already has been an item litigated in another court which amounts to a sum of £4,000, and an estimate has been made of the compensation that might fall to be paid in a certain contingency, and the amount that is set down is £16,000.  Both these items &mdash; the restoration of the line and the item arising out of contingent claims are being abandoned by the company in consideration of this.</P>
    <P>These three lines were built out of Government funds, the cost of them, approximately, being &mdash; Arigna Line, £60,000; Wolfhill, £125,000; Castlecomer, £160,000.  They have been worked by the railway company for the Government on the ordinary cost <Col N="607" /> basis.  That is to say they worked them and we met any deficiencies that might arise.  There has not been, except in one small period, any profit.  The experience in connection with these railways has been very disappointing.  The lines were constructed for coal traffic, and that traffic absolutely failed to justify the construction of the railways.  The Wolfhill pit has been closed for some time.  The only use there has been made of the Wolfhill line since then is that a certain bank has been built at Ballylinan station for the loading of sugar beet in connection with the sugar beet factory, and a certain small traffic has developed on the line which runs about four miles from Athy.  The rates for the traffic are at a very low level, and the receipts accruing to the Wolfhill railway have been very small, and in fact fall short of the cost of keeping open even that section of the line.</P>
    <P>The Arigna coal carryings are also very small and fail to give any return on the line.  The only coalcarrying which has originated on the Arigna line has been on a small section from Derrinavoggy junction, which is about one and a half miles from Arigna station.  The traffic from the Arigna mining company's pit does not justify the expenditure of the large sum of money which was asked for at one time and which would have been necessary to put the line into proper working order. There could have been no receipts looked for from which there would be any return.</P>
    <P>There is a fair volume of traffic on the Castlecomer railway, but even there the receipts have not been sufficient to meet the working expenses. The Arigna railway showed in the year of the British coal strike a profit of £67; otherwise it has been run at a loss since 1925.  Wolfhill railway was run at a considerable loss.  The Castlecomer railway in 1925 and 1926 had a net loss of about £2,000 in each year.  The loss has since gone down a bit; it was roughly <Col N="608" /> £700 in 1927, and it is likely to run to about £1,000 in 1928.</P>
    <P>The other point that has to be adverted to is that when the railways were built first-class material was not to be had, and the railways were built from poor material.  The sleepers particularly were very poor. The result is that if the lines are to be kept open for any length of time, the losses that have been incurred to date on the working will be very considerably increased, because there will be considerable maintenance required on the lines.  It is considered, therefore, that in cutting the losses on these three lines and making the bargain that has been made, there has been what I can only describe as a fair bargain.  There was no inclination to drive a desperately hard bargain with the railway company in their position, seeing that the baronially guaranteed lines had been already taken over.  It is a settlement which is understood to be acceptable to the Railway Company. It is certainly acceptable on our side.</P>

I mention two items in that; the item that has been litigated elsewhere, amounting to £4,000, the responsibility for which has not yet been fixed, but it would pretty necessarily fall upon us.  There is a further contingent liability of about £16,000.  These two are being waived.</P>

      <P>This Estimate arises because it was expected that the clerical staff of the Patent Office would have been reduced earlier than it has been found possible to do so.  The staff had been swollen to a strength beyond the requirements of the Office working at normal time.  It was swollen because there was a tremendous number of claims registered.  It has not been found possible to reduce the staff on that account, but the retention of the staff has resulted in the earning of considerably more fees, as the amount of work done was more than anticipated.  By keeping these people on the additional work has been done, and we anticipate that it will bring in the current year £5,000 more than expected.</P>

A tremendous number of claims were registered simply for the sake of priority.  These were piling up, and a tremendous lot of work had to be got through.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,748 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for Expenses connected with the Purchase of Fuel during the Coal Emergency, 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the end of the transactions in connection with the purchase of coal which had to be undertaken to meet the emergency which arose.  This particular sum arises out of an action in which a decision was given against the firm. It is considered that we have, at least, a moral liability towards the Coal Merchants' Association.  There were various cargoes of coal of different varieties and at different prices coming in at the time.  One cargo was offered of 2,000 tons of Czecho-Slovakian screened coal.  It was believed to be black and, added to the belief, was the fact that the firm had a report from an inspector at the port of shipment that it was black coal.  The price quoted at the <Col N="614" /> time at which the purchase was negotiated was higher than the price quoted for brown coal, but less than that asked for black coal.  We drew attention to this at the time, as it seemed to cast some suspicion on the quality of the coal, but we were advised that the lower price, as compared with other black cargoes offering at the time, was due to the fact that deliveries were offered at a later date.  We believed that the cargo was black and agreed it should be ordered on the basis of the arrangement made with the Coal Merchants' Association.  When the cargo arrived the coal was found to be brown and not black, and the firm refused to accept delivery.  The firm was sued for the contract price and were advised that they were not liable to accept the cargo.  They defended the action, and there is no doubt that they were properly advised in defending it.</P>
      <P>Litigation on similar points was entered into in England and Northern Ireland with different results from those given here.  The courts here found that the firm was not entitled to reject the cargo, and had to pay full payment for it and for the incidental costs such as demurrage and so forth.  Under an arrangement made previously, as between the Government and the Coal Merchants' Association, a particular firm acting as agents for that association was entitled to be indemnified by the merchants.  As the cargo was not taken up by them, the merchants were entitled to be indemnified by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point might be made that the Department could have fought out the case as against the firm or association, but in fact the arrangement, although it did not cover in detail such a point as this, was drawn on such lines that there was a moral obligation on the Government, not exactly to indemnify but to help the firm and the Association to pay the costs of such transaction.  The largest amount of money has gone in legal expenses.  The firm was advised, as we were, that there was a good case to defend.  The fact that similar cases were defended successfully in <Col N="615" /> the courts in Northern Ireland and England was a justification for the firm going on.  Once the verdict was given, the only point was whether there should be an appeal, but as that would mean piling up additional costs we were advised that no further legal action should be taken. We are meeting part of the amount. The full claim of the firm amounted to £16,121 18s. 11d.  We are meeting that to the extent of two-thirds of the final claim.  The details are made up of separate items &mdash; for freight, landing charges, and for the expenses of the action in regard to the coal.  The expenses of the action are in excess of any of the other items. Covering all the series of transactions in connection with the coal emergency, excluding this particular case, the expenditure to date was £91,460.  Including this case, the total expenditure runs nearly to £111,000, as against which there were receipts to the Exchequer amounting to £52,000.  The net cost to the State, therefore, for providing coal in that emergency was, if this item were taken into account, about £58,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, two thousand tons &mdash; £5 per ton.  I understood the Minister to say 200 tons of coal, but even at that figure it is dearly-bought coal.  If it has the effect of teaching the Ministry anything about a little foresight in dealing with matters of this kind, even in emergencies, probably the money will not be lost for all time.  It does seem strange that while, as the Minister says, similar actions were tried in England and in the North of Ireland, different decisions were given in the courts in these other States from those which were given here. Here legal contracts entered into with the owners of that coal in Czecho-Slovakia or elsewhere by those acting on behalf of the Minister were so incompetently drawn, that in our own courts here it was decided that the Ministry, and eventually the ratepayers, would have to pay the legal charges, although I think the Minister said that the coal supply was not up to the agreed standard. Somebody suggested to me, but I certainly would not be in favour of it, and I wonder if the Minister considered it, that seeing that a verdict, more friendly to the buyers of the coal, was given in the Northern courts and in the English courts, the Minister might consider taking the question to the English Privy Council to see if he could get that body, to which the Government have gone more than once before looking for judgment in their favour, would give a decision in his favour and so save money.  However, even at the expense of losing this amount to the ratepayers here, whatever it is, I would not favour that course.  The coal was got, and whatever became of it, the money was expended, and let us hope that the lesson will be remembered.</P>

    <P>With regard to the next item. Colonel Fitzmaurice was presented with a motor car in the United States after his flight.  The two German airmen who participated in the flight <Col N="618" /> were also presented with motor cars.  In their case no difficulty arose about the admission of the cars into their own country. Colonel Fitzmaurice at the time was &mdash; for various reasons, the expenses in connection with the trip, and all that &mdash; unwilling, and, as he said, unable to pay the amount of the duty that was required on the car.  We thought, in view of the credit that had been reflected on the country by Colonel Fitzmaurice's participation in the flight, that it was only fair that this car should be allowed in free of duty and that we should not have a position under which it would possibly be returned to America, so that the duty was paid.  In connection with the sum of £80 odd for the funeral of the late Vice-President, the items are made up of payments by the Department of Defence for the purchase of crepe and black linen, £32; to the Department of Justice, which incurred expenses to the extent of £17 for postage in connection with the funeral &mdash; for the Mass and the postage of cards for it; and the Stationery Office, for printing in connection with the funeral, incurred a bill of £30.

But at the moment, as the matter is an invention and under a certain type of patent protection, and as the development of it is still proceeding, I do not intend to say any more, and I have simply to put this to the Dáil in good faith at the moment.

If it is only what one might call an industrial speculation, I do not think that is a matter for the Government to indulge in.  If we are asked to pass this Estimate we are asked to approve of the Government indulging in an ordinary speculation.  If this thing is something of a national character there may be some justification for it, but before we are asked to approve of this Estimate we want something more definite in the way of information than we have had from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The whole thing is unsatisfactory from the point of view of ordinary Parliamentary procedure because I cannot give details, and nobody who had thought the <Col N="622" /> invention of sufficient importance to ask the State to put money into it would jeopardise the chances of it becoming a success by giving details. I will not be escaping, because if the matter is a failure, or even whether it is a failure or not, it will be criticised &mdash; at least my unwisdom in asking the State to bear the bulk of the burden of getting this developed and trying to bring it to the process of manufacture will be criticised, and I will have to stand over it afterwards. I do not escape by getting this Vote passed.  I simply ask Deputies to give me this £5,000 in good faith.  I believe that the thing is of value.  I have had it scientifically tested.  Work has been going on for more than six months, and there should be some fruits from it soon. But, again, with all the best wishes in the world to give the Dáil information as early as possible, I would not jeopardise the thing by coming to the Dáil with information until I thought that it had been completely protected and when information could be given about the working of it.</P>

Would it not be better for the Minister to get permission from the House to go on with this particular transaction, or have embodied in the Bill what would cover this transaction, because a precedent is established by this, and the Bill is being introduced to give the Minister power to continue like activities? There may be every reason for the Minister's action and for the Minister's secrecy; but at least we should get some assurance that nothing further will be gone into in the same way until the result of this is known.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputies to pause before they ask for such a guarantee.  Supposing there were inventors in this country whom we could help, under the Bill that is to be brought before the House shortly a Vote will be taken year by year. What more security have Deputies <Col N="623" /> than simply to limit the Vote?  They could say: &ldquo;We will give you £20,000 for the purpose of people with inventions.&rdquo;  The thing is so extraordinary that it would be better not to have Votes put down year by year for such purposes.  Do Deputies mean that before giving money to any inventor I should come to the House and say: &ldquo;I am going into this,&rdquo; and what more would they get than a statement from me, or from anybody in my position, that the thing is going to be done?</P>
      <P>An invention of this nature cannot be revealed.  If there is any value at all in it there has to be secrecy in order to secure protection for it.  You cannot fit in this type of thing with the ordinary Parliamentary procedure.  The amount of money is inconsiderable if any good is to come out of the invention at all. It is absolutely inconsiderable.  The Deputy is afraid that some Minister is going to be seized with the idea of benefiting inventors and to contribute to inventors, or those who think themselves inventors &mdash; and they are very numerous &mdash; and it may be that somebody would go along lavishing money, hoping to pay it back to the Contingency Fund afterwards.  The Contingency Fund is a small fund&mdash; £20,000 &mdash; and there is at any rate that bridle.  I should say that one of the hopes I have from this particular invention, if it works out to be a success and if there are profits accruing to the State from it, would be to see a big amount of whatever comes from it to the State set aside to help other inventors.  I would like to see an industrial and scientific research body established out of the proceeds to bring along other inventors.  I simply have to ask the Dáil to take this in good faith, and I will present myself for their castigation or for their praise hereafter when the thing works out.</P>

      <P>I move: Section 1, lines 29-30, &ldquo;that the words and figures &lsquo;30th day of September, 1930,&rsquo; be deleted and that the words and figures &lsquo;31st day of March, 1930,&rsquo; be substituted,&rdquo; and the same in Section 2.  To our minds there has been quite enough time to enable the Department to have examined the Report of the Greater Dublin Commission, and to have come to a decision as to what policy they wish to lay before this House for the reconstitution of the local governing authorities in Dublin City and County.  We made a protest here before when a similar Bill was before the House, urging that it was an unfair and an improper practice for the Government to insist that the charge of local affairs in Dublin City should be kept out of the hands of the citizens.  We do not want to tire the House by going over these arguments again and again, but we take a serious view of the matter, and we certainly think it is not creditable, either to this House, to the city of Dublin, or to the Department concerned, that they could not have considered the matter, even agreeing, as we do, that it is a serious one, involving various types of opinion that have to be taken into consideration, including engineering, financial and general local government opinion, questions of public health, poor law and other matters <Col N="626" /> that are of very great importance. Nevertheless, having experts at the disposal of the Department, and having them presumably in sufficient numbers to give consideration to these professional and important matters, we believe that twelve months' consideration ought to have been sufficient to enable the Department and the Minister, with the advice of his officials, to have come to a decision with regard to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Municipal Council of Dublin has now, for close on almost five years, been suppressed, and an irresponsible body &mdash; I will not say any more than that about them now&mdash; three gentlemen called Commissioners are put in charge.  They have no responsibility to the citizens of Dublin, except so far as some may claim that they are responsible to the Local Government Department, to the Minister, and the Minister is responsible to this House.  That kind of responsibility is very involved, and it deprives the citizens of direct touch with the Municipal Council, with those who collect their rates and spend them.  Even though the administration of the Commissioners were eminently satisfactory &mdash; and I claim it has not been, but we are not going to go into that now &mdash; still it would be, to my thinking, an injustice to the City that the regime of those gentlemen should be continued. We believe that it is the right of the City to have its own elected Government; that it is improper and unjust to the ratepayers to have their Municipal Council suppressed, and to have that suppression continued for such a long period.  Now it is proposed to continue it for another year and a half.  We protest against this prolonged continuance of the suppression of the Municipal Council.  We believe the time the Government had for the consideration of this matter, and the time that will be given up to the 31st March, that is thirteen months more, for further consideration and the passing of legislation will be ample to secure all the further consideration that the legislation may require, and that all the advice that can be got from the experts <Col N="627" /> will be in the hands of the Minister to enable him to make up his mind by that time.</P>

      <P>Both the Deputy, his colleagues, and the other members of the Oireachtas would find it impossible to agree to accept this amendment if they fully appreciated what was involved in it. Not only the citizens of Dublin, and every particular class of rights involved on their part by having Commissioners in charge of the City's affairs at the present moment, but the citizens of the seven urban districts in the County of Dublin, and the people in the County of Dublin themselves, are involved in this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained yesterday the circumstances in which we dealt with the settlement of the government of Cork before dealing with the Dublin problem, in spite of the fact that in November, 1927, I thought we should deal with Dublin first.  Deputies will remember that the discussion that took place over the Cork Bill involved the keeping of the Cork Bill in the Oireachtas from about the 22nd June till the 23rd February.  It took the Cork Bill practically eight months to pass through the Oireachtas. I told Deputies, arising out of what was involved in the Dublin measure, that it would be impossible to put before the Oireachtas proposals in respect of Dublin City and County earlier than perhaps to have the First Reading of the Bill before the Summer Recess in order that the Bill might be in the hands of Deputies for a fairly long period, so that the subsequent stages of the Bill might be dealt with in the Dáil during the following Autumn Session. There are principles in the measure that will involve very considerable discussion, and it may reasonably be expected, particularly in view of our experience of the Cork Bill, that the measure will not pass out of the Dáil, say, before Christmas of this year.  The Seanad would require a substantial period in the earlier part of the year to deal with the Bill from its particular point of view. <Col N="628" /> Assuming even it were possible to get a First Reading of the Bill on the 1st July, if we keep the analogy of the Cork Bill in mind it might easily happen that the measure would not pass out of the Oireachtas earlier than some time at the end of February or of March.</P>
    <P>I would have been in a rather awkward position, from a statutory point of view, if I had not got the Cork Bill as early as I did, because as the previous law stands in the matter, it would be necessary if I had not got it before, say, the second week in March to have established a Cork Corporation on the old lines. If we insert this amendment in this Bill it will be necessary to have the Dublin Bill passed completely through the Oireachtas before Christmas, and even assuming that was done, you have a period in which you would have to have elections for a certain number of public bodies in Dublin, and you would then have, with very sweeping changes, new bodies up against a very difficult financial and administrative position, to which they would have to give attention straight away. In respect to county councils and county boroughs the 1st March is a very important date.  The adoption of the Estimates has to take place before that date in respect to urban districts, of which there are seven to be considered in connection with the Dublin Bill.  The 31st March is a critical date.  The adoption of urban estimates has to take place on that particular date.  I cannot possibly see a measure as important as the measure that will arise out of the Greater Dublin Commission Report, in the first place, being put before the Oireachtas and passing through it in such time as would give local representatives a fair chance of facing the problems that would arise in the new bodies on the 1st March.</P>
    <P>I see the possibility of the legislation arising out of the Greater Dublin Commission Report being put through the Oireachtas, say, before the end of June next, and the elections for those different bodies taking place perhaps, at any rate before <Col N="629" /> the end of September, and these new Councils given an opportunity of surveying the new state of affairs&mdash; financial and otherwise &mdash; presented to them in such time as to deal effectively and satisfactorily with the financial business that would arise to them either on the 1st March or on the 31st March.  In fairness and in justice both to the citizens of Dublin and the residents in County Dublin, and in fairness to the Oireachtas here, we will require to give very serious consideration to this legislation. I have again to urge that the acceptance of this amendment for the 31st March would be unfair, unjust and most impracticable.</P>

      <P>If we are to judge by the Minister's remarks it appears that the Greater Dublin Commission, having been set up in 1925 and having reported in 1926, and its Report having been pigeon-holed for two years, during which the Executive Council made up its mind to reject every principle of City management in respect of which it made recommendations, and the recommendations having been pigeon-holed again for the purpose of getting these principles examined, it is still impossible for a Bill dealing with the future management of Dublin City to be introduced and passed through this Dáil within thirteen months from to-day. That is what the Minister said, and he takes as an example of that the progress of the Cork City Management Bill.  For eight months, he stated, that Bill was before the Oireachtas, during five of which, I would remind the Minister, the Dáil was not sitting, because the Executive Council, in spite of Deputies on this side, persisted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He talked of the delay, not <Col N="630" /> only here, but also in the Seanad.  It was exactly two days in the Seanad, and was disposed of in two days.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Certain suggestions, some of which the Minister ultimately accepted, were argued here for hours before we could get the Minister to appreciate that we were attempting to improve the Bill and not trying to play ducks and drakes with it.  A number of these amendments were finally accepted after days had been wasted discussing them.  If the Executive Council are not trying to hoodwink the citizens of Dublin in this connection, they must have already made up their minds as to the general principles to be embodied in the Bill.  According to the Minister yesterday, the actual heads of the Bill have not yet been sent to the draftsman. It is to be presumed that in his Department there is some general understanding as to what the main outlines of the Bill will be.  If the Bill were given to the Government draftsman it could be introduced. The First Reading is purely a formal matter.  Its Second Reading could be taken before the Summer Recess, and it could easily be passed through the Dáil in the autumn.  It could <Col N="631" /> reach the Seanad before Christmas. If they give it the same consideration as they gave the Cork Bill, it will be out of the Seanad before Christmas, and there is nothing whatever to prevent the Greater Dublin Council being set up and an election for it being held before the 31st March.  In any case we think it is advisable that Deputies should put that limit on the Government in this connection in order to make them move a little faster in the matter than they have been moving heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned one or two things that I think should be dealt with.  He apparently foresees the possibility of members of the Councils now existing in the areas which will be included in the Greater Dublin Council making representations to the Minister and members of the Dáil when the Bill comes before the House.  He foresees also that there may be some compromise arrangement made with the members of this Council under the Bill.  I would like to remind the Minister if he contemplates that such a development will take place, if he intends to encourage it, that he is placing the citizens of the city in a very unfair position in so far as they will not have any elected representatives to speak on their behalf, and will not be organised to make representations to protect their interests wherever their interests come in conflict with the interests of the other Councils.  The Minister, of course, appears to be of opinion that the persons who will succeed in getting elected to the new Council will be babies in all matters concerning city government, and will require at least six months careful coaching by the city manager or the officials in their employ before they will find themselves expert enough to prepare an estimate for the year.  I think we can assure the Minister that it is not at all unlikely that there will be elected to the Dublin City Council a number of persons with at least as much experience in Local Government matters as the Minister himself possesses, or even President Cosgrave possesses.  The argument <Col N="632" /> that September is a much more suitable period during which to set up a Council than March is, I think, one that has no weight behind it.  On the contrary, it is my opinion that it is at the beginning of the financial year that the new Council should begin to operate, having placed upon it from the outset the full onus of conducting the affairs of the city efficiently and economically.</P>
    <P>In view of all these arguments, I think there is a strong case for the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kelly.  The eighteen months over which the Minister proposes to extend the term of office of the Commissioners is, in our opinion, altogether too long.  Even thirteen months is long, but it is not unreasonable, and if the Minister will accept the amendment we can promise him, if he is prepared to do the same thing, we will facilitate him in every way in getting the Bill, if it is a good Bill, through the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I had nothing in mind with regard to representations from members of other bodies outside the city, nor had I anything in mind with regard to the capacity or otherwise of the members who may be elected to the City Council.  But I have this in mind, to make a complete financial change over as between a different set of local areas in the city and county, and to make the time at which that should take place exactly coincident with the time of changing the persons and the areas of the local bodies is, I think, most undesirable.  It is for that reason that the 31st March is very unacceptable.  Even if, as the Deputy suggests, it were possible to get the Bill through before Christmas of this year, I think it would be almost impossible, and certainly most undesirable, that elections should be rushed immediately after Christmas, and that the change over and the disentangling of finance should coincide almost exactly with the setting up of the new Council and areas.</P>

      <P>The position in Cork is entirely different.  In Dublin there are several areas; there are seven urban district councils, five rural district areas, the Dublin Municipal Borough and the Poor Law Union in Dublin.  You have the control of these areas, with all their different liabilities in the matter of loans and all their differences with regard to matters of rating.  In Cork you have one area, with financial liabilities arising out of the past quite undisturbed.  I think Deputies will understand that it was a matter of concern to me as to whether we were not likely to put the new Cork Council into a difficult position by having them elected almost immediately, when they would have to face the striking of the rate immediately after they were elected.  I gave the matter considerable consideration. The striking of the rate <Col N="634" /> in Cork, as a matter of fact, will have to be postponed for a short time in order to enable it to be struck by the new council.  I think it would be misunderstood if we postponed the elections and allowed the Commissioner in Cork to strike the rate, and then had the election, say, in a month or two after the striking of the rate.  My concern in the matter was entirely to have things satisfactory and easy, and not to make their responsibilities or difficulties too great for the new council. That applies to Cork where, as I have said, the position is of the utmost simplicity as compared with the position that arises in the county and the city of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not talk about apprenticeship at all.  My attitude is that it is undesirable that new councils over new areas of jurisdiction would come in at a date that coincided with the striking of a new rate.  The reason for that is, that they would be asked to strike a new rate in respect of changed areas and changed circumstances immediately after they came in.  The position with regard to the Bill is, that I anticipate that in March, 1930, the present councils, and in the city, the present Commissioners, would strike the rate for the following year, and that in September the new councils would come in over the new areas; that under their guidance, and during the subsequent six months or so, the change over with regard to finance and all that would take place, and that before they would be called upon to consider estimates and the striking of a rate for their new areas of jurisdiction, they would have had six months' experience of their new areas and their new position; that they would have been there while the financial change from one system of rating to another was being made, and while the financial arrangements that are inevitably involved in changing from one set of local bodies and local jurisdiction to a different set was being superimposed over the same county area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What would happen is, assuming that the election for the new areas takes place <Col N="637" /> on the 3rd September, 1930, and the present local bodies will disappear and their places will be taken by the new councils set up over the new areas of jurisdiction, the Department, instead of dealing as up to whatever date in September it is that the present councils over their present areas, will, from the date of the change, deal with the new councils over the new areas of jurisdiction. I do not understand what other type of consultation with local bodies Deputy Lemass referred to originally, or Deputy Briscoe refers to now.</P>

      <P>I will try to explain myself to the Minister.  When he will be considering the Greater Dublin scheme he will be in consultation with the representatives of certain areas outside the city proper for the purpose of bringing certain areas under the Greater Dublin scheme. If that is the case, certain bargains or arrangements will be arrived at arising out of consultations.  Dublin city during that time should have some sort of representation in connection with the Minister's Department apart from the Commissioners, for the view I have, and the view that is generally accepted by the people of Dublin, is that while the Commissioners represent the city of Dublin they are actually under the control of the Department of Local Government.  In the bringing about of this change over, would the Minister consider giving representation to certain sections of the city for the purpose of consultation and discussing matters for the benefit afterwards of the smooth running of the Greater Dublin scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not accept it as necessarily arising at all that in the framing of the legislation that will be put before the Oireachtas there will be any direct consultation either between myself or the Department and representatives of either urban councils or representatives of the county council area of the city. Even if there were, the proposals that would come before the Oireachtas would have to pass the gauntlet of the Deputies and Senators.  If any <Col N="638" /> points arise that might call for consultation, I would be very glad to consult with the Deputies who represent Dublin City as regards matters of any special interest to the city that may be involved in such negotiations or bargains.  I had not thought of bargains at all until the question arose this evening.</P>

      <P>I did not want to suggest when I used the word bargains that anything done would not be in the interests of the city, but I believe there might be discussions with citizens of Dublin who might feel that something of theirs was being given away, and that such consultations would be of advantage when the striking of the rate arose. The Minister stated that he would be prepared to meet representatives of the City of Dublin to discuss points that might arise.  Deputies of the City of Dublin, as the Minister is aware, are not in the position of representatives of rural and urban areas who come in direct contact with Councillors, who also are in contact with officials in their areas.  Representatives of Dublin are not in direct contact with officials of Dublin City. I feel that the officials of the City of Dublin are of the type that would have the interests of the city at heart, and if they were brought in contact with people who might not be Councillors, but who would be able to discuss with them on matters concerning the best interests of the city, it would be far better eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular pest aimed at is the Colorado Beetle.  It is an insect that attacks potatoes.  It originated, I think, in America, and has now spread to France, and has become practically endemic in France.  There is very little hope that the operations of this insect will be controlled in France.  France is <Col N="640" /> very close to this country, and we think it essential to arm ourselves with the necessary powers to deal with any situation that might arise if, in seed potatoes, packing or in any other way, this particular pest arrived from France and made its appearance in our potato crops.</P>
      <P>In Section 3 the Bill provides that an authorised officer of the Department of Agriculture may enter the land of any grower, inspect his potatoes, and if it is found that the potatoes are infected with this particular disease, he may destroy the crop. Section 4 provides that compensation may be paid by the Department of Agriculture.  The amount is not specified, but compensation may be paid to the full amount.  Section 5 provides that a prosecution for any failure to obey an order or any other regulation made may be instituted at any time within twelve months from the day on which the alleged offence was committed.  The point about that is that this Bill is really an amending Bill.  Indeed, that applies to every other measure.  This is not the first Bill dealing with potatoes and the protection of potatoes and crops generally.  Under a previous Act the prosecution had to be instituted within six months.  In fact, in a great many cases the offence could be committed in planting a particular crop, such as non-immune varieties, potatoes affected with this disease.  It is often quite impossible to verify that the potatoes have the disease until they grow.  As the law stands, the prosecution must be instituted within six months.  It may be found after nine months that non-immune varieties or varieties infected by this particular insect or any other potato disease had been planted, but under the law it would be too late to prosecute. The period is now extended to twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the spraying of potatoes, in the event of a spraying notice being served on any owner to spray his potatoes for the protection of the crops.  If in a district the potatoes of a farmer were found to be infected with this disease, and it was considered necessary <Col N="641" /> as a precautionary measure to compel that man's neighbours to spray potatoes so as to protect them from the disease, a notice could be served.  The farmers might fail to obey that notice, and the officers of the Department could then order the spraying of the crop and charge the cost to the farmers in question.</P>
    <P>This disease spreads very rapidly. It has got such a hold in France that it is almost impossible at this stage to stop it.  We feel that prevention is better than cure, and if the disease appears we think it is much better to wipe it out, either by destroying the crops or spraying in the case of crops likely to become affected because of their location&mdash;their nearness to infected crops.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that expenses up to £1,000 may be paid by the Department without the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  A certain emergency may arise, and it may be necessary to destroy the crop or ask the farmer to destroy it and promise him compensation on the spot.  The Department will have a fund up to £1,000 to play with without sanction.</P>
    <P>This is a short, but it may be a very important, Bill.  If we never passed it, the Colorado beetle might never arrive in this country.  I think it is in England at the moment.  The situation, however, has become quite serious.  The pest is in France, and we feel we should be prepared to meet any emergency.  We are developing a rather important potato trade. We now import no potatoes.  We have considerable exports.  We do not even import seed potatoes, and we are developing the seed potato trade.  The prospects for the development of the potato trade are rather promising, and we are in a specially favourable position as compared with Northern Ireland and England.  We have practically no black scab in the Free State, with the exception of parts of County Louth and Donegal, whereas black scab is all over the Northern area, having regard to the area under potatoes.  It is also prevalent in England.  We should try to maintain our position, the particularly favourable position we have <Col N="642" /> got.  There is practically no disease either by way of black scab or any other diseases that attack potatoes. In this Bill we are endeavouring to take precautions against the introduction of a disease quite close to our shores now.  It is highly infectious and spreads very rapidly.  If it once gets a hold it is almost impossible to control it or to eradicate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks referred to powers in the Bill whereby, in the case of any crop being diseased, the Department can order the farmer or owner of that crop to destroy it, and in such cases the farmer would be paid compensation.  The Minister also made reference to the fact that under the Bill the Department of Agriculture can order the farmers or owners of crops to spray their potato crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to a diseased crop, but to a crop that is likely to get diseased by reason of its location&mdash;by reason of the fact that it is near another crop that is diseased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was about to put to the Minister is this: In such a case, where his Department finds it necessary to do that, his Department has power to levy upon the farmers concerned the charge for the spraying of the crop.  Would the Minister at a later stage of the Bill consider an amendment whereby the Department would, in a congested district, bear the cost of the spraying of the potatoes?  I am referring now to cases where the farmers are in a very poor condition; cases where there is extreme poverty among the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill.  It is certainly a step in advance. It was a very necessary Bill to introduce.  Crops, just in the same way as livestock, are exposed to infection and diseases of every description. It is certainly a very important thing that a country like this, which is immune from this disease at present largely because the country is an island, should be kept <Col N="643" /> immune.  I believe that it is always a wise thing to take very definite steps with regard to the prevention of diseases both in animals and in crops.  The one is the same as the other in the matter of these diseases. The point made by Deputy Cassidy might certainly need a bit of consideration. There are, undoubtedly, cases where, perhaps, under the Bill serious hardships might arise.  I refer to cases where small farmers would unfortunately find their crops diseased, and perhaps owing to their financial position they would be unable to spray the crops themselves or to pay for the spraying of them. At the same time I do not believe that the expense can be very heavy.</P>
      <P>It might be, perhaps, advisable for the Minister to consider some form of amendment in that matter so that people of that description would not be so heavily handicapped, perhaps, with the cost of the extra spraying.  At the same time I believe that the system of spraying is a good one.  Where farmers refuse to apply the remedies or preventives of the kind suggested, I think it is rather a good idea that the State should be in a position to step in and take definite steps to check the disease and prevent it from spreading.  The case of sheep scab was somewhat similar to this. I think this matter of the spraying of potatoes is one in which the Department might have a little more power of a similar nature to that in sheep-dipping.  The Department have a system of dipping sheep, penning them, and it would in fact be a good thing if that system were made a little bit stronger. I know that the custom amongst many farmers is to do the dipping in such a way that the sheep are only half dipped.  The same thing applies in the matter of their crops. For this reason, I believe that the Bill is a good and a suitable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Cassidy's point, you must, I think, give the same treatment to all farmers.  Spraying with a mixture of arsenate of lead would, I <Col N="644" /> imagine, cost very little.  I should say that the material for the spraying would not cost more than 15/- for a half-acre plot.  I am not quite sure of the exact amount, but I am quite sure that the cost would be very little.  But look at it this way &mdash;if the State is to intervene to prevent the spread of a disease which, should it spread, would render the crop useless, does not that save the farmers a very considerable amount of money?  The least that could be expected is that the farmers would co-operate in some way, and that they would spray their crop.  If we go any further and tell the farmers that not only will we spray the crops for them and pay for the cost of the materials, of course, the obvious procedure, for a number of farmers, at any rate, will be just to sit tight and let the Department of Agriculture, and not the farmer himself, go in and spray the crops, paying for the spraying materials and for the spraying at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the farmer is to have the advantage of the services of numerous highly-paid officials of the Department of Agriculture, who are to inspect his crops to see if they are diseased and, in addition to that, where they find it necessary as a preventive measure against these insect pests, they are to spray the crops and the taxpayer is to be called in to bear the cost.  I can imagine a case where, in a poor district, the farmer is so miserably poor that he could not pay the 5/- or 10/- required for the spraying materials that are necessary to spray his rood of potatoes. That would be a very special case, and I should imagine that there would be a way of dealing with such a case.  I suggest that in such a case other measures might be taken.  As a general rule the farmers are asked to spray their crops in order to prevent their potatoes from becoming infected by a particular virus or pest which would render the crop valueless.  The least they may do is to pay for the cost of the spraying. However, that is a Committee point, which can be gone into more closely <Col N="645" /> in Committee.  I move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The long title of this Bill is:&mdash;&ldquo;An Act to make divers minor amendments in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, and also to amend that Act by making further and better provision in relation to the assignment of the benefit of inventions and patents to Ministers on behalf of the State, and in relation to copyright in notes issued by the Currency Commission.&rdquo;  The Bill is really a matter for deliberation in Committee rather than on Second Reading.  There is not even a thread of principle running through the series of amendments which this Bill proposes to make.  They are simply amendments that have been discovered to be necessary for the better working of the Principal Act of 1927.  Section 1 is purely formal. Section 2 comes to this: that under Section 19 (5) of the Principal Act, and the rules made under it, there has been lodged in the office, within the specified period of one month of <Col N="646" /> the acceptance in London, a copy of an accepted specification and certain proofs as certified by the London Controller.  It has been found in practice that a period of one month is not long enough.  There are a number of accepted specifications lodged later than a month which cannot be proceeded with unless this is passed.  We propose two months, or such longer period as the Controller may in any particular case allow, and we propose to have this section made retrospective so as to apply to specifications already lodged, but lodged too late.  This deals with patents, and Sections 7 and 8 deal with exactly the same point, one in relation to trade marks and the other in relation to designs.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is also an enlargement of the time period.  There is a question of payment of renewal fees and the prescribed time for the payment of such fees is before the expiry of the year next preceding the year in respect of which the fee is due.  That is contained in the Second Schedule to the Principal Act.  Under Section 33 (2) of the Principal Act the Controller may extend the prescribed time for six months, and the object is to allow the patent agents to get in touch with their clients, who may be living in various parts of the world, to find out whether they wish their patents kept alive in this country or not.  Again, that period of six months has been found to be too short, and we propose a period of twenty months from 1st October, 1927.  It is necessary for the business of the office.  It is simply to enable patent agents all over the world to get in touch with their clients who have patents which may be allowed to subsist in this country, to see whether they consider it worth while paying a renewal fee.  We want to give time to get in touch with them and for them to make up their mind.  There is a minor amendment to substitute the words, &ldquo;any fee&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;the first fee.&rdquo; That is an intricate detail point which, if Deputies will allow me, I will leave over to the Committee Stage, when the two phrases can be better read together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> As to Section 4, the position in which the office finds itself in requiring this amendment is a peculiar one.  British patents granted before 1st October, 1927, are valid here without registration, but the Act makes provision for having a complete record of all such British patents and entries thereon on our register.  That is purely for office convenience, in order to have the office properly documented and the records properly kept.  The Act worked quite well in so far as patents proper were concerned, because under Section 29, sub-section (6), and also Section 45, it has been made obligatory that there should be furnished to the Controller all the entries in the British register relating to the patents before the payment of the renewal fees, and if not furnished, the renewal fees will be refused, and the patent lapses.  That worked satisfactorily with regard to patents proper, but there is a special type of patent called &ldquo;a patent of addition,&rdquo; in respect to which there are no renewal fees payable. Consequently, there may never be a record of that particular type of patent made here, and there is not the same control that there is in the case of patents proper.  This amendment will compel the holders of a patent of addition to furnish to the Controller the entries on the British register relating to that particular type of patent, the penalty being the same as before.  If the record is not so furnished, then the Controller will allow the patent to lapse.  We have mentioned a particular date, which seems to be the date upon which the ordinary British patent would normally be on our register, as being the date, which is January, 1932.  That affords sufficient time for the furnishing of the required particulars.  Section 5 is a substitution for Section 46 in the old Act, which enlarges the old power given by enabling the Minister to take not merely all, but any share or interest in the benefit of an invention, and then goes on to state certain things which the person taking the assignment of the patent may <Col N="648" /> do with it.  It was thought better to put in all these special items from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;G.&rdquo;  This is an enlargement of Section 46.</P>
    <P>I said in reply to a question put to me to-day that it might be said that practically I had done things for which I had no statutory authority. That is to be taken subject to certain reservations.  There is no doubt that Section 46, at any rate, put a Minister getting the benefit of a patent into the position of an assignee of a patent impliedly, and it is thought that the Minister by becoming the assignee has all the powers to deal with such a patent that any ordinary assignee would have.  But, to put the matter beyond all doubt, this new Section 5 is proposed to be substituted for Section 46.  If the assignment of the patent under Section 46 did not grant the person taking it full power to deal with it, the grant is of very little use.  It only means that the Minister would get such a patent and could prevent anybody from using it, but would be prevented himself from making any use of it.  However, this clears up any doubt which there may be about it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains two points of amendment.  The first is the deletion of the words in one sub-section &ldquo;the firm and&rdquo; and &ldquo;the company and.&rdquo; Under Section 63 of the Principal Act the conditions of eligibility to be entered on the register of patent agents apply only to individuals and not to firms or to companies.  There is no test of eligibility for the registration of a firm or a company.  A firm or a company ought not to be registered as such.  The amendment does not prevent the provision applying or otherwise &mdash; that is to say, that a firm cannot hold itself out as a patent agent unless every member or partner of the firm or director of the company is registered.  The second amendment in that section is brought in to meet certain objections that were formulated against the wording as it originally stood.  It was promised to a group of patent agents who passed an examination under the Principal Act.  It gives <Col N="649" /> these patent agents in this country a greater share of patent agency business here.  Under the Act and rules an agent entered in the London register will not be eligible under the amended section for entry on our register unless that London patent agent resides in, as well as having a place of business in, the Free State.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 are the two sections to which I referred earlier in regard to the enlargement of time, Section 7 with regard to designs, and Section 8 with regard to trade marks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is a very complicated section.  There are really two points&mdash;one contained in (a) of the proposed amending section, and the other in (b).  (a) Simply removes from the proviso in Section 154 (1) of the Act certain words, &ldquo;and in respect of which no order has been made under the provisions of Section 175 of this Act.&rdquo;  The full effect of it amounts to this: that by deleting these words in Section 154, an order may be made under Section 154, although there may be also an order under 175.  Obviously there was a limitation in the proviso to Section 154.  Certain things are set out in the first part, and there was a proviso that the Governor-General may, on the advice of the Executive Council, by order made, direct that copyright subsisting in Saorstát Eireann under the provisions of this sub-section should be subject to such conditions and formalities.  There was a reservation in the proviso that it was to be in respect of which no order had been made under the provisions of Section 175.  It is considered desirable to make an order, even although an order of a different type has been made under Section 175.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could not understand this unless he has the Principal Act before him.  I said in the beginning that these were really Committee points, and all I am pretending to do is to provide a certain sign-post as to what <Col N="650" /> the sections mean.  Anything I say will have to be considered in relation to the Principal Act and to the details of this Bill. The proviso is with regard to licensing conditions&mdash;I do not know if that is an explanation&mdash;the conditions for licensing under which this copyright may be allowed to subsist in the Free State, although the copyright does not subsist originally by virtue of sub-section (1) (a) and (b) of Section 154.  There is then power given under Section 175 to make an order of a particular type with certain licensing conditions in it.  It is thought that where an order was made under Section 175 there would never be necessity for an order under Section 154.</P>
      <P>Owing to a particular thing that has arisen which I will go into in more detail later, there seems to be a necessity definitely for having the power to issue an order under Section 154 even though an order may be issued under Section 175.  That is incomprehensible unless Deputies will read the conditions under which licensing orders may be issued both under Section 175 and Section 154. It is a very fine and detailed point which it is impossible to make out unless the two texts are before Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second portion is a very simple point.  We insert sub-section (2) of the paragraph which follows here instead of the paragraph now contained therein.  Section 154 (2) (a) and the amendment before the House are the same except in this respect that (a) as it stands has the words &ldquo;to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any translation of the work&rdquo; and then it continues &ldquo;provided that such right shall as regards translations into the Irish language cease to exist&rdquo; unless there is publication within ten years in this country.  That is what it amounts to.  We have to make another reservation and the new section states: &ldquo;(a) to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any translations of the work: provided that such right&rdquo; (save as respect the performance or translation of dramatic or musical work).  That <Col N="651" /> extra proviso is required because of the Berne Convention and allows us to limit the period of authors' control over translations but does not allow us to limit the period of the authors' control over the performance of translations.  We must make that exception.  It is a very small point, but it is to keep in line with the international Convention. We still keep the old power with regard to translation, but as to the performance of translations &mdash; how and when that is going to arise I do not know &mdash; we have to keep in line with a particular convention.  It has been pointed out that our law contravened the Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a small point.  The expression &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; is not clearly defined in the Act.  It is defined as including certain countries. In Section 152 (6) relating to patents, designs and tradesmarks, to the word &ldquo;dominion&rdquo; there has been added &ldquo;protectorate or territory.&rdquo; In the preparation of the order under Section 175, doubt arises as to whether such orders can be made applicable to protectorates or dependencies.  We want to remove that doubt and make it clear that we can.</P>
    <P>There is a further amendment in Section 10 (b).  It is a clear-cut section, bringing in that the order may provide that the term of copyright in Saorstát Eireann shall not exceed that conferred by the law of the Dominion, protectorate, territory or country to which the order relates. Again, this is where we find the law in conflict with the Convention. Under the Convention we are bound to restrict the period of copyright that we give to foreign works to the period of copyright allowed by the law of the country of origin, whereas as Section 175 stood, we had to give them the same period as the old Act gives to our own citizens. Now we are putting it on a different footing &mdash; such terms as are given shall not exceed the term of copyright given by the law of the country of origin.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is again to remove doubts &mdash; to make it clear that the <Col N="652" /> copyright of the notes issued by the Currency Commission belongs to the Commission, and also makes such copyrights perpetual, instead of the term as limited in the case of the ordinary individual, that is to say, for the life of the author and fifty years after his death.</P>
    <P>I should say that the really important section is the one which substitutes for Section 46 of the Principal Act Section 5 of this Bill.  That section enlarges and elaborates and puts beyond all possibility of doubt the question of the Minister taking the assignment of a patent and establishing fully and clearly his powers of dealing with it.  The early sections are merely an enlargement of certain periods of time in cases where the Office finds that the time allowed is not sufficient.  Then there is the rather important item in the second part of Clause 6, insisting that any patent agent entered on the London Register shall only be entitled to register here if he resides and has his place of business in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, any effective discussion which takes place on this Bill will be on the Committee Stage.  On the Second Stage we are supposed to discuss the principle of Bills, but this Bill has no principle, each section being merely framed for the purpose, apparently, of meeting defects which arose in the actual working of the Principal Act.  We were not in a position to know what these defects were and we are glad to have the explanation of them given by the Minister, and hope to have an opportunity of considering them in detail through the Official Reports before the Committee Stage is taken.  It appears, as the Minister has stated, that Section 5 is the most important section, and there are one or two points concerned with it which I would like to have cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I approve generally of the powers defined in the section giving the Minister power with respect to inventions, it does not seem clear that the Dáil would be kept informed <Col N="653" /> of the ultimate decision concerning any patent on which it may have expended some of the taxpayers' money.  If, for example, the Minister took an assignment of the whole or any share of the benefit of any patent and procured a sum of money from the Dáil to develop or perfect the invention in the patent, would it be possible for him to grant a licence under the patent with or without valuable consideration, or to lease or sell it with or without valuable consideration without the consent of the Dáil?  It seems an undesirable principle if that could happen. In my opinion, from the wording of the section there is nothing to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>With the general principle of the section, if I may call it such, I am in agreement.  I think it is desirable, in the particular circumstances of this country, that a member of the Executive Council should have the power to take an assignment of the benefit of any invention or patent and to come to the Dáil for a Vote of money to develop or perfect that invention and to work it.  In the interests of the Dáil, however, I think it is desirable that there should be some machinery devised by which the final decision of the Minister with respect to any such patent would be communicated to the Dáil, and would receive its consent before it becomes operative.  It is easy to conceive circumstances under which the Dáil might object to any patent, in respect of which it voted a sum of money for development, being sold to an individual or firm for a nominal sum, or being given for no sum at all. I would be glad if the Minister would deal with that point if he intends to make any remarks at the conclusion of this discussion.  We are glad to see Section 6.  It appears that the wording in the original Act created an anomaly and now it is provided that in order to have one's name registered on the Patent Registry one must not only reside, but have one's place of business in the Saorstát.  That, in our opinion, is an improvement and will remove the objections which the <Col N="654" /> patent agents had to the working of the original Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing a Supplementary Estimate a short time ago, I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that it was a somewhat novel procedure for Governments to purchase shares in inventions. I asked him if there were any precedents for such intervention and he was good enough to inform me that he was not aware of any. It was rather a curious coincidence that this Bill should come on for discussion immediately after the consideration of that Estimate because, on further consideration, I am rather inclined to think that the Minister in purchasing such shares is rather exceeding his powers.  That, however, is a matter that one can only refer to incidentally on the Bill.  I would like him, if he is not out of order in the matter, to give us his authority for taking such a step.  The point I am concerned with in the Bill is, as the Minister rightly pointed out, the powers which he takes under Clause 5.  I agree very much with what Deputy Lemass has said in his desire that there should be some controlling authority in the Dáil over the Minister before he embarks on the unlimited expenditure of public money which apparently he is empowered to expend under Clause 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Lemass is aware that Clause 5 is a very wide one.  It says &ldquo;The Minister may (as the case may be) do or join in doing on behalf of the State all or any of the following things, that is to say, develop and perfect such invention; take an assignment of any patent or of a share or interest in any patent theretofore or thereafter obtained for such invention; sell or lease either for or without valuable consideration any such patent; grant either with or without valuable consideration licences under any such patent and work any such patent commercially.&rdquo;  There are two other provisoes.  That gives the Minister exceedingly wide powers. Under this clause he is authorised to take the funds of the State for <Col N="655" /> any or all of the purposes I have mentioned.  I am not opposed to Governments dealing in patents where the patent concerned is, shall we say, of military or national importance. One would not object to the State embarking on such patents; but if the Minister is going to embark commercially on the ordinary patent I think it is a rather questionable procedure and I would like the Dáil to consider it in detail and to put on the Minister, before he embarks upon any such expenditure, large or small, the obligation of coming to this House, submitting the proposal to it, and getting its authority for any such expenditure.  I think that that would be not only advisable but essential in order that the Dáil may control expenditure. Therefore, I hope that before the Committee Stage is reached some such clause, giving that power to the Dáil, will be put into the Bill in order that it may control such expenditure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, sub-section (2) does not deal with the clause in exactly the way that Deputy Lemass outlined and in the way that I endeavoured to outline. The sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;all expenses incurred by a Minister under this section shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is all very well.  He can bring it to the knowledge of the Minister for Finance, but that does not mean that the Minister for Finance or the Minister concerned, is going to bring it to the knowledge of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to read this clause in conjunction with clause 5, where the Minister is empowered &ldquo;to do any or all of the following <Col N="656" /> things.&rdquo;  He brings that to the knowledge of the Minister for Finance, gets his approval, and then proceeds to make the expenditure. That is the point.  Doubtless the Minister may have an explanation for it, but it does appear to me that there is no obligation cast on either of the Ministers to come to the Dáil and have a scheme approved by the Dáil before any expenditure is incurred in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, to some extent, between Deputy Good and Deputy Lemass in this matter.  Deputy Good apparently is too cautious from my point of view.  It seems to me that the intention is that the existing control in all these matters, of coming to the Dáil to get the finance necessary to do anything, if it is properly exercised, should be fully sufficient in this matter.  Against that, the Minister might, in a moment of enthusiasm, commit himself to an expenditure and enter into an agreement which the Dáil would then have no option but to carry out.  In relation to the development of inventions, you are certainly in a sphere which is highly speculative.  You are either going to make a great deal of money or you are going merely to incur a great deal of expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am of opinion that the Minister should have power &mdash; in fact, frankly, I have always read the Act as that he had that power, and I take it that legal opinion has cast doubts upon the fullness of that power and that this clause has been introduced to make the thing absolutely water-tight &mdash; if there is any doubt about the matter and that this seeks to make it water-tight, then to that extent I approve of it.  The real difficulty will be to get somewhere between a rigid attitude in this matter and an entirely free one.  Say, for instance, that the Minister came to the Dáil and asked the Dáil to consider an invention which was only in the provisional patent stage, a stage which in the interests of the invention it might be desirable to keep for some considerable period &mdash; I mean, without disclosing the full nature of the claims and the full nature <Col N="657" /> of the development &mdash; it might be during that stage that the aid, the assistance and the finances of the Minister might be necessary to the inventor to enable him to develop that.  That would be a stage at which it would be certainly impossible for the Minister to come here and to disclose any useful particulars to the House which would enable it to decide whether or not it was getting value for the money.  You can delay a provisional patent perhaps nearly two years by a certain process without disclosing it, and a good many patents which are of value are kept in that inchoate condition.  While I think the Minister should not be encouraged in the idea that supervision of the House over what is largely speculative finance should be in any way withdrawn, he should not be so limited that he could not do what would be commercially done in relation to a matter of that kind.  Broadly speaking, the Bill seems to be merely a series of corrigenda.  We shall read the Bill in the light of the explanation which the Minister has given us, but two of the basic clauses in it &mdash; one in which he does ensure that residence in this country shall be a qualification for patent agents, and another in which we give the Minister power, if he does find some basic improvement which can be developed for the benefit of the State, to use it&mdash;seem to me to justify the Bill, and it should have our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Minister a moment ago whether this payment he made was a speculative payment or an investment, I had in mind the fears expressed by Deputy Good as to giving the Minister rather extraordinary powers. At the same time I agree that it is very necessary that any invention in Ireland which there may be a possibility of making of great value to the country should be encouraged in every way.  However, from the business point of view, it does not look sound that a Minister, for instance, who might be inclined to take risks would have practically unlimited power to make investments <Col N="658" /> which would undoubtedly be of a speculative nature.  No invention can be called safe until it has passed through all its stages in the Patent Office and has become a really working proposition.  Until that time, money spent on its promotion cannot be regarded as a safe investment.  It is money spent in speculation.  Although from a business point of view it may be unsound, I would still be inclined to give the Minister that power, because undoubtedly in the past many inventions of great use to the country have been lost because capitalists in this country were too timid to back them financially, and a Minister with foresight enough and courage enough to back any promising investment should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>If this Bill consisted of nothing else but one clause, and that clause 5, it should be welcomed by every section and by every class.  To me the strongest appeal in this Bill is the fact that under that clause the needy or indigent inventor is helped.  We know that in many cases where genius makes itself manifest through the inventor, it has been the case&mdash; many cases have come under my own notice &mdash; where because of the indigence or poverty of the inventor he had to take his invention and to market it in some country other than the Free State.  I welcome the whole Bill, because of the fact that it will be possible, when it becomes operative, for any Irish citizen to approach the Minister concerned to get advice, and when, upon examination, the Minister is satisfied that the invention is such that it might be taken up as a business proposition, I think that in itself is a thing that should commend itself to all sections.  For that reason I welcome this Bill on behalf of my colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the wide powers that are being asked for by the Minister under Section 5 of the Bill are not to be used in the fashion suggested by Deputy <Col N="659" /> Anthony, that is that anybody who has a patent, even a good patent, or a good invention, could come along to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and put it up to him that he should go to the Dáil and ask that money should be found to capitalise that invention.  I speak subject to the Minister's idea, but I hope that is not the Minister's idea.  If I thought that what Deputy Anthony said was in the Minister's mind I would hesitate very much about giving these powers to the Minister. But I think the Minister has a little more sense.  I suggest that these powers are being asked for by the Minister, to enable him or any other Minister, or Government, to take advantage of any invention or any patent that is of such a nature that it might be of general advantage to the country, or that it might help us to develop some industry that would be of general utility, advantage and profit to all sections of the community. I would not like to see the Department of Industry and Commerce turned into an industrial or an investment trust.  Certainly, I think that is not its function, and I do not think that the Minister would be foolish enough to ask for powers to enable him to undertake such work.  Anyone charged with the responsible position of Minister for Industry and Commerce, even in such a small State as this, in the Twenty-six Counties has, I take it, quite enough to do at his ordinary work, day in day out, without taking it on himself to examine such propositions as would undoubtedly come before him from inventors, patentees or patent agents, if he were to undertake to become an agent, as it would seem to me he would be, for an industrial or an investment trust, if he had such ideas as those Deputy Anthony had in mind.  Undoubtedly very wide powers are sought by the Minister in this Bill.  It is a further effort, if you like, in the nationalisation of industry.  Perhaps some would call it socialisation.</P>

We adopted that principle last year in connection with the creameries.  That was a big step in the same direction. Where that is being done for the benefit of the community as a whole, and for the benefit of the nation, I personally have no objection; in fact I welcome it, and I welcome the proposal of the Minister, that if he had any doubt in his mind as to the powers he had before, that these powers should be made definite and clear, and that he should get all the power necessary to enable him, or the Government he speaks for, to invest money in such inventions or patents, as would be likely to be of value in helping forward the industrial resurrection of this country. These powers are wide, important, and far-reaching, in many respects, but I give my support, and I think our Party will give him support on the understanding that these powers are to be used in a wide sense for the national advantage, for all sections of the community, and not to be used in the sense of a patent agent's office, or industrial trust, taking up any patent that may come along, and that may be a good speculation for an ordinary commercial or business matter or trust agency.  I take it that is far from the mind of the Minister, and under these conditions I give what support I can to the ideas in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, I am in complete agreement with all the alterations which it is proposed to make in the Act of 1927, but I rather regret that the Minister did not make some attempt to deal with the position that at present exists under Section 19. I know that there are good reasons why that section was originally put into the Act.  It is the section which provides that every application for a patent shall be accompanied, either by a declaration, first of all, as to whether a patent was applied for in Great Britain or not, and if not, compels an applicant to furnish a statutory declaration that a <Col N="661" /> search has been made in one of the offices mentioned in the section through the records of the past fifty years in order to discover whether the invention has been anticipated in any way.  Now, the effect of that section as it stands at the present moment is that it practically compels every inventor, if he wants to get a Free State patent, to take out a patent in Great Britain first. If he proceeds to take his patent out in the Free State he has imposed upon him the extra expense of a search, which is a very expensive matter from the point of view of the ordinary patent agent or of the inventor, but it is comparatively inexpensive if carried out by the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anomaly which exists is this, that the patent office itself for its own purposes has to carry out, after it has received an application, an exactly similar search here.  Obviously the search carried out by the patent office is of greater value than the search carried out by the patent agent.  He starts off hoping he may discover nothing; he starts off with the wrong psychology, whereas the patent office examiner, knowing that he will be responsible afterwards if the search has not been thorough enough, searches in the proper spirit, anxious to discover everything that can be found.  For that reason I think that the search by the patent agent is of comparatively little value, and I believe that sub-section (3) of Section 19 could be deleted without in any way weakening the effects of the Patent Act of 1927.  I would draw the Minister's attention to that.  I do not know how he could do it now, but I certainly think that sub-section (3) of Section 19 could be deleted without in any way weakening the effect of a Saorstát Eireann patent, because patents either originate here or originate abroad; either the invention is made here or it is made abroad.  If the invention is patented in Great Britain, in Germany, or in America &mdash; and most of the patents which come for registration or validation here under Section 52 are taken out in one or other of these three countries &mdash; in each case <Col N="662" /> a very strict search is made by the patent offices in these three countries and in each case the applicant for a patent here has to furnish a certified copy of the specification of the invention which was accepted by the office for the patent.  Therefore the office here, even though it has not a staff at the present moment, would be justified in saying that if these patents had been granted by the British patent office so far as the last fifty years are concerned, or by the German and American patent offices so far as all known records are concerned, these inventions are not anticipated or have not previously been disclosed.  For that reason I feel that the office, without weakening the Saorstát Eireann patent at all, could dispense with the search and the statutory declaration which is insisted on by sub-section (3) of Section 19, and I think the Minister ought to consider that.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment imagine that this particular invention that the Minister has referred to is the forerunner of a series of like activities on his part for the purpose of nationalising certain patents of importance to the community, and I do not think that the Minister would stand over it in that light himself.  My attitude in the matter is that it may be necessary for the secrecy of the transaction, but after all, we should, if so, set aside a certain fund for the Minister to do with it what he is doing in this particular way.  The Dáil would then know its ultimate liability, or the liability to which the Minister could proceed.  I am in complete agreement with the idea of facilities being accorded to people in this country to invent certain things when, by virtue of the fact that they have not got capital, or the means of attracting capital, they might lose for themselves and for this country the benefits of such inventions.  I think it would be far better if a certain fund were set aside for that purpose.  We would then know our ultimate liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us how money spent in the manner in which this money is being spent <Col N="663" /> on this invention will be accounted for.  Will it be regarded as an advance from the Exchequer, or will it be regarded as actual money spent, and how will we be able to balance affairs and to know where we stand? What I would like to emphasise is that the Minister has been frank enough to show by his answer that although this £5,000 is being spent, it is by no means the limit of what will ultimately be spent on that invention. Personally I hesitate to say that I am in complete accord with his action, as I believe that the House should either have some idea as to how far it is going to be committed, or should know more about the thing.  I would like the Minister to state how the money spent will be accounted for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to announce that I am setting my face very strongly against the point of view expressed by Deputy Anthony. This is not intended as an addition to or a part of the Patent Office, so that the Minister can be provided with powers leading to an avenue of money for the purpose of aiding indigent inventors in this country. In fact, I would like to regard this as a very exceptional transaction, and I say that as much for my own protection as for that of anybody else, because I know very well that if what Deputy Briscoe suggested was set up, even supposing we could normally, year by year, with a sub-head in some Vote, be provided with money to aid inventors, the life of any Minister for Industry and Commerce would be made miserable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot close down inventors.  If there is a certain sum of money set aside year by year to aid the Minister to take up inventions, his office is going to be overrun with all the inventors of the country &mdash; and they are numerous; in order to deal with those who think themselves inventors, even with regard <Col N="664" /> to perpetual motion alone, a considerable amount of the Minister's time would have to be set aside.  This should be regarded as a very exceptional thing.  I would never like to approach the setting aside of a certain sum of money, because there would be as much difficulty in refusing money once the Vote was opened as there would be in getting money in the House, and it is rather difficult to get money in this House at times.  I think the method I adopted is quite unusual, but I think it suits the purpose fairly well.  I got money advanced to me from the Contingency Fund. That money has to be repaid to the Fund.  Actually I hope that by the time that Vote comes to be inquired into in detail I will have a great many more details to give to the Public Accounts Committee, or to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, or to the Dáil, than I can give at the moment.  I do not think that the thing will have to remain secret for anything like so long as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good has asked twice whether there was anything of national importance about this. There is, I could go even so far as to say this, that the particular item in question tied itself up very definitely and very clearly with projected development in the country. But even though there had not been that link-up with the particular development in the country, if one could assume the same value about this thing under other circumstances as I felt on examination of it in the present circumstances, then I think an exceptional point of view might be taken with regard to it.  The case was rather extraordinary.  A young man thought he had a thing of great value.  He was in fact on his way to make a sale of it to people outside the country, and then this thought struck him: that he had in fact been educated here at the expense of certain county council grants and that it was time the country got some return, and in a very generous and a very quixotic mood this gentleman came and offered his invention, and even offered to dispose of a majority share against himself.  The <Col N="665" /> amount of money is really inconsiderable &mdash; £5,000 &mdash; of which at least a couple of thousand pounds is being expended on the improving, the perfecting and the working out of this item from the commercial point of view.  As far as fees are concerned, there would be not more than something in the nature of £3,000 expended, if there would be even that.</P>
    <P>The Minister gets very wide powers under this proposal.  Deputy Lemass asked if it would be possible for a Minister to sell or to give away the benefit which he has got for the State under the assignment, without any valuable consideration.  While actually that right is given in so many words, if Deputies do not like that right to be given it is for them to move amendments.  But we are really coming to a point when there will have to be a decision taken as to how this commercial development of particular types is going to be fostered in the country.  We have the State Lands Act.  Under the State Lands Act, when certain State property has to be leased, and it can only be leased, a very varied schedule of particulars has to be filled in and published.  There is great security in that.  One will say there is always sure to be an error, and if there is an error at all in the State Lands Act it will be on the side of the most conservative of business view points.  In the state the country is in at the moment, in the most ruthless conservative business methods there is likely to be a certain amount of elasticity.  I will be coming in with proposals with regard to mines and minerals, with regard to how leases for the development of mines and minerals, which happen to be State property, should be granted, and how the supervision of the Oireachtas, which is necessary under the Constitution, should be exercised. I would not propose at all to have anything as rigid as the Schedule to the State Lands Act. Here we have very considerable powers.  As Deputy Good stated, the Minister may grant, with or without valuable consideration, licences under any such patent.  He may even sell or lease without valuable <Col N="666" /> consideration.  In other words, the Minister may sell such patents without valuable consideration.  In the end one comes to this: there is a question of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The most sobering thing in life is to know clearly that whatever you are going to do you are going to be called on to answer for it quite soon and publicly.  It is a very sobering thing to have the supervision not merely of this House, but of the world of Ireland's citizens over any such action as this.  Really, in the end, one depends a great deal in these things on the sense of responsibility that was brought about by that very sober reflection that there is a jury to be gone before quite soon, and criticisms to be faced.  Anybody in the position that I am in at the moment knows very well it is going to be much more in the way of criticism than anything else that has to be faced.  If it is thought not to be wise to give these powers, I would like to see Deputy Flinn and Deputy Lemass approaching the middle point as between this and the State Lands Act.  I think Deputy Lemass was distinctly drifting when he spoke of having a schedule tied up in some way to something approaching conditions under which lands under the State Lands Act are leased.  That will arise again on the Committee Stage.  It will arise in a much more important way.  This is a very small transaction, a very exceptional case.  The whole matter of the general leasing of property which belongs to the Government will come up more definitely in the mines and minerals legislation than in anything else.  It is not right to say, as has been pointed out, that I have unlimited powers, particularly on the expenditure side.  It is distinctly laid down here that all expenses incurred shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The Minister for Finance is only brought in in this sense: prior to going to the Oireachtas there has to be sanction from the Minister for Finance obtained to the drawing up <Col N="667" /> of a Vote &mdash; to the ascertainment of the amount &mdash; and even when the Minister for Finance has sanctioned that in the ordinary way, the Oireachtas has power to lessen that if it be so disposed, and until moneys are voted by the House by a special Vote the only possible fund out of which the Minister may draw is the fund out of which I drew in this particular case, that is, the Contingency Fund. The full amount of that fund is limited to £20,000, and there are many other calls than this in a year, so that it may be taken that the Minister is limited in his power of expenditure to something in the neighbourhood of £10,000.</P>
    <P>I regard the whole transaction as a purely exceptional thing not to be entered into lightly.  It will have to be explained in the fullest detail to the House.  On account of its being such an exceptional transaction, a certain amount of silence and secrecy should be observed with regard to it.  There is this reason: it is still in an undeveloped state, and to talk too much about it might lose to this country and the actual inventor the benefit of that individual's brain.  I am not going to add to my own troubles by having it broadcasted that this is a country in which anyone who thinks he has an invention which is patentable may come along to my office and get a patent.  I would hope that there is going to be no fund about which you can say you have that given by the Oireachtas for the purpose of aiding inventors.  I do not want that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Goulding referred again to the question of whether this was an investment or a speculation. Of course, most opinions will differ on that.  I agree with him that anything that is to be protected by a patent is most distinctly a speculation, until some type of cover, provisional or otherwise, has been obtained for it, and even when provisional protection has been obtained it does not cease to be speculation, because there is the question: &ldquo;Is the particular item commercially workable?  Is there a <Col N="668" /> profit to be made out of it?  Is there advantage, other than money profit, to be gained from it?&rdquo;  The Deputy admitted that he was speaking in the dark.  I, at any rate, was advised by scientific people that there was sufficient good in this to warrant the helping of it along a few stages further.  It has gone along certain stages.  There is speculation in it.  I say there is considerable investment in it, but before you get to the investment stage the speculation stage must have passed.  There is this to be said about it, that it was not so much a speculation that there was no money to be had for it from outside the country on the part of a private individual, if the inventor had not offered it to the State first and if the State had not accepted it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred also to a point raised on the Vote.  I may answer that this £5,000 was not the limit.  It is very difficult to be precise in this matter, because I should not like to confine myself to the £5,000.  If some additional monies &mdash;a couple of hundred pounds&mdash;were required I would not say that I would not go beyond it.  I will answer the Deputy this way.  If the thing becomes a commercial success undoubtedly there will be required a big amount of money to have the thing launched on a big commercial scale.  Whether the State is going into that company which is going to work on a commercial scale is another point.  All the right I have is to control more than 50 per cent. of the shares in any company established for the future working of it. But I have not yet taken up a single share in the company for the commercial exploitation of this thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that the Minister takes power under Section 7 to form or to promote an incorporated company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, and have already proceeded some length.  At the moment a company is being formed for the launching of this thing.  If the thing is successful there has to be envisaged a company <Col N="669" /> on a fairly big scale.  If the Government was going to come into that, and to stand on its right to take a majority holding of its shares, there would have to be a fair amount of capital put up.  That certainly would not be included in the Contingency Fund.  If that was going to happen there would have to be an application to the Oireachtas for a grant to enable the Government to put up that money.  We are not very near that particular point at the moment, and when I say that £5,000 is now the limit it is in that sense. I think it is the limit as far as this particular transaction is concerned. I will not be ashamed to come before the Dáil and ask for another £1,000, £1,500 or £2,000.  But, substantially, £5,000 marks the full limit of expenditure that is proposed at the moment.  No one knows whether there may not be some diversion which will entail further secrecy as to the patent office and further protection of the patentee.  The Dáil will see the end of this sometime; I cannot say when.  I cannot see the end of it myself.  If the course is considered so unwise that I should not have gone into this avenue at all, I am not pessimistic in that way.  I think the thing is good, and that the circumstances would justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do say again that when the matter comes to be cleared up, on account of the peculiar nature of the whole transaction, there ought to be more details given of the whole origins of the thing than there would be about an ordinary transaction to mark that it is an exceptional thing and as a sort of danger signal to Ministers in the future that they should not embark lightly on these particular kinds of transactions.  I did not embark lightly on this thing.  I do not think it will be found that it was done in a light-hearted way.  It was done after considerable inquiry and considerable process of examination in the preliminary stages.  I cannot answer Deputy Lemass's point at the moment as to these particular powers that are given.  I think powers are necessary.  It may be that they have gone too far in the sense of selling or leasing, either with <Col N="670" /> or without valuable consideration, or it may be that the Dáil would like to put in some limiting clause that before a sale was completed, particularly a sale without valuable consideration, if that can be called a sale at all, or a lease without valuable consideration, there should be some indication given to the House or to some Select Committee of the House. Amendments may be put down to that effect.</P>
    <P>I would like people to bear in mind, if they put down amendments, that they are really advancing to the consideration of the question as to how mines and minerals or potential forms of energy grouped in Article 11 of the Constitution are hereafter going to be leased out to people and how supervision is going to be exercised over the granting of such leases or the working under such lease by the Oireachtas.  This is really fore-shadowing a very much bigger question that lies behind mines and minerals.  If amendments are being considered they should be considered not merely in the light of this small amendment to the Patent Bill but of the very much bigger question of the State property that is grouped under Article 11 of the Treaty.  I will be prepared to discuss amendments, even limiting amendments, to Section 5 with people in that light, because I would like to have this as much a try out in the Mines and Minerals Bill as it is in the particular question of this amendment.</P>

Assuming that an invention is brought under the notice of the Minister by a member of the Oireachtas &mdash; by a member of this House or of the Seanad &mdash; and that the Minister, having examined the proposition, decides that it is worth perfecting and developing, is it not a fact that he then is competent to do all such things as may be necessary, all these things that are mentioned from sub-section A to sub-section G or clause 5?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 is the section on which the principal Act is founded.  Deputy MacEntee asked me to take away sub-section (3) of Section 19, and then went on to draw conclusions as regards searches that are made in England and Germany. If his amendment to Section 19 were directed to making an affidavit or document which is demanded in sub-section (3) of 19, not solely one from the English Patent Office, but, say, in a particular case from the German controller, that is one particular type of amendment.  There will be a difficulty <Col N="672" /> there from the office's point of view.</P>
      <P>All I would say about Section 19 now is that it is the foundation of the whole Patent Office establishment. In the conditions which were facing us when the legislation was first drawn up actually a point which is in sub-section (3) of Section 19, allowing a search to be made not merely in London but in offices to be specified by the Controller, actually meaning our own offices, was put in in the last stage of the Second Patent Bill when it was in the Seanad.  At that time it was reported to me that the Controller designate was satisfied that there were sufficient documents and books under his control to enable him to make a search and to say whether or not there was priority.  Although the documents are there I am not sure at this moment, though the office has been established for some time, that these documents and volumes are sufficiently indexed and put in order that a search can easily be made.  Eventually we will come to a stage when there will be a sufficient number of documents on their hands so that a search may be carried out here at the will of the Controller.  But it is too early to begin to play about with Section 19, because it is the foundation of the whole legislation as it stands. Undoubtedly the situation is changed somewhat.  We have better records here.  They are in the process of being indexed and put in order.  Probably we will come to the time when even for people who have taken out patents on the other side a search here will be necessary. I cannot make out whether the Deputy meant that or another point, that a certificate from Germany, United States or the British Controller should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That a certified copy of the complete specification which was accepted by the Patent Offices of Germany, America or Great Britain should be accepted here instead of the statutory declaration made by the patent agent. In sub-section (3) of Section 19 there are two searches to be made. <Col N="673" /> Obviously there is a search to be made by the patent agent in relation to which he must make a statutory declaration.  After he has lodged his application, with his complete specification, the Patent Office, for its own protection, I presume also makes a search and examination of the application in relation to disclosure and that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>It would seem, in view of that, that a search by the patent agent has now become unnecessary.  As it was a source of great expense to the applicant applying for a patent, in the first instance, and, therefore, an impediment in the way of taking out a patent, the Office.  I think, should dispense with the statutory declaration by the patent agent.  I am not asking the Office to dispense with the search which makes for its own protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this whole matter about Section 19, I may say that I have had the question of the amendment of the Act under consideration from the very day the Act was passed, and in fact prior to that, because it was realised that under the changing conditions of the Office here any legislation that was passed would have to be rather of a temporary nature even though it is included in this bulky form here.  The reason for that is because the situation is changing from day to day. There have been people viewing what are the changes necessary, and if it had not been for the change in the headship of the Office I would probably be here now looking for much more radical changes in the whole patent legislation than I am at the moment.  I am now only looking for certain urgent small changes to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Section 19 and the whole foundation of the Act was very definitely under consideration and was only interrupted by the departure of the Controller to another post.  The new Controller has not had time to look into the situation. I know that the other points mentioned were under consideration, but I have not yet been advised that <Col N="674" /> they can drop the particular ones relating to search to which the Deputy refers.  He can rest assured that the question of the amendment to the Patent Act, even changing the whole foundation of it, is being considered. I cannot say that I am even within sight of being able to promise when that legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since last night I have had a further opportunity of considering the advisability of adding this sub-section to the Bill.  I am sorry to say that more mature consideration has really rather strengthened than weakened me in the view I expressed last night, and I do not think that this sub-section would be of assistance to the Bill.  This sub-section is rather moulded on the Firearms Act.  Under that Act, everyone who has a licence to sell cartridges, or something of that kind, must keep a register.  It must appear in that register that a sale has been made to persons entitled to have these particular things.  That is a thing which goes on on a pretty large scale.  A dealer in cartridges will deal with a very large number of customers.  Again, in a Bill which I will very shortly introduce to the House, and which is not unconnected with the Act to which I have just referred, namely, the Game Preservation Bill, there will be a similar provision, that a game dealer will only be able to buy game from a certain class of person. Therefore, it will be strictly necessary to keep a register.  Where it must be done on a large or substantial scale, such as the buying of game or the selling of cartridges, it is obvious that a register must be <Col N="675" /> kept, but here there will only be very few cases of licences being granted. That, I think, is pretty obvious and will be admitted.</P>
      <P>As the amendment stands, it is to the effect that anybody who gets a permit to buy a particular book would, at the same time, have to get some particular form.  He certainly would have to keep in his house the name of the person from whom he bought the book.  Similarly, the bookseller who might only get a permit for one particular book in the whole of his career as a bookseller, would be obliged to keep this register and fill it up.  The sending out of these forms would cause an unnecessary amount of trouble.  It would impose a considerable amount of trouble on the bookseller who received the register.  When a thing has to be done generally such as happens in the case of cartridges, then everyone knows what the necessary provision is, but in a case like this, if you had to have a register, the bookseller would probably be ignorant of it.  On the whole, I do not think that it would help the administration of the Act.  I think that it would cause a great deal more of annoyance than good.</P>
      <P>There is one sub-section at the end, and in trying to meet the Deputy on that I would go a small way.  Sub-section (7) states that the Minister &ldquo;may at any time by order revoke any permit granted under this section.&rdquo;  I do not think that is necessary, because permits will never be given, to use a legal phrase which Deputies Ruttledge and Little, perhaps, will follow, in gross.  A permit will always be given to a certain individual to sell to a certain individual.  You may stock twenty and sell to whom you like.  I would call the attention of Deputy Ruttledge to the last words in sub-section (3), which are to this effect, that the Minister may grant any person a permit subject to such conditions and limitations as he may think fit to impose and shall specify in such permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, if it became necessary, in some <Col N="676" /> strange circumstances which I do not myself foresee at the moment, that it should be advisable that you should trace from hand to hand into whose hands a particular book has passed, then in the particular permit given to the individual that can be set out.  You see that is very broad. You have, on the whole, this to consider, that, administratively, if it ever becomes necessary it can be carried out, and that in cases where it is not necessary it would be, as I have said, a considerable inconvenience and would involve the State in some small expense that is, as regards the printing of these permit books.  I really do not think that the amendment would help the Bill.</P>

      <P>Suppose that some class was studying social problems and that a bookseller applies for, say, thirty copies of a book, a situation would there arise in which the Minister would be put in a certain difficulty.  He would wish to grant the permit and would like to see that this book only went to very special people.  In that case a register would be of considerable assistance to him.  Also it would be very valuable from the point of view of the person who, say, had given the order to the bookseller for the book. Say that in one of the Universities there were five or six people, or perhaps ten people, taking all the Universities together, and that they wished to have a particular book <Col N="677" /> which was prohibited, they would have written or called on their bookseller and asked him to get the book for them.  They would have applied for the permit, and perhaps for some reason or other they might be found with that book.  If they could refer the police to the bookseller and say: &ldquo;You will find my name in the register,&rdquo; or if the police knew that their name was in the register, it would be a protection to them.  It would put them to the minimum of inconvenience in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot meet the Minister with regard to withdrawing this amendment. So far as I understand, and so far as I intended, it is merely for the purpose of protecting what might be called both sides, the people who get the books and the people who dispose of or sell or distribute the books.  If this register is kept it will facilitate both sides, and it will be a protection to the people who are entitled to those books against the books getting into the hands of people who are not entitled to them, and a protection to the people who are entitled to get them from getting into trouble.  I think if the Minister considers it from that point of view he will see that this register would be a necessary safeguard and strength to the Bill and a protection to the people who would be entitled to get a permit under it.  When the Minister talks of very few licences being granted, that is purely a matter of conjecture.  He cannot say at the moment how many licences will be granted.  The Minister, or anybody in the House, can only vaguely arrive at some estimate as to the number that may have to be put into operation.  Perhaps it may be a very large number, but if there were only a few it might be easy to devise a method of control of the register. It has been mentioned by the Minister that there is some sort of analogy between the Firearms Act and the Game Preservation Act.  The Firearms Act may be very necessary, but if we are to believe all we see in the papers from vigilance societies, and <Col N="678" /> such other organisations, the firearms in this country are only a very minor danger compared with the corruption, and so on, that this Bill is intended to protect the people from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not state that I agreed with it myself.  I was just using an illustration.  With regard to the Firearms Act and the Game Preservation Act, registers will be kept.  It is not going to be said, I suppose, that that will impose any great hardship on the people who will have to keep them, and I do not think there will be any difficulty in devising regulations under the Censorship Bill that will enable registers to be kept.  I submit that the keeping of these registers will protect all parties interested, and it is absolutely necessary if you are to prevent books getting out of control and getting into the hands of people not entitled to get them, and in that way getting innocent people into trouble.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I still remain unconvinced by Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Little.  Deputy Little takes concrete examples of students.  How many registers does he mean?  A bookseller is to have a register, and each of the students in a class has to have a register also.  Is that what he intends?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then take the other case.  You find game in the hands of game dealers.  Where or from whom did he buy it?  He must account for that.  Here in this case no purchaser will have a book, and no purchaser will be allowed to let out a book, unless a licence has been granted to him.  What is the meaning of his having a register I do not know.  If he circulates the book the person who is not entitled to the book and in whose possession the book was found would be liable to prosecution and the person who <Col N="679" /> had received the book under permit would also be liable to prosecution. Further, I do not see how the register would help in that.  I think it must be taken for granted that whoever puts the Act into force will be somebody who has a reasonable amount of commonsense, and who will carry out the intention of the Act.  I cannot see the advantage of making the Act unnecessarily cumbersome in the very few cases which in the nature of things must arise.  I think the Bill is a strong Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is advisable or wise to have in this Bill what is unnecessary for effecting its purpose, and what would be considered by the world at large, the booksellers and other persons, as a purely vexatious matter.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.  I would impress on the Deputy that in an occasional case, like a social circle that satisfy the licence-granting authorities they want a book, then provision might be made.  In the case of a large number of indefinite persons, say ten or fifteen persons, special arrangements would have to be made.  That is what the Bill has envisaged, and that is why the Bill says the Minister administratively shall or can so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any provision in the Bill by which a licence must be granted to an individual, the person who gets the book.  &ldquo;If the licence is given the Minister may if he thinks fit grant any person a permit in writing to sell or keep for sale or keep for distribution,&rdquo; and so on.  That is a licence to the distributor and not to the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act could only be administered in the sense that except in abnormal cases no bookseller could be given the right to sell indiscriminately.  Take the Deputy's interpretation, that he keeps a register of the person to whom he sells.  You trace it into the person's hands.  What good is that? What use is it?  You know that a bookseller, Mr. So-and-so, has sold <Col N="680" /> books to Tom Jones, John White, and so on.  What good is that unless these persons have also been investigated as to whether they are fit and proper persons?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case I mentioned of a class, say, of thirty, who require a particular book.  There it would be very much simpler if the bookseller had a register in which he could enter the names and addresses of the persons who wanted the book, and the purpose for which it is wanted.  No one going into his shop, knowing he would have to give his name and address, would venture to do so unless he wanted the book for a bona fide reason.</P>

      <P>In the next amendment there is a suggestion for a register for another purpose, and perhaps I might be permitted to ask the Minister for some enlightenment in this matter.  I assume that the Minister has accepted in principle the idea that there are certain books which it is desirable should not be generally circulated but which should be accessible on special occasions to special persons or authorities.  Is the machinery for divising the suitable person to whom a book should be sold to rest with the Department of Justice? Will it be that a person will apply to the Department of Justice for a permit and that when he gets that permit he will give it to his bookseller when ordering the book?  Now I see a difficulty there.  That book will go through the Post Office and through the Customs.  Under Section 14 of the Bill the Customs are bound to stop that book.  The Minister, therefore, will have to warn <Col N="682" /> the Customs and the Postal authorities &mdash; he will have to send notice of the fact that he has permitted a particular person to get the book. I may be wrong in that, but there is an easier and a more simple way of doing it.  I wonder has the Minister visualised the machinery that will get over this difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so, or else he will have to send a particular form to the bookseller who will send it on.  However, that is a small matter of detail which I have not considered.  That will come under one of the regulations which will be drawn up for the working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is these regulations that will make the whole difficulty. In ordinary practice I get word from the Post Office that goods have been consigned to me which are considered to be contraband and that I must appear in propria persona before a particular body to claim the goods.  Then they tell me that the mere fact that these goods have been sent on &mdash; even though I have no knowledge of them &mdash; may render me liable to a criminal prosecution.  Something between that procedure and the other might be adopted.  If these goods were addressed to a bookseller the information would be sent to me that such goods had been held up and then the onus would be on me to produce evidence.  Perhaps some procedure of that kind might be adopted.</P>

      <P>Amendment 71, standing in my name, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful, under conditions specified in the register (hereinafter referred to as the Register of Prohibited Publications) for any person to import into Saorstát Eireann for his own use or for sale on order to another person (in which case a record of the sale shall be made in a special sales book which shall be open to inspection by officials of the Department of Justice) any book which is entered in the register (hereinafter referred to as the Register of Prohibited Publications) and which is designated in the said register as conditionally prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already discussed this principle and the Minister has given his views on it.  I may be obstinate, <Col N="684" /> unfortunately, but I am not altogether convinced that my amendment is unreasonable.  I accept the Minister's dictum.  Restrictive legislation is always vexatious, but I think the Minister will allow that even restrictive legislation should not be unnecessarily vexatious.  Now I feel that if there were a research student who wanted to get books in a hurry he would feel it a great restriction and a thing that is very annoying and vexatious if the books were held up continually owing to his having to ask for special permission for every one of them.  There was one matter mentioned in the course of the debate.  We provided for medical books and for books on medical jurisprudence.  But scientific books and particularly physiological books and books of a sociological nature might very easily get upon the Black List.  Now it might be desirable that these books should be in the hands of our research students. I wonder could the Minister provide for that by providing that some kind of general permission might be given for a group of books of the type that Deputy Little referred to?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand the Deputy's suggestion, it is that there should be a species of conditional prohibition to meet this point&mdash;that these books are to be imported for a certain class but not for another class.  That would be impossible.  I do not see how you could concede that.  The book goes through the Customs, through the Post Office, and the Customs official would have to discover everything about the natural history of the person who was the consignee.  I do not want to be abrupt with the Deputy but I think I expressed my views upon this section already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister a case where there would be a practical difficulty.  Now, there is a book at present being produced, a book of a sociological nature in connection with the quest of Herbert Spencer.  The purpose of this book is to gather sociological facts on <Col N="685" /> everything, that is, from all books, and to put these facts in tabular form together.  Now, some subjects of sociology would, of course, never come under the ban of the Censorship Board.  There are such questions as war, art, transport, dress, eatables, and so on.  These would not come under the ban.  But there are other subjects that, I presume, would.  There are diseases.  There is a very old disease, syphilis, that has been treated in one of these volumes. Some facts have been brought out recently.  Books of that sort would be necessary to the student of research, but such books might be stopped by the Minister.  There is the difficulty.  In that case I think something like conditional prohibition might be placed upon a group of books.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Flinn's phrase, &ldquo;authorised sewer pipe,&rdquo; is correct. What Deputy Alton was dealing with was serious books which were condemned, but which, nevertheless, a student of sociology might very reasonably expect.  There are persons in the State who might very reasonably expect to get such books. They might find it necessary to set up a concrete thesis as to what the book was advocating.  A man might be writing a thesis contrary to what the book would advocate.  I do not think Deputy Alton's suggestion can be properly characterised as an <Col N="686" />&ldquo;authorised sewer pipe.&rdquo;  I do agree with Deputy Flinn to this extent, that it would be impossible to segregate people except by licence of some sort.</P>

      <P>I may have overstated the case, and possibly I did. I do not want to open the way for what might be characterised as sewage literature coming into this country.  The literature that I do contemplate, as the Minister very kindly explained, is literature of a scientific character, but that should not be for general circulation.  There are many books, for instance, of a physiological and sociological character that might be required in certain circles in the Free State.  Perhaps the Minister could devise some machinery by which they could be readily obtainable by those who would require them.  It is a special case, but it is one that should be catered for, in my judgment.  I think the claim of research students in sociological and other similar matters is a fairly equitable claim.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1), line 26, after the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;and the Minister shall cause to be printed and published in a form available to the public and at regular intervals the Register of Prohibited Publications.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not for the purpose of advertising prohibited books, and I do not think it would have the effect of giving appreciably greater publicity to the books on the list than the method of advertising proposed by the Minister.  It simply is to enable a law-abiding, reputable citizen to obtain information at a particular time as to what the list consists of, so that he may avoid breaking the law.  I do not think it is to be expected that the average person should have to search through back numbers of the official journal in order to find out <Col N="689" /> what books are prohibited.  It is a perfectly natural proceeding that the Minister should get a register of these books, and that is what the amendment seeks to procure.  It also seeks to establish the power of the citizen to obtain knowledge of the register if he so requires and it justifies his reason for asking for it.</P>

(2) Whenever a prohibition order is made there shall forthwith be entered in the register &mdash; (a) if such order relates to a book, the name of such book, the edition or editions of such book to which such order applies, the names of the author and the publisher of such book....&rdquo;  What the Deputy says is that there shall not merely be a publication in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; but there shall be, in addition, a printed copy of the register.</P>

A person buys for a certain sum of money this particular list of books so that he may be able to know what books to read and what books not to read.  I cannot see any objection to that.

      <P>In view of the fact that the next amendment takes a different tone, I would like to reinforce the Minister's willingness.  I hope I am not transgressing the spirit in which, apparently, the Dáil has decided to discuss this matter.  I have a library down in Sligo and in it are some books that conceivably might be put on the register, such as Aristophanes, a <Col N="690" /> translation of Rabelais, and Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights.  Unless there is some printed list issued, before I lend, or even give to a guest staying in the house, any of the books that possibly would be prohibited, I would have to come to Dublin, go to the Department of Justice and inspect the register there.  Surely that is very absurd&mdash;to have to travel about 250 miles in order to satisfy myself that a certain book is not on the list drawn up.  If the Minister prints from time to time a register containing a list of prohibited books and makes it available at a reasonable price, then all law-abiding subjects anxious not to distribute books that have been banned by the Censorship Board will know where they are.  If the register is only to be kept in the Department of Justice and is only available for inspection within limited civil service hours, it will be impossible for a man when he wants to take a book to bed with him to know whether or not he is, by taking a certain book, committing an offence.  That is carrying the censorship to absurdity, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment or the principle embodied in it.</P>

      <P>I will consider that matter as to whether <Col N="691" /> it would be advisable to prevent newspapers from publishing it. There is a good deal to be said on both sides.  On the one side, it is necessary that persons should really know where they are, and, on the other side, it might be that it would encourage persons going out of the country to read such books outside &mdash; that nasty-minded people going outside the country might spend their whole time in reading books which are on the list and that that would not be advisable.  At the same time, they might spend 5/- if they wished to get a copy of this index.

I should like to know what would be the effect for the printer.  Assuming that the publishers were men of straw and that the printer had assets in the shape of machinery and plant, not to say anything about a bank balance, how would the printer stand in that case?  So far there is nothing in the Bill which would make it incumbent on the Department concerned to furnish the printers with a list of suspects.  We are going so far to put any amount of obstacles in the way of certain reading that we might at a later stage do something to encourage good reading.  However that is a matter for another occasion. I want to get some assurance from the Minister, in any case, that when we do set about punishing a person or persons under this section we should not punish the wrong persons. I do not want the printer to suffer for the sins of the publisher.  They are often two distinct persons.</P>

I do not suppose they will go to the trouble of getting nauseous details that would not be public in England.  If they did the person who is the proprietor or editor or publisher of such paper or periodical or book, or the person who is master printer and who breaks the provision would suffer.

      <P>My motive in framing this amendment is to try and secure an improvement in the wording of the Bill.  The words used by the Minister are so loose, and he has cast his net so wide he possibly will get in it matter which he has not contemplated.  I would like to know, for instance, whether in the case of a magazine which might contain advertisements in regard to books, to which reference is made here so frequently, it would ipso facto come under the ban.  I want to be quite sure that while we deal precisely, severely, and inexorably with literature that advocates such matters as the prevention of conception, etc., we may not sweep into the net as well literature that would be comparatively innocuous and which any educated man should be free to read. The words &ldquo;which might reasonably be supposed to advocate&rdquo; are such that a very wide meaning could be given to them.  Nearly everyone, particularly a crank, claims to be a reasonable man.  I would like something more frank and more precise which would prevent abuse of this clause.</P>

      <P>I think I have already forestalled any remarks that I could make on this section when I was dealing with the previous one.  I then explained that this section is the one under which a decision will be come to by the Court. Prosecutions must be brought under this section before a Court which must decide that a book advocates, or may reasonably be supposed to advocate, the unnatural prevention of conception.  That would be a matter entirely to be decided by the Court.  As to whether an advertisement does or does not amount to that, I apprehend it would depend <Col N="699" /> very much on the form of such advertisement. If you get a book or periodical consisting of a whole series of advertisements it might be very indecent indeed.  A Deputy opposite who is now present will recollect that he sent me a copy of a publication which consisted of nothing but advertisements which were most indecent and which could be said distinctly to be advocating the unnatural prevention of conception.  I have already stated that I was willing to make two amendments in this sub-section. One of them is to this effect, namely, &ldquo;unless the seller can show that by the exercise of reasonable care he could not have known the contents thereof.&rdquo;  That is not making him absolutely an insurer of the contents of the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes it clear that if he sells books of this nature, which he has reasonable grounds for thinking may contain propaganda of this prohibited sort, it will be his duty to make some investigation himself into the book.  I have done that because I consider that it might easily happen that a bookseller might suddenly get in a periodical in which he had no reason for thinking was made the medium by any person for this particular class of propaganda and might discover after the first week that it was made such medium.  It would be rather unfair to punish him for that.  On the other hand if he knew that it was a particular class of periodical which previously contained such propaganda he ought to be on his guard.  If he knew that its general tone was likely to be of that nature he ought also be on his guard.  When I accepted the amendment of Deputy Law and Deputy Tierney the other night I also indicated that I would insert an amendment to this effect, namely, &ldquo;any book or periodical publication whether same may appear on the register of prohibited publications or not.&rdquo;  The reason is that certain works, certain publications, may not have been up to then condemned, but he should keep his eye open if they are of a doubtful nature and see that they do not circulate. For instance, a periodical <Col N="700" /> will not, under Section 8, be condemned if it has one particular article of any nature.  It must be general in its tone, but this section says that it will be condemned if it has propaganda of this particular nature in it, even in one issue. Therefore it is necessary to have something of that kind in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not grasp the Minister's reference to propaganda. The problem of birth-control is being discussed in most countries, whether we are in sympathy with it or not.  It is a thing to which we cannot shut our eyes, and if the question can be discussed decently, without advocating or teaching it, I say that some books on the subject could be permitted as no harm would be done to the reader.  A book might, for instance, discuss the problem speculatively.</P>

      <P>The amendment which is down in the name of Deputy Law and myself was really intended to elicit from the Minister what exactly he intended to mean by that phrase, &ldquo;which may reasonably be supposed to advocate.&rdquo; To anyone reading over the section it does not look as if there was any great difference between the word &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; and the phrase, &ldquo;may reasonably be supposed to advocate.&rdquo;  It does not look as if the second phrase was very necessary.  Either the word &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; by itself, or the phrase, &ldquo;may reasonably be supposed to advocate,&rdquo; would perhaps be sufficient.  The whole section has a rather general air about it which looks as if it might be possible that books which it did not intend to cover may be brought under it.  As regards the whole question of the advocacy of birth-control, it occurs to me that it might be possible to <Col N="701" /> make a distinction in a Bill like this between two kinds of advocacy. There is, for instance, the kind of advocacy which consists in definitely advocating and advertising certain methods of contraception. That kind of advocacy would, itself, I think, generally come under the heading of &ldquo;obscenity&rdquo; and could be generally dealt with as an indecent publication, so that there will be very little difficulty about it under this or any other section. There is another kind of publication which consists rather in discussing the matter from what might be called an economic point of view. That is a kind of publication which, as Deputy Alton states, is very common at present, particularly in England, and it raises the question as to how we are to deal with such a publication in this country.  I am not saying that we should not deal with it.  I am not maintaining that that kind of economic advocacy of birth-control is not dangerous.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, as it stands, this section is somewhat too vague and uncertain, and leaves people who are likely to be affected by the Bill in a very doubtful position. Suppose you take an English periodical which is otherwise quite unobjectionable or a book by a celebrated playwright, for example, by a well-known clergyman, or by a famous story-writer, a book which in one of its pages contains language which might be called advocacy of contraception, from an economic rather than from a direct point of view, I think there will always be a difficulty, whether the person to adjudicate is a judge or the Minister or the Censorship Committee, in deciding whether a particular book of that kind comes under this section or not.  There will always be a certain class of publication which will be on the border-line and about which there may be different opinions.  Personally I have no brief for any of these publications, but I can see that booksellers and newsagents will find themselves in considerable difficulty under this section because of the uncertainty that is sure to exist in such cases as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> There are a good many well-known weekly newspapers, a good many English weekly periodicals, which quite often contain articles dealing with this question from an economic point of view, and if that kind of article is to be construed as advocacy of birth-control, then the situation created by this section for our booksellers and newsagents will be a very difficult situation indeed. You will have cases arising in which a newsagent like the firm of Eason here in Dublin will not know whether he has committed an offence until he has been brought into court and tried &mdash; tried for an offence about which he cannot know until the magistrate or the judge has decided whether it is committed or not.  I cannot see how that state of affairs can be regarded as good law. I think it is a most peculiar principle to import into the Bill, that you create a class of offence which you refrain from defining and that you leave the definition of the offence to the judge or magistrate before whom the defendant is brought.</P>

      <P>I do not at all insist that I have the right point of view, but it did occur to me as a danger which I would like to have cleared up.  That is really why I am raising the question.  Take the case of Eason's here in Dublin, Eason's sell half a dozen weekly political journals.  Any one of those journals may contain an article by that well-known clergyman, whom Deputy Byrne quoted here yesterday evening, or by a well-known romance writer or a well-known playwright who advocates this practice from an economic point of view. The advocacy may very well be of <Col N="703" /> such a kind that no two people would agree as to whether it constituted advocacy of birth control or not.  No one could tell in a great many of these cases if the judge would decide whether the possession or sale of the periodical constituted an offence under the Act, and you would have a newsagent in the position of having committed an offence without being certain himself whether it is committed or not until he is brought to court.</P>
      <P>Take another case.  A newsagent like Eason here in Dublin has in his premises an enormous number of books of every kind, books dealing with all sorts of questions, books into a great number of which what we might call economic advocacy of this practice may enter.  The Minister said that it was an unheard of thing that individuals in the now defunct &ldquo;recognised associations&rdquo; should be expected to read every line in every book brought under their notice.  Is it not an equally unheard of thing that a newsagent should be expected to read every line in every book, or even every line in a large number of books, which he has in stock, and that such an agent is likely to be brought into court and tried for the offence of not having read every line of every book, or every line of a large number of books which he has in stock?  That is what the section would amount to, it seems to me.  Deputy Law and I suggested as one way out of this difficulty that publications of this nature might well be decided upon by the Censorship Committee, because I submit it is clearly a question where you have to get a decision.  I am not raising the question as to the merits of any particular decision.  I have no opinion one way or another for the moment.  I am not raising that matter, but I say it is a matter that must be decided clearly. You must have a judge of some kind to decide it, and I submit the judge should give a decision before the newsagent is made liable to prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our way of meeting the matter was to have these publications <Col N="704" /> brought before the Censorship Board in the ordinary way and decided on.  We tried to have that brought about by an amendment to Section 7.  It was pointed out then that the danger arose that books and periodicals of an offensive nature might obtain circulation in the country before they could be brought to the notice of the Censorship Board, and that danger was held, I think, by the Minister to justify him in keeping this section as it stands.  Personally I am still not satisfied that the Bill as it is at present does not contain dangers of persecution, if I might put it so &mdash; dangers of interference in a very objectionable way with booksellers and newsagents &mdash; and I would suggest as a way out that in addition to having this kind of literature brought before the Censorship Board the Minister should also take power to prohibit books and periodicals provisionally&mdash;that is to say, that the Minister should, on his initiative, prohibit a certain book or a certain periodical for a period until there would be time for it to go before the Censorship Board for decision and have it put on the list in the ordinary way.  That would get over the danger that such publications might circulate all over the country before they could be stopped, and it would enable newsagents and booksellers to know when exactly they were committing an offence.  I want to insist that that is the problem you have before you in this section, and I am not satisfied that it is dealt with satisfactorily in the section.  You must enable people who are likely to be prosecuted to know whether or not they are committing an offence. I do not know whether it happens in other cases &mdash; I am not an expert in law &mdash; but it does seem to me as an ordinary citizen that it would be an extraordinary state of affairs if you could bring people into court for crimes that you have not defined.  I think the method that I have suggested would meet the difficulty. Whether it would or not I would like to be satisfied as to the position of <Col N="705" /> booksellers and newsagents under the section, and I hope that the House will press the Minister to make the matter clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>In modification of the suggestion which Deputy Tierney has just made I think the same idea could be worked out by the Minister taking power to inform the bookseller that he is liable to prosecution if he continues to offer for sale such a book or paper, because it has been submitted to the Board of Censors.  I fully agree with what Deputy Tierney has said; he has expressed what was in my mind better than I could have done it myself.  If this is going to be a matter for the judges, surely it is our duty to see that the words in the Bill are as carefully drawn as possible, and not widely and loosely drawn.  But it seems to me that the introduction of such words as &ldquo;which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate&rdquo; is simply making matters difficult for the bookseller or stationer.  Now, I can imagine it being argued on the one side in the case of a particular book that it would not be reasonable care on the bookseller's part unless he had read every line and every word of the book, whereas I could imagine a bookseller putting forward the contention that it was absolutely impossible to read every word and every line of that particular book.  I do not think that there is any difference of opinion between the Minister and myself, and between practically everyone of us here, as to the desirability of stopping a certain kind of thing, but in order to do that the Minister seems to me to be trying to do something that is a great deal more than there is any occasion at all for doing.  It may be that in the word &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; he sees something more than I do; I daresay that he does not mean a reference to this subject.  Possibly he does.</P>

      <P>It depends on the nature of the reference, and it becomes a matter of opinion whether reference is advocacy or not.  It becomes what Deputy Tierney said&mdash;a matter where the bookseller may argue with himself as to whether it is or is not advocacy, and he will not know until he has got a legal opinion as to whether he is breaking the law or not in putting this book up for sale.  The Minister's wide expression is introducing difficulties where there is no need to introduce them. He would achieve his object by using much more closely defined words.</P>

      <P>The plan I have suggested with great diffidence, because the Minister would be able to suggest a much better plan, is that he should refer the publication to the Board of Censors and at the same time inform the bookseller that until a decision is obtained the sale of the publication is prohibited.  That would surely ensure what the Minister desires, unless it is prosecutions he desires, and I submit that in having prosecutions he is not doing what everyone desires.  We want to prevent prosecutions.  I beg of the Minister to consider this section further, and to be as explicit in the words he chooses for it as it is possible for him or others to be.</P>

      <P>My idea, as I said, was not to attempt to define in the Bill a thing that, of its very nature, is only capable of being defined for particular cases.  My idea is that each particular book, newspaper, or article will have to be decided on by some person competent to decide, by some judge or board of judges, if you like, and what I was proposing was that every case of this kind should be referred <Col N="707" /> to the Board of Censors in order that they might give an authoritative decision, pending which decision the Minister should have power provisionally to prohibit anything he thought came under this or some such section.  That would enable booksellers to know where they were, and it would prevent literature of this kind from coming into circulation until there was a definite decision.</P>

      <P>I have fairly settled views on this matter which I am not able to express in public, but I want to say this, that there is a very great difference, as Deputy Tierney has pointed out, between the dissemination of books and articles that advocate certain methods to be used for the prevention of conception and books and articles that are written from what he calls the economic point of view, upon which I feel very strongly myself. There are very many instances where women every year are bearing children &mdash; who have borne a dozen &mdash; and they have no means of giving these children a proper livelihood. Therefore, there should be <Col N="708" /> some control.  As Deputy Little pointed out, that control might be of two kinds.  It might be natural control or unnatural control, and I think that this House feels that books should not be introduced that advocate the unnatural control of conception.  But I would be willing almost to go so far as to say that almost any method should be used in order to prevent the economic conditions that I see around me every day in connection with this problem. I do not want to go into that problem, but I think we should have some means of discriminating between these books, of which I know examples that are advocating certain methods, very serious things to be put into the hands of young people throughout the country, and to which I have the greatest possible objection, whereas I would have entire sympathy with those who are writing articles from the broad economic or social point of view that would, at all events, insist on some efforts being made to exert control over birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the subject in general. Deputy Sir James Craig has used the phrase that he is in entire sympathy with people who advocate a certain course.  I am not criticising Deputy Sir James Craig. I only want to point out that I have not expressed, and I do not wish to express, any sympathy with these people.  I only want to get the Dáil to look at this thing from the point of view of the bookseller, who cannot be sure whether, when a book advocates in a certain vague, distant or indirect way this practice, whether that advocacy constitutes advocacy within the meaning of the Bill or not.  I do not want to discuss, and I do not think we should try to discuss, the economic advocacy of birth-control in general.  But what I do want to point out is that there is a difference from the point of view of the bookseller between advocacy of the means on the one hand, and on the other hand advocacy from the long-distance <Col N="709" /> economic point of view, of what might euphemistically be called by some people the control of population. That makes all the difference, from the point of view of the bookseller, and it is because I wanted to have the exact meaning of the phrase, &ldquo;reasonably supposed to advocate,&rdquo; defined that I raised the matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is &ldquo;reasonably supposed to advocate unnatural&mdash;&rdquo; That is the point.  This clause as it stands is a very excellent practical argument in the mind of the bookseller to give the benefit of the doubt against any publication which he thinks could possibly be reasonably considered as advocating unnatural control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>I remember once hearing of a prisoner who was indicated in Connaught who was asked whether he was guilty or not guilty, and he made answer: &ldquo;How do I know until the jury bring in their verdict?&rdquo;  He seems to have been very much in the same position as Deputy Tierney's stationer, who does not know whether he is guilty or not guilty, as to whether he is selling a book which is or is not advocating these various things, until a magistrate has decided upon the facts of his particular case.  I have been asked to explain the meaning of the words &ldquo;which advocate or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate,&rdquo; etc.  There is a very real distinction between these two things, because we know that there are different classes of books putting forward this particular propaganda.  We know that they are being put forward for different purposes.  We know that some of them are put forward for what Deputy Tierney calls economic reasons.  Others are put forward for what I might call financial reasons, using the words in a very different sense.  Some of them are put forward as Malthus put forward his original doctrine.  Others were put forward for the purpose of selling certain articles, and generally for making money, either that the book <Col N="710" /> itself will get a certain circulation, and be a paying proposition owing to its contents, or that it may be the vehicle for sale of certain things. There are certain classes of these pamphlets sold at 2d. or 3d. which do more harm probably than the larger books, and which are sold entirely for the latter purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that the view which I hold is this: that the motive or the argument which is put forward &mdash; it is always the same argument &mdash; on behalf of this particular kind of control does not matter.  It is always this: &ldquo;If you have not birth control you may have poverty, or the nation may be over-populated.&rdquo;  They appeal either to the individual or to the whole country.  I am equally opposed to both.  I believe that birth control, because a nation may become overpopulated, will inevitably lead to race suicide, and the book which advocates that, no matter what the arguments it puts forward may be, no matter how it is treated, will equally come under this ban here&mdash;&ldquo;which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate.&rdquo; But take the smaller class of book that I mentioned a moment ago. They might very easily condemn this; they might say: &ldquo;We are not advocating it,&rdquo; but they might condemn it in a fashion, and they might say: &ldquo;This must not be done,&rdquo; and then give all particulars of how it could be done, and say: &ldquo;We are not advocating it.&rdquo;  It is because that advocacy, under the guise of censure, should not be permitted to creep away with hypocrisy in this matter, and should not be successful that these words, &ldquo;which might reasonably be supposed to advocate,&rdquo; must come in. It is said that it would be impossible for a bookseller to know.  How does the bookseller know now whether he is selling a decent book or an indecent book?  If he sells an indecent book at present he can be prosecuted. It is very hard, almost impossible as the law stands at present, to prosecute.</P>

Deputy Thrift says the words &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; are too vague.  &ldquo;Reasonable care&rdquo; are words that run all through our law. No magistrate interpreting this section could possibly have before him words with which he is more familiar. They are words that are in daily use. You could not have more simple words.

I have said several times that I do not deny that.  All I maintain is that there is a certain kind of border-line case in this as there is in many other matters which no newsagent, with rights as well as duties, can be expected to decide for himself under pain of prosecution. The Minister has expressed great scorn at the notion that he should be expected to decide in this matter. The Minister is in no way inferior in judgment to any newsagent, and if the Minister is incapable of deciding before the magistrate decides upon a matter, why should a newsagent be capable of deciding?

I can see every newsagent in Ireland puzzled out of his wits as to what he is going to do with practically every newspaper, because there is hardly a newspaper coming over here which will not contain, at one time or another, articles of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the ordinary law of indecency.  That has been in operation for hundreds of years. Practically no book or periodical, except its indecency is of a kind which leaps to the eye, can be made liable to a fine or penalty under that law.  The very fact that it is inoperative is the reason for the presence of this Bill here.  The very fact that it is impossible, in nine out of ten cases, to get a verdict in a prosecution under the old Indecency Act is responsible for the fact that we are bringing this Bill in here.  A kind of prescription has grown up under the ordinary Indecency Act. It is perfectly obvious to anyone that the number of books or papers likely to be met under the Indecency Act is quite small, but in this case, the number of books or papers likely to be dealt with under this section is legion.  Every English book on sociology, any book by a dozen writers I can name, any article or report either in a daily or weekly newspaper that comes over here, is capable of being made subject to a prosecution under this section.  I do not object.  It is quite right it should be so, but I want to see some means found by which the poor bookseller or newsagent can be protected from being prosecuted for ten different offences in the one day.  If that is not going to happen, well and good, but as far as I am concerned I do not see how he can be protected under this section as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that the newsagent <Col N="714" /> would have to read the &ldquo;Saturday Review&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; to decide.  If the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Saturday Review&rdquo; had previous articles dealing with this matter he would be inclined to expect such a thing, and he would glance through the heading or the table of contents. If the &ldquo;Saturday Review,&rdquo; for example, were to come out with an article in favour of birth control, it would be the last thing anybody would expect, the last thing I would expect.  I certainly think it would not require reasonable care to expect that there would be no article of the nature in it.</P>

      <P>I do not think anything the Minister said directly referred to the immediate point under consideration&mdash;the immediate point I have in mind.  That is the case of a book which deals with something disconnected from this subject altogether, but which may drift, in a paragraph or two, or a page or two, into what someone may say was a discussion of the question, into what one person may say was advocacy of it and somebody else may say was advocacy against it.  It may be quite a small section of the book.  What I want to know is, how is the bookseller to decide?  How is he to be prosecuted for something which occupies a very small space in that book?  If he happened to see it, who is to be the judge of whether he is breaking the law or not if he allows the book to be sold?  The Minister says a judge in the Court.  I say I want to keep it from becoming a matter for prosecution altogether, because that is desirable, inasmuch as prosecution <Col N="716" /> leads to advertisement&mdash;the very thing you want to stop.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 87:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1), line 54, to add the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that no book or periodical publication shall be deemed to offend against this sub-section nor be made the subject of a prohibition order under sub-section (3) of Section 7 merely by reason of the fact that it contains an advertisement relating to a prohibited book or publication or to a book or periodical publication in which the unnatural prevention of conception is advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask not merely the indulgence, but the help, of the House in regard to this amendment.  It raises a very difficult and complex point.  I frankly confess that I am not at all satisfied with the method by which we have endeavoured to solve it.  I say that I am not satisfied with it because I recognise that, since the amendment was put on the order paper, certain things have been said <Col N="717" /> and certain instances have been given which show me that the amendment probably shoots beyond the point at which I had aimed.  On the other hand, there is, I venture to suggest to the Dáil, a real, practical difficulty which I have endeavoured, probably unsuccessfully, to meet. Before I explain what the amendment is, let me first explain what it is not, because this amendment, like some others, has been the subject of a good deal of, I dare say, perfectly innocent, but none the less substantial, misrepresentation.  It has been supposed by a great many people that this amendment was designed in order to protect advertisements of contraception, whether by way of advertisement of theory or by advertisement of actual practice.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, I am sure, will not make that mistake.  It is quite obvious, if the amendment is read carefully, that it has nothing whatever to do with anything of the kind.  What it does is this: it suggests that no book or periodical publication shall be deemed to offend against this sub-section or be made the subject of a prohibition order under an earlier sub-section merely by reason of the fact that it contains an advertisement relating to a prohibited book or publication and so on.  The practical difficulty about the whole thing is this: let us take books first. Take the interesting series published by a very well-known and reputable firm of publishers called the &ldquo;Today and To-morrow&rdquo; series.  There is in that series a book called, I think, &ldquo;Hibernia&rdquo; or the future of Ireland.  I confess that I have not read that particular volume, though it is written by a man whom I know. I am told it is a very excellent work. I am certain that it contains nothing even remotely bearing upon any of the questions which we have been discussing here.  Taken by itself, I am quite satisfied that there would be no question whatever of its being prohibited, or that any difficulty would arise in connection with it. But, as everybody knows, it is the habit of booksellers very frequently to insert upon the fly-leaf of their books&mdash;sometimes upon the loose <Col N="718" /> cover of a book, but more often, I think, on the actual fly-leaf &mdash; a list of all the other publications of their firm.  In cases, particularly where you get a book that is one of a series, it is the usual practice of the bookseller to print on the fly-leaf a list of all the books appearing in that series as well as a list of others that are about to appear in it.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it has happened, but I can very well imagine that in a series, such as I am thinking of, in which you have books dealing with all sorts of subjects &mdash; such, for instance, as the future of science, the future of chemistry; I remember one written by a friend of mine which dealt with the future of clothes &mdash; there may be one book in connection with the future of Scotland, say, dealing with future populations.  That book might very well deal with the subject in an objectionable way; possibly it might treat in the most objectionable way this very subject of birth control. See what follows.  In so far as an advertisement is advocacy, and that is a point which I am not attempting to decide at the moment, it might very well be held to be advocacy of birth control.  I apprehend that the very fact of the name of the hypothetical book that I suggest appearing on the fly-leaf in one or other of the series would, unless some amendment such as this were adopted, be sufficient to condemn the entire series under this section.</P>
    <P>Then, again, take the case that has been suggested already by Deputy Tierney, of the great London weeklies. The Minister has said that he reads them.  I know he does, and he will agree with me that, generally speaking, the kind of paper I have in mind, such for instance, as the &ldquo;Nation,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Saturday Review&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; are not papers, whether you approve or disapprove of their politics, which any sane person would ever dream of condemning under this Bill.  Naturally, such a question cannot possibly arise.  I have seen myself once or twice in the advertisement columns of every one of the papers I have mentioned a list <Col N="719" /> of publishers' announcements relating to books which undoubtedly were liable to be condemned for advocating unnatural birth control.  The problem is whether it is worth while risking, because of that more or less accidental association, having publication, in themselves entirely excellent, shut out.  I want to be perfectly frank with the House, but that is the difficulty as I see it on the one hand.  I also see the difficulty on the other hand, that though the amendment certainly was not intended to protect, and I do not think could possibly have the effect of protecting, advertisements advocating birth control or the methods of birth control, it might conceivably happen that where the advertisement was the substantial thing, and the text alongside it was really only an excuse, then an amendment of this kind might operate to protect &mdash; in other words, the amendment might lend itself to evasion of the law.  As I do not desire that, I am not proposing to press the amendment.  Having explained the difficulty, as I have seen it, I ask the Minister, before the Report Stage, to give the matter careful consideration in order to see whether he cannot do what I have failed to do &mdash; that is, to find a form of words to obviate the danger I have in mind while at the same time not running into the contrary danger I desire to avoid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that a certain type of Deputy in this House is more interested in the external population of this country than the internal population. We have listened to an address by Deputy Law endeavouring to prove to this House that certain things existed in this amendment which every man of common sense knows do not exist.  He tells us, in the first instance, that this amendment is not designed to protect the advertisement of contraception. Throughout the whole debate the one thing I have advocated in connection with this Bill was the exercise of a little common sense. <Col N="720" /> Anyone reading this amendment can only come to the one conclusion, and that is that it is the most dangerous that could possibly be inserted. Deputy Law is concerned with the interests of a certain class of people. You may insert a list on the fly-leaf dealing with a series of published books, he said, and, he goes on to add, that list might contain something dealing with future population. The second point he makes in advocating his amendment is that a list of books advocating birth control might be incorporated in these particular books by some means or other.  When these books are coming in to this country, and the people who are handling them know that certain legislation exists here, is there not an easy, obvious remedy, and that is to take precautions and see that lists advertising objectionable books are not incorporated in the periodicals coming in?  I say that the very thing Deputy Law suggests could not happen under this Bill is the very thing that will happen.  I say this is a very easy means for the advertising of contraceptive methods.</P>

      <P>My view of the question as to how the Bill will be interpreted is, if there was a mere catalogue somewhere in a newspaper of books that are offensive that newspaper should not be condemned simply because of the mere catalogue of books.  Otherwise, you would have to condemn your own list of censored books because it contained the names of the censored books.  I do not think the mere fact that the names of books appeared, without any idea as to their contents, should be sufficient to condemn any periodical or other book.  I think that would be quite wrong.  On the other hand, I can understand an advertisement which would be of such and such a book by such and such an eminent writer, and stating &ldquo;this is the most valuable book ever written on birth-control,&rdquo; and which might go on in that fashion, being an advocacy of birth control.  I think as the Bill stands the nature of the advertisement would be the thing to decide whether it would be a question of advocacy or not of birth control.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that no prosecution for an offence against this section of this Act shall take place unless the book or periodical publication in question shall have been referred to the Board for report and that the Board shall have reported that its indiscriminate circulation should be prohibited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think we have been discussing this amendment for some considerable time.

I understand perfectly that every speaker on this section was agreed that this propaganda should be held in check, but certain speakers thought that certain methods were more effective than the methods which had been put forward in the Bill.  I want to make it perfectly clear that Deputy Tierney, Deputy Law, Deputy Thrift and Deputy Alton, in anything they have said and in any action they have taken in this House have not in any way advocated birth control. I say that because Deputy Byrne seems to have a different opinion, and since Deputy Byrne has rather flung out that opinion, that Deputy Tierney and Deputy Law regarded birth control as a matter of no importance, I say emphatically that their speeches did not leave any such impression on my mind.</P>

      <P>I formally move the Second Reading of this Bill. I am not taking responsibility for it, but I am moving it to give the House an opportunity of pronouncing for or against the Second Reading &mdash; that is, for or against the general principle of the Bill.  This Bill was introduced into the Seanad to bring in some minor modifications into the Children Act of 1908.  Our attitude towards the Bill is not one of complete acceptance and it is not one of rejection.  We are quite willing to accept the Bill provided that certain amendments could be introduced in the Committee Stage which we think essential from the point of view of principle and from the point of view of the general working of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the Children Act of 1908 that is referred to in this Bill enumerates the various grounds on which children can be committed to industrial schools.  A number of people, for some time, have thought that these grounds are not sufficiently exhaustive.  In fact, it has been pointed out that some offence has to be committed by the child or else that the parent is incapable of exercising control over the child; otherwise, unless there is some fault on the part of the child or parent no power lies with the magistrate to commit the child to an industrial <Col N="726" /> school.  Hence you have had what might be called collusion in the case. For instance, a parent anxious to get a child into an industrial school, or a guardian anxious to get a child into an industrial school, must go through a certain formula.  The child must have been found guilty of an offence such as begging.  Begging is, I think, the usual form that has to be gone through, so that the child, merely on the grounds of the destitution of the parents, could be admitted.  That is the real ground, the ground of destitution, but nominally on the ground of begging the child is sent to an industrial school.</P>
    <P>The Bill from the Seanad proposes to add a new section to Section 58 of the 1908 Act extending the power of the magistrate in this particular case and, in the case of an infant, of a child found destitute who is not an orphan, he or she may be committed on the grounds of what we call the destitution of the parents.  In practice that may sometimes occur.  But it is really a kind of subterfuge for the alleged offence of begging.  It was, I am sure, in order to get rid of that objectionable practice and in order to recognise that destitution is one of the reasons for the committal of the child, that Senator Brady introduced this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>My particular objection to the Bill as it stands is that I do not think the State or the magistrate should have power to take away the child from the parent merely because of destitution without the consent of the parent.  If the House thinks it well to give this Bill a Second Reading we shall ask the House on the Committee Stage to accept an amendment to the effect that under this particular sub-section no committal shall take place without the consent of the parent and, furthermore, that the responsible Minister, in this case the Minister for Education, shall, at the end of the school term &mdash; there are a couple of terms in the year&mdash;release the child if the child is committed under this sub-section.  As it stands, that is how the Bill would work, <Col N="727" /> though I know that it is not the intention, so far as I gather from the speeches in the Seanad.  I know that such was not the intention of the Senator responsible for the Bill, nor was it the intention of those who supported him.  But the Bill as it stands would seem to be an invasion of parental authority, and my view is that if the House gives this Bill a Second Reading it ought to make it clear on the Committee Stage that there is no such invasion of parental authority in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which concerns the committal of children on the grounds of destitution or where destitution may be one of the matters that may be operative in bringing about the committal of the child to an industrial school.  That is, however, a matter that concerns the Minister for Local Government and Public Health more than it concerns my Department, and he will be able to explain his attitude in the matter.  I want to make it quite clear that we accept no responsibility for this Bill.  I am formally moving the Second Reading. I will vote for the Second Reading with the very distinct understanding that if there is a Second Reading I will, on the Committee Stage, advocate a radical alteration of the Bill on the lines I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the view put forward by the Minister with regard to this Bill.  There was certainly doubt in the minds of a number of my colleagues on these benches as to the advisability of supporting the Bill as it stands, having in view the fact that there was no reference to any consultation with parents or guardians.  The child, without reference to parents or guardians could, without any offence having been proved against it, be taken away and put in some industrial school.  As the Minister has stated that amendments on the lines of safeguarding the rights of the parents and also of the child will be introduced, we are prepared under these conditions to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Ex-Senator Brady asked me to support the Bill, and I am glad to do so because it gives me an opportunity to make one or two points quite clear.  The simple thing the Bill wishes to do is to get over the necessity that arises for convictions for a nominal offence against the law.  Ex-Senator Brady has expressed himself to me, and written to me, that he had no intention of going contrary to the wishes of parents, and he is quite prepared to accept an amendment on the lines the Minister suggests &mdash; that such committal shall not be without the consent of the parents.  There are other matters, including one about finance, which will come up later. It may be necessary to put forward some other amendment to prevent additional expense.</P>
      <P>If it is a case of sheer necessity, where the parents are absolutely destitute, even if it costs the State a little, I would urge the desirability of permitting the committal to an industrial school where the child would get a training, and the complete desirability of getting over the necessity for branding the child as having at one time been committed for even a technical offence against the law.  I hope the House will accept the Bill, and amend it in Committee so as to make it satisfactory to all parties.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the Second Reading with the greatest pleasure.  I have a case in point where a woman who was a cook got married.  After six children were born, her husband died and she was unable to support the children. She wished to return to service and an effort was made to place out the children.  She was most anxious to get two boys placed in an industrial school and she actually sent them out to break a window in order to get them arrested and so have some excuse to put them into an industrial school.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will meet a case of that sort. One could not say that this woman was absolutely destitute; but she wanted to go to service again in order to earn money to send some of <Col N="729" /> her family to school.  It is very necessary that we should include something to prevent children being sent out to break the law in order to qualify for entry into an industrial school.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to refer to, and that is the cost per head of children in these industrial schools.  I understand it is 12/6.  If you commit two children to the school it will be 25/-.  Suppose the parents got that amount instead, would it not be better in the interests of the children?  While favouring the principle of the Bill, I contend it is a very poor home indeed that is not better than the best industrial school, if the children can be kept under parental control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say something on the lines mentioned by Deputy Fahy.  I feel very keenly on this point, that where people are destitute, and where the only crime against the parents is that they are destitute, their children should be torn from their side and sent to school.  The principle is wrong.  It has been repeatedly pointed out to me in the police courts, where parents have been sued for the maintenance of children in industrial schools, that the State has to pay 12/6 for each child in the school.  If people are so destitute as to warrant the taking away of their children because they are absolutely starving it might be just as well to make some extra contribution besides ordinary relief, if there is any given, to those people, or otherwise the distribution of food.  I do not want to press this matter now, but I would be inclined to favour some amendment on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point.  Are we going to classify industrial schools, or will the position be that you will have children committed to an industrial school where you have other children who have actually committed offences, and who would be bad companions for those children who have committed no offences?  I am not impressed by Deputy Thrift's <Col N="730" /> attitude in the matter.  I feel that although certain people are poverty stricken the affection and love between the parent and the child are not impaired.  I have found on many occasions that people in lowly circumstances have sacrificed themselves for their children, and are more prepared to do so than people in higher ranks of life.  I was rather sorry to hear the view expressed by Deputy Thrift.  I would welcome some alterations in keeping with the Minister's suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the Local Government Department, there are some objections to tackling the Bill in this way.  I want to mention them at this stage, so that if, in hammering out amendments to the Bill for the Committee Stage, Deputies think the points are not sufficiently made, then they can be dealt with in another way.  When we are dealing with the question of a destitute child we are dealing with a person entitled to relief under the Poor Law Acts.  The whole tendency of the changes made in Poor Relief legislation, within recent years at any rate, has been to preserve the home, and the steps in relief that have been recommended are, in the first place, home assistance and, in the second place, as regards children boarded out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only when children cannot be relieved either by the granting of home assistance or by, in certain circumstances, boarding them out, that turning to an industrial school, or any other class of institution, to look after them is recommended. This Bill, as it stands, in the first place, does not relieve the child and the people connected with the child from what are almost quasi-criminal proceedings, because under the 1908 Act, any person can bring a child before a Petty Sessions Court for receiving alms.  It is proposed in this Bill to bring the child before the court as a destitute child, but the difference between a charge of being destitute and a charge of receiving alms seems to be a very slight one when you bring the child into court at all.  So that there is <Col N="731" /> that aspect of it.  In the second place, if we assume the Bill is amended to include the consent of the parents, the local authority responsible for poor relief is entirely kept out of it.  Not only that, but instead of falling on the authority for poor relief, the charge for the child's maintenance in an institution would fall upon the county council or the borough council rather than the poor relief authority. That seems to raise the point of weakening the sense of responsibility of the authority responsible for poor relief by creating a situation in which any person or court can interfere to look after a destitute child, with the authority responsible for poor relief practically washing its hands of the situation.</P>
    <P>If we consider the situation outside the city and county of Dublin, under the county schemes, although it does not seem to be fully appreciated, there is, in fact, power for any board of public assistance to provide for the maintenance in an institution of any person who would be entitled to relief.  So that there is nothing to prevent, so far as I am advised, outside the city and county of Dublin, a board of public assistance sending a destitute child to an industrial school without the intervention of any court and without the unsatisfactory proceeding of relieving the body responsible for relief of the charge of the child, and transferring the charge to the county council.  So that, in so far as the area outside Dublin city and county is concerned, I am advised that this Bill is practically not wanted.</P>
    <P>Inside the city and county of Dublin, a child, who is not an orphan, cannot at present be sent to an industrial school at the public cost, even if the parents agree, unless the parents are inmates of the workhouse, or unless it is made a subject of quasi-criminal proceedings under the 1908 Act.  Possibly, when amendments are proposed to the Bill, we will decide that the Bill is not necessary outside Dublin city <Col N="732" /> and county, and that inside Dublin city and county the situation might be met by an amendment of the Pauper Children (Ireland) Act, 1898, by which the body responsible for poor relief inside the city and county of Dublin could send a destitute child to an institution without its parents being in the workhouse. Exception was taken in the Seanad to dealing with this matter in a piecemeal way, and I have a certain sympathy with that, particularly when the difference between charging a child before a court with being déstitute and charging it with receiving alms hardly warrants this particular measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the actual effect of being brought into court and charged with receiving alms, or charged with being destitute, is concerned, there is a very thin line.  The Minister for Education has spoken of the necessity for seeing that, whatever is done, the parents' consent shall be obtained, and I think it would be entirely away from the spirit of our recent poor law legislation if that were left out.  I submit that it would be most undesirable that children, when destitute, should be sent to an industrial school without the consent of the local body responsible for poor relief, or their being brought into the matter in some way.</P>

I might say that I think ex-Senator Brady made it quite clear in the Seanad that he had no intention of interfering with the rights of parents.  He was under the impression that the Bill actually provided for that, and I know that is his personal <Col N="733" /> view.  I want to make it clear that what he really wanted to get rid of was the kind of thing that Deputy Sir James Craig referred to, namely, the necessity there was for parents to get their children to commit a real or nominal offence, and to get a conviction for a real or nominal offence in order to get the child into an industrial school.  I think that was the main purpose he had in introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>To delete in lines 33 and 34 the words &ldquo;and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to alter the Constitution by providing that casual vacancies in the Seanad shall be filled in future by elections at which the candidates shall be nominated in such manner in all respects as shall be prescribed by law, and at which the electors shall be the members of Dáil Eireann and <Col N="734" /> Seanad Eireann voting together. The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together.&rdquo; It is designed to effect the purpose of assuring that in the case of future elections to fill casual vacancies in the Seanad, members of the Dáil, alone, will have the right to record their votes.  This Bill, of course, is one of a series on which we had some discussion during the previous session.  I have no doubt it will be contended by speakers on the opposite side that the alteration which it suggests in the Constitution is consequential upon the passing of the Seanad Electoral Act before Christmas.  In the various discussions upon these previous Constitution Amendment Bills we expressed our views upon the question of, not merely the existence of the Seanad itself, but, also, upon its method of election with clarity, I hope, but, certainly, at some length.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the President's witticism.  We, therefore, despite what the President thinks to the contrary, are of opinion that any proposal to alter the machinery of government in this State, whether the proposal be to improve or to wreck it, is of sufficient importance to merit the very serious consideration of members of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the President approves of that.  As the Constitution wrecker, par excellence, his approval is worth having. The President will remember when this Bill came before the House on Second Reading he endeavoured to score a point by indicating to us that by opposing it we were running the risk of allowing the filling of casual vacancies to remain exclusively in the hands of the Seanad instead of, as he proposed, in the hands of the Dáil and Seanad together.  We did not admit, at that <Col N="735" /> time, that our attitude was in any way illogical.  We opposed the Bill, as we opposed all the Bills that the President introduced, because we disapproved, and still disapprove, of the entire scheme of constitutional reconstruction, which the Select Committee set up by the Dáil and Seanad proposed.  On the occasion, therefore, of the Committee Stage of the Bill, when it is possible to put in amendments, we can indicate the particular view we hold upon particular matters and in favour of ensuring a straight vote in the House for or against these views.</P>
      <P>Of course I think it is not unlikely the President will take the opportunity of telling us again that if the amendment is defeated that in opposing this section of the Bill we will be again risking the restoration to the Seanad of the sole right of filling casual vacancies.  However, we are prepared to take the risk of appearing to be inconsistent on a matter of that kind because if we ensure the rejection of the Bill by the Dáil it will necessitate the revision of the entire scheme which is embodied in all those multitudinous Constitution Amendment Bills.  Of course in order to prevent any wrong notion concerning our attitude towards the whole question of the Seanad's existence it is well, I think, that I should reiterate that in the present constitutional position of the State there does not appear to us any reason whatever why a Second Chamber should be in existence, exercising the powers which the present Seanad exercises or the powers it exercised before this zeal for constitutional reform overwhelmed the Government.  That we do try to effect casual amendments in that scheme is not to be taken as representing any alteration in our attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the opportunity here, in connection with the Bill introduced by Deputy Thrift, of pointing out that as we are not sufficiently strong to carry our main objective by abolishing the Seanad altogether, we intend, whenever we get an opportunity to decrease its powers, to <Col N="736" /> lessen its effectiveness and to reduce its cost to the people.  The purpose of the amendment I am now moving is to ensure that in respect to the filling of casual vacancies, at any rate, the fullest possible control shall be exercised by the Dáil in relation to the Seanad.  The Dáil, of course, rejected previous propositions which came from this side of the House designed to provide that the ordinary normal elections for members of the Seanad which take place every three years should be left, exclusively, to the Dáil.  Now in fighting the same battle, more or less, in respect of casual vacancies, we are, as it were, defending the last line of defence. We are hoping that even at this last stage it might be possible to induce the Executive to throw some little sop to democracy.  It might be possible, I say, although we have very little hope that they will do so.  The Executive are, no doubt, committed in many ways, to maintain the Seanad and to increase its powers to impede the course of legislation, and it is not likely that they will abandon their commitment in consequence of any arguments that I can put forward. They are not open to argument and they are not open to conviction.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to suggest to such Deputies as are here present, and who have read this Bill, and who have any interest in the matter, that there are considerations to be taken into account in connection with the election for casual vacancies that do not apply to the ordinary triennial election.  We pointed out on the occasion of the introduction of previous Constitution Bills and the Seanad Electoral Bill, that as the period for which a Senator is elected is nine years, it is inevitable that at least one general election for the Dáil must take place between the beginning of such a Senator's term of office and its conclusion.  A general election for the Dáil at any time may result in a change of the Executive and an alteration in the policy of the majority of the House.  It may do that at any time; but it is almost inevitable it will next time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not prophecy. That is a mere statement of fact. The point I want to make, however, is that changes in the Seanad cannot possibly be effected as rapidly as changes can be effected in the Dáil, and that although there is at present in the Seanad a majority of members empowered to do everything which the Executive Council wishes them to do, that will not be the case after the next general election.  That majority, when there is an Executive in office which is anxious to work in the interests of the Irish people, may find amongst themselves strength to resist in a way they have not yet demonstrated.  In that case a rather serious constitutional crisis might arise.  It is to lessen the risk of such constitutional crisis arising that this amendment is proposed.  It is quite possible that shortly after that general election, in anticipation of that constitutional crisis, a number of Senators might resign, and there would be then a number of casual vacancies to be filled, in which case we think it very advisable that the majority which will be in the Dáil should have an opportunity of ensuring the smooth working of the machinery of government by substituting for the resigned Senators a number who will hold the same opinions as that majority holds.  In that way we would lessen the serious risk of conflict of views and would enable the majority in the Dáil to proceed with its work without any serious danger of it being successfully impeded in the Second Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President will, no doubt, take the opportunity of remarking that I seem to suppose that the Second Chamber will continue its existence for some time, be it long or short after that new Executive Council comes into office.  I do not suppose anything of the kind, but I think there is a possibility that the new Executive Council will have much more important work to deal with in the beginning than such questions as the abolition or retention of the <Col N="738" /> Seanad, and it might not be able to deal with such questions for some months after it took office, and it is during those months that the constitutional crisis which I fear might happen.  It is true that members elected to fill casual vacancies only hold office until the next normal election takes place, and it may be argued that the majority in the Dáil, no matter how strongly they feel on a matter of this kind, would see the advisability of allowing things to develop in the normal way until that triennial election was due to be held, and then utilise the power they posses with their votes in order to ensure the election to the Seanad of a number of more suitable Senators than are now in that Chamber. Against that, however, I think it is right to point out that anyone who takes any interest in the proceedings of the Seanad, and anyone who goes to the labour of reading their Official Reports, might become impatient, and it is a bad thing for the Dáil to risk the possibility of making the Executive Council impatient in dealing with a serious constitutional matter of this kind, because an impatient Executive Council, as was demonstrated to us in the past, can be induced to take rash action.  It is much better for members here &mdash; we are all cool now &mdash; to consider in coolness and in calmness this matter and to take a course which would avoid the possibility of a crisis arising after the next election.  I do not suggest that if we accept this amendment members will ensure that no such crisis will arise, but it will serve, at least as a small and, no doubt, effective safety valve.  It would have been much better if members here adopted our other amendments on all the other Constitutional Bills, but, even at this late hour, and having had an opportunity of considering the matter after a fairly long adjournment, we may now induce them to see the light. That, no doubt, may be a rather difficult task.  I do not think that I would be incorrect in saying that at present not two members sitting on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches <Col N="739" /> have the least idea what this Bill is about, but they, of course, vote for it.  Possibly, with the exception of the President, who has been studying the matter for the last half hour not one Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy could tell us what this Bill proposes to do.</P>

      <P>A threat.  For the benefit of Deputy Cooper I will explain this matter again.  The Constitution provides, or did provide&mdash; as a matter of fact I am not quite sure how this particular section of the Constitution now stands, as I think we have already amended it, but enough of it remains at any rate to support this particular Bill &mdash; that casual vacancies in the Seanad would be filled by election, the voters being members of the Seanad alone. In March, 1928, a Special Committee consisting of a number of members of the Dáil and a number of members of the Seanad was set up and the majority of that Committee reported in favour of altering that system of filling casual vacancies and substituting for it election by members of the Seanad and members of the Dáil voting together.  They also proposed to alter the method of nomination. We have not yet been informed of the intentions of the Executive Council with respect to the method of nomination in the filling of casual vacancies.  Possibly we will have another opportunity of educating them in constitutional matters when the Bill dealing with that particular item is introduced. The Bill at present before the House, although it leaves the matter of nomination to be determined by law, provides that the election will be <Col N="740" /> carried out by the members of the Dáil and the members of the Seanad voting together.  We propose to amend that Bill by cutting out the Seanad and thus leaving it to the members of the Dáil to participate in the election to fill casual vacancies.  Now that Deputies know what they are voting on I will state briefly the arguments in favour of the amendment.  In the first place, when a member is elected to fill a casual vacancy, he only holds office until the next ordinary normal election. He does not hold office for nine years.  He is only dressed in a little brief authority.  It may be argued from that that it makes no difference how they are elected, and possibly there is some force in that argument in view of the fact that the Seanad can be of little good in any case, although there are six just and good men there now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One man there was office boy on the President's newspaper. It really makes very little difference who is elected.  The Seanad is useless in any case, and, in view of the fact that these members are elected for a short period, any system of election will do provided it is cheap and quick.  As against that, I would inform members here that we have decided to increase considerably the powers which the Seanad exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have disposed of this Bill we will take presumably Constitution Bill No. 12, the Bill which proposed to increase in a particular respect the powers exercised by members of the Seanad.  It is not unlikely in the event, as I pointed out, of a general election resulting in a change in the personnel of the Executive Council that members of the Seanad might embark upon an obstructionist policy.  They could easily do so.  Very carefully planned out amendments to the <Col N="741" /> Constitution have been carried through the House for the purpose of enabling them to carry out obstruction.  Of course, we contend, and always did contend, that the Seanad was created originally for obstructionist purposes.  It was intended to be there as a brake on members of the Dáil if members of the Dáil should attempt to legislate or to alter the Constitution in such a manner as to enable this nation to progress in the direction of greater freedom than that which it now enjoys.  A delay of even six or twelve months might be a serious matter in the life of the nation, particularly if Bills rejected by the Seanad were matters dealing with urgent public affairs.  And we know the Seanad can hold up Bills, even those passed unanimously by the Dáil, for a period of about twenty months if they so desire.  In anticipation of a large number of resignations from the Seanad after the next general election &mdash; members on the opposite side of the Dáil will not get an opportunity of resigning &mdash; and quite a number of casual vacancies arising to be filled, we think it very desirable that the remaining members of the Seanad should have no opportunity of participating in these elections and that only members of the Dáil should participate.  In fact, I think a strong case could be made out that only members of the majority Party in the Dáil should have a say as to who will be voted in as substitutes for the resigned members.  In that way almost simultaneously with the change in the Dáil you will have a change in the Seanad and a constitutional crisis will be avoided.</P>
    <P>We do not like constitutional crises.  Because of that we are anxious, as I said, to take counsel with each other.  I do think that in a moment of peace and calm such as now exists, the best course to take is to avoid having an unpleasant happening in a time of strain or great excitement such as might possibly arise after a general election. We urge, therefore, upon members of the Government Party, now that <Col N="742" /> they understand what the Dáil is about, to realise that it is in the best interests of themselves, their constituents and their colleagues in the Seanad, that they should support the amendment.  That amendment, if carried, will effect a very small but important item in the scheme which the Joint Committee proposed and which the Government accepted.  If it is rejected then that scheme in all its horribleness will be carried through, and those who support it will be sowing the dragon's teeth which some day may grow up as a constitutional crisis.  For that reason I ask the Dáil to pass the amendment.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate feature about the discussion of this particular amendment at the moment is the absence of its author.  I had occasion on another amendment to another Bill to draw attention to the fact that the leader of the Party opposite had abandoned his own child.  This is the second child he has abandoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly a very trite observation.  It is no wonder.  Looking over the report of the proceedings referred to by Deputy Lemass I find that on this matter of casual vacancies the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad moved: &ldquo;That the Joint Committee recommends that no change be made in the provisions of the Constitution relating to the method of filling a casual vacancy in the Seanad.&rdquo;  An amendment to that was proposed by Deputy de Valera: &ldquo;To delete all words after the word &lsquo;recommends&rsquo; and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;That a casual vacancy in the Seanad be filled by election by the original electing body,&rdquo; the original electing body having been already decided by the Committee to be the Dáil and Seanad voting together.</P>

      <P>I am doing so, but it so happens that the tail is bigger than the dog.  The Deputy proposed that vacancies should be filled by the original electing body, which was the Dáil and the Seanad voting together. This is the second child which has been abandoned by this great leader.  For a long time I could not understand what it was that occupied Deputy Lemass's mind in his long speech, but it is now clear that he was trying to cover up the tracks, the unfortunate tracks, of this leader possessed of two minds &mdash; one at the Committee and another here when there is an opportunity of posing.  I would say to Deputies opposite: &ldquo;Do not pose.&rdquo;  If they would only recollect that there is a very intelligent public outside who know very well the intelligence, capacity and ability of Deputies opposite and who will not give them the opportunity which they sigh and weep for until they get a little more experience of public matters, they would show a little more commonsense in dealing with any matter that comes before the Oireachtas and stop posing.  That is the most important of all.</P>

      <P>As we know, members of the Executive Council never interrupt. <Col N="744" /> They certainly never interrupt to stand over, with their own money, things which they assert.  I think this is about the fourth time I have had an opportunity of offering members of the Executive Council, the temporary occupants of that position, the opportunity to make money, and in every single way, however definite may have been their assertions, when asked to stand over them with some of their own money they have always evaporated when it came to that test.</P>
      <P>My belief is that they will evaporate also in exactly the same way when they come to the test of a general election.  If I had risen for the thoroughly disorderly purpose of discussing the future prospects of the Government, if I was supposed to be here for the purpose of destroying Cumann na nGaedheal at the next general election, I should not waste my time: Cumann na nGaedheal is quite capable of destroying itself before the next general election without any help whatever.  And the work that we have here to do, and the work that we have to do in the country in relation to that, is not to ensure that Cumann na nGaedheal, after it has had that test, will never again be the Government of this country.  That is not our task.  Our task is to see that there will be in this country an educated and a live public opinion which will see that their successors do what the present Government has never done &mdash; put the interests of this country before the interests of a party.</P>

      <P>The question, I think the Chair will agree with me, which I am discussing is the question as to whether the Seanad should be allowed to have any further say in the responsible function of filling its casual vacancies for the next couple of years.  Why should it?  I think that a member of the Labour Party has already told us that members of the Seanad are paid £7 10s. an hour for any work they do.  Is that any reason why they should continue to have a voice in electing themselves? We know that an effort has been made in the last few weeks to get the Seanad to do some work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If we cannot discuss the qualities, the conduct and the qualifications of the members of the Seanad it is very difficult to argue whether or not they are a competent body to elect themselves.  That is my difficulty, and what I suggest to you is that everything in relation to the Seanad&mdash;its personnel, its conduct, what it has done, and what is has failed to do&mdash;is relevant to the question of their qualifications to be regarded as electors.</P>

      <P>Well, if the Chair would permit me to say it, I would not like to be taken as saying that their performances are irrelevant. We are to have the Seanad and the Dáil electing by some secret ballot. It seems to me that it is very relevant to consider exactly the nature, the record and the performance of every man who, under a secret ballot, is allowed to elect even to casual vacancies in the Seanad, because while a man whose record may be questionable, whose performances may generally be irrelevant, whose general record may be undesirable, may openly and without very great damage exercise certain functions, it is perfectly obvious that the same man should not be allowed secretly to influence and secretly to do the same thing.  For instance, if you have found a man going straight in the daylight you may be inclined to follow him in the dark; but if you have not found him going straight in the daylight that is a very sound reason for saying that he is a man who must not be allowed to be your guide in the dark.  I would like to illustrate that, if I may, by a little story which I think will prove to be ad rem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I see.  The amendment is to delete in lines 33 and 34 the words &ldquo;and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together&rdquo;. We object to members of Seanad Eireann voting at all in a matter of this kind, because we do not think that such a body is properly constituted, either in personnel or in any other way.  We think that body was set up for a purely obstructive purpose; we think it has very admirably fulfilled that function in relation to everything that was good for Ireland.  We know that it was professed to be set up for the purpose also of obstruction in matters that were evil for Ireland, and we know that in very serious matters which were definitely evil for Ireland it did not hold them up for one single moment; that there was a conspiracy to prevent actions of that kind being held up, even for the two or three days which would have enabled them to be reviewed by a full Dáil, as distinct from a Dáil which was made up of a single party.  A body that so repudiated its primal function, that so refused to hold up bad and evil legislation, which now happily has passed into memory &mdash; the Public Safety Act &mdash; can anybody contend that such a body is entitled in perpetual succession to have the power of influencing the personnel of legislatures in this country?  That seems to me a very sound reason why the Seanad should not elect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason why the Seanad should not elect is that it is made up of people who have been elected, or <Col N="748" /> brought together, or joined, or thrown in, or any other words you like to use, on all sorts of different franchises.  Some of them have been elected by 23 per cent. of the people; some of them have been elected by the President; some of them have been elected by themselves; some of them have been elected by a mixture of themselves and this Dáil.  There is not what you might call a common denominator amongst them; there is no common qualification by which you can say: &ldquo;These men as a body are good.&rdquo;  Some of them might be very good; some of them are deplorably bad.  At any rate, what is perfectly obvious is that when you add their votes together you are not adding things with a common denominator.  You are adding two months and two elephants and making four.  That may strike you as a rather strange statement, but it is true.  You are adding nominated men to semi-elected men, and you are taking their votes as if they were of equal value. You are pretending to regard them as a body which has some common principle, which enables votes in it of individual men to be of equal value.  Can any man suggest they are?  We know perfectly well that that thing, from the day it began until now, has been going through a state &mdash; I do not know whether you would call it development or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Local Elections (Dublin) Bill, 1929. - Adjournment&mdash;Vesting of Judicial Holdings.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice yesterday that I would raise a question as regards vesting of judicial holdings on the adjournment to-day because I did not consider that the reply received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the question I put by any means satisfactory.  I intended during the past five or six months to raise this question definitely, but I thought that those who came here to represent directly the agricultural community&mdash;the Farmers' Party&mdash; would raise the matter themselves. I do not think I need impress on any member of the House the deplorable position of the farmers in Ireland. But the position of the tenants who are not vested is far more deplorable. I know cases in my own constituency where those tenants were getting voluntary reductions from the landlord of 35 per cent.  The compulsory Bill which was passed in 1923 increased the rents of those tenants by 10 per cent.  Since then, those tenants have been paying that increase.  That is one of the blessings of the Land Act of 1923.  Last week, in reply to a question put by Deputy Allen, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that the Land Commission had published in provisional lists of lands to be vested 18,978 holdings of tenanted lands, situate on 1,890 estates, comprising an area of 703,841 acres.  Of these, 6,114 holdings on 1,067 estates, comprising 243,516 acres, have already been vested.  There are, therefore, 12,864 tenant farmers who are paying this 10 per cent. increase in their rents. Those tenants are suffering a far greater injustice than that, because they cannot enjoy the benefit&mdash;if there is any benefit&mdash;of the Agricultural Credit Act.  Although loans have been granted them, they have been informed that no advance can be made them until such time as the holdings are vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the reply given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. In his reply to me yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;Before any holdings can be vested in the tenants, the correct particulars thereof must be ascertained and the boundary surveyed, and matters arising on surveyors' and inspectors' reports must be dealt with and commissioners' rulings discharged.&rdquo;  I do not know how those questions can arise in respect of judicial holdings. We have it stated in Clause 3 of Section 22 of the Land Act of 1923 ...&ldquo;in the case of a holding subject to a judicial rent, the record filed in the Land Commission shall be final and conclusive in all matters appearing thereon, except that where the judicial rent was fixed before the 1st day of April, 1899, the adjustment provided for by Section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1898 shall be taken into account in determining the amount of rent.&rdquo;  If the record filed in the Land Commission is to be final and conclusive, I do not understand how the reports of those commissioners and inspectors are required in respect of an estate which is subject to a judicial rent.  I do not understand how there should be any delay whatsoever in the vesting of judicial <Col N="753" /> holdings.  I was wondering, when I first came to consider this matter, what malignant spirit in the Land Commission offices compelled those unfortunate tenants to pay 10 per cent. more than they need pay if their holdings were vested.  As far as I can judge, the Land Commission are quietly seizing this difference of 10 per cent. in the rents and clapping it into their own Department in order to pay already overpaid officials or to serve some purpose of that description.  Clause 4 of Section 21 of the Land Act of 1923, states: &ldquo;There shall be payable by the Land Commission to the person or persons entitled to receive the same a sum equal to the amount to be collected as payment in lieu of rent from the gale day next preceding the date of the passing of this Act up to the appointed day, less income tax, and such deduction towards cost of such collection as the Land Commission shall consider reasonable and proper.&rdquo;  That is the way the 10 per cent. is going&mdash; in income tax and cost of collection. That is where the 10 per cent. which these tenants attempt to drag out of their lands is going each year.  It is going into the pockets of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I think it is high time the Government definitely fixed an appointed day for the vesting of all judicial holdings purchased.  The Land Commission officials must be well aware, from the state of unpaid annuities, that there is considerable agricultural depression at present.  The tenants are practically unable to pay the annuities.  It is grossly unfair that tenants who are compelled to continue paying interest in lieu of rent should have ten or twelve or fourteen years' purchase added to what they have to pay.  The more we look into this matter the more we realise the injustice of this 1923 Land Act.  The unfortunate tenants who succeeded in dragging from the landlord a reduction of 35 per cent. have clapped on to their rents an increase of 10 per cent.  They have had to pay that from 1923 to 1929, and I think it is high time those <Col N="754" /> tenants got the reduction they are entitled to and that the injustice that this 1923 Act imposed upon them was removed.  As I pointed out, those tenants cannot get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. That is a very grave matter. From inquiries amongst my colleagues, I find that that complaint is practically general. Although a loan be granted, no advance can be made until such time as the holdings are vested.  If the present Government policy continues the holdings will be vested 68½ years hence.  I think the attitude of the Land Commission in this matter is deserving of very grave censure.  If something is not definitely done, we will find that those tenants who cannot get a loan and who have been compelled by a so-called national Government to pay an increase of 10 per cent. in their rents will definitely refuse to pay any more until such time as their holdings are vested.  They continued to pay in the hope that under a national Government they would get some redress, but apparently there is no use in looking for redress here or elsewhere. I know the facts myself.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any doubt that these tenants were getting a voluntary reduction of 35 per cent., I will prove it to him by the landlord's receipts.</P>

      <P>There is a very considerable issue involved in this question of interest in lieu of rent. To the person unacquainted with the working of the Land Act and the purchase of lands, it would seem strange that the farmer, who is generally assumed to be astute where bargain-making is concerned, should permit himself to be bled by overpayment in respect of land annuities. Yet I have not any hesitation at all in saying that, on this question of interest in lieu of rent pending the non-vesting of estates, the farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties have paid many millions over and beyond the amount that they bargained for as a fair price for their land.  That the farmer should have paid that sum, or have allowed himself to be bled <Col N="755" /> of that amount of money, requires some explanation.  But the operation was so manipulated and carried out in such an expert and ruthless fashion that, in many cases, the farmers paid that money without actually knowing that they were paying a sum that was over and above their contract price.  I desire now to refer to the negotiations that took place for the purchase of estates under the 1903 and 1909 Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to illustrate the case, and it is immaterial under what Act I do that. In the general form of bargaining that takes place in the purchase of an estate the tenant is entirely concerned with the primary factor, which is the price he is going to pay. He calculates that by averaging so many years' purchase of the rent that he is liable for to the landlord. There may be smaller factors that enter into the transaction, such as rights of way, turbary rights, and other things, but the primary one with the tenant is the amount of the purchase price that he pays for his land.  Let us say that the average price would be 20 years' purchase. He calculates that on the rent that he had been paying previously.  Once he has fixed that, he gets at once a reduction upon his previous rent and becomes liable to the Land Commission for the amount of the annuity, payable half yearly.  In many cases the farmer assumes that immediately he has got a reduction in his rent he has become the owner of <Col N="756" /> his land, subject to the payment of the land purchase annuity over, say, a period of 68½ years.  That is not the case.  The problem that we are discussing now is the grave injustice of compelling farmers to pay, with their land purchase annuity, interest in lieu of rent, and of continuing to extract that from them for an indefinite period.  I know cases of tenants who have been paying interest in lieu of rent for the last eighteen years.  The farmer does not realise that in many cases.  He did not bargain to do that.  What the farmer understood when the bargaining took place was that he was purchasing his estate at a definite price. He believed that that price was to be fixed by way of mortgage on his land, to be redeemable by the payment of annuities over a period of 68½ years.  In many cases the farmer holds to the belief that each year's annuity paid by him is a reduction on the mortgage covering the period of 68½ years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give figures, running over a period of 18 years, in connection with estates where the original price fixed was £360.  During those eighteen years, the amount of interest in lieu of rent paid by the tenant amounted to £264, and still the land is not vested.  If that figure is added to the original price that the farmer bargained for, it will be found that the farmer, instead of purchasing his holding at eighteen years' purchase, and after making a hard fight to get those terms, is now paying a price which represents 26 years' purchase.  That is a situation that requires particular care in looking into, apart from the fact that the farmer has been misled by an ingenious form of bargaining that has been responsible in extracting from him not the eighteen years' purchase that he bargained for, but a price representing 26 years' purchase.  There are other factors that enter into this under the Land Purchase Acts, because, in addition to the mortgage taken on the farmer's holding for the repayment of the annuity, additional security is taken in this way: that each tenant is made responsible <Col N="757" /> for the payments of all the other tenants on the property.  They are all co-equal in that respect, and there is co-security for the full payment of the annuities levied against them.  I doubt very much if there is in any of the Acts passed here any section giving power to the Government to deduct out of the Agricultural Grant the amount of arrears arising in the way of interest in lieu of rent.  The Agricultural Grant was originally formed by way of contribution from the landlords towards the rates of the country.</P>
    <P>When the landlords were cleared out, the Government of the time undertook to continue that contribution direct to the various county authorities.  They had an easy means then of securing any defaulters in the way of land annuities payable.  But, in the case of many estates where interest in lieu of rent continues to be paid, they still continued to deduct out of the Agricultural Grant the interest in lieu of rent when it became in default. That is another factor to be considered, that not alone has the farmer been made liable for a price that represents 26 years' purchase of his holding, instead of the 18 years' purchase that he bargained for, but that the whole country at large is made liable for defaulters who run into arrears in the matter of the payment of interest in lieu of rent.  If you add to that the costs borne by the farmers where they became defaulters during that period&mdash;the costs incurred in collecting the interest in lieu of rent by the State Solicitor and by the sheriffs all over the country&mdash;you will realise that the figure I stated at the outset is a very moderate one.  Taking all these facts together, in the 26 Counties the farmers have paid many million pounds over and beyond the contract prices that they originally entered into.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, by means of a question, I sought information from the Department of Lands and Fisheries and asked for a return of the number of estates purchased in the County Leitrim, and the number of years that had elapsed until they <Col N="758" /> were vested.  I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary, not in his usual way, because as a rule he is fairly wide and generous in his replies, that he refused absolutely to give the information.  He said that he would not have the time of his staff taken up in preparing such figures.  The information that I sought for applies to many estates, and I should say that the sum of over one million pounds is involved. I would like to know what would be thought of a small huckster in the country if he were asked by a customer to furnish the items of his account and replied that he would not spend his time in preparing it. What would be thought of a member of a co-operative society if he asked from the manager a statement of his account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask if the Government have considered at any time the advisability of bringing in legislation to enable tenants who have purchased under the 1923 Act to get a marketable title in their holdings so as to enable them to get loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  A number of such tenants who have otherwise got good securities cannot get effective title until their holdings are vested.  That is my information.  I think it is fairly general all over the country. Have the Government any proposals to make with regard to the matter, and do they intend bringing in legislation to deal with it?  There is another question: from the date on which the landlord has lodged the scheduled particulars of title under Section 22 of the Act of 1923, will the tenants get credit for the amount of interest paid in lieu of rent between that date and the appointed date, which may be a considerable time?</P>

      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies, I would like to ask what action the Government proposes to take regarding farms that have been sold some years ago?  The proprietors of such lands bought out feesimple from the Land Commission before selling the farms, and then put on rent in some cases twice the former rent.  I would like to know on what footing such unfortunate tenant is placed, seeing he is not getting the benefit of land purchase, and that the farm is not vested in him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Boland, I may say at once that whatever difficulty there may have been hitherto with regard to the granting of loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that the tenants who hold lands either for temporary convenience or agreement to purchase have now been removed, so that under no matter what form of agreement a tenant holds his land to-day he is entitled to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That difficulty was removed some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to all tenancies, no matter what the form of agreement.  Deputy Corry has presented me with somewhat of a mathematical conundrum.  I cannot understand how a tenant who got a reduction of 25 per cent. immediately after the passing of the 1923 Act should to-day be paying an increase of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My case is that a large number of tenants in my district, in which are included about five estates, had a voluntary reduction from the landlord on their judicial rents of 35 per cent.  Under the 1923 Land Act these tenants were compelled to purchase, and had to accept 25 per cent. reduction instead <Col N="760" /> of the 35 per cent.  I can give receipts proving this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sheer nonsense. The 25 per cent. is based on the abated rent the tenant was paying at the passing of the 1923 Act. These rents were supplied to the Land Commission on a schedule of returns supplied by the owner.  The tenant was informed of the rents returned by the landlord in that schedule of particulars, and he was asked if he had any objection to the return supplied by the landlord.  If he had, and if the wrong rental was supplied, he had the right to object and to appeal to the Land Commission. If any irregularities existed in the schedule of returns he had the opportunity of having them fully redressed by the Land Commission. Under the Act of 1903, on the rules made by the Land Commission relating to the different sections of the Act, the owner is bound to return a schedule of rentals to the Land Commission. The tenant is subsequently notified by the Land Commission of the amount of rental so returned. It is open to any tenant to dispute the accuracy of the amount supplied to the Land Commission.  Figures prove that in the overwhelming majority of cases the returns of rentals made by the landlords were accurate.  2,700 applications have been made to the Land Commission out of 85,000 or 86,000 tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures prove conclusively that in the main the returns supplied by the owners were accurate.  This question of delaying vesting was discussed very fully on the Estimates last year.  The procedure is clearly laid down in the Land Acts.  The Land Commission was established for the purpose of carrying out the legislation embodied in these Acts.  It is impossible to rush unduly the vesting of land. There is a great deal of legal procedure to be gone through.  The Land Commission in dealing with this question of vesting must be sure there is a clear and secure title to the <Col N="761" /> tenant when vesting.  If the proceedings were unduly rushed that would only result in litigation costs to the tenants.  It is to the credit of the Land Commission that it has never been known in its history, once it has vested a title in a holding to a tenant, to have that title upset.  I have never heard of such a case. The procedure is very elaborate. This question has been examined over and over again with a view to seeing would it be possible to simplify it in any way.  I have in the past three or four months gone into this to see if simplification were possible, and I have found it cannot be simplified, if you want to make certain that, once a tenant's holding is vested in him, there is a clear and secure title.  The Deputy must remember that under the 1903 and 1909 Acts there is still a balance of holdings acquired to be vested in the tenants.  It has taken more than twenty years to vest all the holdings acquired under the 1903 Act.  There <Col N="762" /> is still a balance of holdings acquired under the 1923 Act to be vested in the owners.  Considering the short time the 1923 Act has been in operation, a considerable acreage of land has been already vested in the tenants, comprising 6,162 holdings, representing a purchase money of £2,344,653 and an area of 245,547 acres.  That rate of progress compares favourably with the progress under the earlier Acts.  Steps have been taken recently to still further expedite the rate of vesting.  It is quite impossible under existing circumstances to proceed very much faster with the vesting of tenanted land than the rate at which we are proceeding at the moment.  I did not quite catch the question raised by Deputy Sheehy, but if the Deputy puts the question on the Order Paper I would answer him on the point.</P>
