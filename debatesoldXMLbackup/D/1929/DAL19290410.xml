      <P>Since the recent introduction in the Irish Free State of new wave lengths consequent on the redistribution by the Union Internationale de Radiophonie, only one complaint has been received from South or West Cork of unsatisfactory reception.  Investigation of complaints from other areas showed that the present wave lengths are technically quite satisfactory, but that some receiving sets may require modification or readjustment. While this Department is prepared as far as possible to assist listeners it cannot accept general responsibility for reception faults when they are due to the receiving sets, but we understand manufacturers of and dealers in wireless apparatus are willing as a rule to assist their customers in this regard.</P>

All persons who had access to the butter were questioned. A sergeant and a Gárda visited the house of Michael Cahill, a porter who had handled the butter, and interviewed Mrs. Cahill, and as they had no search warrant, asked permission to search the house.  She consented to the search being carried out and was present throughout. The butter was not found in the house.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state why the interest on money deposited by insurance companies with the Accountant-General of the Supreme Court of Saorstát Eireann is not paid over, on receipt, to the companies entitled; and whether he will state the reasons for the delay of six months in such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest accruing due on money deposited by insurance companies with the Accountant of the Courts of Justice is usually paid over to insurance companies as it accrues. Where, however, the deposit consists of several different classes of securities, on which the interest accrues at various dates, payments are made at intervals throughout the year on specially selected dates. A company desirous of having these dates altered or payments made more frequently, on application to the Accountant can have its wishes carried out.  An examination of the payments made during the year 1928 shows that a delay of six months occurred in only one instance.  When the long delay was brought to the notice of the Accountant by a representative of the company a payment order for all the interest accrued was immediately issued, and such delays are not likely to recur.  In fact the particular company has already received two payments in the present year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that in the allocation of grants under the National Road Scheme to the various County Councils the amount per mile of national roadway granted to some counties exceeded by twice or three times the amount given to some other counties with less national road mileage, and, if so, whether this will be taken into account when future grants are being made, and whether consideration will be given to the question of making larger sums available to those counties which received a relatively small amount heretofore, and particularly to the North and South Ridings of Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to be based on a misconception of the scope of the National Road Scheme, as the allocations were made without reference to county boundaries. though, of course, for purposes of accounts, etc., they were assigned to particular counties.  The answer, therefore, to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The suggestions in the remaining parts cannot be acted upon, but as expenditure in maintaining roads is one of the factors taken into consideration when allocating grants, the reduced expenditure in maintenance of counties which have benefited considerably under the National Road Scheme will be reflected in future allocations.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1,600 miles of roads included in the National Road Scheme under the Roads Advisory Committee are based upon the requirements of the country as a whole, and are not based on giving a certain amount of money to each particular county, so that as far as the National Road Scheme is concerned, it is based on a scheme of 1,600 miles approved by the Roads Advisory Committee.</P>

      <P>I am not tied to the words I used in putting down the amendment.  It is an attempt to bring under the scope of the Bill certain societies which are to all intents and purposes public utility societies, but which are attempting in approximation to an economic way at any rate to build houses.  Under the terms of other Acts and under this Bill they would only receive the same subsidy as would be given to a private person. My wish is that they should receive the same help to enable them to continue their programme of building houses for the poor which other public utility societies would get under the Bill.  The societies I have in mind are not very numerous. In fact, I am not aware that the amendment would cover more than two&mdash;there may be others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>One for example is the Association for the Housing of the Very Poor, which, as we all know, is really a philanthropic society, but which under this Bill would only receive the same subsidy, I understand, as a private person.  Under previous Acts this particular Association, and others I have in mind, for instance, the Cork Model Dwellings Association, received the subsidy which a private person got, and in carrying out building under these Acts they incurred rather a serious loss which has crippled and prevented them from carrying out a further scheme of building.  If they got the additional help which is given under this Bill to public <Col N="19" /> utility societies I believe they would be able to undertake immediately a further programme of building, and as that building is for the help of the very poor it is very desirable that we should assist them under this Bill.  I have tried to tie up the amendment as much as I could so as to make perfectly sure that no societies would get in except those which are purely philanthropic, but I will be prepared to accept any words which the Minister suggests, if he thinks we are more certain to secure that object.</P>

      <P>I wonder could the Deputy give some more information as to these societies&mdash;I do not know if he mentioned the names of the three&mdash; and if we could get some idea of the class of work they have done in the past.  Personally, I would be inclined to favour the idea in the amendment, but I think that from a legal point of view the amendment would want to be made water-tight. I have not had an opportunity of seeing any kind of case put up for this amendment, and I have not had any information as to what class of work has been done by these societies, either recently or in the past.  It would, therefore, be desirable that the Deputy should give us some information as to the extent of the operations of any such society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite expected that the Minister would say that he would want to tighten up the amendment more, and I accept that. I only know two societies that would be covered by the amendment, one is the Association for the Housing of the Very Poor, and the other is the Cork Model Dwellings Association. The only information I can give the Minister at present is that under the 1919 Act the first Association actually lost £1,100 on the houses that they erected, and they have not since recouped themselves for that loss and would not be in a position to undertake any further building under this Bill if they were only to be regarded as private individuals. <Col N="20" /> They did make an attempt under that Act to have themselves registered as a public utility society but they were informed that that was not possible, and I think correctly so under the terms of the Act.  If the Minister would undertake to look into the matter I will undertake to get such information as he desires as to the work they have done.</P>

I should like to get the remaining stages of the Bill to-morrow if possible, if we can so deal with the matter in Committee that there is nothing very particular left over.  If the Deputy would arrange to discuss the matter with me or some of my representatives this afternoon, and if we could get a clearer idea as to what liability we would be shouldering, and what kind of help we are likely to give to such societies, without opening the door very wide to, perhaps, objectionable proceedings, I would be very glad to meet the Deputy with an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 45, to delete the figures &ldquo;£45&rdquo; and substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;£60.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Second Reading I pointed out that under Section 3 (a) private individuals are penalised under this Bill.  Such individuals get a subsidy of £45 for a house as against £60 given to public utility societies and local authorities.  I also pointed out that you were penalising those who ought to be encouraged, even to the extent of giving them a preference. It is agreed by all who have studied the problem that it is the duty of a Government to encourage citizens to own the houses in which they live. It is an incentive to good citizenship and stability.  Under this Bill these individuals are penalised, and I hope that the Minister in the meantime has had an opportunity of looking into this.  I propose to get over the difficulty by raising the amount of the subsidy to the individual to the same rate as that given to public utility societies and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section of the community that it is also very desirable to encourage, and that is the speculative builders.  The speculative builder is a considerable asset in the way of providing houses.  In most cases he is a man with a small amount of capital, with two or three sons.  These people build one house after another and dispose of them. The speculative builder has been <Col N="22" /> found to be a considerable asset on the other side of the Channel, because, as I pointed out, nearly 50 per cent. of the houses erected since the armistice in Great Britain were erected without any assistance from either the State or local authorities. For these reasons I think it is highly desirable that this encouragement should be given both to the private individual and to the speculative builder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>For once I find myself in agreement with Deputy Good.  I think that agreement would be more whole-hearted if the Deputy had tried to induce the Minister to increase the total amount.  I was rather struck with one of the statements made by Deputy Good in support of his amendment.  He said it was the duty of the Government to enable people to become owners of their own houses, that it made for stability and for good citizenship and gave them an interest in good Government.  I hope the Deputy will keep that in mind when the Town Tenants Bill comes before the House in the next month.</P>

On the Second Reading I voiced my objection to the reducing of the amounts and I am only sorry that it is not within the province of a private member to move to have the total amount of the grant increased.  I think, seeing that the Government has refused to do what I consider to be a better thing and what I believe in the end would be a more economic way of getting houses built, that is, by giving long term loans to local authorities, that this amendment is probably the next best thing.  I am satisfied that before the end of three months the Minister will find his £200,000 will have been absorbed in the building of houses and that is all to the good and for that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  At the present moment in the city of Dublin housing is in an exceedingly bad way. The type of house that has been built in the past has been erected at such a rent that the ordinary common or garden individual in nine cases out of ten was unable to avail himself of one of these houses. Under the Bill as now framed it would appear to me that every incentive will be given to build a smaller and cheaper house.  Representing the north side of Dublin as I do I hear regularly from time to time very bitter complaints about the high rents and how people are unable to pay these rents.  Now this Bill as far as I can see will tend to encourage the building of three-roomed houses.  It would appear that three-roomed houses are not in favour with certain sections of this House.  But as far as the city of Dublin is concerned smaller houses are the urgent need of the moment and I hope the Minister will remain firm in keeping the subsidy in the Bill at its proper level.  Some considerable time ago I drew attention in this House to the fact that the ordinary Dublin artisan received no consideration under the various housing schemes carried out in the city of Dublin.  If under this Bill a small type of house will be erected and let at a lower rent that will certainly be to the good.  I notice that the Labour Party want four-roomed and five-roomed houses in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that if the amendment of Deputy Good were carried the tendency in that amendment would be that a bigger, larger and more expensive type of house would be built than if the Bill was carried as it stands at present, and I think I am keeping close to the subject when I say that, representing the city of Dublin, I stand for smaller houses at lower rent, as far as the area that I represent is concerned. I think there are representatives of the city of Dublin in this House who ought to take a non-party view on a question of this kind.  We have been told that the affairs of Dublin monopolise the time of this House, but as far as I have seen the affairs of Dublin take up a very negligible portion of the time of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good in moving this amendment talked in pathetie and moving terms about the righteousness of enabling the ordinary citizen <Col N="25" /> to own his house, but when Deputy Morrissey came to deal with that he found a snag in it.  Deputy Good was keenly interested in the ordinary speculative builder.  I can say safely that I have as much experience of the speculative builder as Deputy Good.  I have earned my living among speculative builders. and I know what decent men they are and what they will do when properly encouraged.  But I have yet to learn that the ordinary speculative builder comes into the same category or into the same terms and rank as the ordinary private individual. The ordinary private individual or ordinary people working through a public utility society do a great deal of good for the masses of the people.  Everyone knows the ordinary speculative builder is not building for any philanthropic motives, but rather that he is going to get as much profit as he can.  The public utility society is building for an entirely different purpose.  I am living in an area where some of those public utility societies have functioned, and, knowing what they have done, I think the Minister is perfectly right in giving them every encouragement he possibly can to help those people, even though, as Deputy Good has said, that help is given at the expense of the speculative builder.  The whole point at issue in this amendment in my opinion is this, namely, if the Bill as now framed is carried we will have a smaller and cheaper type of house built for the citizens of Dublin. I think that that is eminently desirable and very necessary.  As I have said, the ordinary artisan in the city of Dublin&mdash;I feel sure I have his interests as much at heart as Deputies on the Labour Benches &mdash;has been cut out from enjoying the amenities of houses that have been built up to the present.  If the amendment is carried there can be no doubt that we will have a repetition of the building of high-rented houses for which people in this city cannot pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good said recently in a speech that the economic factor generally <Col N="26" /> rules the type of house that is built.  The economic factor here means that if there is a higher subsidy given than that proposed in the Bill the cost of houses will be considerably higher and, consequently, the rents will be considerably higher. If smaller houses are built it will mean that people who hitherto could not send in an application for a house with a rent of 14/- or 15/- a week will now have a chance under this Bill.  I think that the Minister is further justified on the economic principle to which Deputy Good referred. Deputy Morrissey referred to the question of town tenants and, of course, we heard the word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; immediately mentioned. The country is aware that for a considerable time decontrol of property has been going on rapidly.  Within a few months that decontrol will cease, and if it has been brought to an end far too speedily, why should not a reduction in the subsidy be based on the same principle and be automatically brought about in the same way as the control of property has been dealt with?  Deputy Good said that across the Channel since the Armistice there were about one million houses built, and that the speculative builder had been responsible for almost half that number.  I wonder what are the profits of the speculative builder in England, and how do they compare with those of the speculative builder in Ireland.  In Lancashire some years ago I had experience of two men who started building without practically a pound capital, and at the end of four years they enjoyed a profit of £4,000.  They charged a ground rent of £5 a house, and each house was sold at the actual cost of building.  I suggest that we have a very important factor here which would enable the Irish builder to turn his activities in this particular direction and to build if he were so minded.  We have heard a great deal of criticism about the failure of the Government to do this, that, and the other.  If the housing question is ever to be solved it will only be by the united efforts of the people engaged in the building trade.  From my knowledge of the building trade, <Col N="27" /> I suggest that neither Labour nor the builders have pulled their weight to solve this question.</P>

      <P>It is about the amendment that I want to speak.  I just want to point out that the argument of the last speaker is utterly unsound.  If a house cost £300 and if the subsidy is £45 it means that the builder has to bear approximately six-sevenths of the costs, whereas if the subsidy is £60 he has only to bear four-fifths of the cost. Is he not far more likely to build a smaller house than a larger and more expensive one on which he will only get a subsidy of £60?</P>

      <P>We are talking about the extent of the subsidy to be given to a private person who builds or who arranges to build a house for himself.  Since 1925 a private person who built a three-roomed house got a grant of £45, a private person who built a four-roomed house got a grant of £60, and in the case of a five-roomed house the grant was £75.  In addition to that, he probably got from the local authority concerned some other class of assistance, either a similar grant, loan, or remission of rates.  I quoted figures on the Second Reading showing the reduction in building costs that had taken place as indicated by the reduction in the cost of houses built by local authorities, these being the only class of houses for which we could get reliable and comparable figures. I showed that in Dublin on a five-roomed house the reduction from May, 1926, to September, 1928 was 14.6.  In Cork on a five-roomed house from May, 1926, to May, 1928, the reduction was 25.5, and was as high as 29.1 for a four-roomed house.  In Limerick and Tuam reductions amounting to about 10 per cent. took place, and, arguing that there has been a general reduction in the cost of building, we are now applying a reduced grant all round. In the case of private persons, instead of getting a £45 or a £60 or a £75 grant, it is proposed that every private person building a house which comes within the terms as to size and specifications laid down by the Minister for such subsidy, will get a grant of £45, and, in addition, will get a reduction in rates of a varying amount over a period of twenty years.  Deputies have suggested that this is a hardship on private persons and speculative builders.  I would like Deputy Good to discuss in connection with his amendment the extent of the responsibility which the State has for assisting a private person of the middle class who is able to build a <Col N="29" /> house of his own or who is able to get credit to enable him to do so. That is very different to the responsibility which the State and local authorities have to build houses for the poor.  If Deputy Good is going to say that a private person should get as big a grant as a public utility society, then the way in which he should get the people saddled with the responsibility of building houses for the poor to do that would be to put down an amendment to the effect that a public utility society should not get more than a private person.  The amendment should be to reduce the grant to a public utility society and not to increase the grant to a private person.  I fail to see where injury or injustice to the speculative builder comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1922, £2,100,000 of State money has been put into housing in order to get the speculative builder on his feet, to enable him to do his business, while at the same time the Government has been approaching nearer and nearer to providing houses for the poor.  Many people have argued that the building work that has gone on under the recent Housing Acts has not meant housing the poor.  It has not, but we have done a certain amount in providing houses for the better class of artisans. We have done a certain amount in assisting private capital to be employed in housing private citizens, and we have done a considerable amount in putting the speculative builder in the way of organising his business for a number of years. Now we are getting down to the problem which is the problem of the State and of the local authority, and we are proposing to make the best use of a limited amount of money to go towards the housing of the poor. In these circumstances we are continuing the grant to private persons, but a reduced grant because of the fact that we are getting nearer to doing the work that is our own responsibility, and because of the fact that there is a considerable reduction in building costs.  The Deputy has spoken of what has taken place in Britain.  If he put down an <Col N="30" /> amendment which would give private persons greater assistance than utility societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to put down an amendment reducing the grant to utility societies from £60 to £45, we can understand that and we can debate that. What we are debating now is that the grant to a private person should be increased.  The grant to a private person in England at present is £50, and so far as we can see it is going to cease entirely from September of the current year, for the reason, too, I believe, that in Great Britain they are coming down to a point in building development and in the organisation of building when they can turn their money and their organisation to the housing of the poor.  The very same complaint exists in Britain&mdash;that recent housing operations have not housed the poor to any extent, but have housed the better class and the better class artisan.  By this amendment, in the opinion of the Government, you are giving subsidies to private persons and the middle classes to a greater extent than is necessary and you are going to take away from the small pool of money that is available to assist in housing.  You are going to take away money that ought to go towards building houses for the poor, if the amendment of Deputy Good is carried.</P>

      <P>My friends and I being primarily interested in the housing of the very poor, oppose this amendment.  The amendment of Deputy Good does not find favour with us.  It would perhaps get sympathetic consideration if we understood, at the same time, that the total amount of money available would be increased proportionately. Seeing that the amount of money is so limited as it is and so small, that the problem is so great, and that the really urgent matter is to provide houses for the very poor over the <Col N="31" /> whole area of the Free State, we think that the amendment would not help what we have in mind.  We therefore propose to vote against it.</P>

I might be inclined to agree, if the proposal were that the subsidy be increased in so far as the person doing his own building was concerned, but so far as the speculative builder is concerned I am entirely opposed to the amendment unless the Minister were to make it mandatory on the particular person who receives the grant to pass on the benefit to the person who would eventually occupy or buy the house. I agree with Deputy O'Kelly, that having regard to the amount of money available, the amendment would mean robbing the people for whom we want to cater, that is the very poor.  I therefore oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister in speaking on this amendment seemed to imply that this Bill was going to encourage the building of houses for the middle classes.  I do not know whether any other members of the House have such an idea.  There is no idea in my mind that this Bill is going to encourage the building of houses for the middle classes.  In the previous Bills of a similar character, notably the 1925 Act, we had a different subsidy for different sized houses.  In view of what Deputy Byrne has said, I would just remind the House of the reason why large houses were built under that Act.  Under that Act a private person building a three-roomed house got £45, for a four-roomed house he got £60 and for a five-roomed house he got £75.  The same proportions practically, to an increased amount, were given to the utility societies. The untility society got £60 for a three-roomed house, £80 for a four-roomed house and £100 for a five-roomed house.  It is quite obvious as I pointed out several times in the discussion on this Bill, that the larger the house the cheaper the room from the point of view of construction. <Col N="32" /> Consequently the schedule gave an incentive to the building of larger houses.  That is why larger houses have been built.  Now the Government find that there are too many of the five-roomed houses being built in proportion to the other houses and they are anxious that the incentive to build large houses should cease.  The method they propose is a reasonable one, to give an equal subsidy for all houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to correct a false impression which might be created by the Deputy. When we speak of moving towards a point at which smaller houses will be built, we mean smaller houses by local authorities.  We do not mean that private persons who get the subsidies are going to be invited to build three-roomed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is quite clear. I need not read it.  Every Deputy can read it for himself.  I will take clause 3, which says:</P>
      <P>To any person erecting one or more houses to which this Act applies a grant not exceeding £45 in respect of such house; to any public utility society erecting one or more houses to which this Act applies a grant not exceeding £60 in respect of each such house; to any local authority erecting one or more houses in pursuance of the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921, in accordance with this scheme, approved by the Minister a grant not exceeding £60 in respect of each such house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any one of these three, the private individual, the public utility society or the local authority is quite free to erect a three-roomed, a four-roomed or a five-roomed house provided it is approved of by the authorities. It is quite clear in the Act and I am quite satisfied that the effect of this Act will be to encourage the building of the smaller houses, that is of the <Col N="33" /> three-roomed houses.  That is quite obvious because as a man gets the same subsidy for erecting a three-roomed house as for a five, naturally he will erect a larger number of three-roomed houses in order to get a larger amount of subsidy.  It is also equally obvious that a three-roomed house is not a house that could, in any sense, be described as a house provided for the middle classes, so that, as far as this Bill is concerned it is not going to do anything&mdash;let us be quite clear on it&mdash;in the way of providing houses for the middle classes.  It is going, like its predecessor, to provide houses for well-to-do artisans.  My objection to all the Housing Acts brought in by this Government has been that that is the section of the community that has been getting all the advantages from the Housing Acts.  I have urged that those in the slums have not been touched by any of our Housing Acts, not even this Act, and I have urged that consideration should be given to their claim and that a measure should be brought in in order to deal with them.  That, I am satisfied, is a problem that does not come in under this particular Bill and is not affected to any material extent by it.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by those on the Labour Benches that we are not wise in encouraging the speculative builder.  I do not agree with that.  The speculative builder in the larger number of cases is a working man belonging to the particular union that the Labour Party represent or ought to represent.  Now we are told by that Party that represents that particular individual that he is not to be encouraged.  I think it ought to be the duty of the Government to encourage anybody who is anxious to assist in the provision of houses, whether they be speculative builders, other individuals, or whoever they are.  Anybody who is prepared to put his capital into that particular industry and help to solve that particular problem ought to be encouraged by the Government. Therefore, I say in discouraging, as this provision discourages, a private individual, a speculative builder in <Col N="34" /> contrast with the encouragement given to the utility societies and the local authority, that Bill is not in the best interests of the State.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of the discouragement? An individual gets £45 as against £60 given to the public utility society.  The local authority, under which the private individual erects a house, is at liberty to give a further grant to that individual not in excess of the Government grant.  So all the local authority can do is to give another £45, provided it is so willing, to the private individual as against £60 to the local authority.  Then there is a further provision in the Act which enables the local authority to make grants to public utility societies and to private individuals of sums not exceeding double the amount of the Government grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans; you are quite right.  That is, the local authority makes a loan to the builder of the house not exceeding double the amount of the Government grant. Take these three provisions together. For the private individual, you have £45 first of all a Government grant and you have £45 given to him by the local authority, assuming they give the full amount they are empowered to give.  Then you have the local authority granting a loan of £90, a total of £180, adding all three together, to the private individual. Take the public utility society; it gets £60 for the same house as a grant from the State, £60 from the local authority and a loan of £120, a total of £240 as against £180 given to the private individual, or an increase of 33? per cent.  I say that is unfair and unwise, and I hope the amendment will be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I thought we would get some reason for this amendment when Deputy Good introduced it, having regard to his long and intimate knowledge in connection with housing, but I never heard a weaker case than that which has been put up by the Deputy.  He is a sufficiently <Col N="35" /> sensible business man to know that in connection with the provision of any commodity, no matter of what sort or kind, the larger the number of commodities required the cheaper will be the cost, and he seeks, notwithstanding the fact that he has that before him, to make the single individual who is building a particular house the subject of special consideration.  What is the reason for special consideration being shown in this measure to every local authority or public utility society except that everybody realises at once that here is a particular service that requires a maximum effort on the part of everybody concerned to provide something that is needed, and, knowing that, the Deputy comes forward and says you must give exactly the same privileges and rights to the private individual, whether or not he be one of those that require the special consideration of the State and of the local authorities.  You must give him the same assistance as you are giving the unfortunate person who occupies, perhaps with five or six in his family, a single tenement room in the slums, and the Deputy goes on in the course of his case, which ought to be made in respect of the private individuals, to attack the Government for neglecting persons in the slums.  What is his proposal in connection with those persons in the slums?  No one knows better than he that all this talk about solving the housing question, in so far as houses in the slums are concerned, is all gallery talk.</P>

When <Col N="36" /> the State and the municipality are prepared to come forward with more than 50 per cent. of the cost of the provision of the houses, then the Deputy will talk.  I can understand persons interested in politics, interested in scoring off any Government in office, but Deputy Good, the business man with an experience of 40 or 50 years of housing, when he gets up and tells us that we have not solved the housing problem in the slums, knowing that it is a problem which cannot be solved by us or by anyone else, is wasting his own time and that of everyone else in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the attempts that we have made to solve the question, because the slums in this city, or in any other city, do not house purely and simply the submerged tenants.  In so far as wage earners are concerned, you may have a person occupying a room in a slum, who is earning very good wages, unable to get a house, anxious, as the Deputy is, or as anybody would be, to get a house, but unable to get it.  We have during the last seven years taken considerable numbers of those people out of the slums and put them into self-contained cottages.  We have not been able to do all that we would like to do, but what we have done is work that is creditable, and the Deputy and those who have criticised it could not have improved upon it.  It is work which would not be helped by the passing of the amendment which the Deputy has tabled.  If I interpreted Deputy Good correctly on the housing question during the last few years. he would do away with all subsidies; subsidies are a mistake and we ought to get away from them.  He now comes forward to help the private individual, as he calls him.  Who is the private individual?  The private <Col N="37" /> individual, apparently, is a person who requires a house.  You can divide private individuals into three orders: the economic, the uneconomic and the border line.  As regards the economic persons, we have no liability towards them.  The State has no liability towards them and the municipality has no liability towards them.  They ought to be honest enough to make an effort to house themselves.  Is it for that person the Deputy moves his amendment? Obviously not, because he is a person who ought to be able to provide for himself.  Then it is for the uneconomic person, or for the person who is occasionally, economic and occasionally uneconomic.</P>
      <P>In respect of that person we believe that the policy of the Government during the last few years has been to do everything that was possible to enable the local authority or the public utility society to build. Is he better looked after in group or bulk by either of these two methods or is the Deputy's method of treating him as a single unit the better way? I believe it would be much cheaper per house to get a contract for ten houses than for one.  I believe that the contract for even one hundred houses would provide houses relatively cheaper than a contract for ten houses.  That has been one of the main planks in the policy which has been adopted by us during the last few years.  The ordinary individual who wishes to build a house for himself, fashioned after his own liking and built in respect of conditions and specifications that he would supply, and who is able to put down the money for that house, has not the same claim on the State or on the municipality as the person who is badly housed in insanitary areas, whether in the slums or elsewhere, and the policy that has been devised in respect of every Act that we have passed here for the last few years has been to treat the uneconomic person or the person who is barely economic in a way which puts as slight a burden as possible on both the State and the municipality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the cost of building in the last few years justified <Col N="38" /> this reduction in the subsidy.  I should say that within the last three years it has come down about twenty per cent.  Building when those Acts were first introduced was practically at a standstill.  It is now a thriving industry in the State, and it has been sufficiently helped during those years to enable its activities to be carried on under the reduced subsidies.  The persons in respect of whom Deputy Good made the major claim, the uneconomic or those barely on the economic line, are served better both by the local authority and the public utility society than they would be served by the speculative builder.  I have myself great respect for the work that has been done by the speculative builder during the last five or six years.  Even under the provisions in this Act&mdash;£45 for a single individual&mdash;it is possible for the speculative builder to form a public utility society and to get the full subsidy that is given to a local authority or a public utility society. In view of that fact, I say the whole of the case that was made by Deputy Good falls to the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word on behalf of a large class of individuals who have benefited in the past by those housing grants and who hope to benefit in the future, that is the small farmers and rural dwellers generally.  We have heard a good deal during this discussion about the city slums. but I think there is no one living in a rural area but knows that we have also rural slums and that the housing conditions in many of our rural districts are very undesirable and ought to be improved as soon as possible. I am not interested in the speculative builder, and I am not particularly anxious, in regard to this amendment, whether he should get the full amount that Deputy Good claims or not, because, outside the cities and perhaps a few of the large towns, the speculative builder may be said not to exist. For all practical purposes he does not exist.  The small farmer in a country district could not avail of the advantages of these public utility <Col N="39" /> societies, and usually his local authority is not going to embark upon a scheme of building for his particular benefit.  If a house has to be put up it has to be put up by an individual, and many small farmers during the past few years have availed of the housing grant to build houses.  They have contributed very largely by their own efforts to provide the houses.  The materials may be provided locally, and much work of an unskilled nature is done by the man's own family.  In this way they are able to build.  Sometimes they get a loan from the Land Commission. That is a class of individual that ought to be encouraged to put up a house for himself and his family. I believe the reduction of the subsidy to £45 will just make the difference which will prevent many members of that class from embarking on the building of houses.  I propose to support the amendment by Deputy Good mainly on account of the benefit it would be to the class of individual I have mentioned. I am not, as I say, concerned whether it is extended afterwards, if it is passed, to the speculative builder or not, but I do believe that in the case of the small farmers and rural dwellers the subsidy ought to be fixed at £60.</P>

      <P>It is obvious if a certain sum of money is set apart for this purpose that we will have a smaller number of houses built on the £60 subsidy than on the £45 subsidy.  Consequently I think that the people who say they want more houses built and at the same time say that they want the subsidy raised are only deceiving themselves.</P>

      <P>There is one point that I would like to mention arising out of the last speaker's remarks.  To be consistent, Deputy Brennan should move an amendment to this section of the Bill to reduce the subsidy to £5 per house.  If the Deputy's argument is to hold water at all he should get many more houses built with a £5 subsidy per house than with a £45 <Col N="40" /> subsidy.  I would like to make my position as clear as possible.  I agree with a good deal of what the President said.  I have no wish whatever to refuse the credit that is due to the Government for what they have done with regard to housing during the last few years.  I believe they have made an earnest effort.  Our objection is that they have not faced this as a national problem, and they might have done more.  Speaking personally, I may say my anxiety is to get houses built in the country because there is a great necessity for them.  In order to get them I am prepared to move or vote for any proposal which will make building sufficiently attractive either for private individuals or public authorities.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will be able to tell the House, from the figures which he must have at his disposal, that under previous Acts passed here most of the money paid out by his Department was given, not to speculative builders, but to individuals who have built comfortable homes for themselves in the towns and in the rural areas.  Those houses in most instances would not have been built were it not for the Government subsidy.  I am aware that considerable numbers of thrifty workingmen, by taking advantage of the grant given by the Government, have built comfortable homes for themselves and their families.  It is for that reason I am prepared to vote for this amendment.  The President made a good deal of play regarding the provision in the Bill which would enable County Councils and other public authorities, if they so desired, to give a grant not exceeding the amount given by the State.  We know that in practice very few, if any, public bodies have given those grants.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good and the President dealt with it, and both of them were wrong.  I agree with many things the President says, but I think his speech was rather against <Col N="41" /> giving any subsidy whatever to a private individual, just as Deputy Brennan's short contribution tended. I say that if Deputy Brennan were to be consistent he should follow up his statement with an amendment to reduce the subsidy to £5, £10 or £20, instead of leaving it at £45.  I do not wish the attitude of myself and some other members of the Party who will probably vote for the amendment to be misconstrued in any way.  We want to get the houses built, and we are prepared to vote for sufficient inducements to get them built.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose Deputy Good's amendment for reasons already outlined by more than one Deputy.  The amount of money available is limited.  The particular clause to which this refers is a clause that will be availed of in the main by people not of the really necessitous class.  The fund will be depleted to that extent and I would not like to see any encouragement given to such persons, because by giving a large amount of money to them we would deplete this fund.  I think in the main this fund should be applied to the provision of houses for persons catered for by public authorities and public utility societies.  On those grounds I intend to oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I intend to oppose the amendment, not because I am out of sympathy with the class for whom Deputy O'Connell has spoken, but because as a representative of Cork City, where the housing question is very grave and where the shortage of houses is keenly felt, I believe under this Bill a greater inducement is held <Col N="42" /> out to local authorities to build on a large scale.  I was impressed by the President's speech in that particular respect.  As against a speculative or other class of builder who would be prepared to build four or five houses because of the £45 subsidy or the £60 subsidy, I would far prefer to see blocks of houses run up by the hundred.  The sub-section here says, &ldquo;A local authority erecting one or more houses.&rdquo;  We do know that when local authorities embark on a building programme they do so on a fairly liberal scale.  So far as the speculative builder is concerned, undoubtedly he has contributed to a partial solution of the housing problem. On the other hand, the houses which the speculative builder erected have been rightly described by Deputy Good as houses for the middle-class people or well-to-do artisans.  It might be a subject for enquiry to ascertain who has got the benefit of the Government subsidy and who will in the near future get the benefit of the subsidy paid to the speculative builder.  In every case I know of, and I know some dozens, the speculative builder, having got the subsidy either from the Government or the local authority, sold the house and did not give the purchaser the advantage of the subsidy.  I have a fair experience of some of these transactions, and I know the person who got the advantage was the speculative builder and not the person who was seeking a house.  That is an important point, and before subsidies are given on any large scale to the speculative builder, I suggest the matter should be made the subject of enquiry by the Minister for Local Government as to who is being served by the subsidy. In my view, the speculative builders get the biggest portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we find that, even with the grant which has hitherto obtained given to the local authorities, for the reasons mentioned here by some Deputies, the houses are now let to people who could well afford in many cases to build houses themselves. Even the well-to-do artisan for whom Deputy Good has such a <Col N="43" /> great affection and regard cannot afford to pay 16/- to 20/- a week for a house.  I do not know that the well-to-do artisans, or those of them whom I know, can afford to pay practically one-fourth of their wages to the landlords.  This Bill is, in my view at any rate, a fair attempt at solving this housing problem, though I do suggest that the Minister might have taken a bolder step. That is the only portion of Deputy Good's speech with which I feel myself in sympathy, that is where he suggested that a more serious attempt should be made to deal with the slum problem.  So long as there is housing shortage, so long will you have the slum problem.  But no matter how liberal the attempt made to solve the slum problem you will still in this country, as in every other country, have what is described as the Submerged Tenth. That class of the community will never be reached by any Government in any country.  At the same time there is a class of our people who, up to the present, have not been reached by anything that this Government has attempted to do in the way of housing.</P>
    <P>The class of person to whom the best efforts of the Minister should be directed by way of relieving the house shortage is the person of industrious and steady habits who has, undoubtedly, because of this shortage, to live in insanitary or slum areas.  It is not because many of those people are housed at the moment in insanitary areas, and not because they are living in tenements, that they should be classed as the Submerged Tenth.  They are not, and many of those respectably poor and industrious people would reject the idea of being considered one of the Submerged Tenth.  I know that they are in many cases people in precarious employment.  You have hardworking labourers&mdash;hard working when they can get it.  You have hardworking artisans&mdash;hard working when they can get it.  But these people, because of the precariousness of their employment, are not people who can readily afford to pay from <Col N="44" /> 14/- to 16/- a week for a house.  And that is the class of thing that has happened under the legislation in force up to the present as an attempted solution of the housing question.  I am opposing the amendment for the reasons I have indicated. I believe, notwithstanding that, there are some things that I can say in criticism of this Bill; the Bill is a fair attempt and I do hope it is a forerunner of something on a more liberal scale in the near future.  I do suggest that when the Minister finds, as I hope he will find, that this Bill will meet with success, or, at least, with partial success, he will be a little more liberal in the next Bill which will, I hope, be introduced in the next session.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has reminded me of a class of people in the country who unfortunately are not able to avail of this subsidy at all.  It has struck me that perhaps we should do something to meet their case.  There are in the rural areas, and in the congested districts, particularly, a number of small farmers who build their own houses but who, unfortunately, cannot build them in accordance with the specification of the Local Government Department. These people are amongst the most deserving class of persons in the country.  Very often as a result of the house being very old or through a heavy storm or some accident it becomes practically uninhabitable. These people rebuild the houses themselves but not being in a position to afford to use slates for roofing the houses, they roof them with corrugated iron, line them and make them quite warm and comfortable.  Owing, however, to the fact that they have not complied with the specification required by the Department, they are not entitled to any subsidy at all. It is a pity that some effort is not being made to help them.  I know that this is outside the amendment altogether but it struck me that this would be a good opportunity to raise the case of these particular people.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and the question as it appears to me is that we <Col N="45" /> have a limited sum of money available for subsidising the building of houses.  The question this amendment raises is as to the best means of distributing this limited sum at our disposal so as to build as many houses as possible.  There have been three channels suggested through which this money should be distributed&mdash;the private builder, the speculative builder and public utility societies or public authorities.  The question we have to decide is really through which of these channels would most houses be built.  I have definitely come to the conclusion that public utility societies, by getting a large proportion of this grant, would be enabled to build a larger number of houses than if a similar proportion were given to either of the other two classes I have mentioned.  It is desirable that private individuals should be given as great an opportunity as possible, but, as the President said, one cannot get away from the fact that it is cheaper per house to build ten houses than to build one. Similarly it is cheaper per house to build one hundred than it is to build ten.  I have come to the conclusion that it would be more advisable in the interests we all have at heart&mdash;that is, the erection of as great a number of houses as possible&mdash;to give a larger proportion of this subsidy to public utility societies and public authorities than to either the private individual or the building speculator.</P>

      <P>While agreeing with most of what the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the President said in connection with the Bill, I believe the House should pass the amendment.  Most of the President's speech dealt with the conditions that obtain in Dublin, and Deputy Anthony's speech dealt with conditions in Cork.  Anyone listening to this evening's debate would imagine that the £200,000 was intended only for those two cities, and that country constituencies would get nothing at all.  I disagree with that.  I hold no brief for the speculative builder.  He does not trouble us very much in the country.  I do not <Col N="46" /> think we have any interest at all in the speculative builder, because in the country there is no work for him. The men who will benefit by those grants will not assist tradesmen very much in the country, because in the building they will utilise their own labour.  I want to see the people in the rural areas getting a fair share of the money.  Under this section as it stands £15 per house is being taken off, and that, with the £15 which would be granted by the local authority, would mean a reduction of £30.  We all know that if the public utility societies and local authorities in Dublin and Cork put their heads together and say that they will get as much of this money as they can there will be very little left for the other 24 counties.  In fact, I do not believe we will get half a dozen houses built in each county. That is the position as I see it.  I believe we should help the man in the country town who has a little money to build his own house and not handicap him by having a loss of £30 on his house, while you are giving the money to public utility societies and local authorities in the cities of Cork and Dublin.  Of course, Deputy Anthony, like the President, was speaking for his own city.  As I said before, some people in this House think that these two cities are the whole State.  We should think a little about the County Kildare, for instance.  In Kildare we have not got very much money in the last few years under any of the Housing Acts, and there is not much chance of the local authorities in Kildare helping us, with the exception of the County Council.  If the subsidy is to be reduced from £60 to £45, I say that our County Council will not give an equivalent grant&mdash;they will not vote any money for housing, as they will say it is not fair.  I want to make a strong protest, so that I can go to the County Council and say that I have made a protest on behalf of my county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the effect of the reduction in the building grant and its application to the rural population and the small farmer <Col N="47" /> that Deputy Anthony referred to, I would not at all agree with him that the best interests of that class will be served by maintaining the rate of grant at the higher figure, for the reason that he stated, namely, that most of the work is done by the small farmer and his family, and, consequently, the outlay is small.  A much greater benefit could be secured for that class of the community in making the grants by taking into consideration the local circumstances, as most people in the rural areas have already made provision for their own housing.  Improvement in the housing conditions is necessary, however, but that improvement can only take place according to the amount of money the farmer can afford to spend.  He will have to be facilitated in improving the building that he already possesses.  It is not possible for the small farmer to undertake the building of a standard house, as set out in this Bill.  By reducing the amount of the grant to £20 a good deal of very useful improvement could be carried out by the small farmer.  Up to the present no provision has been made in any of the Acts to deal with the condition of the existing slums in the poorer parts of the rural districts. Nobody can say that there has not been serious neglect on the part of the Government in dealing with that class of the community and in overlooking them to the extent that they have.  We have heard a lot about the condition of the workers in the cities and towns and the necessity for providing them with better houses.  We who come from the country districts realise that necessity and are prepared to give every possible assistance in solving the problem.  At the same time, we must stress the fact that the Government have not done their duty towards that section of the community that I speak for, namely, the small farmers.  They have not done anything in regard to improving the housing conditions of the small farmers.  I know of instances where farmers attempted to take advantage of the provisions of previous Acts, <Col N="48" /> but because they utilised some of the side-walls or other portions of existing buildings, that it would have been waste to pull down, they were disqualified from receiving the grants.  The only explanation that could be put upon the attitude of the Government in that respect was that they did not want to give any of those grants to the rural areas.  If that section of the people are to be taken into account, I am convinced that the best service that could be rendered to them is that the grants should be reduced even further and facilities given so that the small farmers can improve their dwellings in proportion to the amount of the grant-in-aid.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to add at the end of paragraph (c), line 54, the following proviso&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that where a local authority for the purposes of this section levies a special housing rate of not less than one shilling in the pound the Minister may with the like consent make a grant not exceeding £72 in respect of each such house.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to carry out a suggestion I made on the Second Reading that encouragement should be given to local authorities who are willing to make an effort themselves to expedite building by giving them an increased grant. Accordingly, I put down the amendment to provide that where a local authority raises a rate of not less than 1/- in the pound for the special purpose of housing, an increase of 20 per cent. in the amount of the grant provided for in the Bill should be given.  I am very glad to see, from the amendment which follows on the Paper, that the Minister approves of that suggestion, so that it will not be necessary for me to elaborate it to any extent.  I think that some local authorities, at all events, are beginning to rouse themselves to the fact that some further effort is required from them than they have made in the recent past to <Col N="49" /> provide houses more expeditiously for the working classes and the poor. If this amendment is accepted by the House it will, I think, result in a considerable increase in the building of this class of house in the near future.  Take what will happen in the City of Dublin alone.  On the valuation of the City of Dublin, if this provision is put in operation by the Commissioners, my calculation is that it will mean that in the next year you will have built in the City of Dublin, in addition to the ordinary programme of building going on at present, about 200 houses.  No doubt Deputy Anthony, or some of the other Deputies from Cork, might be able to give a calculation of what it will mean in Cork, as I have not the figures available, but as regards Dublin it will mean an increase in one year of 200 houses.  As I say, I believe that a number of the local authorities are awakening to the fact that something of this kind might be done.  I am in a position to say, as regards the City of Dublin, that if this amendment is accepted the authorities are prepared to adopt this proposal as to a special housing rate on condition that this additional grant is given.  For these reasons I commend the amendment to the House.  The Minister's amendment, which follows, contains not only this provision, but a further provision, and if the Minister is prepared to carry out this proposal of his, and it is approved of by the House, I shall withdraw my amendment in favour of the Minister's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment standing in the name of Deputy Rice gives no safeguard at all as to the extent to which the local bodies will shoulder this burden. For instance if they struck a rate of 1/- in the £ they might apply that in such a way that the local contribution might be £10 towards the building of a house and the State contribution £72.  I take it the Deputy does not mean that but that the local authorities shall shoulder their definite responsibility as they must if the housing problem that exists for the poorer classes is to be solved in <Col N="50" /> any way by the provision of sufficient houses at reasonable rents.  I do not know whether the Deputy has withdrawn his amendment and whether we are dealing with the amendment in my name but I suppose that we can deal with it on Deputy Rice's amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment that stands in my name proposes exactly what Deputy Rice's amendment proposes, that is, where the local body strikes a local housing rate of a shilling in the £ in respect of a scheme of housing to be created under this Act, an increased grant up to 20 per cent. or £72 in respect of each house instead of £60.  But it is necessary to make provision that the local authority will contribute, say, more than £10 where the State contribution is £72.  You have to take certain steps to have a more equitable distribution of the burden, as I said before, and there will arise even out of this in the consideration of any particular scheme for which the local authority is striking a rate and an increased grant is expected from the State&mdash;a question as to what rent is to be charged to the occupants of the new houses.  A fourth factor then comes into consideration, that is, the number of houses to be built under any particular scheme.  So that in connection with the scheme where the local authority proposes to strike a housing rate of this kind and looks for an increased contribution from the State the question of the number of houses to be built so as to enable them to be let at a reasonable rent to the occupier will arise for consideration and will come under examination as part of the matter to be examined by the Department before the Minister can agree that an increased grant should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I stated I considered there was a danger that the giving of an increased grant by the State and the making of a definite arrangement to get an increased grant or a definite contribution from the local authorities would keep up the cost of building. A very careful scrutiny will have to be made of every scheme submitted in this particular way to <Col N="51" /> see that the cost of building is not unnecessarily being kept up by the fact that rather larger contributions are being made by the State and by the local authorities towards the building of houses for the working classes.  That I am satisfied will come under review when we consider in connection with each scheme the rents at which the houses are to be let, or alternatively the price at which the houses are to be sold in cases where the local authorities are disposing of houses either by direct purchase or by a system of purchase rent&mdash;the rent that will be charged or the cost, together with the number of houses that will be included in any scheme to be approved of.</P>

So far as Wexford Corporation is concerned, we have struck a rate since the last adjournment which includes 6d. in the pound for housing.  We might have put in a shilling if we knew there was such an inducement as this.  It is very hard, of course, to get ratepayers to agree to increased rates for this or any purpose. I want to know what is the position of a local authority that has struck a sixpenny rate already in an effort to help the Government to solve this problem.</P>

      <P>Most of the rates have been struck, I know, and, to a certain extent, I hope they have. A certain amount of pressure has been brought to bear to get people to strike rates up to time.  Any new schemes not before us would likely take six weeks or more to be put up. I would not encourage the withholding of the striking of the rates for such a period in order to include a rate in this way, except there are special local bodies in a particular position that could conveniently do it.  That would mean that in two months the scheme would be examined and passed.  The amendment provides that a shilling rate could be struck next year for a scheme that will be passed, and in the great majority of cases the councils would only require the money in respect of the scheme passed in this way.  I do not want to commit myself to too big a hope that there is lying in the Wexford rate struck for this year a spare sixpence.</P>

      <P>There is a question in regard to the wording of the amendment which I would like to ask the Minister.  It is stated that &ldquo;every such house shall not be disposed of by way of sale or lease save at such price and rent and subject to such <Col N="55" /> conditions as the Minister shall approve.&rdquo; That wording would give the ordinary casual reader the idea that it was not the intention of the Government to encourage local authorities to dispose of these houses. I suggest that the same effect might be obtained in a different way.  I am glad to know that it is not in the Minister's mind to discourage the sale of such houses, but I think that it should be more clearly expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>If you take the rent, where we give a special grant, where the local authority has struck a special rate, and where the object intended to be served is the housing of the poor, Deputies will understand that we will take steps to see that the rent charged is appropriate.  I admit that when you come to the sale of houses where money can be put down, there will be, on our part, a desire to get in as big capital sums in the disposal of houses by sale as it will be possible to get.  Although that may, to some extent, work against what we have in mind, namely, the letting of those houses at a low rent, we want to control the situation, where it is possible to do so and where the general circumstances permit it, so that the amount charged will be neither too high nor too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is nothing sinister or nothing that can be misunderstood in the wording of the amendment.  It gives us the power in order to balance in any particular scheme the State grant, the money provided by the local authority, the number of houses, or the rent charged, and we must have power to approve of the rent or what is analogous to that, the selling price, and it is only by analogy that the selling price comes in.</P>

      <P>The only suggestion that I have to make is that the wording gives the casual reader the impression <Col N="56" /> that it is not the desire of the Government to dispose of these houses.  I suggest that instead of putting it in this negative way it should be stated in positive form and that after the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; you put in such words as these: &ldquo;may be sold or leased at such price or subject to such rent and conditions as the Minister shall approve.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that this amendment is going to achieve very much.  In principle it is a good amendment and I would like it to achieve a great deal.  I would like to see municipal and urban councils all over the Twenty-six Counties in a position and being willing to strike a special rate of 1/- in the £ for the purpose of housing, but I am afraid that it will not be done.  I am afraid that the number of local authorities which you will get, even by holding out an inducement of an increased grant, to put on an extra shilling in the rates will be very small.  It is, however, a move in the right direction, and it is showing local authorities that so far as this House is concerned it is prepared to dip deeper into the State's pocket if necessary to encourage such local authorities to do likewise and get over the difficulty regarding housing. I hope that anybody who can influence, or who is a member of such authority, will try to induce them to make use of the powers given in the amendment and take advantage of the extra grant that is offered.  Unless that is done this question of housing, which is so urgent and pressing, will drag on for a long time.  I do not know if Deputy Rice is responsible for the idea, but it is a good one, and I certainly approve of it.  As I say, I hope that everything will be done to induce local authorities, where they can afford to do so, to strike this extra rate, if not this year, next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points in regard to the amendment that I would like to have cleared up. If all the money voted here under this Bill were availed of a certain number of houses would be built. Now, however, with the additional inducement offered under this amendment, to local authorities to get an extra grant, the Minister might find himself in the position that a smaller number of houses than that originally intended would be built.  The Minister has probably some information on the matter and he could probably tell us whether Deputy Rice is correct in stating that if an extra shilling in the £ were put on for building purposes in Dublin, 200 extra houses would be built.  Personally, I do not believe that the citizens of Dublin would be satisfied to have 200 extra houses built in exchange for an extra shilling on the rates.  So far as I can calculate, there would be between 4,000 and 5,000 houses built if the full amount of money voted was availed of.  If all the local authorities were now to avail of this extra grant the number would, in my opinion, be reduced to about 3,000.  Is the Minister prepared to say whether that is so and, if we get a boom in building throughout the country, will he introduce a Supplementary Grant during the year?  I do not know in what position Dublin would stand but I have an idea that it would not be concerned in this particular matter as the Commissioners here can raise money in the ordinary way to build houses, and they would probably find that it would not be a profitable return to build houses by putting an extra shilling on the rates.  Has the Minister any figures that would tell us what amount of money would be realised by the imposition of an extra shilling in the rates in Dublin and what number of houses would be built out of that extra rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A shilling in the £ would raise approximately £57,000. The Deputy will understand that there is a question of rent involved in this.  It is not contemplated by me, at any rate, that a housing <Col N="58" /> scheme in Dublin with a rate of a shilling in the £ going towards it and this increased grant, would involve the rents that are charged at the present moment for four-roomed houses built under the old conditions. That requires very careful consideration before we can say how many houses would be involved.  I do not know where the figure of 200 comes from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment will be acceptable to the general body of members here inasmuch as it is a clear incitement or encouragement to local authorities, such as you have here in Dublin, where there is necessity for building houses, and where you have in charge of the administration a Commissioner who feels that his main work is to provide houses for the workers, to strike such a rate. He is not very much troubled as to what the feelings of the ratepayers generally concerned are or whether their attitude is favourable or unfavourable. I mean he is in a different position to that of a county council which is responsible for the administration of a county.  The members of a county council are directly in touch with the people, and I feel that when they are asked to strike a shilling in the £ they are asked to do something which is not feasible, and the Minister knows perfectly well that they will not do it.  The object of the amendment, in my opinion, is to give better opportunities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take a case where there are no urban areas the county councils have to deal with this matter of housing.  There you have a case in which the county council is implicated.  Under this amendment you give facilities to larger corporations or to county councils that are well situated financially, by striking a rate of a shilling in the £ to raise such a sum of money.  The result of it will be that you will increase the number of houses built in one county or in an urban area to the detriment of poorer areas.  In the case of Dublin here, a rate of a shilling in the £ brings in about £50,000.  If you take the average cost of a house at £400&mdash;I think it is something over that&mdash;that means that something like 140 houses will be built, and if you give an additional sum of £12 for each house it will mean that an additional sum of £1,680 will be taken out of this total grant of £200,000.  To my mind this clause will undoubtedly lead to certain authorities in the country getting a far larger proportion of the grant than they are entitled to.  They will get a larger share of the grant than would be ordinarily allotted to them while councils which are financially embarrassed and which cannot afford to strike a shilling rate will be deprived of that share of the grant which they would otherwise receive. I am opposed to the amendment because I think it is most unfair in a general way to the community.</P>

      <P>I have again to point out that the proposal only applies to the urban districts.  In reply to what Deputy Briscoe has said, I can only say that if this money is used up, a new Housing Bill will be brought in.  If I could give consideration to the matter overnight and if I saw that the money provided under the Bill should be increased rather than that we should have to look forward to a new Housing Bill at an early date, I would perhaps deal with it, but as <Col N="60" /> the matter stands, the only effect of having the money used up will be that a new Housing Bill will have to be brought in at an earlier date than was anticipated.</P>

If Dublin strikes a rate of a shilling. Dublin will absorb practically all of this money under this Bill.

I think the Deputy will hardly suggest that there is any sign of that at present.  It is only in urban districts that we have been given hope of a housing rate, and I think it is premature to give any consideration to the matter of what might be done in a case where a county council is prepared to strike a housing rate, in respect of labourers' cottages.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the best way to encourage that would be not to make it compulsory on the council to strike another shilling rate, but to leave it optional to the council to strike a smaller rate where a smaller rate would meet the requirements of the district?</P>
      <P>You will not get the county council to strike a rate of one shilling in the £, but if they got certain privileges of striking a rate of threepence or sixpence where the area of charge is fairly large, and where the rateable valuation is large, it would encourage them.

Nothing less than a one shilling rate would be of any use, considering the housing requirements of the urban districts.  The county council does not come into the matter of this particular scheme at all.

      <P>One of the unsatisfactory features of this Bill is that it is proposed to make grants on a flat rate quite irrespective of the type of house for which the grant is to be given.  On a Second Reading of the Bill we indicated that our opinion was that the four-roomed house was the house that the local authorities at any rate should set out to build in the main.  I was sorry when I heard the Minister say that he was anxious to get this Bill through immediately, because it was our intention on the Report Stage, when further amendments on the section were dealt with, to bring in an amendment changing the flat rate to one which would give some slight preference to the four-roomed house over the three-roomed house.  As it stands it is obvious that what is going to happen is, as Deputy Good pointed out in the case of the private builder, there will be a definite inducement to build three-roomed houses rather than four-roomed ones.  The proportion of the cost is, I understand, something about 4 to 5.  In that case it seems to me that grants ought to be roughly in that proportion.  Our intention was to propose that the rates should be £45 and £60, leaving £60 to four-roomed houses and five-roomed houses, and making no distinction between four-roomed and five-roomed houses, and £45 for the three-roomed houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the private builder we would not propose to reduce his amount lower but to leave in the case of three-roomed houses the inducement there to the private builders and to have a direct inducement to the local authority to build four-roomed rather than three-roomed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that position is fully safeguarded by the position in which the Minister for Local Government is placed in regard to schemes of houses to be put up by the local authorities.  All schemes put up under the Working Classes Act have to be approved of <Col N="63" /> by the Minister, and naturally the whole circumstances of the district and the objective of the local authority's scheme will be very carefully considered before approval is given to the scheme.  The Ministry would not be prepared to approve, to any large extent, of the three-roomed house, that is of the one living room and two bedrooms type of house, but there might be cases in part of a fairly large scheme where it would be desirable that a few houses of that kind might be provided for.  As some of the Deputies have explained, the cost of the three-roomed house is relatively greater than that of the four-roomed house, and there is a case for not reducing the grant for the three-roomed houses in the isolated and really few cases in which such houses would be sanctioned, but the Department's whole housing policy is to control what will be done. There is full control in the Department over what is done in the matter of preparing the schemes and the type of houses they will approve when provided by local authorities. So I would not be prepared to accept a proposal that there should be a smaller grant for the three-roomed houses.  It might be desirable that the grant would be the same, and there is full power in the Minister to prevent the building of houses of too small a kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that we have no control over the policy of the Ministry.  We do not know very definitely what is going to be the policy with respect to the three-roomed house and the four-roomed house, and we think we should have some definite guarantee that there is a special inducement to build a four-roomed house rather than a three-roomed house.  The policy of the Ministry may change from day to day.  We have no control over it, and I think we are justified in seeing it down in black and white and in seeing that it would be effective in the Bill and we would like to have an opportunity of having an amendment discussed <Col N="64" /> by the House if the Minister is not prepared to meet us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that there is nothing terribly wrong in leaving the matter open.  It is only a question of having the matter wrong for a period, say, of twelve months, and the matter can be further considered then, but in the meantime I think we ought to be free to allow the local authority to build a certain number of three-roomed houses, if necessary.  I personally would not be prepared to agree to it as a kind of general practice, or be prepared to agree that there is any other type of houses which are required for the working classes than the four-roomed house with the one living room and three bedrooms.</P>

      <P>Have we a definite assurance with respect to the policy of the Ministry in this respect?  I am not quite clear what the policy of the Ministry is.  Is it a fact that the policy of the Ministry is that four-roomed houses should be the rule and that three-roomed houses should be built only in very exceptional cases by local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a very large number of urban areas, and the circumstances in each area have to be considered in connection with each particular scheme. Schemes which are put up from time to time under these Acts in connection with these cases are only a picked out part of the problem, a contribution to the solution of the whole.  I would not be prepared to say that only four-roomed houses should be allowed, just as I would not be prepared to say that there should be only three or five-roomed houses.  You have families of the poorer classes to be considered with large and small families.  You will require a certain amount of discretion in that matter.  Any discretion that will be exercised as between having three, four or five-roomed houses will be a discretion exercised jointly by the Minister and the local authorities with the controlling power in the matter in the hands of <Col N="65" /> the Minister.  But usually, I think, local authorities know their requirements and act rather reasonably as regards the type of house they are providing.  The type of house that has mostly been provided in recent months is a four-roomed house.  At any rate, if we do allow three-roomed houses in this particular Act to be built, it will mean that we will gain a certain amount of experience, and I think local authorities and the Ministry are looking for that experience. It may be that there is not very much at stake, except such schemes as will be put up within twelve months or within nine months.</P>

      <P>While I am not objecting to this Bill going through as it is, it is quite clear that this particular attitude with regard to housing is an indication that the Government are putting the responsibility of providing houses definitely on local bodies as distinct from the Government taking responsibility on their own shoulders.

In Dublin City for 300 houses they would have to strike a rate of 1/-. That would realise £57,000, and for £57,000 they would get from the Government £21,000.  If they did not strike the rate they would be able to get £18,000 for the smaller houses, so that by striking a 1/- rate to raise the £57,000 they are only getting £3,000 extra.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is suggesting is that the Ministry <Col N="66" /> would agree to a scheme for 300 houses in respect of which the Corporation would provide £57,000; that is to say, a scheme in Dublin would be approved for which the Government would provide £72 a house and the local authority would provide £200.  The residue only would be found from the tenant in the matter of rent.  I cannot imagine, being put the problem right off, that it would mean any such thing.</P>

      <P>These Estimates show a net increase of £57,990. It will, however, be seen that in the first part of the Estimate which deals with salaries, etc., there is no increase. I dealt last year with very substantial increases in staff and cost of administration that had taken place.  Under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous Grants,&rdquo; apart from the increase shown for housing which is £59,915, Deputies will note that an increase is indicated in every instance. This group includes the contributions of the State to various social services other than housing. The amount is in total £106,396.  This is a modest contribution to public services of a most important character. They are the grants towards maternity and child welfare, the medical treatment of school children, the provision of school meals to children and the treatment of tuberculosis and veneral diseases.  I suggest to Deputies, apart altogether from the fact that these grants are built up of statutory grants that are given to local authorities and are the measure of the expenditure on these matters by local authorities, it is not desirable to make reductions in them.  As a matter of fact, such reductions would be illusory economies.  Every pound of this money will bring its certain return manifold in the prevention of needless suffering to mothers and infants and in the avoidance of the many kinds of physical impairment which become chronic in adult life because of neglect, inattention or ignorance during childbirth and infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress of preventive medicine must depend entirely on the acquiescence of the public generally in the advantages to be attained. Much enlightenment has been secured by voluntary agencies and by the medical officers and nurses connected with various maternity and child-welfare and tuberculosis schemes throughout the country. <Col N="69" /> That is through these voluntary agencies.  Praise is due to those early propagandists who without proper machinery or organisation involved public interest in the facts as to health.  In matters of public health the application of the results of experience demands co-ordination and efficient administration.</P>
    <P>The appointment of county medical officers of health and the inauguration of school medical services, which are now being steadily advanced, afford the opportunity of placing health schemes on a sound and systematic basis.  County medical officers of health are now working in Cork, Carlow, Kildare, Louth, Offaly and Westmeath, and assistant medical officers of health in Cork (3) and Kildare (1).  The public health schemes in these counties are in various stages of development. In addition to schemes for the prevention of tuberculosis and for the medical inspection of school children schemes for the eradication of diphtheria have been undertaken in Louth and Cork.  On the whole, the Department have no reason to be dissatisfied at the progress made in appointing county medical officers of health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The matter is under discussion in Meath. The adverse financial circumstances of many counties have caused delay, which can be understood.  The importance of the question and the <Col N="70" /> necessity for such whole-time health officers are now being generally recognised. The Donegal County Council have decided to appoint a county medical officer of health (£800-£900), and an assistant medical officer of health, who will act as school medical officers and tuberculosis officers; and the Meath County Council are asking the Local Appointments Commissioners to recommend a suitable person as county medical officer of health (£800). The question is under consideration in Roscommon, Wicklow, Monaghan and Limerick, and it is hoped that a number of additional appointments will be made in the course of a few months.  It is intended to press for further appointments as opportunity offers in the remaining counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the most effective use of the county medical staff of a public health scheme has engaged the earnest attention of the Department. The easiest administrative arrangement would probably be to allocate an assistant medical officer of health to a particular section of the work, but the effect of this method would be to create watertight compartments in which the staff would lose the wider outlook which is essential to their highest development.  In order, therefore, to attain the highest ultimate efficiency, the medical staff of each county unit will be empowered in as many branches of the work as it may be possible to arrange.  In Cork and Kildare the Department have been enabled, through the generous financial assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation, to set about providing the requisite organisation for these health units. The scheme in Cork provides for the appointment of three whole-time assistant medical officers of health, to whom shall be assigned definite areas.  These assistant medical officers of health will also act as tuberculosis medical officers under the supervision and direction of the county medical officer of health.  A superintendent public health nurse and six other whole-time nurses for the school service will shortly be appointed. <Col N="71" /> Maternity and child welfare work will, it is hoped, be carried on here and elsewhere by nurses employed by the district nursing associations under the supervision of the county medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>The question of the training of sanitary inspectors has been a matter of much concern to the Department. A three months course of practical experience supplemented by a series of lectures has been arranged in Dublin to enable persons seeking the position of sanitary inspector to acquire a fundamental knowledge of the duties of the office.  These courses are given periodically and due notice is given in the Press.  It is intended to appoint whole-time sanitary inspectors where county health schemes are in operation and it is hoped that the higher salaries attaching to the positions will attract persons of good education.  The work of the sanitary inspector as at present organised was found not to be up to modern requirements.  The prescribed course of training is short but the County Medical Officers of Health already in office have expressed their willingness to give further instruction and to complete the training of persons appointed as sanitary inspectors.  This arrangement has many advantages which commend it to the Department as there are many sanitary problems of rural life that do not present themselves for solution in cities.</P>
    <P>In the case of a school medical service, the organisation of this service is inevitable but it awaits the appointment of the County Medical Officers of Health because the whole scheme of school medical attendance will have to be controlled, directed and co-ordinated by the County Medical Officer of Health.  Schemes have been operating for some time in Dublin, Cork and Clonmel.  Since we last discussed the matter here new schemes have been put into operation in the County Borough of Limerick, in County Cork, County Kildare, Offaly and Louth.  We hope before long that the scheme will operate in Westmeath, too.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves that particular phase of the subject, I would like to know if it is his intention to put the young men who desire to be sanitary inspectors to the expense of attending lectures in Dublin, with the possibility also that they might never be appointed. Does the Minister consider there are three centres&mdash;Dublin, Cork and Galway&mdash;in which this instruction could be just as easily given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is really only in its infancy.  It is difficult to organise these schemes and they will require the co-operation of the university college and the local medical officer of health.  I would like to consider to what extent vacancies will exist before incurring whatever expense may be involved. I do not know how costly these courses will be.  One does not want to set up courses and invite young men to go to the expense of attending them when there would be no subsequent employment for them.  I would be prepared to consider the matter in relation to the number of vacancies likely to occur in the future.  I would also consider the places where facilities could be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing my chief point.  I take it the intention is to give a course of lectures. After these potential sanitary inspectors have attended the course an examination will be held &mdash;a competitive examination&mdash;for those who attended the lectures.  I suggest instead of putting these men to the expense of attending lectures in Dublin&mdash;possibly men from all parts of Ireland&mdash;that wherever there is a medical officer of health he would be sufficiently competent to give information to aspirants for sanitary inspectorships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have to understand that there is a very limited number of these positions, and, in so far as instruction can be given by county medical officers of health, we cannot expect them to take control of the raw <Col N="73" /> material for sanitary officers and set themselves up as regular professors, delivering to those aspirants rather important and perhaps difficult lectures in matters pertaining to public health and hygiene, and, to some extent, medicine generally.  In order to prepare the ground so that the medical officer of health would have suitable material to work on, you would have to have the co-operation of the university or some other such place where men with experience in medicine and public health matters would be available.  Before the present course was arranged for in the City the alternative was to go to London.  We are at least making some progress in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Deputies already know of these developments.  A much more satisfactory way of drawing attention to alternatives would be to send a letter or a memorandum to the Department. If the Estimates are to be discussed in such detail as to determine where and what sanitary inspectors are to be taught, and if we are to have such long discussions over these matters, then we will want a very long time indeed to discuss the entire Estimates.  The type of person we are looking for in the shape of a sanitary inspector is a better class of man than we have had up to the present, and he would have a larger area of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the heading of Child Welfare there are 29 local authorities and 77 voluntary agencies.  It is hoped to develop this important service still further in the counties according as medical officers of health are appointed.  Much valuable work has been done under existing arrangements both by the local bodies and voluntary agencies. <Col N="74" /> In Dublin the medical officer recently appointed, besides attending at the various baby clubs in Dublin, will hold ante-natal clinics at the Carnegie Institute and will give lectures and instructions to mothers and expectant mothers.  That will co-ordinate in a useful way the work of many local bodies.</P>
    <P>As regards the welfare of the blind, it is not expected there will be very much increase in the future, and the arrangements are, I think, fairly satisfactory.  The standard scheme devised by the Department has been adopted in all counties and county boroughs except Limerick County Borough.  Owing to financial considerations, however, only the portion of the scheme dealing with education and training of blind persons in approved institutions has been adopted in Galway and Wicklow counties, and the Boards of Health and Public Assistance in Limerick and Mayo have manifested unwillingness to carry their schemes into operation.  These local bodies are being urged to carry out their statutory duties under the Blind Persons Act.  Provision is made in the standard scheme for affording suitable blind persons according to their needs and circumstances (1) education or industrial training in approved institutions; (2) employment in workshops of approved institutions, maintenance in a hostel and augmentation of wages; (3) maintenance in approved homes if incapable of work owing to age or infirmity; (4) monetary assistance so as to assure certain weekly incomes to necessitous and unemployable blind living in their own homes. These weekly incomes vary from 14/- in county boroughs to a minimum of 7/6 in counties for single persons, with an increased scale for married blind men and further provision for families.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of tuberculosis there is an increase of £9,500, or slightly over 12 per cent. on last year's grant.  The numbers of tuberculous patients dealt with under approved tuberculosis schemes have risen steadily in recent years, and <Col N="75" /> the latest returns which relate to the year ended 31st March, 1928, show a total of 14,445 cases, or over 14 per cent. more than in the preceding year.  An estimate cannot yet be made as regards 1928-29, but the general indications would point to a further substantial increase in the number of patients dealt with.  This influx of patients goes to show that persons suffering from the disease are acquiring more confidence in the arrangements made for their treatment, and that the facilities afforded by the tuberculosis schemes are benefiting the classes of the population for which they are primarily intended. These schemes are developing normally and are in operation in Cork, Dublin and Waterford County Boroughs, and in twenty-two counties.  Moreover, Cork County and Limerick County Borough are in the act of establishing suitable arrangements for dealing with tuberculosis, and similar action is under consideration in Meath and Wicklow counties.  Roscommon and Longford have not yet decided to follow suit.</P>
    <P>The accommodation for the institutional treatment of early cases of the disease is generally adequate and would be quite ample if the more advanced cases which are often sent to sanatoria were provided for elsewhere. The chief desideratum at the moment is, therefore, the extension of the residential facilities for the advanced and moderately advanced cases of the disease which constitute the bulk of the total number of persons affected.  Substantial progress has been recently made in this direction, and it is expected that as a result the institutional accommodation specially reserved for tuberculous patients will be increased by about 460 beds in the near future.  I think it need not be expected that there will be any very substantial increase in the amount of money to be devoted to the treatment of tuberculosis in the future.  The arrangements which exist, with a few additions which require to be made in certain places, seem to be adequate.</P>
    <P>As regards finances of county <Col N="76" /> councils, there has been a gradual improvement in the rate collection, but a more willing response to the demands made upon ratepayers will be necessary before local finances are placed in a really satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be nearer the point to say that a more effective operation of the machine for rate collection will be necessary before full advantage can be taken of the willingness of ratepayers to pay their burden of rates when called upon to do so.  Much of the delay in the rate collection that has come under my notice is due to the fact that the county councils are not prepared to urge their rate collecting machines to a full and satisfactory effort.  During the last twelve months, however, a very considerable improvement has taken place. On 31st March, 1928, there was 24.5 per cent. of the warrants outstanding. On 31st March, 1929, the percentage of outstanding rates was 19.5.  There has been a 5 per cent. improvement during last year in the collection of the rates.  Some bodies have made very substantial improvements. There are other public bodies that will require a certain amount of pressure before their rate collection can be said to be satisfactory. The amount outstanding on the 31st March, 1929, was approximately £557,000 or 19.5 of the total year's warrant.  At 31st March, 1928, the percentage of the current year's warrant then outstanding was 24.3. The amount of overdrafts on local bodies at the end of March, 1928, was £381,780.  This year at the same date the amount of the overdraft is reduced to £201,949.  A substantial improvement is suggested there, but on the other hand certain local bodies are rather slow in discharging their liabilities generally.  When we say there is a substantial improvement in the amount of overdraft held by county councils at this time as compared with last year, we have to take into consideration that perhaps the explanation of that is that a large number of debts owing by county councils are still unpaid.  Every effort is made <Col N="77" /> to see that local bodies discharge their liabilities at a reasonable time. In some cases it is difficult to get that done.</P>
    <P>As regards roads, I am glad to say that the relations generally between the Department and road authorities have been satisfactory.  There have, of course, been cases where we do not see eye to eye with one another, but there has been no suggestion that our efforts have not been well directed, even in these cases.  Work under the national scheme is now practically completed.  The sum remaining unpaid on 1st April, 1929, out of two millions allocated, was only £124,439.  The greater portion of this sum represents the balances to be discharged when accounts are finally wound up.  It was thought that the scheme would have been completed by October last, but at the end of that month the balance outstanding in respect of the different allocations was £276,517, or nearly £300,000.  Last year we allocated £500,000 towards maintenance and improvement grants.  This year we are allocating £600,000.  We had hoped that by the co-operation of county councils a grant for improvement as distinct from the upkeep of main roads would have been notified by this, but for various reasons councils have apparently found it difficult to come to an early definite decision.  We were furnished from time to time with figures, and, almost concurrently, with an intimation that these figures would probably be revised at a later meeting.  While we are, on the one hand, very encouraged by the evidently thoughtful consideration which the road authorities are devoting to their estimates, we would be glad if they could make up their minds a bit earlier than in general they have done.</P>

      <P>We endeavoured as long ago as October to get the county councils to let us know fairly definitely what their expenditure on maintenance work would be for this <Col N="78" /> year, the reason being that we contribute from the Road Fund 50 per cent. of the cost of maintenance of main roads and 30 per cent. of the cost of maintenance of link roads. Until we would know what amount ought to be set aside for maintenance we could not say how much of the £600,000 could be allotted for improvement work.  The result is that county councils find themselves at this time without information as to the amount they can have for improvement work this year.  County councils may be ready with their schemes for improvement; summer months are the months during which improvement works are carried out. A certain amount of maintenance work can be left over to winter, but improvement work must be done in summer, and it is most desirable that the county councils would know at the earliest possible moment how much money is allocated for improvement in their areas.  The Department has done everything it could do to put county councils in the position of knowing what amount of money is coming to them. Now because of the fact that in some counties we do not yet know how much they are going to spend on maintenance, we have not, up to the present, been able to let them know how much they are to have for improvement.  I expect to let them know within another fortnight or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time last year it appeared from the figures then before us that the sums passed by the road authorities for the upkeep of their roads amounted to £1,158,973.  The grant towards this expenditure was £235,000 approximately, and by the aid of the grant towards this expenditure the local contribution would be, approximately, £968,000.  For the coming year, while all the figures are not yet definitely available, it appears that the proposals passed by county councils for the maintenance of the main roads in both urban and rural areas and the county roads in 1929-30 amount to £1,328,328, of which, approximately, £312,000 will be provided from the <Col N="79" /> Road Fund as a grant.  Allowing for a sum, which in a few counties must be applied to additional works, the net sum to be raised by the councils themselves for maintenance is £1,041,328.  The increase in both the net figures and in the upkeep grant is largely due to a higher standard of maintenance&mdash;viz., surface dressing of the roads which have been laid down at such considerable cost to the Road Fund over the past five years.</P>
    <P>The report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the control and regulation of road traffic was presented in September last.  The recommendations have been considered very carefully, and while the matter has not been fully considered by the Executive Council up to the present, instructions have been given for the preparation of a Bill along the lines of the majority report.  I am not able to say at present when I may be in a position to present a Bill dealing with the matter, but a number of matters have already been dealt with by the Motor Car Public Services Vehicles Order, 1928, which deals with such matters arising out of the report as could be dealt with by administrative action.</P>
    <P>Since the last estimates were presented the reports of the Department for the two years ending March, 1927, have been published.  I hope to be able to publish shortly the report for the year ending March, 1928.  The local taxation account up to the year 1926 has been published since we last discussed the estimates, and I hope to be in a position shortly to publish the accounts for the year ended March, 1927.  As to the Poor Law Commission report.  I stated in the Seanad some months ago that the rough draft of a Bill dealing with the codification generally of the Poor Law is practically prepared. There is such an amount of old legislation involved in the Poor Law generally that we have thought it desirable to frame a Bill codifying the whole of the Poor Law.  It will give an opportunity to the Oireachtas <Col N="80" /> for a full review of the law, and it will be a great blessing to local bodies that have to deal with the administration of the Poor Law to have the law codified into one Act. A considerable amount of work has been done on the preparation of that. I cannot yet say when the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of discussing it, but in so far as it is possible to speed up the work, it is being done.</P>
    <P>The Milk Commission has reported and I have before me a draft Bill dealing with the recommendations. In connection with the National Health Insurance Report, a Bill dealing with such recommendations of the Commission as the Executive Council are prepared to approve of has been for some time in the Parliamentary draftsman's hands.  The draftsman has been busy with a large number of matters, and as soon as that matter can be dealt with we will introduce a Bill.  I have already stated what the position is with regard to Greater Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for this year totals nearly half a million, which is a good-sized figure.  If we were getting value for it, nobody would complain.  As to whether we are or not, there will be differences of opinion.  In some respects, no doubt, good work has been done by the Department.  As far as money is available, probably the social services are as well conducted here as in any of the surrounding countries, but the trouble is that there is not sufficient money.  I should like to see a good deal more out of the total of just half a million devoted to improving the social services and public health generally.  However, before I come to that there are one or two points in connection with the staff on which I would like to have some information.  Last year we were told there had been, and I believe there was, a considerable reduction in the number of the staff, as compared with the previous year&mdash;considerable reduction certainly in comparison with the year that the new Local Government Department took over. There has also been, as far as the <Col N="81" /> number given in the estimates goes, a slight reduction in the number of the staff in the last year.  I am not so very keen on mere reduction of staff.  If the reduction means that the efficiency of the staff is decreased, then I am not so keen about it.  I should like to see at all cost efficiency in working and good value being given for the money expended.  There has been a reduction of five.  Where that reduction took place or what the individuals concerned were I do not know and I do not suppose that it matters very much.  At any rate, if efficiency is not decreased, it is good to see a reduction in cost and in the number of officials who are, after all, a cost to the community.  There is one appointment which seems to be new.  Reference is made here to the appointment of an Intelligence Officer.  I do not know what exactly the duties of that officer would be. I presume that the heads of Departments would be intelligence officers, especially as far as their own particular branches are concerned.  Why there should be one gentleman or lady described as an intelligence officer I do not know&mdash;perhaps there is need for it.  The Minister will probably tell us why.  There is to be a sum of £600, presumably with bonus, spent on that officer.  That seems to be a new appointment, as there was no such officer mentioned in last year's estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice another new appointment, when going through the estimates&mdash; that of a pharmacist.  I do not know why there should be necessity for a pharmacist in a Department that is purely administrative.  There may be good reason.  I imagine the medical inspectors of the Department should be qualified in pharmacy; medical men usually are.  They ought to be specialists enough to give any advice to dispensary doctors in matters relating to materia medica.  I am sure the House would like to know what is the reason for this appointment. The salary is £250 a year presumably, also, with bonus.  There is another matter&mdash;that is the case of two general inspectors, which also seem to be new appointments, at salaries of £500 a year each.  I take <Col N="82" /> it they are necessary, but I would like to know what the special need is for gentlemen styled general inspectors, and, also, what are the qualifications of these men, and who appointed them.  I would like to know if it is the Civil Service Commissioners that selects these men, or if they are to be appointed merely on the nomination of the Minister.  If so, we will be glad to know what qualifications these gentlemen possess for nomination to such office.  I take it they have some special qualifications, but what are general inspectors?  They may be engineers, or doctors, and they may be fully qualified in engineering or in medicine.  I do not know whether you could appoint a lawyer as a general inspector to the Local Government Department or not, or a chartered accountant. Whatever they be we would like to know the reason for the appointment, the qualifications, if any, of the persons appointed, and the appointing authority, whether it be the Civil Service Commission or whether it was the nomination of the Minister.</P>
    <P>One other appointment.  I would like to ask a question about.  There is no salary put down this year for the chief roads engineer.  I wonder has the chief roads engineer become an honorary appointment.  I do not imagine he has.  The salary last year was £815, possibly plus bonus.  I should like to know if the chief roads engineer is being dispensed with, for then we could understand the salary being left out this year. Presumably that is not the case. What then has happened with regard to him?  Why is his salary not included this year is a thing that some of us would like to know.</P>
    <P>There are also temporary auditors &mdash;there is one, at any rate, provided for.  Would the Minister tell us what are the qualifications in the case of these auditors appointed; also, who is the appointing authority and the person who selects them?  In sub-section (j) of the Estimates there is this year a decrease of £6,000 in the grant under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1907.  How does that decrease <Col N="83" /> arise?  Does it mean there is less provision this year for labourers' cottages to be built in the country, or what, exactly, is the meaning of it?  It may be quite all right, and I have no doubt indeed it is, but I do not understand it, and I should be glad if the Minister will let us know the explanation of that decrease.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say there was an improvement with regard to the number of county medical officers of health that had been appointed, or were being appointed.  I spoke at fair length last year on this subject.  I said that, in my opinion, the public health of the Free State was in a very backward condition; you might almost say a rotten condition, looking at it from the public health conditions generally.  That is not entirely due to the Local Government Department.  It is due to historical causes perhaps, but I believe the Local Government Department, with the money and staff at their disposal, could do more and could force more to be done.  They could oblige the authorities in existence and working directly or indirectly under the Department to be more active and to do more to raise the public health standard generally in the country.  We think they could do a great deal more in educating the country on the need there is for improvement. They could use the staff to a much greater extent to impress upon the country and upon public men and upon county councils, through the organisation under their control, the grave need there is for improvement in the public health services in the country.  Until you get the public, and particularly responsible public men, imbued with the idea that we are in a really backward state in regard to sanitation, public health, and social services, you will not make good progress in this House.  There will have to be wider knowledge in the country of the necessity for improvement in these matters before the country is prepared to move forward with the rapidity that is necessary with regard <Col N="84" /> to public health services in general and sanitation and housing in particular.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that there has been an increase in the number of medical officers of health.  I do not know exactly how many the Minister mentioned as now actually at work.  I took down the list&mdash;Cork County, Carlow, Kildare, Louth, Offaly and Westmeath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far, so good; but that is a very small number out of the total.  Out of the Twenty-six Counties you have only five that have appointed county medical officers of health.  That is not good enough.  Again, I do not say that the Department is wholly responsible, but I think they ought to bring greater pressure to bear and to use the machinery at their disposal to bring greater pressure to bear in having these officers appointed. I know there is opposition. I know the county councils and the public behind them need educating in this matter, and they will not move, generally speaking, voluntarily or of their own accord. Pressure must be exercised and education brought to bear on them, and I think the Department and its officers could do more in that direction. A good deal has been done in some of the cities, and although I am not certain that I heard the Minister correctly, I gather something was also done in some of the towns with regard to child welfare.  That is a branch of health very much neglected in the Twenty-six Counties.  Dublin City has done something.  It is probably moving fairly well in the right direction, but when we consider the high infant mortality in urban areas in the Free State and compare that with the death rate in urban areas round about us we can see the necessity there is for a big increase in the <Col N="85" /> work being done in the direction of child welfare.</P>
      <P>Last year somebody, I think it was the Minister, gave us the figures dealing with infant mortality in Dublin. They showed that 118 children per thousand died every year in Dublin, whereas the figure in London, was 64 per thousand.  Although that figure applies only to Dublin City it is something which gives us reason to think.  There is something radically wrong when in Dublin City a hundred and eighteen out of every thousand children born in a year are doomed to death before they reach twelve months.  The death rate is not as high in other urban centres in the Free State, but still it is abnormally high.  Attention should frequently be drawn to it and to the necessity of the expenditure of money by public authorities on the spread of education so that that alarming death rate could be gradually reduced.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the Public Health Commission's report.  I understood from him that a Bill, embodying some of the suggestions with regard to improving conditions and adopting the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission, was now being drafted. I know that some of the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission's report are being put into operation here and there in different parts of the country, but there are recommendations in regard to specific problems, like that of the unmarried mother.  Unfortunately that problem is growing, and the classification of that type of person.  That is something that needs attention and probably money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the provision of pensions for widows is another important matter that has to be attended to and which will probably prove costly.  It will not improve public health if we merely pigeon hole these reports.  Public authorities in the country should make use of such reports to spread knowledge, educate public opinion, and force unwilling ratepayers and taxpayers &mdash;it is for their own good&mdash;along the road towards improving public <Col N="86" /> health.  The authorities on whom the responsibility rests regarding public health, public morals, and social services ought to be active in spreading knowledge on these matters, and in that way inducing people to see the necessity of spending more money so that conditions generally may be improved.</P>
    <P>During the last few weeks I have had many poor people calling on me in regard to the arrangements for home help in the City of Dublin and in regard to the amount granted.  I know that the Ministry is not directly responsible for the administration of home help in the City of Dublin, but the officers in charge are officers of the Department, and from the stories I have heard I believe that they are not acting with that broadness of mind with which they should act when they are up against conditions of poverty and starvation such as exist in the City of Dublin. I know it is true that the home help granted in Dublin is higher than the amount granted in other parts of the country, but the conditions of life in Dublin City are different.  I think that the Department, whose officers are administering the public affairs of the city, ought to see to it that the poor are treated with a little more thought and consideration than they are getting, according to the numerous stories to which I have unfortunately had to listen for the last month.  I know that in the country the question of home help is difficult and that ratepayers find it hard to meet the claims made upon them. That is not a matter over which the Local Government Department has absolute control, but they could, by way of education through their medical officers, help those who are directly responsible to a greater realisation of their duty to the poor and afflicted.  I do not think that all that is possible to be done by the local authorities in Dublin in the way of relieving necessitous cases is being done, I will not say generously, as we are too poor to be generous, but, at any rate, in the way in which, in my opinion, it is required to be done.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister <Col N="87" /> speak of the improvement in the services in regard to tuberculosis. That disease has been a terrible affliction in this country, and it is good to hear that improved conditions all round can be reported by the Department in so far as practically every county in the Free State is concerned, and that better arrangements have been made for the treatment of all classes of cases. I take it that that is what the Minister said&mdash;advanced cases in particular. It is agreeable to know that these poor afflicted people are getting all the attention that can be given to them out of the public purse.  We had some talk about housing to-day and have had several talks recently on that subject.  I do not want to go into it again.  On this side of the House we have expressed the opinion over and over again that we are not satisfied that the Department is doing all it should, or that the Government is giving it all the money necessary to deal with that question.</P>
    <P>The money granted is probably being spent as it should be spent, but our complaint is that the effect of bad housing on the public health generally is not sufficiently realised and is not brought home to the people.  In regard to the general ill effect, the possible spread of disease from slum areas arising out of bad housing, and the spread of diseases of different kinds, not alone in the areas concerned but all through the community, we think that the Department, purely from a public health point of view, should stress every day and more and more on the Government the immediate necessity of spending a larger sum of money than they have yet spent in any one year in eradicating the housing evil.  As there has been some discrepancy in regard to the number of houses built during the last financial year, perhaps the Minister would give us the exact figures in regard to such houses, the number built since 1922 by local authorities, public utility societies, and private persons and, if possible, also the number of houses of three <Col N="88" /> rooms and of four rooms that were included in these housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Many county councillors who have been speaking to me are very dissatisfied with the sums granted to their respective bodies out of the Road Fund.  I know that it would be very difficult to satisfy the demands that are likely to be made by all these bodies for road purposes. The Road Fund is bound to cause greater and greater difficulty as time goes on.  Although the number of motor users and the amount of income from licence duties have increased considerably in recent years, the Fund, when we take into consideration the mileage of road that has to be dealt with, is by no means adequate to cover the demands that are necessarily made on it.</P>
    <P>There is only a small portion of the total main roads of the country dealt with in anything like an adequate way out of this fund.  The total mileage of important roads in the country is very large, and the amount of money in proportion is small.  I have heard more than one person, who claimed at any rate to be an expert, discussing the question as to whether or not there was good value got out of the money spent on the making, re-making and improvement of many of these roads.  Probably like every other profession, doctors, lawyers, and the rest, experts disagree, and this road problem possibly has not yet provided sufficient experience for engineers and road authorities in the Free State, any more than it has in any other country, for them to be able to say what kind of surface of road gives the best return for the money. At any rate there is considerable dissatisfaction&mdash;probably the Department and the Minister are made aware of it through the county councils and their officers &mdash;with regard to the amount made available out of the Central Fund for the maintenance and improvement of trunk roads and minor roads.  I do not suppose there is any likelihood that the mileage that has been already covered by the national scheme of two or <Col N="89" /> three years ago will be increased, certainly not to any considerable extent, in the course of the next twelve months.  No estimate, as far as I understand, has been prepared for the coming year, although there is and there will be, continued and pressing demand for an increase in that direction.</P>
    <P>There was one matter which the Minister mentioned that I have heard discussed at considerable length recently by some county councillors and others.  That is the question of defaulting rate collectors.  I did not gather from the Minister's statements that there had been any increase in the number of defaulting rate collectors but quite recently a number of cases have been mentioned to me.  Whether it is the case that there has been a large increase in one particular county or not I do not know but there has been a large number of cases brought to my knowledge. It occurred to me when I heard them to ask if the Minister or the Department had given at any time consideration to any other means of collecting rates.  I was told that in county Kerry they had abolished rate collectors and they were now collecting rates through the post office.  If that be true&mdash;I do not know if it is, I had not time to inquire into it&mdash;I would like if the Minister would tell us how it has worked and if he or his department think that such a system would be an improvement and would be more efficient, even if not less costly. Probably it would be less costly but at any rate some other method ought to be tried if it be true there is every year a number of defalcations. I am told that last year in one particular area there was a number of them.  What the amount involved was I do not know.  Probably these defalcations were covered by insurance. These rate collectors are under a bond but whether that be so or not&mdash;perhaps I am referring to something that has been thought out or on which some considerable discussion has taken place in the Department&mdash;if there has been discussion and if the Minister has considered this question of collections <Col N="90" /> and defalcations and has arrived at the conclusion that the present method is the best method and that there is no room for improvement or that no alternative method would be better, I would be glad to hear what his views on the matter are.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would wish to refer.  It does not exactly come under the Estimates, but it has reference to the Department at any rate.  That is, the question of the rearrangement of the municipal and public services generally in the Dublin area.  I would be glad, before the Minister has finished, if he would give us any definite date as to when the Bill, which I presume he has on the stocks for some time, with regard to the rearrangement of local authorities in the Dublin area&mdash;I think it is known as the Greater Dublin Bill &mdash;is likely to be introduced.</P>
    <P>I was asked by a county councillor the other day if I could give him some information on another question to which I would like to refer. I referred him to the Department, and I do not know whether he got the information there.  It relates to land annuities and the amounts stopped out of the Central Fund or whatever fund there is at Headquarters out of which the amounts of arrears of land annuities are stopped from county councils.  The question asked me was, when, having gone through the courts, the Land Commission secures payment of land annuities from those who owe them in the different counties, if credit is given to the county councils later on for the amounts so secured.  That probably is done, but this is one county councillor who did not know whether it was done or not, and if the Minister can enlighten us on that matter I would be glad.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Cork County Council, the County Board of Health, and the other boards in the county, I would like to bear testimony to the good work done by the Local Government Department, especially during the past two years. We have in the county at present a <Col N="91" /> principal medical officer of health and three assistants.  They are the machinery laid down by the Local Government Department.  They are doing very useful work in the county tending towards the public good and the public health.  We will have the inspection of national schools which, to my mind, is long overdue.  It is there all the evils came from.  The schoolhouses are better attended to, thanks to the Board of Works.  All that is wanting at present to make perfect the machinery of the public health in our county&mdash;let every hen scrape for herself&mdash;is the building of more houses for the poor working man.  If power were given to the boards of health to institute schemes for labourers' cottages, the same as rural district councils enjoyed, then, after sworn enquiries and the remainder of the legal formalities, I am sure that a great evil would be put a stop to that is compelling poor people to live in insanitary dwellings. Some of these insanitary dwellings are demolished, tumbled down, and taken away altogether, rather than pay rates for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The roads in my county are very much improved, thanks to the grants given by the Local Government Department during the past three years.  Unfortunately they ceased this year.  They were not as good as they might be, although they were not too bad.  There is another thing, that in the matter of water supplies which are an essential, the Local Government Department might see their way to give some help by way of grants wherever they think it might be of absolute necessity.  As to home assistance, that is altogether left in the hands of the members of the Board of Health and their officials, the relieving officers.  As far as we are concerned in the county of Cork, we deal fairly and squarely with these poor people, and never see them short whenever a deserving case is put up to us.  We are never brought to book or surcharged by the Local Government Department, and for that reason I am here to thank the <Col N="92" /> Local Government Department and bear testimony to the good work they have been doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I interrupted the Minister with a view to getting some information as to the modus operandi of the appointment of the inspectors with which he dealt.  Of course I was slightly out of order, and whilst the Minister gave me an answer I was not quite satisfied with it.  For that reason I will repeat my question.  I want to say at the outset that I support the Vote.  It possesses many good features this year that it did not possess last year.  I am for the moment concerned with one or two parts of the Minister's speech in introducing his Vote, and I want to get some explanation. He spoke about a scheme he had in view for the training of sanitary inspectors and mentioned the fact that it would be necessary for those who would secure those appointments in future to undergo a period of training in Dublin.  I suggested to the Minister that there were many other places in the twenty-six counties where sanitary inspectors could be trained with little or no expense to the State. Sanitary science is not such a very obscure subject that it could not be taught by any medical officer of health in the Free State.  Most medical officers of health now have the Diploma in Public Health, and I understand, in fact I know, that sanitary science enters largely into the curriculum of their lectures and examination.  I suggest to the Minister that on the grounds of economy that should be done, so that many of those people who intend to take up careers as sanitary inspectors, need not be put to the expense of coming to Dublin. They could take out their lectures in any town or city and come up for examination, if necessary to Dublin.  Even that would not be necessary.  Under the old regulations of the British Civil Service, the Minister must be aware, examinations were held in convenient centres to facilitate candidates, except examinations for the higher Civil Service.  I want the Minister's sympathy <Col N="93" /> for my suggestion.  It would obviate an amount of expense to young men who ambition these posts and it would not in any way take from their efficiency if they were qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly in the course of his speech spoke about child mortality and the high figures for child mortality in Dublin, but it was only towards the end of his speech that he indicated in any way that there were other causes operating besides bad sanitation.  I want to suggest that there are other causes and that unemployment and its corollaries, poverty, mal-nutrition, under-feeding are predisposing causes to this high mortality among children in Dublin, Cork and other places.  In this connection I may say that this Vote of £18,609 for child welfare, schools for mothers, etc., to me at any rate, appears to be one of the best features in this Vote.  I congratulate the Minister on his sympathetic treatment of this particular aspect of local government.  Again here I would like an assurance from him that it will not be necessary for inspectors or others set up under this head to have to attend lectures in Dublin.  There is absolutely no sense whatever in compelling men or women who intend to follow this career to attend lectures in Dublin. There is a very useful body in Dublin and in Cork, the Child Welfare League, which is doing magnificent work.  It has a grant from the Cork Corporation of something like £700 a year, and the Medical Officer of Cork City is a member of the Executive. A number of ladies and gentlemen generally give their time to committee work and other work incidental to the carrying on of a league of that nature.  The Medical Officer of Cork is a highly competent man, and I feel sure, also, he will be able to do the necessary work, such as lectures, required to qualify people for the position indicated in the Minister's speech.  I am not criticising this Vote as a whole.  I am just asking the Minister to consider this aspect of the question.  It will not produce at greater efficiency to bring those young men or women, as the <Col N="94" /> case may, be, to Dublin to undergo this course of lectures.  These lectures could just as well be given in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, or other centres where you have medical officers of health.  I had no desire to speak on this motion at all, except to get from the Minister an undertaking that he would not compel people who want to qualify for these positions to take up their lectures in Dublin, because I say there is no necessity for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last year on this estimate I said that I quite appreciated the difficulties that confronted the Minister for Local Government in dealing with the sanitation of inland towns in the country.  That difficulty, unfortunately, is still with us and, in my opinion, as I said last year, the difficulty of providing inland towns with a proper water supply and with a sewerage system will remain with us until the Government take their courage in their hands and make the whole question of sanitation a national scheme.  There is no reason why sanitation should not be treated as a national scheme.  Some years ago we had a scheme for trunk roads put into operation.  If that scheme was a success, in so far as the highways of the country are at the present time in good repair, and if the highways of the country deserve that attention and the spending of so much money on them, surely there is scarcely any necessity for me or for anybody else to impress upon this House that sanitation and its bearing upon the public health of the whole population of the Saorstát should receive at least the same consideration?  I am afraid so long as it is left to local bodies to take the initiative in carrying out these schemes that nothing will be done.  We had an example during the last year in the County of Roscommon where free grants were returned because the local council, for reasons of their own, would not incur the odium, if you like, of the farming community by putting the scheme into operation. There is only one way that this can be done, and that is by <Col N="95" /> making the whole thing a national problem.  It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the importance of this. Public health is, or should be, our greatest national asset.  It is no use talking about stopping emigration or starting industries in the country if we have not proper sanitation, giving the people a chance of being housed properly, and of living the lives that Christians should live.</P>
      <P>We have had during the last three weeks perhaps what should be sounded as a warning note to the whole country.  We have had, notwithstanding Press reports, a very serious outbreak of typhoid fever in the town of Carrick-on-Shannon.  We had three deaths from typhoid fever in that town during the last fortnight, and at the present time there are over 50 or 60 cases under treatment. The town has some sort of water supply, but, unfortunately, the supply is taken from the River Shannon at the identical spot where the sewage of the town gets into the river.  It is true that it is filtered, but I understand that the water has been analysed, and has been found to be sewage contaminated. With that epidemic in our minds I, for one, do not like to visualise what will happen in towns of the same size as Carrick-on-Shannon without any water supply whatever or without any sewerage system whatever.  With the fatal consequences of that outbreak in our minds, we should be determined to go straight forward to provide every town of the size of Carrick-on-Shannon or smaller towns with a proper water and sewerage system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the question of typhoid fever, I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  It is, when a case of typhoid fever is reported, as it has to be reported to his Department, that a scheme for compulsory inoculation against typhoid fever should be introduced in that area.  As a proof of the effectiveness of the anti-typhoid vaccine, I might quote the case of the British Army. In the Boer War the British Army had more casualties from typhoid <Col N="96" /> fever than they had from bullet wounds.  In the last war, when inoculation was introduced, typhoid fever was unknown.  In the Boer War we were dealing with thousands of men and in the Great War we were dealing with a question of millions, so that the effectiveness of the vaccine is beyond question.  It strikes me that the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health, as it is known, is a somewhat cumbersome Ministry, and I would suggest that there are other Ministries not as important and other Ministers who have not the important work that the Minister for Local Government has to do who are provided with Parliamentary Secretaries.  To my mind, it is such an important branch that public health should be treated either as a separate Ministry or that there should be a Parliamentary Secretary responsible for it attached to the Department of Local Government, until such time as we bring the public health of the country and until such time as we bring the sanitation of the country to a level with the public health and sanitation of all other civilised countries in Europe.  There is no question of it, we are long behind other countries yet, and we will remain long behind them until we tackle this matter in some earnest way.  There is just one other matter that I wish to refer to. That is, the question of the severity of the test, if I might so put it, that is asked for by the Department of Local Government in the case of applicants for blind pensions.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it when the Blind Pensions Act was introduced&mdash;the wording of the Act was &ldquo;so blind as to be unable to perform work for which eyesight was essential&rdquo;&mdash;the interpretation put upon it was that when the applicant, through defective eyesight, was no longer able to continue his ordinary occupation and earn his living through that occupation he was then automatically entitled to the blind pension.  There is no doubt but that was the original intention of the Act.  The Department stepped in with a test which was good <Col N="97" /> enough in the case of some people, in the case of the rougher trades. In the case of trades such as shoemaking, tailoring and seamstresses and trades of that class this test is entirely too severe.  It is not right to say that because a seamstress can no longer earn her living by sewing she should be disqualified from the blind pension because she can scrub floors.  I submit that if through bad eyesight a seamstress is no longer able to earn her living by sewing she should become entitled to the blind pension.  I believe that was the original interpretation put upon the wording.  I would ask the Minister to consider somewhat relaxing the stringent rules governing the granting of blind pensions.  I have been assured by many eye specialists in the Eye and Ear Hospitals in the city that there are many cases throughout the country where the test is too severe.  It is true that some sort of test should be imposed and adhered to so as to prevent any kind of lax administration. But I submit that we could produce evidence to prove that the test as at present imposed is far too severe.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his address stressed a very important point&mdash;the present condition of the rate collection in the Saorstát. I wish to say, as a member of the Cork County Council, that so far as our county is concerned we are alive to the situation, and I wish to say that we will leave no stone unturned to compel our collectors to do their duty.  Speaking of the portion of the county that I have the honour to represent, I wish to tell you that last October 95 per cent. of the first moiety was collected, and of the second moiety 85 per cent. was collected on the 31st March last.  I am speaking of people in congested districts, districts within the Gaeltacht, occupied altogether by very small holders.  When such people realise their duty to their county and to the State, and when they come forward and pay their contribution of the rate, it is an example to the people in the rest of the Saorstát, an example for them to follow.  As <Col N="98" /> far as we in Cork are concerned, I can inform the House that that collection was carried out without any seizures and without any persecution whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the collection was due to the anxiety of the people to perform their duty to the State and to the county.  If that principle is followed in the rest of the Saorstát our public machinery will work smoothly and our local public services will be all right because there will be the means to meet public expenditure.  If the rates are not paid and if the councils in the rest of the Saorstát do not insist on the ratepayers performing their duty, then the country will be in a bad way.  As far as my county is concerned we insist that the rate collectors do their duty and then nobody is to blame.  If the collectors fail then they are in the hands of the Local Government Department. It is for the local councils to co-operate in this matter and to see that the collections are properly carried out.  I entirely agree with what my colleague Deputy Daly said with regard to the anxiety of the Local Government Department within their powers to assist us and the various public bodies in our county.  I know that the Local Government Department would do better in many ways if they had the funds.  We realise their position and I am certain that we have a very serious question along the seaboard where the poor people are living in houses unfit for human habitation and I am confident that the Local Government Department will facilitate us in every possible way to come to the rescue of the fishermen and labourers there.  They are really in a very bad position. We in the country deeply sympathise with the poor people living in the slums in Dublin and Cork. But, as Deputy Anthony said, the slums are not confined to the two cities.  There are families all over the State living in even worse conditions. So far as the Government is concerned, and especially the Department of Local Government, I am <Col N="99" /> sure they will give us all the assistance possible in order to enable us to deal with this problem of the deserving poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote on which I could speak at very great length. There are many subjects which come under review on this Vote, but it is not my intention to deal generally with the matter.  I intend to-night to confine myself to one rather important item.  I would like to ask the Minister when it is intended to introduce a measure on the lines of the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission.  The particular recommendation of the Poor Law Commission to which I wish to refer to-night is with regard to the position of the very large number, I regret to say, of unmarried mothers who are in the various county homes of the Saorstát at the moment.  They are rearing families at the expense of the ratepayers.  I am sorry to say that oftentimes they are not very long out of the county homes until they return again under similar conditions. In the particular county for which I speak, I am aware that there are a good many chronic cases at present in the Westmeath County Home.  What I wish especially to allude to is that the innocent, or what I might possibly call the first offenders, are sent in there, and they come in contact with the chronic and professional element.  When they are in their company for a while there is very little hope for their future.  I do not know what the Local Government Department may be doing in connection with that matter, but I think there should be something done in the way of grading those first offenders, or, as I say, the more innocent ones, and giving them a chance for the future.  At the present time they are given no chance for the future.  They are herded there with the professional element and with the chronic cases, so that they get practically no chance of being able to reform, and drag themselves away and rectify whatever mistakes they may have made in the past.  I would ask the Minister to say, when he is replying, <Col N="100" /> if there is any hope of a central institution being set up where the first offenders could be kept together, graded and provided with employment. That employment might be laundry work or anything of that kind.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with this most important matter. We in this country are very proud of the good name of our people.  That is one of the things that I want to see fostered.</P>
      <P>I am sure any measure that will be brought forward to rectify this matter will have the unanimous support of the House.  I would like if the Minister, when replying, would tell us what is going to be done with regard to the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission in so far as they deal with the particular matter that I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a good deal of congratulations to the Minister and his Department.  I do not want to let the occasion pass without referring to some matters in connection with the constituency which I represent.  I want to bring some matters in connection with Mayo County Council before the notice of the Minister, and I would be glad if he would, when replying, deal with certain resolutions from the Mayo County Council with regard to the work proposed to be carried out by that county council on their own initiative and at their own expense.  Some months ago it was moved by that county council that they should raise a loan of £12,000 for the reconstruction of minor roads leading into their populous districts where unemployment is very rife at present.  Subsequently an effort was made by the county council to strike a rate of ninepence in the £ for an additional scheme, which also dealt with minor roads connected with the main roads in the area.  In both these cases the Department turned down the proposals, possibly owing to technical objection, that it did not come within the Local Government Act of <Col N="101" /> 1925.  The works could not be carried out, or at least, were not carried out.  The Minister, when replying to a question by Deputy O'Connell here on a subsequent occasion, stated that he did not consider that it was necessary to have any amendment or alteration made in the law with regard to those matters.  If the Minister has inspectors in the County Mayo, and I assume he has, that was an extraordinary statement to make in the House.  He should be aware that these roads, other than main roads, for the last ten years have had no repairs carried out on them.  It is nothing unusual to see on these roads leading from the bogs to the main roads people breaking carts and suffering injuries as a result of the terrible condition in which these roads are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had inspectors in the county he would be aware of that.  If his inspectors were in touch with the people and with the conditions existing in the county he would be aware of it.  In the same way one would think that his inspectors would have been able to report on the unemployment and almost starvation existing in these areas.  Dire necessity exists there to secure employment in order to alleviate the distress and to provide better roads for the people who live on the mountainside and on the bogs.  These people regularly pay their rates, and they expect to have proper facilities; and they should be enabled to get employment that will put many of their roads into good condition.  Now the main roads are steam-rolled and the trunk roads are steam-rolled.  But it must be remembered that these poor people who live on those bogs and mountain sides are ratepayers as well as the others.  If they do not use the main roads as much as other people, they are as well entitled as the wealthy people to have proper means of reaching their homes and conveying the produce of their farms to the market.  If the Minister thinks that there is any reason why that loan of £12,000 should not be granted&mdash;other than a technical reason&mdash;he might state it.  If there <Col N="102" /> is no other reason, it is a simple matter to have the section amended. That £12,000 would, with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government, be raised by the Mayo County Council on its credit. Spread over a period of five years, it would entail no hardship on anybody. It would put these roads into a fairly decent and passable condition, and it would alleviate the hardships inflicted on people who have such bad roads.  It would also relieve the unemployment that exists.  That could have been done if there were no technical objection in the way of striking that rate for ninepence in the £.  The Mayo County Council, as has been stated from time to time, were in a strong financial position, and were quite well able to bear whatever little burden this would impose.  I would like to know from the Minister when replying if he has any intention of getting over these technicalities so as to alleviate the conditions of people who live in such dire distress. As the Minister is aware, there was a protest against his action in refusing to sanction that loan to carry out special works.  If the Minister can state that he is satisfied that the conditions are such as I have stated&mdash;and I am sure he is conversant with the unemployment there, and that those bog roads are in a deplorable condition&mdash;then it would be only reasonable to expect that he would take steps to amend that section of the Act of 1925 which prevents county councils from dealing with such matters.  But if he is so satisfied, will he state that he proposes to take steps to have it amended and so enable the poor people of that county to get merely civilised conditions and be enabled to carry on their ordinary work without the risk of losing their lives and the lives of their animals and breaking their carts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this matter.  So far as we are concerned we find the Local Government Department and its general administration giving extreme satisfaction. With a little co-operation <Col N="103" /> from the county councils and the urban councils I think it must be regarded as one of the finest institutions we have.  It is dealing with such a large volume of business and with so many branches and doing the work so well that it would reflect credit on the largest commercial institution in the world if it were able to show that it discharged its duties in the same manner as the Department of Local Government does. With more co-operation from the county councils and the urban councils&mdash;and such co-operation is most desirable&mdash;we would have much more satisfaction than we have at present.  When appointments are to be made the county councils and urban councils rather resent these appointments being taken out of their hands.  They want to make them on their own initiative.  They feel that these matters should be left entirely in their own hands.  But one always notices that when matters become chronic so far as the county or urban councils are concerned, then they would like to pass their responsibility on to the Department of Local Government.  At other times they are anxious to have the appointments left in their own hands.  It is not altogether fair.</P>
      <P>In that way I do not think it is altogether fair for the councils to be nagging at the Department that is doing so well for them in regard to the roads.  I think the Department has done very well for the public highways.  I do not know if the contribution from the Road Fund has been allotted in proportion to the mileage of roads in the various counties, but it would appear that some counties have got a little better treatment than others. I understand that is due to the amount of the rates subscribed by the particular counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the housing question I heard a statement made that the Local Government Department did not deal fairly with the rural districts.  My experience is the reverse of that.  I found where housing schemes were carried out according to plans and <Col N="104" /> specifications that the rural areas were afforded every facility and got the grants directly the schemes were completed.  To make an insinuation like that was not fair either to the Local Government Department or to the Housing Department.  Where there was any question as to the retention of an old wall or gable of a house, I found that the Department went so far as to send down a special inspector and that they made a contribution pro rata to the expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is another matter concerning county councils, urban councils and mental hospitals to which I should like to refer.  In urban areas a demand is made for poor rate by the county councils which very often is in excess of the ability of the urban areas to pay.  I have a case in mind where the poor rate in the urban area last year was 4/6 in the £.  This year the county council made a demand on the urban area for a sum that would be equivalent to a rate of 9/-.  When that is added to the town rate itself, it places the urban council in a very awkward position and imposes an extreme financial hardship on the ratepayers of the town, because it might mean a rate of a pound in the pound.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the Road Fund discharges the obligation that was heretofore carried by the urban areas, and that that money is given to the county councils for the making of the main roads through the urban areas.  These roads were maintained for the most part out of the urban rate some time ago.  At present the money for their upkeep is largely contributed by the Road Fund.  Yet the county councils are making a demand for much more than the cost of maintaining the roads when they were maintained out of the urban rates.  I should like the Local Government Department to investigate the contribution that should be made, taking into consideration what the urban council originally expended and the amount of money contributed out of the Road Fund at present for these roads <Col N="105" /> Then there is the question of the mental hospitals, which the county councils have no jurisdiction over. The county councils have a right to appoint a certain number of members on the mental hospital committees. Three counties may be represented on such a body.  These committees for some reason have the right to demand from the county councils any sum of money that they think fit, and the county councils are not in a position to cut down the demand.  Irrespective of the capabilities of the county councils to pay, the mental hospital committees make the demand and, I understand, the county councils are compelled to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to make clear is that if in order to change that state of affairs it would be necessary for the Minister to introduce legislation, then the Deputy cannot argue that on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It is rather a hardship on county councils to be placed in the position that they have no control over the dispensing of the huge amounts that are demanded by mental hospitals.  In such cases they have to strike a rate which the ratepayers are not capable of paying.  The point I want to come to is, that something should be done to relieve the county councils of the responsibility of contributing that sum and that it should be put under some other heading.  I think it should be placed on the Central Fund, as we find it impossible to carry on in the various county councils under the present system.  On the whole, I am <Col N="106" /> satisfied that as matters stand the Local Government Department is giving very reasonable satisfaction but I hope that the Roads Department will go into the matter that I mentioned as between the urban councils and the county councils.  I find that urban councils in my particular district are incapable of carrying on any longer.  They are looking for de-urbanisation because the rates demanded by the county council have become exorbitant and they are not in a position to pay them.  It would mean striking a rate of a pound in the pound if, in addition to paying the town rate, water rate and the sanitary rate, they were to pay a county rate of 9/- in the £.  I should like to see some adjustment made in respect of the contribution of the county councils to the trunk roads, having regard to what was expended on the same roads when they were maintained by the urban districts previous to 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to find fault with the condition of the roads.  I think, on the whole, they are in an eminently satisfactory condition, but I am going to bring forward again my persistent grievance, namely, that we should have a Minister for Public Health, or at least a Parliamentary Secretary. In my earlier days in the Dáil I pressed for a Minister.  I have become more modest as time went on, and in latter years I have been asking only for a Parliamentary Secretary with a medical training.  That does not mean that I am finding any fault with the present Minister for Local Government, who does his very best, but there is no doubt the sanitary condition of the country is not satisfactory.  There is no doubt that in the small towns and villages in the country the conditions of sanitation are deplorable.  I do not think that any worse case could be brought against the sanitary conditions of the country than the fact that there are seventy cases of enteric fever in one urban area alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had already a good deal of discussion with regard to the <Col N="107" /> cause of smallpox and the method to be employed to wipe out that disease.  Never for one moment did I suggest that sanitation would do anything to eliminate and prevent smallpox, but I do say that enteric fever and diphtheria&mdash;two diseases prevalent in two very distinct areas&mdash;are diseases eminently brought about by bad sanitation and by bad water supply.  It is asked where are the medical inspectors? What is the use of sending a medical inspector to inspect cases where he could do no good, and where it is plain that it is necessary that these urban areas should have proper sanitary arrangements.  These urban areas are not able to pay the rates themselves, and their agricultural friends do not want to pay them, and that is where the great trouble arises.  If you put on a rate for sanitation in the urban areas, it is extended then to the rural areas, and quite naturally the farmers in the rural areas do not want to subscribe to what is a very necessary thing if the health of the entire community is to be maintained.  I do not want to say very much about it, except that it is disgraceful at this time of day that there should be an epidemic of enteric fever in any part of the country, a disease that is undoubtedly caused by bad sanitation.</P>
    <P>There are three or four other points that I would like to touch upon.  One is to ask what the conditions are up to the present with regard to the county medical officers of health.  One of the first things I did in this Dáil was to suggest that owing to the state of sanitation in the country, it was necessary that a county medical officer of health should be appointed for a county or group of counties.  How far has that been carried out? Because we can never get a satisfactory condition of sanitation in the country until we have county medical officers of health alone responsible for that class of work.  The second point I want to know about is: What progress has been made <Col N="108" /> with regard to medical inspection and treatment of school children? I have spoken on that subject both inside and outside the Dáil for a number of years.  It is a very necessary thing, if you want to have a first-class adult population, that we should look after the children.  I need not say anything more about that at the present time.  I want to say a word upon a subject which touches me very nearly, although it was said on the last occasion that I spoke upon it that I was only shedding crocodile tears.  That is the subject of the sanitary conditions of the schools of the country.  They are a perfect disgrace.  It would take almost a million pounds to make the schools of the country what they should be.  There is nothing more disgraceful than to compel children to attend schools in which there are no fires, where the sanitation is bad, and where they are compelled to breathe over and over again foul air for want of proper ventilation.  I made a suggestion before that it would be a good thing if these schools had been blown up instead of the county mansions, because then we would have got better schools built in their places.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister is doing his best with regard to these matters, but there is some more push required in order to get the local people and the managers to undertake the improvement of these schools.</P>
    <P>I was speaking at a meeting in Trinity College a short time ago and I made an appeal to the students that when they went down the country they should try and encourage philanthropic ladies to form committees and do something to improve the condition of the schools and also in regard to the provision of meals.  I am glad to see that so far as the Estimates are concerned the amount of grants for the treatment of school children has gone up to £3,000.  but with regard to the provision of meals the increase is not very great.  I want to make this clear so that no one may run away with the wrong impression.  I do <Col N="109" /> not think it is the Government's business to provide food for the entire school children.  I think that would be a very undesirable attitude for the Government to take up and I would not support it for a single moment.  But I think every encouragement should be given to local philanthropic bodies willing to do that work and to increase their funds by small grants so that the children would be enabled to get better food.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that there is not very much use sending medical inspectors to inspect enteric fever conditions.  On the face of the thing there is want of sanitation that cannot properly be affected in any way by any inspection or by small improvements. There must be a general reformation and there must be proper water supplies for those towns that are affected.  I think it was Deputy Ward who described some time ago the state of affairs last year in the town of Monaghan, which was such that they were enough to bring forth tears from a Fianna Fáil Deputy, not crocodile tears, of course, such as I was supposed to shed, but real tears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I want to raise on this Vote, and that is the question of the regulation of the motor bus traffic. I think it is the Minister for Local Government who has power to regulate the size and seating capacity and the speed, and make various other provisions for the safety of the passengers in motor buses.  I feel it would be a bad thing to let this opportunity go by without asking the Minister whether it is not possible to take more definite steps than are being taken at present for the protection of the passengers on motor buses.  I live on one of the principal motor bus routes in Dublin. I suppose there are fifteen or sixteen lines of buses, of all sorts and sizes, running on that route.  I should certainly say there is hardly any part of the world where such dangerous conditions are allowed to prevail as there are at the present moment on these bus routes.  I have <Col N="110" /> myself driven in motor buses where the driver, a rather pleasant young man, removed his two hands from the wheel when going about 30 or 35 miles an hour, in order to kiss them to a girl standing at the corner.  I have often been in a bus the seating capacity of which would be 14 or 15. In the centre there is a narrow passage about a foot wide, and not only were all the seats occupied by passengers, but that passage was also full of people.</P>
      <P>In addition to its small seating capacity, the bus was so low that an ordinary man could not stand upright in it.  That type of bus is quite frequent on that main road, and the type of driving which I mention is not infrequent. In addition there is the constant practice of buses racing one another on that road.  I speak of that road particularly because I know the conditions there.  I am certain that the same conditions exist in other parts of the city, and probably all over the country.  I do not want to raise any large question about the motor bus traffic.  In fact I do not know whether this is the time to raise it. I do not want to make any attacks on people who are carrying on this business, and I have no desire to interfere with the livelihood of bus-drivers and others connected with it, but the state of affairs at present is very dangerous so far as the public is concerned, and if it is allowed to go on as it is going on, some day we will have a terrible accident in which a large number of people will lose their lives or will be seriously injured.  We will then have a national scandal and regulations will be made, but we will have a great deal of talk about closing the door after the horse is stolen.</P>

That is so far as any technical speed limit is concerned, but in so far as further regulations require to be made regarding the Local Government Department new legislation must be awaited.

      <P>I think it is a matter for congratulation that a Government Deputy has expressed an <Col N="113" /> opinion on this problem, because he may encourage some of his colleagues to appeal to the Government with more effect, at least, than we have been able to do, to organise and control the 'bus traffic.  There is no interest that does not find fault with the present system by which buses are racing each other and snatching passengers from each other, to the terrible danger of the public.</P>

      <P>I will leave the subject at that.  The real reason I got on my feet was to ask the Minister to consider the position with regard to the inundations of the sea at Greystones and Wicklow.  I understand that his Department is at present dealing with the position of the families who suffered so badly in the recent storms at Greystones.  I am not asking the Minister for a statement at the moment on the subject, but I suggest that, if he wants to avoid a much bigger problem in Wicklow town, he ought to use his influence with the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;I think that that is the Department concerned&mdash;to try and get work going at Wicklow which will save thirty or forty thousand pounds worth of property at The Murragh. Unless the work is done this summer he will have to face a grave state of affairs in that town.  The season is advancing and there is not much time to lose.  As more will probably be heard of the subject later on, it may not be desirable to go into it now and in any case, it comes more appropriately under another Vote. With regard to the Estimate generally, it seems to me that the Ministry do not want to encourage anything in the way of criticism or suggestion from any part of the House, or else they would give a little more information when introducing the Estimate.  This Estimate deals with the State responsibility for dealing with an expenditure of ten millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister responsible skims over the subject in a speech lasting <Col N="114" /> about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he gives us no information as to various things that are worrying the ratepayers of the country, and that are the cause, in many cases, of considerable hardship.  On the big subject of the collection of rates, he had no remarks to offer as to whether any more economical system than the present system could be tried; as to whether the postal system was approved of by his Department, and whether he would encourage other localities to adopt that system.  On the question of arrears of rent on labourers' cottages and the sale of labourers' cottages which is agitating a great many county councils&mdash;we know it is a very big source of loss to practically every council in the country&mdash;he has nothing to say to the Dáil as to the attitude of his Department.  One would think that, concerning a big department like that, where there are the best engineers in the country, the best medical men in the country, the best officials in the country, there would be a great deal more to be said; that there would be at least some theorising for the advantage of the House on the occasion of a big Estimate like this. The Estimate itself being for about half a million of money would justify a much more elaborate statement, but when we remember that there is behind it an expenditure of ten millions, it seems incomprehensible that we should be given no idea of the views of the Department.</P>
    <P>It seems hopeless altogether to get any information as to the view of the Department on the administration of the Road Fund, or what its outlook is with regard to the future.  I do not think that the Minister can be satisfied that the best use has been made of the sum of six millions that has been spent through the medium of his Department on roads since the Free State was established.  Certain engineers throughout the country, those of them who express their minds, do not seem to be satisfied that the problem of road-making is on a very definite or secure basis.  Numbers <Col N="115" /> of them have written articles during the past twelve months to show that the finances of road improvement and road-maintenance have broken down.  Some of them have suggested, a very big loan with a view to embarking on a definite and much bigger scheme of road construction than has hitherto been attempted. Those of them, at least, who expressed their minds on the subject, seem to be quite dissatisfied with the position, and do not seem to have much hope that the roads which are being made can be maintained out of the money that seems likely to be available from the Road Fund in the future.  It is true that you have in the last report of the Local Government Department a statement like this: &ldquo;Publicists accustomed to describe the roads as the worst in Western Europe have acknowledged the vast progress made in recent years, and the splendid condition to which the roads have attained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to make a statement of that kind, but it is not satisfactory to those who are concerned as to whether these roads can be maintained, and whether the improvements which will be necessary in the future can be done out of money likely to be available from the Road Fund.  It is the opinion of several of the road engineers in the country that water macadam roads are the merest throwing away of money, that they last far too short to justify the expenditure, and that the maintenance of them, which amounts probably to £300 or £400 a year per mile, is not well spent money, that it would be very much better to go in for the better type of road and so to save a considerable amount in maintenance in the future. I think on that subject the time ought now to have arrived when the Minister, through his advisers, through the engineers who advise him, should be able to make a statement as to what are the conclusions of his Department.  Last year I quoted a statement of the Chief Roads Engineer to the effect that some surveyors are able to get work <Col N="116" /> done nearly 50 per cent. cheaper than others.  So far as I have heard these wide discrepancies still prevail and notwithstanding that there has been a very continuous and heavy fall in the price of road material it appears to be the opinion, of some surveyors at least, that the cost of building roads and of road improvement is not being reduced proportionately.</P>
    <P>There is the further question as to how far native materials can be substituted for imported materials. On that subject I think the Minister might well supply us with a little information.  His Department, I understand, has had under observation an experiment made at Shillelagh, in Co. Wicklow, where native slate powder was used instead of ordinary materials.  The local opinion now is that that road has stood the stress of traffic as well as any other road in the county, that it is much better suited to horse traffic than the ordinary main road, and that the use of that material should be encouraged. If it has the qualities that I submit it has, then there is a big case for it.  It is by no means fair to the farming community that so little attention is paid to their constant complaints that horses cannot travel on the motor roads.  It seems an extraordinary state of things that in a community where agriculture is the chief industry the main roads should be constructed entirely with a view to motor traffic and an absolute disregard of the feelings of those who are contributing very largely towards the upkeep of those roads.  I think there are a great many farmers in the House who can testify that in bringing cattle to fairs it is a common thing to have to take a round of five or six miles because of the dangerous condition, from the point of view of travelling, of the roads.  If, as I say, there is a native material that obviates that state of things, then the Department should at least be more enthusiastic about it than they seem to be at the moment.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that, with a view to meeting that problem, there should be a certain margin of <Col N="117" /> the road left which would not have as smooth a surface as the main portion of the road. That would not be always practicable, but I think that even in places where it is practicable it has not been followed up.  I think that before the Minister concludes he ought to give us at least some information as to the attitude of his Department on this big subject. Nearly a million a year has been spent on roads for some years past, and for that very big sum there ought to be much greater results than have been shown up to the present.  In particular, I hope the Minister will tell us what the general cost of maintaining the roads which have been made by grants from the Road Fund is, and what he thinks the aggregate cost will be for that service, and to what extent it will absorb the money likely to be available from the road fund in future.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that has agitated some surveyors I know. That is, where the local councils refuse to provide money for maintenance, the roads they have made at very big expense are likely to suffer very severely.  Apparently the Department's attitude is that they will only give money for maintenance where the local council itself provides a certain sum for maintenance. That may be all right with a view to discipline amongst local bodies, but I think you could easily create this position, that a community, having given a big grant for the improvement of a road, might see all that money wasted because of the failure to provide money from any source for its maintenance.  I have been told directly, at least by one surveyor, that he was faced with the prospect of seeing all the expense of constructing a considerable mileage of road practically wasted because, he said, without proper maintenance it would quickly go to pieces.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some information on that point before he concludes.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of the Local Government and Public Health Vote which I should <Col N="118" /> like to ask the Minister to deal with in his reply.  It is a matter of general interest to the whole country, but it is particularly interesting to the constituency which I represent, County Dublin.  It is that of the suggested legislation arising out of the Commission which sat within the last couple of years in connection with the Poor Law, especially that of the treatment of what are known as boarded-out children.  It is a very serious problem in the County Dublin, and I should like the Minister in his reply, if he is in a position to know it, to state what is the policy of the Ministry in regard to it.  I observe from the vote that there is a sub-head dealing with child welfare, schools for mothers, and so forth.  I need not go now publicly into the details of the scandals in this matter in the County Dublin.  The Minister is sufficiently aware of them, and I should like him in his reply to let the House know if he has any proposals this year to deal with that very serious aspect of what is a very grave Local Government and Public Health matter.</P>

The grievance is that the legislation is so interpreted as to make it very difficult for members to maintain their average of attendances, and if the Minister will say to-day that his Department will not so rigidly enforce these regulations, it will make matters easier for the members' attendance. I suppose I cannot deal with the attendance of members at Joint Committees who get no expenses?</P>

      <P>I think it would be wrong to allow a discussion to proceed here that would suggest to members of public bodies down the country that the law was other than it is.  The interpretation put upon the Act is the interpretation that is in the Act.  If there is any doubt about that, it is unfair to members of public bodies to suggest otherwise when there are alternatives. The first is to suggest new legislation, and the second is to get a different interpretation, if possible in the courts.  These are the only alternatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that legislation will be introduced on the lines of the Report of the Poor Law Commission. I trust in that legislation that some effort will be made to co-ordinate the medical services.  At present dispensary medical services and medical services under National Health Insurance rather overlap.  It would be advisable if the whole matter were taken into account in the coming legislation.  I spoke some time ago here with reference to the number of workhouses in the country.  Many of these houses are becoming absolutely ruined.  Perhaps the matter could be dealt with in this way.  At present in the county homes throughout the country you have the aged poor, and you have the imbeciles, and you have unmarried mothers and children, and some effort should be made to segregate these different classes.  It is most undesirable that unmarried mothers and other classes should be in the one institution.  It is impossible to give them adequate care, and if an effort were made to utilise some of the empty public buildings now derelict over the country perhaps these classes could be more adequately dealt with.  The inspectors of the Department do not always consider the interests of the ratepayers and make suggestions in respect of these matters.  An inspector, speaking to myself in connection with the opening of a district hospital, suggested that the proper way to meet it would be to build a <Col N="120" /> new hospital.  His suggestion was that a new hospital should be built just outside an old building which was a huge place in good order at the time.  A few hundred yards away there was another building. It looked absurd to suggest that a new building should be erected and that these two should be allowed to go derelict.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the county medical officers of health, however desirable they may be, there is no doubt that the ratepayers of the county are objecting very strongly to these appointments.  Suggestions have been made that the services undertaken by these officials can be carried out by the existing medical officers of health.  I know there are objections to that, but it might be possible to meet them.  People are becoming convinced that the growth of officialdom is getting beyond them and that before long you will have more officials than the people in the country can pay for.  Whatever we may think of the desirability of medical officers of health, undoubtedly the people resent very strongly their appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore dealt rather well with the roads question.  We seem to imagine that the only people we have to cater for in this matter of roads are the motorists.  In any county of Ireland the vast majority of the people are not motorists.  A very considerable section of the ratepayers are people living in districts served by second or third-class roads.  The county councils are so hard driven that they are gradually dropping these roads out of their estimates.  The result is that people living in mountain areas are deprived, in some cases, of egress or ingress, and when they come down on the tarred county roads their horses and cattle break their legs. These are the vast majority of the people for whom we are supposed to cater.  It is all very well to build magnificent roads for English motorists who go through our country and admire our scenery, but we must realise that we have a duty to our own people.  I have seen cattle lying <Col N="121" /> on these roads with their legs broken, and I have seen horses with their tackling broken.  The people, apparently, have no redress.  I know instances where people when going to fairs have gone several miles out of their way to keep to the by-roads, realising the danger of bringing young cattle on tarred roads, and that if they did bring them on these roads they were likely to lose one or two of them.  The tendency for years past has been to neglect the second and third-class roads, and to concentrate on the main highways.  We should see to it that our people who live in mountain areas are not neglected.  The argument has been put up that these people are only small ratepayers, and that we would not get enough value for the roads, but they are our own people.  I am a motorist myself, and I appreciate a good road, but it is not fair that those people who live in mountain areas should be served by roads that are not merely indifferent but absolutely bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I referred to a report issued in County Clare regarding the sanitation in many of the schools in that county.  The same problem has been referred to to-day by Deputy Sir James Craig. I should like to support this appeal to the Minister to give more consideration to that matter.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important now that the Compulsory Attendance Act is in force and the schools are more crowded than they were.  It is useless to provide an excellent programme and first-class teachers for children who are cold and hungry and who are standing all day in badly ventilated schools in a foul atmosphere.  They cannot learn.  It is imperative that the sanitation of these schools should be improved. Every day we see reports of houses condemned for being insanitary or for one reason or another.  I should like to see lists of schools condemned and even closed, because children would be better off at home than attending many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might inform us how <Col N="122" /> many counties or boroughs have medical inspection or dental inspection of school children.  My colleague, Deputy Goulding, stated that the appointment of such medical inspectors is not popular with the ratepayers, that it involves expense. It does, but it more than repays the expense.  It repays it in fitting the children to take advantage of the instruction afforded them.  It is well repaid in improved health, and also in the fact that statistics reveal in other countries that in the early years of school a large percentage of children, particularly in urban areas, suffer from diseases which are easily curable but which present a difficult problem when they get more advanced.  In that way much suffering is saved them, and eventually much money is saved to the nation.</P>
    <P>The matter of sanitation comes, of course, under the Local Government Vote.  There were other matters referred to&mdash;heating and so on &mdash;but they do not come under this particular Department.</P>
    <P>Regarding the road problem, it has struck me that our whole policy in that matter may require reconsideration.  I do not know that this State can afford these great trunk roads and the money spent on them.  I do not know, if we could afford it, that it is the best way in which to spend the huge sums now devoted to that purpose. It may be better, perhaps, to spend less on these roads, considering that we are an agricultural country, as we are so often told in the Dáil and elsewhere, and to give better facilities to the farmer, and if possible even to give some of that money to the local councils for the improvement of the smaller roads which are mainly used by the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which concern the County and City of Waterford.  I suppose what one says about these matters applies in a great many cases all over the country.  One matter was already referred to by Deputy Goulding, and that was the matter of the empty unions owing to the changes under the amalgamation that took place. There are a lot of buildings in <Col N="123" /> Waterford City that are absolutely derelict, and the whole matter should be looked into.  You have these buildings, and at the same time a County Home is being put up at Dungarvan, about twenty miles away.  It is a great cruelty to old people who have to go to the County Home from Waterford.  It really means that they are parting from their own people for ever, because their relations have not the money to visit them.  The change really works a very severe hardship on the old people who are sent to the County Home.  When you have empty buildings there you could easily provide for old people within a radius, say, of so many miles of the City of Waterford, instead of their having to go off for the remainder of their lives to Dungarvan, because that is what it really amounts to.  It is a matter which the Local Government Department should consider very carefully.  By a little re-organisation they could do two things at the same time.  They could do a humane action towards those people, and at the same time they could save these buildings, which are of considerable value.  If it was only to keep them in repair, it would be worth while putting somebody into them.</P>
      <P>Another matter which has been referred to, almost adequately, is the matter of the roads.  The whole question of the roads is an extraordinary one.  If you make the roads good you will have, as a certain person who is largely interested in the cattle trade said, to get roller skates for the cows to go along these roads. You make the roads so good that they become a nuisance to the country, and, after a time, owing to the heavy traffic, they get into a condition when they become an increased expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to suggest a solution. I do not pretend to be an expert on the subject.  My own experience is that two or three years ago the roads were in a very admirable condition. They had been engineered by men who knew their road work extremely well, but the roads are now getting <Col N="124" /> into a bad condition.  I want to say that a great deal of money will have to be spent on these roads in order to bring them back into good condition. I do not know whether it is within the powers of the Local Government Department to make regulations which would economise the wear and tear on the roads.  For instance, regulations could be made so that nothing greater than a five-ton lorry would be allowed to travel on the roads.  The result of that would be to throw a considerable amount of traffic on to the railways and so save a considerable amount of extravagance in the wear and tear of the roads.</P>
    <P>Another thing which affects Waterford, just as it affects the rest of the country, is the lack of houses for the working people.  In Waterford 800 houses are needed.  There are people in Waterford at present paying 10/- to 12/6 for a single room.  The people for whom these 800 houses would be required should not be asked to pay more than 5/6 a week for them.  They could not afford to pay any more.  That would be the very highest that could be expected from them.  There is considerable unemployment in Waterford. While you have unemployment on the one hand, you have, on the other hand, the question of slums and the lack of houses.  There is no use in saying that if the Corporation of Waterford could raise a rate so as to co-operate with the Government in the building of houses a solution would be found.  The rates in Waterford are extremely high already. They are high for several reasons, and it would be impossible for them to increase the rates.  The same thing holds good for the county rates, because if you take the rates and the land annuities to-day as they fall upon the farmers, they amount to more than the old rents that fell upon the farmers in the days when rackrents were paid.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  Again, it is not a matter which I am quite sure is within the powers of the Department of Local Government and <Col N="125" /> Public Health.  The capitation grants for patients in mental hospitals were fixed at a time when the purchasing power of money was much higher than at present.  Owing to the fact that a change in the value of money has taken place, the present arrangement works very hard on the local bodies.  I do not know whether or not that is a matter that can be dealt with by the Local Government Department under its present powers, or whether new legislation is required on the matter.  There is one question I would like the Minister to answer. In England and in Northern Ireland measures are being taken to prevent the erection of petrol pumps along the public roads practically within ten yards of each other.  I would like to know whether the Minister intends to restrict the number of public pumps here before they become an impediment to traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard to expect the Minister or anyone in his Department to know what the country's needs are in respect of roads.  From some Deputies we have complaints that sufficient money is not given to construct the roads properly. Other Deputies have complained that the roads are too well attended to and too well made, and the farmers are complaining that too much money is being spent on them. I say that in some parts of the country sufficient money has not been given for the reconstruction or maintenance of roads.  I have no hesitation in saying that it is not the Minister's Department that is responsible for that state of things, because the tendency is, in the case of some counties, to take advantage of the maintenance grants given by the Government in order to apply them in relief of the rates.  That policy might be all right in five or ten years' time, when the roads have been brought to the standard required in order to deal with traffic. To my mind county councils should not be allowed to take advantage of the grants given by the central Government in order to apply them to the relief of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Deputy Connolly raised the question of the manner in which roads within urban areas have so far been dealt with by the county councils. I believe that the Minister will see the wisdom of bringing in legislation to go back to the position that prevailed prior to the passing of the Local Government Act of 1925.  I say that because the dual responsibility that prevails at the moment between the urban councils and the county councils to see that the main roads inside the urban areas are properly maintained is a matter that will leave these particular urban roads in a bad state.  I want to deal with the Wexford county.  This year the estimate for main roads was reduced by 30 per cent., and a portion of what was left was transferred from main roads to third and fourth class roads.  That left a comparatively small amount of money to deal with the main roads all over the county. Now a 30 per cent. reduction all over the county or rural areas would not be felt to any great extent, but in the urban areas it would be felt to a very appreciable extent.  When I tell you that the amount of money allocated last year for the maintenance of main roads in the borough area in Wexford was £875 and that this year, in consequence of the reduction, the amount is only £525, I think you will agree that that is a very serious matter so far as the urban roads are concerned.  The farming element, who are in the majority in the county council, cannot be expected to understand the problem of road-making inside an urban area.  They are not going to pay the attention that is necessary to the making of roads inside an urban area.  The Local Government Act of 1925, as well as making the county council responsible for the maintenance of roads, makes them responsible also for the maintenance of the channel courses and the footpaths. The farmers have not to deal with channel courses and footpaths and things of that kind, and they have not the same interest in these <Col N="127" /> matters that an urban representative would have.</P>
    <P>The urban centres are prepared to pay a higher rate in order to have their roads maintained, but they are subject to the vote of the rural population. I am not complaining about the way in which the farmer representatives vote.  They have a perfect right to vote in accordance with the views they hold as representing the people in the rural areas.  But, taking all the circumstances into consideration, I believe that the Minister will have to go back to the position that prevailed prior to the Local Government Act of 1925.  In the town of Enniscorthy the same state of affairs prevails, to a lesser extent than prevails in Wexford itself. Because of the fact that Enniscorthy Urban Council recognises that the amount of money available for their roads would not permit of the roads being properly constructed or maintained, they were prepared to borrow the money in the bank. They had received an assurance from the bank and the bank was prepared to advance the money.  They asked the county council if they were prepared to allow them to use the maintenance grant for three or four more years to pay interest and sinking fund.  The county council were prepared to do that, but the Local Government Department refused to permit it.  They say, and say rightly, that that is not the function of the urban council and the Act of 1925 prevents their doing it.  That just shows what I said in the beginning, that the urban authorities would be better off if they were allowed to maintain the roads within their own area.  It shows that they are prepared to expend more money than the county councils are prepared to give them.</P>
    <P>Everybody will admit that roads in an urban area require a greater efficiency in the matter of their maintenance than do roads in a rural area.  Pedestrian traffic is greater in urban than in rural areas.  In consequence of that I believe the proper <Col N="128" /> thing to do would be to revert to the old system.  There may be some roads in an urban area which may be completely handed over to the county council, but there are parallel linking roads which should, in my opinion, be handed back to the urban areas themselves.</P>
    <P>There is another thing in connection with the roads and the maintenance grant to which I would like to refer.  At the present moment the policy of the Local Government Department is to pay 50 per cent. of the amount of the maintenance required on the main roads, and 30 per cent. on the link roads.  The Minister will not, I think, suggest that the main roads have all been reconstructed yet.  There are certainly some main and link roads that have not yet been brought into any sort of shape.  The Wexford County Council have applied to the Ministry for permission to borrow some money in order to reconstruct certain portions of the road down near New Ross, and they have asked if permission be given for them to borrow the money, that they should be permitted to use the maintenance grant in order to pay off the sinking fund and the interest.  The Department of Local Government have refused to do that.  I know very well that the Department cannot guarantee that there is going to be a maintenance grant for any number of years, but if there were a maintenance grant, they should be permitted to use that.  In my opinion, it would be more economical to permit of that being done rather than that this amount of money should be put into a bad road year after year.  You would have the roads constructed properly.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in that matter. When a council is prepared to borrow money it shows that they are interested in the matter of road construction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of county medical officers, I am not at all satisfied that the Department of Local Government are doing all that they should in this matter.  As far as I know the Act passed here in <Col N="129" /> 1925 makes it mandatory on the county councils to appoint these medical officers of health.  Here we have been going on for the past three years and only a small number of councils in the State have appointed medical officers.  On numerous occasions I have advocated that an officer should be appointed in Wexford, and I have been beaten on the point.  There are twenty-seven county councillors in Wexford. Thirteen are in favour of the appointment and fourteen are against it.  I think in a case like that the Minister should use what powers he has got under the Act to see that the medical officer is appointed.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of cohesion amongst the medical officers of the county in consequence of the fact that they have nobody to guide them as to the standard of sanitation in the county.  In various parts of the country there are places that are absolutely insanitary.  Everybody knows the effect that has on the health of the people.  In a great many cases in the schools, the position is so bad that in my opinion the children should not be attending them at all.  There is then this question of the medical examination of the children at the schools, a very important matter, which has been referred to by Deputy Fahy.  I urge the Minister to insist upon exercising the powers conferred upon him under the Act of 1925 and to see that the county councils do appoint medical officers of health at once.  It is not fair to the other county councils who have appointed these officers. Every county should be treated in the same way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little referred to the question of the mental hospitals throughout the country.  He referred to the matter of the capitation grant.  These grants were fixed years ago when the value of money was much more than it is now.  I suggest that the Minister should ask the Department of Finance to reconsider the position with respect to this particular matter.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health is a Department which one does not want to criticise.  I <Col N="130" /> must say that it is a Department which, to my mind, is functioning in the interests of the country, and its officials are always very courteous and always very approachable.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this Estimate has ranged over quite a number of the activities of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in a most unsatisfactory manner.  We have not succeeded in getting the mind of the House on any particular question.  Every question has been dealt with by different speakers in a different manner. I think the fact that the discussion has been carried on in this way is largely due to the manner in which the Minister proposed the Estimate.  In proposing the Estimate, we think that it should have been the duty of the Minister to have told us what the policy of his Department is in respect to the various activities with which it is dealing.  I think he should have told us the policy that they have been following heretofore, the goal they have been aiming at, how far they have succeeded in attaining that goal, and the progress they hope to make this year.  Instead of that, he indicated to us the states of decomposition which the reports of various Commissions and Committees have reached in the pigeon-holes of his Department.  He told us that the report of the Commission dealing with the National Health Insurance was looking healthy and was expected to be moving around again soon.  He told us about the state of the report of the Poor Law Commission. Apparently that was not so healthy, but all hope had not yet been abandoned.  There have been a great number of other reports, including the Greater Dublin Commission Report, which have been placed in the limbo of lost causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies anxious to find out the policy of the Local Government and Public Health Department would not find it in the reports of the debates which have occurred here. The policy of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, as far as I am able to discover, never has been discussed in <Col N="131" /> this House.  If we want to find that policy we have to look for it in some pamphlet issued during an election by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or we may find it in speeches delivered by Ministers at public meetings throughout the country.  That policy was never brought forward here.  It was never gone into here in a manner which would enable us to see its main outline or permit us to subject it to our criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Has the Deputy ever looked into the annual report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly we can find in the annual report of the Department a very thorough and informative account of the different activities upon which the Department has been engaged.  I suggest that that is not enough.  We should know what the Government are doing and hope to do, particularly what they hope to do with respect to the various matters with which the Department deals.  It deals with housing, roads, local government and public health administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the question of housing, which has been discussed at some length to-day and during portion of the session preceding the Easter Recess.  So far as we have been able to discover the policy of the Department and of the Executive Council, it appears to be based upon the belief that, if they periodically reduce the grants which they give for housing, in some mysterious manner, in consequence of these reductions in the grants, the cost of housing will also go down.  But we have not been told whether the Government are satisfied that that policy is working out.  Can they directly trace any reduction in building costs to the various reductions which have taken place in housing grants?  Do they think that if they continue at the present rate, and ultimately reach the point at which the grants will have disappeared altogether, housing costs will then be back to what we might <Col N="132" /> consider normal?  I do not think so. Do they seriously believe that if they follow the policy they are pursuing they will be able adequately to deal with the housing situation in this country?  Can they see any possibility within the period of the life of this Dáil or the next Dáil, that the abominable conditions which exist in Dublin will be ended?  Do they see any possibility, following their policy, of providing decent housing accommodation for the large number of families who are now living in tenements declared to be unfit for human habitation?  If they do not see such an end to their policy, are they going to change their policy? Have they anything else in mind to substitute for it?  We think it is more important that we should be told the attitude of the Executive Council on matters of that kind than that we should be informed about various minor activities of the Department, as the Minister did to-day, in connection with most of which we would be able to get all the information we require, either by question in the House or reading the Departmental report, to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to roads. This question has been mentioned in this debate more often than any other.  The Minister mentioned, I think, that one and a half millions will be expended this year on road construction and maintenance.  Does the Minister think that that is enough, or that it is too much?  We want to know where we are going in this matter.  Do the Government think that the amount provided this year for the maintenance of roads already constructed is sufficient to keep these roads in good repair, or that a larger sum should be provided? Do they think that it will be possible to prevent any wastage, such as has been suggested by Deputy Moore, without any increase in expenditure? Or is it their view that expenditure is too high, and is merely being maintained at the present level because of the great volume of unemployment and the necessity of making some provision for it?  We have not got the mind of the Ministry <Col N="133" /> on these matters and we want to know it.  We want to know their mind in respect to a number of other matters to which I do not wish to refer.  These are the principal activities of the Department to which the Minister has only made very casual reference.  He gave certain statistics relating to them.  The same thing applies to Local Government and Public Health administration in general.  We are discussing now a motion to refer this Estimate back for reconsideration. It is because we are utterly dissatisfied with the policy of the Minister, so far as we have been able to detect what that policy is, that we are going to support the motion.  We think the Dáil should express dissatisfaction not merely with the policy, but with the refusal to give information concerning it, by referring back this Vote.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons which I think should influence the Dáil to take that decision is the attitude of the Ministry towards the matter of the municipal government of Dublin.  We have had this matter discussed here also during the present year, but that fact should not prevent us again expressing dissatisfaction with the dilatory manner in which the Ministry have dealt with the whole problem. The citizens of Dublin are getting really perturbed about the situation which exists in respect to its government.  We have seen the figures published in the Press dealing with the expenditure incurred by the Commissioners appointed by the Government.  We have seen that since these Commissioners were appointed the total amount paid in salaries to Corporation officials has been increased by 12.3 per cent., or £20,987. We have seen that the amount paid in pensions to ex-officials has been increased by 7.4 per cent.  But we have seen also that the wages paid to manual workers have been cut by 25.6 per cent.  When we examine the figures in detail, we find that not merely has that bias in favour of the highly-paid officials, as against the lower-paid manual workers, operated in respect of those employed by the Commissioners, but that any economy which has been effected has been very <Col N="134" /> largely at the expense of the relief provided for the destitute poor.  I notice that even the Dublin &ldquo;Evening Herald&rdquo; on Friday or Saturday last published a two-column article in its first page dealing with the fact, in which the views of prominent workers in charitable organisations were expressed to the effect that there was unnecessary parsimony in the administration of relief, and that there was serious destitution amongst a large number of families in Dublin in consequence.  The big increase in the municipal debt and various other matters relating to municipal government of a serious nature are such that a very large and rapidly-growing section of the citizens are looking forward anxiously to the day when the control of local affairs will again be placed in the hands of their own elected representatives.</P>
    <P>We have agreed that a situation did exist in 1924 in respect of many matters concerning the Dublin Corporation which could be quoted to justify the appointment of Commissioners, but, as I have pointed out on some previous occasion, many of the evils or grievances which could be pointed to to justify the appointment of Commissioners had been dealt with and remedied as long ago as April 1st, 1927.  According to the Commissioners themselves, in the reports submitted to the Minister, as published in the report of the Department, we find that they themselves declared on 1st April, 1927, that they had already dealt with the various evils which had grown up in the administration of the Corporation, to deal with which they had been appointed.  Nevertheless, they are still there, two years later, doing the work which should be done by an elected and representative council, and doing that work in a manner which is not altogether in accordance with the wishes of a great body of the ratepayers.  The Government, as I said, have permitted that position to arise.  They could at any time since the publication of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission in 1926 have introduced legislation to regularise the position, but they have not done so.  They have let the <Col N="135" /> whole thing go by default, and as an expression of disapproval, in consequence of that default, I think the House should support the motion to refer the Estimate back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items about which I want to remind the Minister before this debate comes to a conclusion.  The first thing that would strike anybody here from the heart of the country during the discussion of this Estimate would be that there is no such place on the map now as Galway and Mayo, or some of those backward counties. We have heard a lot of talk about the housing problem and the houses that should be built in Dublin, and so on.  I should like if the Minister would take into consideration a town like Ballinasloe.  Quite recently from Ballinasloe town a circular was sent to many Deputies in this House pointing out that there were over 100 houses condemned there by the medical officer of health, for want of proper sanitary arrangements and other causes.  So far as I remember, for years back there has not been one new house built in Ballinasloe.  I am sure that houses are wanted in other small towns like Ballinasloe just as much as in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are other cases out in the country districts.  I have here a case of a family that had been practically wiped out by tuberculosis. The local medical officer has condemned the house these people are living in.  I hold in my hand a letter from the Administrator of Tuam, Canon Walsh, recommending a grant to be given for the building of a house for these people.  I think these are the most important points in the housing problem.  If we here stand for these things we are nothing short of what I would call a pack of murderers.</P>

      <P>He did not get it, anyway.  Whether he was refused or not I do not know.  The Department have mysterious terms that they can use.  A man gets a reply that the matter is having the consideration of the Minister, or something like that.  That is not a refusal, but it is not getting the grant, all the same.  He is told it is having consideration, but it is having consideration too long.</P>

      <P>Yes, I will do that. I think when cases of that kind are put forward they are the first cases which should be attended to.  These are more important than anything else.  If there is tuberculosis in a country house it should be attended to immediately, because people are actually dying fast there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of roads.  If you travelled all Ireland you would not find worse roads than in Galway.  There is one trunk road between the north and east of Galway&mdash;the trunk road leading from Ballinasloe to Galway.  In Galway they have been fighting for ages for a road from Ballinasloe to Mountbellew, where there is heavy traffic. The Minister and his Department use the iron hand, and it would be well to use it in this case.  I have known cases where men were idle on the roads six weeks before Christmas at a time when they should be working, and at the present time they are spreading stones only to have the cars come along to scatter them over the ditches.  These are things which <Col N="138" /> should be attended to, and I hope they will receive consideration.</P>

      <P>My objection to this motion in the first instance is that, first of all, by selecting five members of this House on a Joint Committee it is impossible to give proper representation to the various Parties. For that reason, in my opinion, the number of five, which has been the number followed in regard to previous Joint Committees, should be enlarged in some way.  Nine may be considered too many.  Seven Deputies, at any rate, should be appointed in order to give full representation to all Parties.</P>

Deputy O'Hanlon would be out of order in moving an amendment which purports to appoint on a Joint Committee nine members of the Dáil as against five members of the Seanad.  The position in regard to the motion is that it can be put in a particular form so as to make it in order.  If Deputy O'Hanlon wants to alter the number &ldquo;five&rdquo; to give a better representation to the different groups in the Dáil, that is quite in order, but if he wants to alter the number &ldquo;five&rdquo; so as to have a different number of Deputies and Senators, that is not in <Col N="140" /> order, as the essence of a Joint Committee is equal numbers.</P>

But it has been assumed, and I think it is correct, that a Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad should consist of equal numbers.  I think if the Deputy wants to discuss that particular procedure, he should put down a motion in general terms that Joint Committees set up should have more members of the Dáil than of the Seanad.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the Land Act of 1923 in so far as it relates to the fixing of the Appointed Day for land to which Section 24 of that Act applies.  Section 70 of the Land Act provides that the Appointed Day shall be fixed so as to suit the convenience of the Land Commission, and that different Appointed Days may be fixed for different estates and different groups of holdings.  Prior to the Appointed Day the tenant will pay to the Land Commission a sum which is equal to 75 per cent. of his old rent.  That sum, subject to certain deductions in respect to income tax and cost of collection, is paid over by the Land Commission to the landlord according to Section 20.  After the Appointed Day has been fixed the tenant pays a certain sum which is called the standard purchase annuity, subject to such additions as may be made by virtue of the addition of the unpaid compounded arrears of rent. The fixing of the standard purchase annuity is laid down in Section 25 of the Act and in the First Schedule. According to Section 25 and the First Schedule of the Act the standard purchase annuity in the case of judicial tenants is fixed at 70 per cent. of the old rent in the case of tenants whose rents were fixed subsequent to the 15th of August, 1911, and in the case of tenants whose rents were fixed before the 16th of August, 1911, they pay an annuity which represents 65 per cent. of the old rent.  That is to say, according to these provisions which determine the standard purchase annuity the judicial tenants are in some cases granted a reduction of 5 per cent., and in some cases a reduction of 10 per cent., as against the payment in lieu of rent which they had been paying to the Land Commission prior to the Appointed Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of non-judicial tenancies the amount of the standard purchase annuity is to be fixed in each individual case by the Land Commission in the absence of an agreement between the landlord and the tenant.  The reduction, I believe, in <Col N="148" /> the case of the non-judicial tenants ought to be very much greater than in the case of the judicial tenants. It ought to be considerably in excess, as the House will appreciate, of what the judicial tenants get and the payment which the non-judicial tenants will have to pay when their annuity is being fixed, ought to be considerably lower than the interest in lieu of rent which the judicial tenants are now paying.  It seems clear, therefore, that in respect of the different types of tenant farmers in the Free State who are interested in this matter, reductions of five per cent. in some cases, of 10 per cent. in others, and in the large proportion of cases, reductions of perhaps up to 30 or 35 per cent. will be made when the Appointed Day is fixed.  For that reason I submit to the House that if this fixing of the Appointed Day can be done, it ought to be done as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I should imagine perhaps that subsequent to the Appointed Day the position of the landlord will be that he will be paid in land bonds an amount which will be equal to the purchase annuity of the tenant capitalised at 4¾ per cent., plus a contribution of 10 per cent. from the State.</P>
    <P>The object and intention of the promoters of this Bill is to fix the Appointed Day immediately or in the near future.  They believe that can be done, and that immediately the Appointed Day is fixed the Land Commission may proceed with these investigations into title and disputes, and make its calculations. Afterwards, when it finds that it is in a position to name the Appointed Day as the Appointed Day was contemplated originally under the Land Act of 1923, it can do so, but our intention is that the vesting, when it does take place, should be made to be a vesting retrospective as from the earliest date that will be fixed in this Bill.  The position which will arise in the interval after the fixing of the Appointed Day if it is fixed, by the passage of this Bill in the near future or immediately, and the final <Col N="149" /> vesting as contemplated by the Land Act of 1923, will be, I think, very simple in the case of judicial tenants. Under the Land Act they are entitled to reductions which would bring their standard purchase annuity to 65 per cent. or 70 per cent. of their rent.  In their case it seems to me it is simply a matter of calculation, and that the amount of the standard purchase annuity in the case of judicial tenants can be fixed at once.  In the case of non-judicial tenants the position is not so easy. Nevertheless, I think it is a position which can be remedied.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why if the House really desires it, and if the Dáil desires it, as I believe they do, that they will not now carry such legislation into operation as will fix the appointed day for the non-judicial tenants as well as the judicial tenants.  The way I suggest the standard purchase annuity could be fixed in the case of non-judicial tenants is by fixing arbitrarily an approximate annuity.  That approximate annuity can be found by fixing a judicial rent in the case of these non-judicial tenants and basing that judicial rent upon the average rent of the area in which the holding is situated.  When the judicial rent is fixed the reduction of 30 per cent. should be made and a margin of error should be allowed upon that in the tenants' favour.  Subsequently, when the holding is vested and when accounts have to be squared between the non-judicial tenants and the State, I submit to the House that it is a perfectly feasible proposition that whichever amount may have been granted to the non-judicial tenant upon the fixing of his purchase annuity, whatever excess reduction may have been granted to him can be added to the purchase price of the holding, and that you have a precedent for that in the manner in which, under the 1927 Land Act, you added the unpaid compounded arrears of rent to the tenants.  That can be done, and it merely means that certain financial adjustments will be necessary by the Land Commission.  I am not going to go into that question now, <Col N="150" /> but I know that it is within the capacity of the Land Commission to make these adjustments.  The only thing that is necessary is that the adjustment, of course, will have to be approximate, in the first instance, upon the fixing of the appointed day.  Afterwards final adjustments can be made and the accounts reconciled. Untenanted land can be dealt with, I suggest, in the same manner as I have suggested should be adopted in the case of non-judicial tenancies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the landlord, the landlord gets his purchase price.  According to the cost fund which is provided by Section 5 of the 1923 Act, he has his costs for carrying through his sale.  I cannot see, therefore, that there is any financial reason whatever, so far as the landlord's interests are concerned, why the tenants should not be granted the full reductions to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>To pass on to another aspect of the question, which is an unsatisfactory feature of the present system of fixing the appointed day, that is that while some tenants have the appointed day fixed in their cases comparatively early and without any great delay, in other cases there is a delay of very many years and the tenant has to wait all that time. I suggest it is most unfair that while one tenant should receive priority in getting these reductions the other tenant should have to wait for a number of years and be deprived of them.  I say that is not equitable. It is not satisfactory, and it is not sound.  It cannot be defended, I think, upon any grounds.  I believe, and the House will agree with me, that it is a gross injustice, from which thousands of Irish tenant-farmers have suffered during a number of years.  The Dáil has now the opportunity to remedy that injustice, and I hope they will take advantage of it.  If I may sum up in respect to our claims for the two classes of tenants, judicial and non-judicial, it is simply this.  On behalf of judicial tenants we say: &ldquo;Give us the reduction to which we are entitled. It is simply a matter of calculation. <Col N="151" /> Proceed afterwards at your leisure, disentangling and investigating questions of title and so on.  So far as we are concerned, you have the full facts of our case at your disposal, and there is no reason why we should not get these rights.&rdquo; With regard to the non-judicial tenant we take up the attitude that they also should get a reduction, but that reduction of course will have to be approximate and subject to readjustment by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I submit that these adjustments can be made and that the final adjustments can be made later.  There are not, as far as I have been able to gather in the course of my inquiries, any valid legal objections to treating this matter in the way I have suggested. Transactions between the State and the tenant are similar to transactions between vendor and purchaser.  It is quite a common practice in connection with a sale between vendor and purchaser that a joint account should be opened; that the purchaser should get full beneficial enjoyment and full possession of the land or property; that in the meantime the question of title should be proceeded with, possibly over a period of years, and that at the end of the period, when the transaction is finally closed from the legal point of view and all questions of title have been settled, then the vendor is paid the purchase money and the accumulated interest.  We are simply asking, in the case of the Irish tenant farmer, for the same procedure and the same rights as the purchaser gets in the case I have mentioned.  I am sure the Dáil will grant that.  I may be told that this matter of fixing the appointed day immediately, or in the very near future, will necessitate the re-casting of the finances of the 1923 Act.  I do not agree with that.  There will, I believe, be certain adjustments necessary, but with the experience the Land Commission has had up to the present I believe no great difficulty will present itself.  What I have suggested here could, I think, be adopted, and that is that in the fixing <Col N="152" /> of the annuity for the non-judicial tenant the average rent in the area should be taken as a basis. Working upon that basis, I think the Land Commission will have no difficulty in settling the matter.</P>
    <P>I think the sum total of all these adjustments in which so many thousands of tenants are involved, will in the long run be not so very considerable.  Although the total amount involved may be great, I think the ultimate balance of accounts will not mean more than a comparatively small sum one way or the other.  As a matter of fact, only a few months ago, referring to the recent amending Bill passed in the British Parliament to defer the appointed day in respect of certain tenants in Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister said that the tenants there who had not been vested will be recouped for whatever amount they are paying as rent in excess of what they will ultimately pay as their purchase annuity.  That is an instance of where the retrospective principle has been adopted and is being carried out.  The Dáil and the Government itself accepted that principle and embodied it when, under Section 2 of the 1927 Act, they decided that the compounded arrears of rent&mdash;unpaid arrears&mdash; should be added to the purchase price.  I submit the principle and the procedure are the same.  If the members of the Dáil are anxious&mdash; and I believe they are&mdash;that this question should be settled and that the tenant should get fair play&mdash;and that is really all we are asking for&mdash; then they will pass this Bill into law, making whatever consequential amendments that may be necessary in Committee.  They will make whatever adjustments may be necessary and they will place upon the Land Commission an onus which I believe they can carry out&mdash;that is, making necessary adjustments after the appointed day has been fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one question? The question is mainly to clear up a point.  The Deputy mentioned that the appointed day shall be fixed on a certain date.  Is it the <Col N="153" /> intention that on that date the fee simple of the land shall be vested in the tenant I could not gather that from the Deputy and I was not clear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it in another way.  I understand that under Section 28 of the Land Act the Land Commission have the power to resume certain lands.  If the Government are willing to accept the principle of the Bill&mdash;that the appointed day shall be fixed very shortly&mdash; then we would be willing to grant whatever rights the Land Commission had prior to this in connection with the acquisition or resumption of holdings.  We would be quite willing to grant those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the point.  The Bill as it stands sets out that the appointed day shall be fixed not later than 1st December, 1929. As the Land Act stands, on the appointed day the fee simple of the lands is vested in the tenant purchaser and a folio is opened in the Registry of Title for the tenant purchaser. Does the Deputy contemplate that that procedure shall continue to take place&mdash;that on the appointed day, on 1st December, 1929, the fee simple of the lands shall vest in the tenant and a folio shall be opened registering that fact in the Registry of Titles?  I only want that for my own information.</P>

      <P>There are a great many points that I do not understand in connection with the Land Commission.  I do not know whether the Land Commission will have to change its procedure or not. The purpose of the Bill is simple. It fixes the appointed day and gives the tenant the benefits I have mentioned. If the Land Commission find it necessary to change procedure.  I think they ought to do so.</P>

      <P>Procedure, of course, can be changed.  I was wondering whether they were supposed to change the procedure to meet the point I have mentioned.  I wanted to know whether that was the suggestion underlying the Bill.  This is a Bill amending certain Land Acts <Col N="154" /> and it must be read in conjunction with certain Land Acts.  It suggests specific alterations of the Land Acts. It merely changes the provisions of the 1923 and 1927 Land Acts in so far as the appointed day is concerned. It does not alter the point made clear in the Land Acts, and that is that on the appointed day the fee simple must vest in the tenants and a folio must be opened.  If this Bill is passed, that procedure must take place and I want to know if that is the intention of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>When I asked a question a few moments ago, I was not asking it for the purpose of blocking the Bill.  I find I am in considerable difficulty in discussing the Bill unless I have that information. As the Deputy is unable to give it to me, I can only take it that the Bill means exactly what on its face it appears to mean.  In order to make the position clear, perhaps I might outline shortly the procedure under previous Land Acts.  I will take the 1903 Act as typical.  Under the 1903 Act there were three vital dates: (1) the date of the passing of the Act&mdash;an important date; (2) the date when the agreement or undertaking to purchase was signed by the tenant; (3) the date when the lands are vested in the tenant. Under all previous Land Acts, including the Land Act of 1923, when the lands are vested in the tenant they are registered.  The fee-simple of the lands is vested in the tenant and the lands are registered in the name of the tenant in the Local Registration of Title Office under the Local Registration of Title Act. That was a very important Act, particularly important from the point of view of the ordinary farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old days, before that Act was passed, the laws connected with real property were extremely complex. If a man was assigning any real property, no matter what the area, very long searches and very elaborate procedure had to be gone <Col N="155" /> through.  The vendor or the person assigning it had to get the title, and this entailed very elaborate procedure. Searches had to be made in the Registry of Deeds, and all sorts of titles had to be cleared up by evidence collected here, there and everywhere.  It was a very slow and expensive procedure.  All those questions arose not only when land was being assigned by one person to another as a result of a sale, but also when the owner of land died and when his land went to a third party under an intestacy or a will.  In addition to that, all these questions had to be investigated when any dispute about rights-of-way, easements, and so on, occurred in connection with the land.  While law was generally expensive, it was admitted that the law's delays and the expense in connection with the law were more acute when they were connected with dealings with real property than if they were connected with any other aspect of law.</P>
    <P>To meet that situation the Local Registration of Title Act was passed. The aim of the Act was to simplify dealings with land.  The Act provided that all property held in fee simple should be registered in the Registry of Titles, that a folio should be opened, that that folio should set out the name of the owner, the area of the land, the head rent in connection with the land, easements in connection with the land and, finally, there should be attached a map showing the exact boundaries of the land. The same Act provided that in case of any transfer of the land by deed, under a will, or by intestacy, or should there be any dispute in connection with the land, that that particular certificate was evidence for everything that appeared on its face, and it should be accepted as such by anybody concerned, judge or anybody else.  That saved every owner of land and property immense time and trouble and, comparatively speaking, immense expense.  It was one of the most beneficial Acts ever passed from the point of view of the owner of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> I take it that it is not contemplated the Local Registration of Title Act is to be, by implication, repealed by this Bill.  I take it that it is not contemplated that the procedure which solicitors, landowners, tenants, owners in fee&mdash;everybody concerned &mdash;admit is a great convenience and a great advance on the old procedure should be repealed by this Bill.  I take it that the procedure we have at present under which the title of every tenant is registered in the Registry of Titles should still be maintained.  If that is so, the position is that under the 1903 Act, on the day or during the week in which the fee simple of the holding is vested in the tenant, a folio is opened in the Registry of Titles for that particular holding.  That folio sets out the name of the owner or tenant purchaser, the exact area, any charges on the land, any rights in connection with turbary or grazing, and it contained a note which I will refer to now, but which I will deal with later on&mdash;a note to the effect that the holding was registered subject to equities. That folio would be absolute evidence of the title of the owner to that land, and would be evidence of every other statement specifically made on its face.</P>
    <P>When we were passing the 1923 Act we felt that the procedure of the 1903 Act could be somewhat improved. The procedure under the 1903 Act contemplated three important dates&mdash;the date of the passing of the Act, the date of the signing of the agreement or undertaking to purchase, and the date when the fee simple of the land was vested in the tenant.  With that latter date coincided the opening of the folio. Under the 1923 Act you have only two dates&mdash;the date of the passing of the Act and the date on which the tenant signs his agreement to purchase.  On the date on which the lands are vested in the Land Commission the lands are also vested in the tenant.  In other words, instead of having two periods, a period between the passing of the Act and the agreement&mdash;a period between the signing of the agreement and the vesting, which was the procedure <Col N="157" /> under the 1903 Act&mdash;you have now only one period, the period between the passing of the Act and the vesting of the land in the tenant. I said when we were passing the 1923 Land Act that we cut out the pretty long period which used to elapse between the signing of the agreement and the vesting.  We have done that.</P>
    <P>Under the 1903 Act, taking average cases, and you can only deal with average cases, it took three, four or five years before the landlord was persuaded to sell.  After the landlord was persuaded you then had to fix the price with him.  It was not a compulsory Act.  You had, first of all, a considerable delay between the passing of the Act and the signing of the agreement to purchase by the tenant&mdash;a delay of four, five, six and, in some cases, ten or twelve years, while in other cases it would be only a year.  The average would be five or six years. During that time the tenant was paying full rent, rent to the full 100 per cent., and there was no reduction of 70 per cent. or 65 per cent. Then you had the agreement to purchase, and in five or six years more, again speaking in averages, you had the lands vested.  On the day on which the Land Act of 1923 was passed, the tenant got an immediate reduction of 25 per cent. and that reduction lasted to the date of vesting.  That period is considerably shorter than the total period which elapsed between the passing of the 1903 Act and the vesting, in an average case.  During that period there was a reduction of 25 per cent. under the 1923 Act.  What is the suggestion of the Deputy?  It is that the appointed day shall be fixed on a date not later than 1st December, 1929.</P>
    <P>I must assume that the Deputy does not mean to abolish the Local Registration of Title Act.  I must assume that on that date the fee simple, the landlord's interest in the land, is to be vested in the tenant; that the tenant is to become the owner in fee simple, and a folio is to be opened for him in the Local Registration <Col N="158" /> of Title Office.  On that assumption, and I can see no other, what is to happen?  Between this and the 1st day of December, 1929, certain particulars must be accurately ascertained.  They must not be ascertained approximately, but put beyond all doubt.  There must be no possibility of any mistake, because, remember what it means: they are to be accepted by any judge as absolutely right without any further evidence. The folio must set out certain particulars, and these particulars will be accepted without any further evidence in any dispute or any assignment or any dealings of any kind in connection with land.  It may be said by people who are not used to dealing with land, &ldquo;What difference does it make if there are slight mistakes?&rdquo;  Any solicitor knows how people in the country feel about rights-of-way and how bitterly title cases are fought.  Any solicitor, or anybody who is used to dealing with land, knows that in a very big number, though I admit in a minority, of cases there are assignments, sub-tenancies, easements, rights of turbary, rights to grazing, all established on behalf of third parties after the date on which the fair rent was fixed on the land.  On all these matters that folio must be absolutely accurate, otherwise either the owner of the land or some third party who has rights must suffer very grave injustice.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to deal with this matter because I am not clear as to what the Deputy means, and I believe the Deputy is not clear himself. I do not believe that he thought out this question.  He said &ldquo;Let this thing be adjusted afterwards; vest, open your folio, register so-and-so, say the area is so much approximately, say that the occupier is such-and-such a person, set out a map showing that the boundaries are so-and-so, that the area is so much, that the rights of turbary are in favour of A. B. and C., or there may be no rights; if there are any mistakes put them right afterwards.&rdquo; Of course that means scrapping the whole procedure under the Local Registration of <Col N="159" /> Title Act.  It means going back again to the old procedure under which every right in connection with land, such as the rights to fee-simple or to easement, must be proved by the evidence of engineers and lawyers and the oldest man in the district.  Undoubtedly if you do anything of the sort you will have a very large number of cases coming up before a judge where he will have accepted this approximate certificate and where it may be proved afterwards that the certificate is wrong.  You cannot have it both ways.  It must be either of two things.  You must go back to the old procedure under which all rights, either the right to the fee-simple, the right to any easement, a right of way, or anything else in connection with land, were proved by specific evidence of engineers, old deeds, as a result of searches in the Registry of Deeds, or proved by the memory of the oldest man in the district, and so on.  You must go back to that position with all its insecurity, or you must, when you are opening the folio, make it absolutely certain that every statement on that folio is correct.  The Deputy may say that there are certain rights to land which are not set out on the face of the folio, that there are certain rights which are covered by what is known as the notice of equities. I will not say what those rights are, as they are innumerable.  Perhaps the most satisfactory way to explain the position will be to say what rights are not as a rule covered by that notice of equities.  When the folio is opened these must be put beyond all doubt.  It must be put beyond doubt that the holding is in fact a judicial one.  The landlord's return is not always complete as to that.  The landlord may return so-and-so as the judicial tenant. When you get the fair rent order you may find that while a judicial rent was fixed in 1892 a portion of the holding was assigned to somebody else by agreement with the landlord, that a certain amount of the rent was apportioned on the assigned portion and that the holding <Col N="160" /> is no longer judicial.  You must find out who the actual occupier is.  The actual boundaries must be found out &mdash;they cannot be taken from the map.  There is no map in any case except where the fair rent is fixed by the Land Commission.  A fair rent in the old days could be fixed by the Land Commission or by the County Court.</P>
    <P>Even where the fair rent was fixed by the Land Commission, in numerous cases the map is found to be wrong.  So it is necessary to check the actual boundaries, and in all cases to check the actual area, and it is absolutely necessary in practically all cases to check the rights as to turbary and as to grazing; not only the rights of the owner of the particular holding as to turbary and grazing elsewhere, but the right of any person in the district as to turbary and grazing on the particular holding.  You cannot open a folio otherwise; if you do the folio is no use.  When you speak of vesting, I presume you mean opening a folio which on its face shall be evidence of the title of a particular person to a definite holding with a certain area, certain boundary, certain rights to turbary, certain rights to grazing.  If you contemplate that, then all these inquiries must be made before vesting with the greatest possible care. They must be made so carefully that there will be no prospect that they are wrong, and that the judge who has accepted, and must accept them by law, has not done a grave injustice to somebody else who has rights there.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Deputy saying, &ldquo;I do not mean that; I mean something else.&rdquo;  But then what does he mean?  When he speaks of naming the appointed day and vesting a holding in the tenant, does he mean setting out somewhere that A.B. is the owner in fee-simple of a certain holding with a certain area, with a certain annuity, and with certain rights&mdash;in case there may be such rights&mdash;to turbary or grazing on a neighbouring holding, and that C.D., E.F., and G.H. have rights on the holding either to turbary or grazing? <Col N="161" /> If he does not mean that, what does he mean?  I do not know.  If he does not mean that, then the Bill has no meaning to me.  If he does mean that, then let us face the question. Let us see whether all that can be done in respect of all the holdings in the country before the 1st of December, 1929.  Possibly it could if you trebled or quadrupled the number of people in the Land Commission. If you told them to give up the purchase and dividing of untenanted land, and if the whole energies of the Land Commission, quadrupled or multiplied by five, or whatever number it may be, were concentrated on the work, then possibly it could be done.  I could not say.  The only point I make is that simply to state in a Bill that all this work shall be done in respect of an unnamed number of holdings within an arbitrary time leads you nowhere. The Deputy has not proved to us that 90,000 holdings can be vested by any reasonable staff of lawyers and inspectors within that time.  I believe that if it were examined, and if the exact number of people who could reasonably do this within the time were stated, and the cost was stated, and also the implication that the Land Commission should concentrate upon it and do nothing else, Deputies would not agree to this Bill at all, even if the Deputy did propose it.</P>
    <P>I agree there is plenty of room for difference of opinion as to whether the procedure in vesting land has been too slow or not.  There is plenty of room for criticism if you like.  I was responsible for it myself, and it may be open to criticism that there ought to be more attention paid to vesting land and less to acquiring and dividing it.  I think there is a great deal to be said for the matter of giving a rest to the policy of acquiring untenanted land, and that there should be concentration upon the vesting of tenanted land.  That is quite reasonable, and can be discussed. But when the Deputy, without being clear as to what he wants, without apparently being clear as to the implication of his Bill, simply introduces <Col N="162" /> the Bill&mdash;he may be clear, but he will not admit it&mdash;fixing an arbitrary date at which a certain amount of work which he has not apparently contemplated and without any advertence to the difficulty of doing the work or as to what follows from the procedure&mdash;when he introduces such a Bill and names an arbitrary date, I cannot understand him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is common form enough.  I often went to buy a bullock, and I said to the owner, &ldquo;What do you want for it?&rdquo; and he said to me, &ldquo;What will you offer?&rdquo;  but that is not the way to do business.  If you are to get business done, you must take a document of this sort introduced here as meaning what it purports to mean.  I am willing to admit that it is debatable as to whether there should not be more time concentrated upon vesting and less time upon the division of the land.  I thought vesting would be completed quicker.  I suggested five years when the Act was being passed.  And may I say at that time the statistics were not as accurate as to the number of tenancies in the country.  It has been found that there is about 40 or 50 per cent. more tenancies&mdash;the figures are there&mdash;than we had contemplated, that is because of the wide way in which we interpreted the term &ldquo;agricultural land.&rdquo;  I mentioned the term of five years.  It could have been done in five years.  None of us contemplated there would be such demand for the acquisition and division of untenanted land.  The Land Commission, during 1924, 1925 and 1926, were driven to devote all their energy to acquiring untenanted land and dividing it up. If the Order Papers during the last one, two, three, four or five years are examined, it will be found that for every one question in connection with the vesting of tenanted land <Col N="163" /> there have been fifty in connection with the purchase and division of untenanted land.  The Land Commission reacted as it should to what seemed to be the policy of the Dáil at that time&mdash;to buy and divide up land, and not to mind vesting so much.</P>
      <P>I have always thought, even when I was in charge of the Land Commission, that more time should be given to the vesting of land than to the acquiring and division of land, but, nevertheless, we were driven to spend more and more of our time acquiring untenanted land and dividing it and less of our time in vesting land.  My view is perhaps there should be more time given to the vesting of land now that most of the big estates are divided and less time to the acquisition and division of untenanted land.</P>
      <P>I think I know what the Deputy means.  This Bill is a very respectable looking Bill.  It contains a lot of legal jargon which makes it look all right.  But it is a much simpler thing that the Deputy wants.  I do not believe that Deputies on the opposite benches, no matter what they would say or how they vote, seriously contemplate that the land should be vested in an indiscriminate way without taking any care whatever to see that boundaries, areas, rents, easements, and all the rest, are accurate and that afterwards it should be left to the barristers and solicitors to make a big fortune out of setting the whole thing right. The lawyers would do really well out of it.  I would try to get as much myself as possible and we would come well out of it.  There would be a vast field for litigation. That is not contemplated.  It would be a wanton thing to repeal the Local Registration of Title Act and vest land in that indiscriminate way and, as Deputy Derrig says, repair the mistakes afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of this Bill is this: Do not fix the appointed day.  He is not concerned as to when the appointed day is fixed.  He is concerned with this: that instead of giving a reduction of 25 per <Col N="164" /> cent., we are to give a reduction of, say, 32½ per cent. at once.  If the Deputy introduced a Bill to that effect we could understand it.  He has not introduced such a Bill.  He has introduced quite a respectable Bill with a considerable amount of legal jargon, and it contemplates an appointed day within a certain time and presumably the consequences that would follow.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, is absolutely unworkable and impossible.  In spite of the fact that this is a sovereign assembly there are some things it cannot do, and one of them is the impossible.  It would be quite impossible to work this Bill; it cannot be done.  What the Deputy is really after is that instead of a reduction of 25 per cent we should give a reduction of 35 or 40 per cent.  The Deputy is entirely illogical.  I believe 25 per cent. is a fair reduction. Not only do I believe it, but I am sure of it.  I think fair play is good policy.  I thought 25 per cent. was a fair reduction at the time on rents fixed in 1886 or some other date.  I am quite satisfied that as compared with the outgoings that the farmer had to pay, rents fixed in 1886 and 1902 and 1906 and reduced by 25 per cent. represent a fair reduction.  The Deputy is not satisfied; he is entitled to his opinion, but I think he should be at least logical.  The Deputy should go a step further and introduce a Bill providing that the landlord should get no rent and should get no bonds. Is not that the position?  It seems to me there is no half-way house between a reduction of 25 per cent. and simply saying &ldquo;We will take the land from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too subtle for me.  I do not exactly know what to infer from that.  The Bill really means that the landlords should suffer, not a reduction of 25 per cent. but some unnamed figure, and I am suggesting, for the sake of argument, that it is a sum approximately <Col N="165" /> between 35 and 40 per cent. That is what the Bill means if it is read intelligibly.  I suggest it is illogical.  The Deputy has not given any good reason why a 25 per cent. reduction is wrong and 35 per cent. is right.  He has not shown that the landlords are getting too much by taking rents reduced by 25 per cent. and that it would be just right if they were reduced by 35 per cent. I am suggesting to Deputies opposite, as I am constantly doing, to be logical.  Let them go the whole hog and introduce a Bill to say that the landlords should be expropriated and that nothing should be paid to them.  That is what it comes to.  That is all I have to say, except that I would like an answer to the question: what do Deputies mean by this Bill? Do they mean that a folio shall be opened, that the fee-simple shall be vested in the tenant, or do they mean simply that a reduction shall be made immediately or should have been made on the date of the passing of the Act, not of 25 per cent., but of 30 to 40 per cent. instead? Let Deputies say what they mean. I say that if you could look at the thing in the abstract, apart altogether from popular demand, it seems that there is a real need for spending more time and devoting more attention on the vesting of tenanted land than on the acquisition of untenanted land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has given us a disquisition on law, and he is much perturbed as to what exactly we mean.  He represents, as I do, an agricultural constituency, and I think that he was not quite fair in stating that we wanted a reduction of thirty-two and a half per cent. straight off.  He is aware, as I am, that there are estates side by side in our county on which some people have got the land vested while their neighbours have not. He will admit that on vesting there is a reduction of five or ten per cent., that some tenants feel the injustice when their neighbours have got that reduction, and that what we mean is to try to get for as many tenants as possible, not only a reduction of <Col N="166" /> five or ten per cent., but that they begin from the appointed day to purchase their land.  Further, there are a lot of people who are paying interest in lieu of rent for five or ten years and who still only begin to pay for the land when it is vested. These are two points with which the Minister omitted to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the legal aspect of it, and the Minister stated that the Bill would inevitably provide a lot of work for the legal fraternity. That, however, is not our intention. Deputy Derrig suggested that the land might be vested provisionally. According to the Minister's statement one would imagine that there is in every case a dispute about the ownership, about who is to be the tenant, about the area, the easements, turbary, grazing and other rights, but it is only in exceptional cases that that occurs.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible, without doing violence to the Local Registration of Title Act, to endorse the folio, to make it, not he perfect legal instrument that the present folio is, but to endorse it to the effect that it is given under a certain Act? It would not be such an excellent instrument in law as the folio is now, but would it not be possible to have that endorsement, which could be removed on the appointed day or when the land is vested?  Such notice or endorsement would limit the tenant's right to transfer.  We would agree to that.  He need not be in a position to transfer with the same facility as if he had a folio under the Local Registration of Title Act.  In most cases there will not be difficulty as to the area or as to who is to be the tenant.  The Minister knows that very well.  In nine cases out of ten the area is fixed, and, in any case, the Land <Col N="167" /> Commission can ascertain it.  If such endorsement were on the folio it need not run counter to the Local Registration of Title Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This would only mean a provisional title.  I do not think that lawsuits will arise when there is a notice to the effect that it does not give them as perfect title as the folio would&mdash;I do not know if the Minister would call it fee-simple. That endorsement on the folio might prevent much litigation instead of encouraging or entailing it.  At any rate the Minister talks of uncertainty but there is great uncertainty at present and a great feeling of injustice, as any Deputy who represents an agricultural constituency knows.  Many of us on these benches, and on the benches opposite, who do not call ourselves farmers' representatives know that representations have been made weekly by these tenants.  Some of them have for fifteen years been paying interest in lieu of rent.  There is no finality and we think that this would bring finality much sooner.  I do not think that it would mean increasing the staff of the Land Commission four or five times, not even doubling it. They have great experience already and there would not be all the difficulty which the Minister thinks there would.  I have great appreciation of the ability of the present staff to do this work.  We believe <Col N="168" /> that it could be done without increasing the staff at all.  The Minister speaks of the three steps to be taken under the Act of 1903 and the two steps under the Act of 1923.  I do not know whether it matters much whether there are two steps or three steps or whether it is a matter of one step.  We hear much talk of the number of years.  It is six years since the Act of 1923 was passed and we do not know how many more years it is going to take.  The Minister then thought five years.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>At Question time to-day, I asked the Minister for Justice to give us certain information concerning the activities on which the Detective Division of the Civic Guards has recently been engaged in Dublin City and County, and the Minister refused to give that information. There is at present in operation in Dublin a terroristic campaign directed against certain individuals and conducted by members of the police force.  The Executive Council and the proprietors of the daily newspapers of the country are in conspiracy to prevent any information concerning that campaign reaching the ears of the general public.  I think it is well, however, that members of the Dáil who have a primary and direct responsibility in this matter should understand what is happening.  During the last three or four weeks a certain number of individuals in the City of Dublin have been made the victims of a carefully-planned and deliberately-carried-out scheme of terrorism. They have been arrested repeatedly, imprisoned for short periods in the Bridewell and released again.  I understand that the law of the land is that a person cannot be detained for a period longer than twenty-four hours without being charged before a magistrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid the necessity of compliance with that law, these individuals are released after twenty-three hours, and in some cases after <Col N="169" /> twenty-three hours and fifty-nine minutes, re-arrested outside the Bridewell and imprisoned for another period of the same duration. Some of them have been arrested as frequently as fifteen times within the last few weeks.  Every time they have appeared outside the doors of their own homes they have been taken into custody by members of the Civic Guard and lodged in the Bridewell.  Houses have been forcibly entered, in many cases without the justification of a warrant. Doors have been broken, forcible entry has been made, and the occupants of the house threatened and abused.  What the purpose of the campaign is it is not hard to decide. We get an indication of it from the fact that it is frequently reported to us that when these individuals are arrested by members of the Civic Guard, the attitude of the Civic Guard towards them is expressed in the words used: &ldquo;We are going to make you fight.&rdquo;  A number of the individuals have been assaulted.</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil adjourned on 22nd March a slight change in tactics has been decided upon.  Instead of the men being released in the day time they are now released at two and three o'clock in the morning.  In many cases they are taken in motors out to the country and severely beaten and then released.  I think it is not extraordinary that the Minister for Justice was so anxious to refuse any information in this matter to the Dáil.  It is not extraordinary that the cloak of silence has been flung over these activities by the daily Press, considering that the daily Press is constant in its support of the Government.  That is what is happening.  It is well known to be happening to a number of citizens of Dublin.  It is not so well known outside Dublin.  The campaign has been in progress since the start of the by-election in Dublin City, North.  We want to know why.  I can tell you straight away the answer to that question which the Minister for Justive will give.  He will tell us that it is a campaign for the suppression of crime and the suppression of <Col N="170" /> criminals.  I want to tell him that that is not so.  The facts prove that it is not so.  Men in custody on Saturday evening are released&mdash;the detectives do not like to work on Sunday&mdash;and are re-arrested on Monday. The men who were in custody during Holy Week were released on Holy Thursday for Easter, and were re-arrested on the following Tuesday. Does that look as if these men were criminals, dangerous criminals who should not be lost sight of, whom it was necessary to terrorise?  Does that look as if the Minister or the Civic Guard really believe that these men, whom they have made the victims of their activities, are what they represent them to be?</P>
    <P>We have no sympathy with crime. A very large number of the men arrested&mdash;those with whom I have been able to get in touch&mdash;have no sympathy with crime.  They are men as honourable and as honest as any individual in this Dáil, and I know that.  I suggest that this activity is embarked upon in order to provoke disorder in this country, which the party managers of Cumann na nGaedheal believe will be to their advantage and their interest.  I deliberately accuse the Government of utilising the machinery which a majority of the Dáil has placed in their hands to provoke shooting and bloodshed, to provoke disorder in this country for their own ends, because they believe by doing so they will be able to stampede a section of the people into giving them that support which they will not now accord them. I make that accusation deliberately. The Minister will deny it.  The members of the detective division who are carrying out the Minister's orders do not deny it.  They have repeatedly said that these men will be subject to this persecution until they fight. What do they mean by fight?  Until they hit back, until some of them, driven desperate by the persecution, will take the law into their own hands and hit back at their accusers. A number of these men have lost their employment.  It was only to be expected that an employer, employing men who, he cannot be certain, will turn in to their work every <Col N="171" /> morning, will find it necessary to dispense with the services of such men.  I have one case in mind, the case of a married man with six children who was employed by Messrs. Guinness.  He was employed by Messrs. Guinness for many years.  He was arrested five times in one week, lost his employment, and now he is starving.  That does not matter to the Minister or the party managers of Cumann na nGaedheal so long as these activities bring about the state of things which they think they are calculated to provoke.  I think it is well that Deputies should know what is happening, and well that they should have an opportunity of saying whether it should be permitted to happen or not.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion on this matter in the debate on the Central Fund Bill.  In the course of the discussion I asked was it not a recognised principle of government in this State that men are considered innocent until proved guilty, that any man charged with a crime should be brought into court and faced with his accuser.  The Minister for Justice described these statements as clichés of nineteenth century Liberalism.  Apparently these principles, which are recognised as the foundation of government in most civilized countries, are something to be sneered at and derided in this Dáil.  You have in your Constitution certain principles enunciated: &ldquo;The dwelling of each citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered except in accordance with law.&rdquo;&ldquo;The liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.&rdquo; Are these more clichés to be ignored or are they to apply to adherents of one Party in the State only?  Is justice to become the prerogative of the supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal?  Is it for that the Minister for Justice or those who act for him, because I do not believe he was consulted in the matter, have marked out certain individuals to be broken by this persecution?  Are <Col N="172" /> they to be deprived of the rights of citizenship, of all the rights you guarantee them by your Constitution and the rights which in any civilised countries would not be denied them?</P>
    <P>We have heard from members of Cumann na nGaedheal in this Dáil and from others outside it frequent expressions of their adherence to the principles of democratic government and the will of the people.  We have had the President in the recent election campaign, prior to the opening of this terroristic campaign, talking about the necessity of preserving the right of trial by jury in this State and of the great things they were going to do to preserve that right. Does trial by jury apply only to one section of the people?  If these men are guilty of any crime, if there is the slightest shred of evidence to connect them with any crime why are they not brought into court and that suspicion substantiated there? If there is against these men the slightest justification for the action taken, it is, I think, the duty of the Civic Guard and the duty of the Minister for Justice to have these men charged before a magistrate. That is not being done and the fact that it is not being done is proof that they have no evidence, that they are unable to associate these individuals with anything that has happened in this country.  I hope members of the Dáil will take some opportunity, an opportunity which they may have on some other occasion, to express disapproval of these occurrences by their votes.  They cannot do it now but I think they ought seriously to consider the facts now.  I think also that the people of the country, through this Dáil, ought to know what is happening, that here at any rate we should make an effort to break down the barrier that is erected between the activities of the Civic Guard and the people by the daily Press.  We have a definite statement from the Minister for Justice that no order was issued to the Press not to publish reports of these raids.  We have it stated by the Minister that it was <Col N="173" /> not even intimated to the proprietors of newspapers that the Government considered it undesirable that they should publish reports of raids.  The daily Press of Dublin is deliberately of its own free will keeping this information from the people.  I hope that fact will be remembered by certain Deputies in this Dáil.  It certainly will be remembered by those on this side.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any considerable portion of the time allowed for the discussion.  I merely want to suggest that it seems to me, from the situation, that the campaign which is being conducted against these individuals is an illegal one.  It seems to me that those who ordered that campaign, who are associated with it and carry it out, are committing illegalities.  The question whether they are or are not committing illegalities may not be questioned in the courts while this Government is in office, but I can assure Deputies here and those associated with the campaign outside the House that if there is any foundation for the belief that this campaign is illegal, and that these constant arrests and imprisonments are being carried out in violation of the Constitution, on some day they will have to take their trial for that action before a jury.  There is, I think, no Statute of Limitations applying in matters of this kind. Deputies may be inclined to think that I am exaggerating.  I am not. It is inevitable, if this campaign is continued, that there will be reaction. I think it is inevitable that the individuals subject to persecution of this kind will do one of two things: either they will clear from the country or take retaliatory action, and it is on that fact that the Ministry are banking.  It is to produce one or other of these two results, preferably the latter.  I assert that they have decided on that line of action deliberately, because they hope by it to produce a feeling in the country that it is necessary to maintain them in office as the people who dealt with disorder before and may be trusted to <Col N="174" /> deal with it again; but if such disorder takes place in this State I want the Deputies to understand that they are now being informed that it will take place as a direct consequence of the provocation which the Government are giving.</P>

      <P>This has been, in a way, rather an interesting discussion, and this very highly rhetorical speech which Deputy Lemass has just poured out has been rather interesting. As usual, of course, Deputy Lemass is endeavouring, after his fashion, to run with the hare and to hunt with the hounds, to take the part of crime and to denounce crime, to show all his sympathies with those men who are endeavouring by criminal methods to upset this State and to make life impossible for respectable citizens in this State.  All his sympathy goes with them, and then he flings in an odd expression here and there, &ldquo;I have no sympathy with crime.&rdquo;  What was the whole tenor of his speech?  What was his whole question to-day? What were the objects of his question? Were they to get information? Not at all.  He tells us he is absolutely full of information.  He knows all about everything.  He does not want information.  What does he want?  He wants to bring all the influence that he himself possesses, all the influence that he can arouse in his Party, to hinder the Guards in their efforts to keep down crime and what I trust will be their successful efforts to keep down crime.  What has happened?  There was as dastardly and as cowardly a murder as could be committed, the murder of young Mr. Armstrong. There was an attempt to murder a man&mdash;Mr. White&mdash;who had done nothing else except his duty as a citizen in a clear case of finding a prisoner guilty.  I heard no denunciation of these crimes from Deputy Lemass.</P>
