      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Post Office Authorities were agreeable to the release from service on May 19th, 1928, of Mr. James Roche, postman, Kilbrittain, Co.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Consideration of Mr. Roche's application, in common with others of a similar kind, must await the setting up of the Statutory Tribunal to which I made reference in my statement to the House on the 20th February last.</P>

      <P>No sum was paid into the Exchequer during the financial year ended 31st March, 1929, in respect of the 50,000 shares of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland held by me, owing to the fact that the company altered the date for closing its accounts from 31st December, 1928, to 31st March, 1929.  No dividend, accordingly, fell due for payment in the financial year ended 31st March, 1929, but the dividend payable in the current financial year will cover a period of fifteen months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the facts of the case.  Thady Lynch, by his will dated September 13th, 1919, devised the lands of Derrynagarragh, Co. Westmeath, to Patrick Lynch, his brother, subject to the support and maintenance of his sister, Bridie Lynch, for her life.  A claim for succession duty, therefore, arose on the death of Thady Lynch under Sections 2 and 10 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853, as amended by Section 58 (1) of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.  Under Section <Col N="740" /> 42 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853, the duty is a first charge on the interest of the successor, Patrick Lynch, and consequently is payable by him.</P>

      <P>Petitions were lodged for three proposed drainage districts in this area, viz., the Nenagh River, Currabaha and Gurtagarry. The proposals were investigated by engineers and land valuers of the Office of Public Works and on consideration of their reports it has been found desirable to combine the three proposals into one.  The county council have agreed in principle to make a contribution towards the cost of the proposed joint scheme.  A detailed survey has now to be made with a view to the preparation of a scheme.

      <P>The Deputy does not make quite clear what details he wishes circulated.  If he refers to statistical tables usually incorporated in the opening Estimates statement, it should be pointed out that these are not standardised sets of figures but are selected as being considered useful as an illustration of the points dealt with in the statement and which frequently would not be informative in the absence of the context.</P>
      <P>It is presumed the Deputy does not expect the very unusual course to be followed of circulating the Estimate statement in full previous to the discussion, and it does not appear, therefore, that any useful purpose would be served by issuing isolated sets of figures apart from their context.</P>
      <P>If, however, there are any specific details or statistics which the Deputy wants and which are available, we will endeavour to furnish them on request.</P>

At the table used by Miss Florence McCarthy the police conducting the search observed thereon notes in which the name of a detective officer appeared. They were unable to decipher the notes in full and took them away for interpretation.  The notes are now being returned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully considered the proposal that sittings of the Circuit Court should be held in Baltinglass, and I have had an opportunity of consulting the Judge of the Eastern Circuit. In the result I have reached the conclusion that effect should be given to the wishes of the inhabitants of West Wicklow; but, as the Circuit Court calendar for the current year has already been fixed, the Court will not actually sit in Baltinglass until next year.  In the meantime, however, I propose to make an Order under the Juries Act, 1927, dividing the County of Wicklow into two jury districts, the effect of which will be to relieve West Wicklow jurors from attendance at the Court at Wicklow town for either civil or criminal business.  The proposed Order will not effect the preparation of the panel of jurors for the forthcoming sittings of the Circuit Court at Wicklow town which have been fixed for the 14th proximo, but these sittings will be the last occasion upon which the inhabitants of West Wicklow will be put to the inconvenience of having to travel to Wicklow town to attend Court for jury service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of my Budget statement last year, I warned Deputies that great and sustained efforts to obtain economies would be required in order to make it unnecessary to impose further new taxation in the financial year 1929-30. I also said that even if increased burdens were avoided this year they could not be avoided in the year 1930-31 without retrenchment on a considerable scale, coupled with an improvement in the yield of taxation. <Col N="753" /> My remarks on that occasion were, I am afraid, taken not as an exhortation to Deputies to assist and support the Government in keeping down the level of expenditure, but as a warning to taxpayers that they might expect the worst.  I should, therefore, like to begin to-day by saying that there is now no serious cause for alarm.  The way before us is not easy, but the difficulties to be surmounted appear to be distinctly less formidable than twelve months ago.</P>
      <P>During the year a certain amount of public discussion took place in regard to Government borrowing and the growth of public debt.  In some quarters expression was given to the opinion that we had been too prone to rely on borrowing to meet outlay which created no asset for the State, and that in consequence the annual charge in respect of interest and sinking fund payments had assumed menacing proportions.  An examination of the facts, however, will show that instead of too freely seeking loans we have pursued a distinctly conservative financial policy, and have kept the dead weight burden of national debt down to a figure which, considering all the circumstances of the past few years, is astonishingly low.  Comparatively little fresh borrowing took place during the past twelve months.  It was not found necessary to issue the second instalment of the Second National Loan, a fact for which we had some reason to be thankful, having regard to the unfavourable conditions that have for some time existed in the money market.  Any sums that were required to meet abnormal or capital expenditure were obtained by discounting bills or by the sale of Savings Certificates.  At the 31st March last (if we leave out of account the amount due in respect of the Dáil Eireann Loans and the sum which is being repaid to the British Government by means of the annuity fixed under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1926) the public debt outstanding was £23,517,000, made up as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>When the aggregate of these, together with other smaller items, has been deducted from the sum of the capital liabilities of the State, we get a net figure of £13,983,000 representing our National debt.  This amount may be compared with £13,584,000 last year, and £12,400,000 in April, 1927.  If we were to exclude the Telephone Capital Advances from the gross total of indebtedness on the ground that the telephones are practically paying their way and able to relieve the Exchequer of liability, the net total would be reduced by <Col N="755" /> three-quarters of a million.  On the other hand if allowance were made for our liability in respect of the Dáil Eireann Loans and the debt to Great Britain which is being liquidated by an annuity of £250,000 per annum, it would be found that the entire dead-weight burden of State indebtedness was something less than £20,000,000.  After the present financial year I do not think that this sum will very greatly increase.  It is now four years since we adopted the policy of dividing expenditure into two classes&mdash;one normal, to be met out of revenue, and the other abnormal to be met by borrowing.  In the latter class we have included certain capital expenditure which did not take the form of advances under specific statutes such as the Shannon Electricity Act, the Electricity Supply Act or the Telephone Capital Act; but the abnormal expenditure has for the most part been of a non-capital character.  It created no assets and in so far as it was actually met by borrowing and not out of surplus revenue it increased the burden of dead-weight debt.</P>
    <P>The volume of abnormal expenditure has, however, fallen very rapidly since 1925-26.  In that year it amounted to £3,837,000, though a certain part of that total should be excluded for the purpose of strict comparison.  In the following year it sank to £3,250,000.  In 1927-28 it was £2,410,000, while last year it was only £1,397,000.  In the present year it will again be very substantially down, and we may reasonably hope that in the year 1930-31 the expenditure of the kind which has hitherto been classed as abnormal will include very little in addition to whatever sum may be required for the Local Loans Fund.  Though the total outlay under the various heads which have been treated as abnormal has amounted in the past four years to £10,894,000, the sums which have been actually borrowed against it do not reach anything like so high a figure.  There are several reasons for this.  Each financial year so far <Col N="756" /> has closed with a surplus of normal revenue over normal expenditure, and up till a year ago the surpluses were substantial.  In addition, there have been considerable receipts of a capital character from the old Departmental funds which were being wound up, and similar sources.  Further, the substantial sinking fund provision which is made in connection with National Loan and Compensation Stock tends appreciably to retard the growth of debt.  The gross total of public debt has risen during the four years by just about £10,000,000, but the greater part of the increase is due to outgoings such as advances in connection with the Shannon Scheme, the Road Fund, the purchase of creameries and similar matters.  The dead weight debt has increased by little more than £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that our considered policy of borrowing to meet compensation charges, to restore public buildings which had been destroyed, to pay that part of the cost of the Army which was in excess of £1,500,000, and to cover certain other exceptional expenses, has not produced the serious position that certain over-zealous critics have hinted at.  On the contrary, a period which was one of great difficulty in relation to the finances of the nation has been passed without the creation of any dangers, or even of any serious problems for the future.  The Saorstát has survived an expensive civil struggle which began soon after the commencement of an acute and long-continued economic slump and has done so without the adoption of any financial measure which there was reason to regret or reverse. The credit of the State is: high, and firmly established, a circumstance of which the beneficial consequences are by no means limited to the fact that we are able to borrow more cheaply than most countries for well-planned schemes of development.  Good national credit is practically essential to the growth of industry through private enterprise, because in its absence there cannot be stability and continuity <Col N="757" /> of financial policy or any certainty that the State will not be driven by dire need to resort to the imposition of unforeseen and arbitrary burdens.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the strict financial methods to which we have adhered and the sound credit position which we have built up have already improved, and will increasingly improve, the prospects of substantial industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of the last financial year, revenue came in very slowly and although at no time was there any ground for anticipating a big deficit, there was a period during which it did look as if the income of the State would, for the first time, fall short of the Estimate and of the amount required to meet outlay under normal and recurrent heads of expenditure.  From the beginning of January, however, the position rapidly improved, and on 31st March there was a surplus of about £100,000 of normal revenue after providing for all items of normal expenditure.  The figures for the year, as a whole, may be viewed with satisfaction.  They indicate that there is no great reason to fear a shrinkage of the yield of taxation in the future.  Since the setting up of the Saorstát we have had to contend with a sharp decline in the return of revenue under certain heads with the result that in spite of all efforts to control expenditure it was in no year possible to give the remissions of taxation that would have been feasible with a stable yield.  Henceforward, there is reason to hope that while, perhaps, there will be considerable fluctuations in the return of individual taxes and while the bulk receipts of revenue may go up or down, a gradually improving yield will be obtained, taking one year with another.  The only danger of a further decline lies in the fact that a considerable proportion of our Customs revenue is now obtained from protective duties imposed in pursuance of our tariff policy.</P>
    <P>As these duties achieve their purpose and stimulate increased production <Col N="758" /> in home industries, they will give a lessening return to the Exchequer.  The additional employment given and the additional profits made by Saorstát manufacturers will of course cause new streams or trickles of revenue to flow into the Central Fund.  There will be increased consumption of dutiable articles of a luxury or semi-luxury character, and increased contributions of income tax and corporation profits tax, and ultimately also of estate duty and legacy and succession duty.  In some cases the loss arising from the disappearance of revenue receipts from a protective tariff will be completely made good. In other cases, however, it seems likely that the growth of Saorstát industry will mean a definite Exchequer loss.  But no net loss that can occur will be such as to disturb very seriously the Budget position. If the whole of the revenue from protective duties were to disappear and no new revenue were to accrue from the increase in manufacturing profits and in the national wage bill, the Exchequer would still suffer less than it has suffered since 1924-5 in consequence of the reduced consumption of beer and spirits.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking features of last year's revenue was an increase of almost £200,000 in the yield of the duty on tobacco, which produced £270,000 more than the tax on spirits and nearly one-half the combined duties on alcoholic liquors, excluding wine.  A considerable part of the increase was no doubt due to extra withdrawals of tobacco from bond, which manufacturers effected in the mistaken belief that the duty was about to be raised. All of the increase, however, cannot be accounted for in this way.  Apart altogether from the effects of forestalling, the return was up by at least £50,000.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the spirit duty also gave an increased yield exceeding the return of the previous year by more than £100,000.  It has been suggested that so far as this particular commodity was concerned the extra <Col N="759" /> consumption that took place last year was ascribable to the occurrence of an epidemic of influenza. I understand that the disease proved fatal in a comparatively small number of cases.  Consequently, it would appear that the brisk rush for spirituous beverages not only benefitted the Exchequer but saved human life, which was an excellent result.  The Revenue Commissioners do not feel that we can safely rely on any sort of epidemic in the course of the present financial year and accordingly I am anticipating a return below that which was obtained in 1927-8.  Allowing for the fact that the shortening of the brewers' credit resulted in thirteen months' tax being collected last year, the beer duty was down by some £50,000.  At one time there was reason to fear that the realised yield would fall short of the Budget estimate by £200,000 or £250,000, but in the last three months of the financial year leeway was steadily made up.  The reasonably satisfactory figure which was finally attained more truly represented the position in regard to the consumption of beer than the result which appeared likely earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions explained that while in respect of most commodities, subject to duties of customs or excise, the tax obtained during a particular quarter or half-year affords some indication of the trend of consumption during the period, the yield of beer duty in the Saorstát in consequence of great temporary variations in brewers' stocks, including stocks for export, is liable to fluctuate so extraordinarily that it would be possible for revenue to shrink during a whole year, though consumption was actually increasing, or to increase though consumption was falling.  As a result of careful inquiries the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that while there was some decline in the consumption of beer in the Saorstát during 1928-29 it was inconsiderable.  Their view is borne out by the fact that the revenue from imported beer which, of course, was not affected by the shortening <Col N="760" /> of the brewers' credit or variations in brewers' stocks, was up by about four per cent., though there had previously been a downward trend.  It is too soon to assume that the return from the beer duty is about to increase or even to become stabilised, but it certainly may be said that the rate of decline is steadily becoming slower, and that if the slight improvement in general economic conditions which has taken place becomes at all more marked the revenue from beer may speedily begin to show a new tendency.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the loss attributable to certain modifications made in last year's Budget, the return from the Entertainment Tax showed a slight improvement.  Though their financial importance is small, it is of interest to note that the taxes on cinematograph films, clocks and watches and musical instruments produced a yield exceeding that of the previous year by £12,000, whereas a decrease had been anticipated.  The tax on sugar produced practically £60,000 more than the estimate which was calculated on the basis of the increased duty.  The yield from the Betting Tax fell rather sharply by over £30,000 as compared with the previous year, a fact which would seem to show that whether or not there was an increase in the number of bets made or an increase in gambling amongst particular classes of persons, the actual amount of money wagered with bookmakers in the Saorstát came down from £5,480,000 in 1927-28 to £4,514,000 in 1928-29. The Revenue Commissioners, however, believe there is some reason to fear that with greater experience in preparing their returns a certain number of bookmakers have become increasingly inaccurate.  Special steps will be taken to secure a more punctilious observance of the provisions of the law, and it is hoped that the decline in the yield of the tax may be retarded if not arrested.  So far as the other indirect taxes were concerned, there was no substantial divergence from the estimate or the figures of the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Deputies will remember that the provisions of last year's Budget necessitated the collection of £400,000 of income tax which would not in the ordinary course have been brought into the Exchequer in 1928-29.  The money was to be obtained by collecting Schedule A tax in a single instalment, instead of in two, and by getting £250,000 more out of the dwindling pool of arrears than could have been got by working the machinery of collection at normal pressure&mdash;I use the word advisedly. The amount actually paid into the Exchequer by the end of the financial year was only £43,000 short of the mark.  In consequence, the amount of abnormal arrears still outstanding has become comparatively small.  The sum which should prove collectible is now estimated at about £130,000.  This represents the most difficult type of case which can only be satisfactorily settled after great trouble and prolonged effort. There is no hope of completing the work in the present year.  About £50,000 will be collected before 31st March next.  The only other abnormal item included in this year's Income Tax Estimate is a sum of £50,000 which will be obtained in consequence of last year's change in regard to the collection of Schedule A.  The revenue from income tax, it is estimated, will not fall by more than £100,000 after this year except as a result of changes in the rate or allowances.  For the past four years profits in trade and industry have as a whole been steady, with a certain tendency to rise.  It can, therefore, be safely anticipated that even if no great change in conditions takes place, income tax will continue to give a yield very little short of £3,300,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn to the position in regard to expenditure.  The White Paper shows that the estimated amount required to maintain the public departments and meet necessary outlay during the year is, in respect of Central Fund Services, £4,199,220, and in respect of supply services £21,241,430, or a total of £25,440,650.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> For Budget purposes I propose, as in previous years, to deduct from the total certain items which because they are abnormal charges of a non-recurrent kind or because they are of a capital nature need not be met out of the proceeds of taxation.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The aggregate of these items is £1,080,000.  When that sum is deducted from the total estimate of expenditure, we get a figure of £24,360,000, roughly, representing anticipated outlay to meet which we cannot properly have recourse to borrowing.  We are still dealing, however, with a gross figure.  Allowance has yet to be made for the element of over-estimation.  I have on previous occasions explained that, no matter how carefully the estimates are prepared or how rigidly they are checked in the Department of Finance, they will always in the bulk contain a marginal sum which will not in fact be expended. There are sixty-eight votes, containing well over six hundred separate sub-heads.  Departments obtain under each sub-head sufficient money to meet the particular class of expenditure to which that sub-head relates.  Naturally and inevitably some small percentage of the amount shown under almost every sub-head in the estimates is really a provision for contingencies.  Every year in the case of a certain number of votes the estimate proves insufficient, generally because of some unforeseen development.  In the great majority of cases, however, and in the estimates taken as a whole, there is some money over at the end of the year.  Last year I fixed the sum which I thought could reasonably be allowed for over-estimation, together with savings, at £600,000, which proved to be practically correct. This year it will not be possible to count on nearly so large a margin, in view of the drastic way in which the estimates have already been pruned.  The largest sum which it would be justifiable to expect to remain unspent at the end of the year in consequence of over-estimation and of savings is £435,000, which is about 2½ per cent.  of the <Col N="764" /> total estimate for all normal supply services after deducting the fixed grants on which no saving could be effected and in respect of which no over-estimation could arise.  If we deduct, therefore, £435,000 from £24,360,000 odd, which is the aggregate estimate of expenditure for those purposes for which it is not permissible to borrow, we get a net total of £23,925,000.  This is the amount which will actually be spent during the present year and which must be entirely provided out of the proceeds of taxation or other normal revenue.</P>
    <P>The estimate for Supply Services, after deducting abnormal items, is down by £539,000 as compared with last year.  This very substantial reduction was not achieved without great difficulty.  In January last, after the draft estimates had been submitted, it was apparent that if the total could not be diminished there would be no alternative to the imposition of fresh taxation this year to the extent of several hundred thousand pounds.  A special economy drive was undertaken. Projected services which would have been very valuable if there had been money to spare were abandoned, and existing services were reduced and in some cases eliminated, and, generally speaking, the estimates were hacked down to the lowest possible level.  I have already referred in the Dáil to the assistance obtained from the Economy Committee, of which Deputy Heffernan is chairman.  The Committee was established in the autumn of 1927, and has since then been steadily occupied with its difficult and tedious task.  Although it had not begun the preparation of a report at the end of January last, when the necessity for very special steps to bring about a reduction of outlay arose, it had in fact carried out a detailed survey of the greater part of the field of State expenditure and was in a position to indicate a number of directions in which retrenchment was possible.  The Cabinet availed to the full of the information which the Economy Committee had collected, and adopted a number of the suggestions which <Col N="765" /> had been before the Committee with a view to their insertion later on in its report.  It is hoped that the Committee will be able to complete its examination of Government expenditure during the present year and present a report, for although the general economic outlook is better there can still be no question of the need to limit outlay as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Two or three of the cuts which were effected in January and February have attracted considerable public attention and in one of them we were unable to persist because of the overwhelming opposition which manifested itself amongst Deputies.  Like many excellent things, it failed to catch the popular fancy.  Another, the abandonment of the summer courses in Irish for National teachers, has been misrepresented in some quarters.  I need hardly say that it marks no change of policy by the Department of Education in regard to the teaching of Irish.  The fact is that while the summer courses were necessary and valuable in the first few years after the change of Government, their utility had gradually declined and in the meantime a slower but more radical scheme for procuring teachers fully competent in the Irish language had been inaugurated. Even if there had been no clamant need for economy the summer courses would not have been continued more than another summer at most.  Their discontinuance is no indication of any disposition to look upon expenditure on effective work in connection with the Irish language as a partly unnecessary expenditure from which pickings may be obtained for the Exchequer any time conditions of financial stringency develop.</P>
    <P>The decision to stop recruiting for the Civic Guard has necessitated the closing of certain stations and a good many local protests and appeals have been received.  We believe, however, that some further reduction in numbers may be possible without much detriment to <Col N="766" /> the public.  But, on the other hand, we are convinced that whatever may be the need for economy the remuneration of the Guards cannot be further curtailed.  In this respect the limit has been reached. Five years ago their pay was reduced by some fourteen or fifteen per cent.  This year their allowances have been substantially reduced. Financially, they are appreciably worse off than police in adjacent countries.  Any further cuts would not only be impolitic from the point of view of the maintenance of efficiency, but they would be unjust to individuals who have given faithful service and allowed opportunities of entering upon other careers to go by.</P>
    <P>Even when an intense campaign of economy is being carried on, it is impossible to stop all additions to expenditure. There are many cases in which the amount to be provided under a particular sub-head is subject to automatic increases which cannot be postponed or avoided.  In other cases, public policy demands that outlay in some new direction be sanctioned or that expenditure on certain special existing services be increased.  I consider, therefore, in all the circumstances, it is something of a feat to bring down the total of the normal items in the estimates for the Supply Services by practically £550,000.  As I have already indicated, the cutting to which the estimates have been subjected makes it impossible to anticipate that savings, whether arising from over-estimation or further limitation of expenditure, will reach nearly so high a figure as last year.  In consequence, the net amount of revenue required to meet actual expenditure under the normal and non-capital sub-heads shown in the estimates for the Supply Services will be less than the amount required last year by only £374,000. The increase in the Estimate for normal Central Fund Services, on the other hand, amounts to £237,000.  It is more than accounted for by the additional sums provided for interest and sinking fund.</P>
    <P>Two factors are responsible for <Col N="767" /> the somewhat sharp increase in the amount expected to be required for the service of debt.  In the first place, it is anticipated that it will be necessary during the year to make an issue of National Loan to the extent of £5,000,000 and nearly £200,000 will be required for interest, sinking fund and flotation expenses. Secondly, I have been forced to the conclusion that the practice hitherto adopted of dealing with interest on Savings Certificates can no longer be followed.  As I have already mentioned, the amount that has been borrowed by the sale of Savings Certificates is over £4,000,000.  The liability accruing annually in respect of interest will henceforth be very considerable.  Up to the present we have only made provision in the estimates for such amounts of interest as it was anticipated would become payable in consequence of the cancellation of certificates in the particular year.  The interest that has actually had to be paid in any year heretofore has been only a small part of the interest which had been earned.  The position will probably not change much for the next two or three years, but a point will then be reached when big interest payments will have to be made.  If no fund were accumulated to meet that contingency the taxpayers of the Saorstát would be faced with the unpleasant prospect of having suddenly to submit to the imposition of the new taxation requisite to provide a very large sum for a purpose for which borrowing would be inadmissible. I have, therefore, decided to set aside a sum of £150,000 as a reserve against the interest on Savings Certificates which will accrue, but not be paid this year. This change of policy increases the Central Fund estimate by the figure mentioned, but I am satisfied that the step could not have been longer delayed. The position accordingly is that while the amount of revenue that must be obtained to meet expenditure in respect of Supply Services is down by <Col N="768" /> £374,000 as compared with last year, the amount required for Central Fund Services is up by £237,000, and the net decrease is £137,000.</P>
    <P>The White Paper shows that the tax revenue which it is expected to receive during the year will total £20,436,000, while the non-tax revenue will amount to £3,528,000, making £23,964,000 in all.  There are two anticipated receipts included under the heading of Miscellaneous Non-tax Revenue, to which I must draw attention.  The first is a sum of £25,000, representing repayments, by Agricultural Credit Societies of advances made to them; the second is a sum of £200,000, which will be received from the National City Bank in repayment of an advance made to it in 1925, when difficulties arose in financing the operations of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act. The advances to the Agricultural Credit Societies were made with money obtained by borrowing, and the sums now being repaid cannot be used to defray expenditure which ought to be met out of taxation. The advance to the National City Bank, on the other hand, was made before we began the practice of dividing expenditure into normal and abnormal categories, and the money was in fact found out of taxation, 1924-25 having been a bumper year from the point of view of revenue.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the portion of the loan which will be repaid this year can be used for any purpose to which tax-revenue now coming into the Exchequer could be applied. Although it is a non-recurrent receipt, it is as much a normal receipt as money arising from the collection of old arrears of income tax, or the shortening of brewers' credit in respect of beer duty.  I propose, therefore, to treat as normal all the amounts included in the White Paper estimates of tax and non-tax revenue, with the exception of the sum of £25,000 to which I have just referred.  If we deduct that figure from the gross aggregate of revenue, we get a net estimated total of £23,939,000.  Comparing this amount with the expenditure figure of <Col N="769" /> £23,925,000, we find that with taxation on its present basis the Budget will balance with a nominal surplus of £14,000.  The position is, therefore, that no new taxation is necessary and no remission of taxation is possible.  If any changes are to be made they can only have the effect of shifting burdens about.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy or taxpayer might omit to be thankful for small mercies, I shall recall the position that faced us last year.  The deficit which had then to be met was £1,149,000.  The estimate of expenditure (leaving the Road Fund out of account) that had to be paid out of revenue was up by £932,000 as compared with the previous year, and the revenue was down by £217,000.  In comparison with the outlook which then confronted us, present prospects give considerable grounds for cheerfulness.  Not only is there no deficit to be made good and no increase of expenditure to be faced, but we are going to have an increase of over £300,000 in normal revenue, apart altogether from the yield of any taxation imposed in last year's Budget or since.</P>
    <P>I have during the last three months received from organisations and individuals many suggestions in regard to reliefs which they thought ought to be given, and new taxes which they considered might be imposed. Almost all of the suggested remissions are familiar to Deputies. They have been discussed in the House or have figured in the reports of the meetings of various Chambers of Commerce and similar business organisations.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to consider favourably reductions in the beer, spirit and wine duties, in the entertainments tax, the abolition of the corporation profits tax, various reliefs to income tax payers, the lowering of the letter postage rate to a penny, the reduction of the stamp duties on cheques and receipts, the reduction of the standard rate of income tax to 2/-.  And now the Joint Committee on the Betting Act has rushed in breathlessly at the last <Col N="770" /> moment with a suggestion, which there has been no time yet to consider, that the tax on bets made at racecourses should be remitted.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in consequence, I suppose, of alarmist rumours about the revenue position, I have got a rather greater volume of advice than usual on how to raise additional funds.  The suggestions that have come in recommended, amongst other things, a tax on shops, a tax on commercial travellers, a tax on bicycles, a tax on imported newspapers, a tax on dances, a tax on automatic selling machines, a tax on coursing meetings, a tax on silk stockings, a tax on barristers, and a higher tax than has yet been suggested on buses.  Curiously enough, none of my correspondents advocated a tax on petrol.</P>
    <P>Feeling that mere chopping and changing of the scale of taxation is useless, and even somewhat harmful, I decided simply to put away till next year, when relief may be possible or new taxation necessary&mdash; which I do not expect&mdash;the many interesting suggestions that have been submitted to me.  Exceptions were, however, made in the case of two proposals.</P>
    <P>The appeal for increased allowances to income tax payers in respect of children and earned income was very carefully considered.  It is one with which I have much sympathy. But I am strongly of opinion that funds for the further relief of income tax payers should not be found by the imposition of customs or excise duties on articles of common use, because in that case the money would be collected mainly from people who are worse off than any of those who are liable to income tax.  I believe also that we ought not to contemplate such a thing as an addition of 3d. or 4d. to the standard rate in order to increase the scale of allowances.  The encouragement of business enterprise is largely a question of promoting in various ways a growth of confidence. A proposal at the present stage to increase the income tax rate <Col N="771" /> for any purpose whatever would immediately produce a feeling of uncertainty as to the economic future and be bad for industry.  An attempt was accordingly made to see whether, without raising the rate, it would be possible to readjust the burden of income tax between different classes of the community in such a way as to give the reliefs sought without loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As I promised last year, a Departmental Committee was set up to examine the whole matter, and Deputies were invited to lay before it any suggestions which they thought ought to be considered.  The Committee were unable to find a scheme which would appreciably increase the children's and earned income allowances without loss to the Exchequer.  The plan which they submitted as the best they could devise provided for earned income allowance at the rate of one-sixth on income up to £450, with allowance at the rate of one-tenth, as at present, on income above £450, the existing maximum limit of £200 to be maintained. The Committee's plan also provided for increasing the present allowance of £36 for the first child and £27 for each other child to a flat allowance of £50 for every child.  On the other hand, it proposed that where at present only half tax is payable on the first £225 of chargeable income, the full rate should in future begin to be payable after the first £150.  The cost to the Exchequer of the scheme as a whole would be about £100,000 per annum.  It is as cheap and as equitable a scheme as could be put forward for the purpose in view, and if there were £100,000 available for the remission of taxation it would merit adoption, though no doubt certain arguments could be brought against it, and its effect in increasing the tax payable by some of the people in receipt of comparatively small incomes from investments would be resented.  The position, however, is that the £100,000 necessary to enable the scheme to be accepted is not available, and we <Col N="772" /> have been reluctantly compelled to put it aside for the present.</P>
    <P>The question of rearranging the scale on which entertainments tax is charged was also considered during the year with a view to seeing whether it would be possible to relieve lower-priced seats in cinemas without loss to the Exchequer.  I regret that it was not found possible to get a satisfactory alternative to the present scale without facing a loss of revenue which in the present circumstances we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>For some years past I have been pressed to take some step towards the simplification of the income tax code, and, in particular, to adopt the principle of assessing tax on the basis of the income of the preceding year, instead of the various bases which are at present taken for different classes of income.  The variety of bases of assessment is confusing to the taxpayer and tends to increase the work of the staff of the Revenue Department.  Thus, the profits of a mine are chargeable on the basis of the average of the five years preceding the year of assessment, the profits of a quarry on the basis of the single year preceding the year of assessment, and the profits of, say, a woollen factory on the average of the three years preceding the year of assessment.  A professional man who happens to be a director of a limited liability company and who has capital invested in National Loan is obliged to compute his income from his profession on the average of the three years preceding the year of assessment, his income from his directorship on the basis of his remuneration for the current year, and his income from National Loan on the basis of the interest arising during the year preceding the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>Again, an employee of a limited liability company is assessable under Schedule E on the income derived from his employment during the year of assessment.  If his salary at the beginning of the year is, say, £400, he is assessed to income tax in the first instance on that amount; but if he receives an increase of <Col N="773" /> salary amounting to, say, £50 per annum, with effect as from the 1st October, an additional assessment has to be made for the extra £25 accruing to him during the year of assessment.  Extra pay for special work, such as overtime, falls to be similarly dealt with.  In the case of various classes of persons who receive special items of remuneration apart from their salaries, these additional assessments, which have to be made after the end of the year, entail much work for the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and a certain amount of inconvenience to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I propose, accordingly, to embody in the Finance Bill provisions designed to sweep away a good deal of this complexity and to secure, broadly speaking, that all income from trades, professions, and vocations, investment income chargeable by direct assessment under Schedule D, and also income from employments chargeable under Schedule E shall be assessed on the basis of the income of the single year preceding the year of assessment.  Mines, quarries, railways and other similar concerns will be definitely transferred to Schedule D, and will also be chargeable to income tax by reference to the profits of the year preceding the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>This principle of assessing income tax for any year on the basis of the income of the preceding year is adopted in the Dominion of Canada, in the Commonwealth of Australia, and in many other countries.  It was adopted in Great Britain in 1926 with effect as from 1927-8 inclusive. I am satisfied that the adoption of it in the Saorstát will simplify matters from the point of view of the taxpayer and will make for economy in administration.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main provisions to which I have referred, there will be certain consequential provisions dealing with commencing and ceasing businesses, the treatment of losses, etc.  These changes will not come into force this year.  The forms requiring returns from taxpayers for the year 1929-30 have long since been <Col N="774" /> printed in accordance with the existing law; the bulk of them have already been issued to the public, and much of the work towards the making of the assessments must be completed before the Finance Bill can be passed.  The Bill will be drafted so as to provide that the changes to which I have referred will come into force for the fiscal year 1930-31.</P>
    <P>The present is an opportune time for a change of this character, which will, I anticipate, be effected without any appreciable gain to the revenue at the expense of the income tax payer, on the one hand, or to the income tax payer at the expense of the revenue, on the other.  It would be difficult to make the alteration at a time when trade was showing a sharp change either upward or downward.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, mention that assessments under Schedule A on houses, lands, etc., in the Saorstát, and under Schedule B on farming profits, will continue as at present to be made by reference to the Poor Law valuation.  Income taxed by deduction at source&mdash;for example, ground rents, mortgage interest, dividends paid by Saorstát limited companies, etc.&mdash;will continue to be dealt with in the same manner as at present.</P>
    <P>In addition to the alterations which I have already outlined, I propose to introduce clauses to simplify certain formalities in connection with the procedure for the making of income tax assessments and the hearing of appeals.  These latter changes do not involve any material alterations in the income tax forms, and I propose that they shall take effect this year.</P>
    <P>Since the British scheme for de-rating agricultural land and for giving a seventy-five per cent. relief to industrial undertakings and freight transport hereditaments was published a year ago, demands have been made in various quarters in the Saorstát that a similar scheme should be put into operation here, at any rate in relation to agricultural land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Before the British proposals were announced we had complaints about the burden of rates and a certain clamour for increases in the different Exchequer grants, as well as for the wholesale supersession of local bodies by commissioners, but there was no agitation for de-rating.  It is probable that many of those who have in recent months pronounced in favour of it have done so without fully considering the matter on its merits. But if, on the one hand, a number of people have accepted without much examination the idea that the British Government has discovered a potent economic remedy which would also be efficacious here, the Government, on the other hand, has been anxious not to fall into the mistake of coming prematurely to the conclusion that because of the wide differences which exist between the conditions prevailing in the two countries it would be impossible beneficially to apply the British scheme or some modification of it to the Saorstát.  In consequence the whole problem has received a good deal of attention from Ministers and Departments since the end of last summer.  An inter-Departmental Committee was appointed to examine the matter systematically, and its report was carefully considered.  The more deeply the question was probed the more serious and complicated it appeared.  If de-rating on the British plan were carried out here, and if malicious injury rates, drainage rates, and similar special rates were excluded from the scope of the scheme, as it is proposed to exclude them in Northern Ireland, the amounts to be found by the Exchequer on the basis of the rates prevailing in the Saorstát during the past financial year are estimated to be as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputies will notice that the cost of giving the 75 per cent. relief to industrial establishments and freight transport hereditaments would be comparatively small here.  Indeed the cost of relieving agricultural land and farm buildings would be almost 92 per cent. of the whole.  In Great Britain, on the other hand, the additional relief of agriculture is rather a minor feature of the scheme. It was estimated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the cost of de-rating agricultural land in England and Wales and of reducing the rate payable in Scotland to one-sixth of the general rate would amount to £4,750,000, whereas the estimated total losses of the local authorities in Great Britain on account of rates will be £24,000,000.  The cost of the agricultural part of the British scheme is, therefore, rather less than one-fifth of the whole.  In fact when the special new grant of £5,000,000 which is being given to help to get the scheme smoothly into operation is taken into account the cost of agricultural de-rating is less than one-sixth of the total.  Not only is the reform which is being carried out across the Channel one which mainly affects manufacturing industry, but it would seem to have been necessitated by industrial needs, and there would appear to be grounds for doubting whether with the system of land tenure that prevails in Great Britain any part of the benefit which it gives the farmer will be permanent.</P>
    <P>It does not follow, of course, that a scheme designed primarily to benefit manufacturing industries might not, if applied to an agricultural country, be just as effective in assisting the farmer.  But there are two factors here at present which present difficulties altogether disproportionate to the difficulties involved in Great Britain.  In Great Britain the cost of making good the rates lost by <Col N="777" /> local authorities will be about 2.8 per cent. of the national revenue.  In the Saorstát it would be 9.2 per cent. of the revenue.  In Great Britain it is anticipated that after a year or two the annual yield from a 4d. tax on petrol will meet the whole cost.  In the Saorstát a 4d. tax on petrol would provide little more than one-fifth of the sum required.  In Great Britain the fruits of a 6d. income tax would be ample to pay for de-rating; in the Saorstát a 6d. income tax would not give a quarter of the money that would be needed.  Our neighbours are able to finance the new system out of the proceeds of a single simple tax which can be easily collected and which falls to a considerable extent on a luxury traffic.  In case we were to de-rate we should be obliged to put on seven or eight new taxes.  If, for instance, we decided to raise the income tax to 4/- we should have to give allowances on the British scale and abandon the corporation profits tax, and the net additional revenue obtained probably would not exceed £500,000.  A tax of 4d. on both petrol and paraffin would give about £700,000, or perhaps £50,000 less.  A tax of 3d. per lb. on tea would yield £250,000; an additional ¼d. per lb. on sugar&mdash;making the rate 50 per cent. higher than in Great Britain&mdash;would produce £200,000.  An increase in the duty on boots from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. would procure £80,000, and by raising the duty on all apparel to 20 per cent. we should probably bring in £90,000 more.  It would still be necessary to obtain a further £410,000 if de-rating was to be extended to industries and transport. If it were decided to confine the relief to agriculture only, £230,000 extra would be required.  Most of the latter amount could be got from an increase of 6d. per lb. in the duty on tobacco.  The de-rating of agricultural land and buildings would therefore involve seven items of new or increased taxation, which I may recapitulate:</P>
    <P>1/- on the income tax,</P>
    <P>¼d. per lb. on sugar,</P>
    <P>3d. per lb. on tea,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> 4d. per gallon on petrol and paraffin,</P>
    <P>5 per cent. on boots,</P>
    <P>5 per cent. on such apparel as is now subject to 15 per cent.,</P>
    <P>6d. per lb. on tobacco.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recognise that no Minister for Finance could bring a list like that to the Dáil for adoption and expect to meet with an enthusiastic reception.  Such a series of impositions would undoubtedly have an effect on the cost of living and entail consequential increases in State expenditure.  It must be borne in mind also that the taxpayer would have to disburse sums in respect of the new indirect taxation which would substantially exceed the amounts which would reach the Exchequer. If the State got 3d. per lb. out of tea, the consumer in all probability would ultimately pay 4d. or 5d. extra.  It is certain that if we raised £2,050,000 by taxation in order to de-rate agricultural land the actual charge upon the taxpayer would be anything from £200,000 to £400,000 more.  It might even exceed the latter figure.</P>
    <P>It is not clear that agricultural production would be increased by de-rating.  No doubt the individual farmer would welcome greatly the immediate relief from direct taxation; but his net gain as a general rule would be very little.  It is probable that many small farmers with families might lose practically the entire benefits of de-rating in consequence of the increased cost of tea, sugar, oil, boots, clothes and tobacco, taken in conjunction with such increases in the prices of commodities generally as might result from a transfer of a portion of the burden of the petrol duty and additional income tax by those on whom this burden immediately fell.  Even in the case of farmers who definitely gained as a result of the change, the net saving would not be such as to have any immediate effect on the economy of their farms.  It could scarcely be sufficient in any case to enable them to produce more or give more employment.  In consequence the position would be either that the agricultural labourer and the town <Col N="779" /> worker would have to suffer an increased cost of living for a change which brought no advantage to themselves, or new schemes of expenditure would have to be devised to give them compensating benefits.</P>
    <P>If de-rating in the Saorstát could be financed as in Great Britain from the proceeds of a single and not very oppressive tax, it would be possible to give the farmer a net measure of relief which would very nearly correspond to the burden which he has heretofore borne by way of rates, and to do it without imposing fresh burdens on classes not well able to bear them.  Conditions being as they are, however, the financing of a scheme of de-rating would be for us a problem of the greatest magnitude. The second factor which makes de-rating a far more serious question here than in Great Britain is the effect it would have on the system of local government.  Across the Channel the change is being carried out without altering substantially or fundamentally the powers or duties of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The present valuation of agricultural land in Saorstát county areas, including urban districts, is 71.2 per cent. of the total valuation of those areas for rating purposes.  In particular counties the proportion rises to 84 per cent. and 86 per cent.  In the Saorstát as a whole the percentage of the total valuation represented by agricultural land and farm buildings is about 65, while in Northern Ireland it is about 38. Agricultural land and buildings in Scotland represent about 6 per cent., and in England and Wales agricultural land represents about 2½ per cent.  In Great Britain as a whole the proportion of the entire valuation, which would either be wholly relieved of rates or given three-quarters relief, would be far lower than in the Saorstát. This is clear from the fact that of rates lost there will only be 12.2 per cent., whereas in the Saorstát it would be 44.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious that it would be impossible for the State to pay out <Col N="780" /> to the county councils sums which, together with existing estate duty grant, licence duties grant, etc., would represent in many cases well over 90 per cent. of their revenue, and leave their present powers undisturbed. If such a thing were done an orgy of expenditure would result.  Stabilisation of the total Exchequer grant would not suffice to check extravagance.  It would only lead to an agitation for fresh relief when the rate burden on dwelling-houses and the like had risen to intolerable heights.  Neither would the fixing of a maximum limit for total expenditure be a workable device.  On the whole, it would at present appear that de-rating would necessitate changes in local government which would practically be equivalent to its abolition.</P>
    <P>I am aware that proposals for the abolition of local authorities would command a good deal of support through the country.  Such support would come not merely from people who think that rates in their own area are higher than they need be, or who have an objection to the personnel or methods of their local council; it would come also from people who take the view that, with the ease and speed of modern communications, a small State like ours, with a small population, does not need local elected bodies at all.  Most of the opponents of responsible local government, however, fail to advert sufficiently to the fact that if the administration of roads, asylums, poor relief and public health were vested entirely in the central authority there would arise a pressure for ever-soaring expenditure which would be nearly irresistible.  At present demands for increased local expenditure are countered by local resistance, but if local government were abolished, either by the wholesale substitution of commissioners or by the transfer of services to Government Departments, the position would be entirely altered.  So long as we have commissioners operating in only a few places, and so long as they hold office only temporarily, the Government need accept no responsibility <Col N="781" /> for their actions.  But if there were commissioners everywhere and local councils nowhere, the Government would be obliged to direct the policy of every commissioner and accept responsibility for all his acts.  He would in fact become merely the agent of a Department of the Government. Equally, therefore, whether the State administered local services exactly as it administers other services or administered them through the medium of commissioners, we should have constant and practically unanimous pressure from every area for increased outlay.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the State should take over certain services like mental hospitals and roads, and leave the local bodies to carry on their remaining functions as at present.  This alternative has its own disadvantages.  It would, of course, leave agricultural land still subject to rates, though they would, for the time being at any rate, be substantially lower.  It would, however, inevitably involve an increase in the cost of what are now local services. While in connection with mental hospitals certain economies could be effected as the result of centralising the administration, improvements of various sorts which would have to be made would undoubtedly result in a substantial net increase in the cost of the whole service.  If the State assumed responsibility for roads, higher standards and greater costs would ensure.  I do not say that in regard to either mental hospitals or roads there would be greater waste under a system of central administration.  On the contrary, I think it possible that better value would be got for the money expended.  But the object of those who want the change is to lighten the burdens of the producer, and that object would not be attained. Moreover, if responsibility for roads and asylums were assumed by the State, and the local authorities left in charge of poor relief and public health, expenditure on those services would speedily rise considerably.  The new outlay might do a lot of good, but it would not serve the same purpose as relief from taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> I am satisfied that before anything in the nature of de-rating could be adopted in the Saorstát, or before any alternative method of shifting the rates burden could be safely carried into effect, the problem of the future of local government would require more examination.  It is the intention of the Government to explore the whole matter further.  An improvement in general economic conditions and in the yield of taxation might easily make the financial aspect of de-rating less formidable in future, and if a scheme of local government reform could be devised which would overcome the administrative difficulties and obviate an undue increase in expenditure, then the proposal would present itself in a much more favourable light.</P>
    <P>I come now to the only increase in taxation which it is proposed to make.  It will not affect the Exchequer, but it will strengthen the Road Fund a little.  About six months ago I stated that the Government intended to submit to the Dáil proposals for increasing the contribution made by motor omnibuses towards the maintenance of the roads. At that time the intention was to impose a mileage tax of 1d., 1½d. or 2d., according to the size of the vehicle, the tax to be paid by means of stamps affixed to a log-book before the commencement of each journey. More recently it has been represented to me that the charge suggested would be excessive.  Representatives of the bus owners were not prepared to argue with any vehemence that they were at present contributing to the Road Fund every penny which they could in justice be asked to give.  They purported to show, however, that in particular cases a vehicle which is now liable to a tax of £40 per annum would have to pay £290 per annum.  Their figures with regard to the annual mileage actually travelled by individual buses are not in accord with figures upon which I relied.  If the bus owners' figures are accurate, I am satisfied that the mileage tax originally proposed would be too heavy.  Without coming for the present to a final conclusion as to <Col N="783" /> whether or not buses should be taxed on a mileage basis, or what rate would be fair if a mileage tax were determined on, I have decided not to submit to the Dáil the proposals which I mentioned last December. It is intended instead to increase the present tax, which is based on seating capacity, by 150 per cent., so that the vehicle at present paying £40 a year will pay £100.  The change will bring an increase of about £45,000 per annum to the Road Fund, but it will still leave the contribution of the buses to the Fund at the modest level of 10 per cent. of the total revenue flowing into that Fund.  The increased duty will be payable as from the 1st July.</P>
    <P>Further consideration has been given to the proposal to increase the tax on vehicles not fitted with pneumatic tyres.  In view of the fact that three years ago the tax on lorries was very substantially increased, it is thought that the additional increase ought not to be imposed for the present.</P>
    <P>Clauses effecting minor changes of various kinds will be inserted in the Finance Bill, but I need not enter into any explanation of them at present. Broadly speaking, the provisions of the present Budget leave matters as they were.  To those members of the public who think that every Budget should embody several stunts, that will no doubt be a disappointment, but I venture to think that citizens who have examined our financial position intelligently will be tolerably satisfied.  Heretofore, in every Budget substantial changes in the scale or balance of taxation have been effected; the influence of some of them on the course of trade was considerable.  This year no important change in the table of duties is called for or is possible, but the benefits of the economic policy of the last few years have begun to be felt. For the first time it is possible to look forward from one Budget to another entirely without misgiving or anxiety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice, in regard to this particular Resolution, to enter into any detailed examination of the statement which the Minister for Finance has submitted to the House.  Before coming to the particular Resolution with which we are dealing, perhaps I might be permitted to make a few general remarks on the statement which we have just heard.  The Minister thought that some of us were not likely to appreciate the small mercy of having the same taxation maintained in the coming year as was maintained last year.  We are thankful for one thing, and that is that this year we have not had any of the stunts which the Minister for Finance employed last year to tide over the difficulties.  It is satisfactory to know, from that point of view, that there is an attempt about to be made to meet expenditure from revenue.  I cannot say, however, that I am at all satisfied, any more than I was last year, in regard to the arbitrary division of normal and abnormal expenditure.  It is quite evident from some of the items given by the Minister for Finance <Col N="785" /> that the sums which he took were quite arbitrary.  He divided certain amounts into two parts, and how he regarded one part as normal and the other part as abnormal, I fail to understand.  He gave no explanation in that regard, and I doubt if any explanation could have been given.  There is one matter which has been particularly disappointing &mdash;that is, if we could be disappointed, because the attitude which some of us have taken up in regard to the present Executive is that of those who expect nothing and are blessed.  We do not expect much from them.  We have got in this particular Budget evidence of something which we realised long ago. That is, their casual indifference to the whole question of unemployment as a national problem.  It has been the same in regard to the housing problem which we recently discussed, and, as I have said, we have come to regard that attitude as normal rather than abnormal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to unemployment, we realise that there are 4,000 persons likely to be disemployed very soon as a result of the completion of the Shannon scheme, and we also realise that there is going to be extra pressure as a result of the American quota of emigrants being reduced from 28,000 to 17,000 per annum. The only evidence which we see either in the Budget or in the Estimates of any realisation of that fact is in a negative direction.  We find in regard to the improvement of estates that the capital expenditure is being cut down by £161,000 and the expenditure on public works by £213,000.  The Minister for Finance, who has been in charge of the preparation of the Estimates and has been responsible for making provision for the coming year, seeks economies by methods of that kind, but, in view of our present position in regard to unemployment, he does not seem to approach that problem in a broad sense.  He confines himself to the narrow task of simply balancing accounts regardless of the cost at which that balancing may be <Col N="786" /> effected.  There are various enterprises that would repay expenditure by the State, and when we realise that each emigrant who leaves this country is taking away capital value in wealth which, according to the President himself, is nearer £1,000 than £500, we begin to realise at what cost this economy of the Minister, which takes no account of these needs, is effected.  There is land to be reafforested.  There is land to be reclaimed.  In regard to my own constituency of Clare, I ascertained recently from an extract from the Report of the Royal Commission on the Reclamation of Tidal Waters, that there were 22,000 acres which could be profitably reclaimed.  There is also very little indication in the Budget statement of appreciation of the fact that we are still importing into this country goods to the extent of tens of millions in value which could by proper organisation be produced in this country, and which would give employment to well over 60,000 persons, with a net gain to the community of twenty million pounds a year.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of de-rating and stated that if adopted here it would be at a cost which would practically make it prohibitive, but he has closed his ears to those who pointed out that a sum which would far more than cover the cost of de-rating is unwarrantably exported every year.  We believe that the sum paid to England is not due and that if the greater portion of it were retained here in the Exchequer there would be no need to put on extra taxation to relieve the present burden on agriculture.  We know, of course, that agriculture is our principal industry, and that seven out of every nine engaged on productive industries are engaged on the land; also that two-thirds of the wealth of the country is produced from agriculture, and, moreover, that the greater part of the remaining one-third is produced from industries ancillary to farming, such as bacon-curing, butter-making, brewing, distilling, and so forth.</P>
    <P>The pressure of rates is particularly <Col N="787" /> severe on our farming community. If we take into account the fact that they have to compete with rivals in Great Britain itself and in Northern Ireland, who are relieved of that burden of rates, we realise what a severe handicap there exists and will remain on the farming community.  As we say, we agree with the Minister that it is very difficult to say how that can be done by imposing alternative forms of taxation, but we say that there is a way which was open to a determined Minister.  If the present Ministry is not prepared to take it, then we say it is the duty of members of the House who see expenditure steadily fixed at the figure given in the Estimates, about £24,000,000&mdash; members who are interested in finding some relief where taxation is too burdensome and in providing means of employment for those who are unemployed&mdash;to get a Ministry who will see that that money is not exported. The British Prime Minister pointed out more than once that more income is exported from this State than from any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>A petrol tax was mentioned.  The Minister thought it was strange that he did not get any suggestions as regards a petrol tax.  One thing might be mentioned, even though this may not be the appropriate place to make the suggestion, and that is that there is need of looking after the petrol industry in this country.  There is at present a high cost of distribution on account of the five or six competing companies.  This competition does not result in any reduction to the consumer.  Although there is no tax on petrol we are paying as much per gallon as is paid in London where there is a tax of 4d. per gallon.  We say that the petrol question ought to be considered seriously by the Minister along the lines perhaps of one other country at least&mdash;as a State monopoly.  That is a question that should be inquired into.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of the <Col N="788" /> immediate Resolution before us, dealing with income tax, at first I found it difficult to keep in the position that I spoke of, that one who expects nothing is not going to be disappointed. When the Minister read the introductory part of the statement I began to hope, almost in spite of myself, that the debate and the suggestions made here last year had their effect and that there was going to be relief in income tax for the small taxpayer.  The present position is most unfair.  In England the tax is 4/- in the £; here it is nominally 3/-, but if you take a man with an income of £400 who is living with his wife and three children, he is paying a tax of £3 7s. 6d. here. A salary of £400 is not a very big salary for a man who has to provide for a wife and three children.  The State here takes £3 7s. 6d. in tax. In Great Britain he has nothing to pay.  In the case of a man with an income of £500 and who has a wife and three children, he has to pay here £10 3s. 6d.  In Great Britain a man in similar circumstances with the same income has only to pay £3 3s. 4d.  We think that the tax should be graded in such a way, and we believe it could be done without any serious loss to the Exchequer, that the man with a small income and a family would be given relief and, if necessary, that the higher incomes should bear any cost which that might involve.</P>
    <P>There was another matter in connection with income tax which was referred to at length last year.  I notice that no mention whatever has been made of it by the Minister in his statement.  That was the question of a preferential rate of tax for money invested in Irish industry as against money invested abroad and used to develop foreign industry and give employment to foreigners, whereas that money is needed here at home for the development of Irish industry.  I regretted to see that there was no mention of it, as if it were a matter about which the Minister had forgotten or thought not worthy of consideration.  We believe that this country at present is suffering very severely from the fact <Col N="789" /> that a very large proportion, £200,000,000, of national capital is invested outside the country.  I had also hoped that the sugar tax put on last year could be reduced this year, and that we would get back to the position in which we were before the increase was imposed.  We opposed that tax last year because we thought it most unfair.  We thought that this extra indirect tax on people who could least afford it, a tax which told heavily on children, and particularly on poor people with large families, should be remitted.  However, there is no indication of that in the Minister's statement.  As I have said, this is not the usual time at which to make a detailed examination of the statement of the Minister. With these general remarks on points that have struck me on reading the statement as the Minister spoke, I will leave over to a later occasion a closer examination of the accounts.</P>

      <P>Like the Deputy who has just spoken, I do not wish to dwell very much on the general position at this stage, except to say that in the early stages of his statement the Minister seemed to me to be defending the conservative financial attitude which the Government has taken up.  If we on these benches have any complaint, it is that that policy has been too conservative. We believe that it would have been more advantageous to the country if the Minister used the credit of the country, which he says is high, and which I agree is high, to borrow even more extensively for the purpose of national development. I believe that if that were done, and money were got on fairly advantageous terms for the inauguration of schemes of national development, such as housing, and especially drainage, which is very much needed, it would be to the benefit of the country as a whole.  As I say, if we have any fault to find with the Minister, it is certainly not on the lines that he has been over-liberal in his financial policy, but rather the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Resolution immediately <Col N="790" /> before us, I anticipated that there would not be very much of a change one way or another in the Budget proposals this year, but I did feel almost certain that in this one direction, in any case, there would be some attempt made by the Minister to meet the appeals made for the past six or seven years, not from one side, but from practically every side of the House, that the incidence of this tax should be changed, so that a certain measure of relief would be given to the smaller income tax payer, and especially the family man.  I can only once again express the disappointment which I have repeatedly expressed in this House that the Minister has not seen his way to afford that relief.  I do not agree that it is impossible to make that change even by adjustments within the present rates.  But I would be prepared to see, and I believe that it would be to the benefit of all, a refusal of the ordinary reliefs to the people with larger incomes, in order that these special reliefs would be given to those with smaller incomes, especially people with young families to support.  A man with £1,000 or £1,500 gets the one-tenth reduction for earned income as well as the man with £400, and to me it seems that that is not equitable if we have to find within the present income tax rates relief for the smaller taxpayers.  I believe that if it were not possible to give relief to the man with the small salary along the lines suggested in the Minister's statement&mdash;that is, that the first £450 should be subject to one-sixth reduction for earned income&mdash;that even that might be abandoned for the purpose of giving the £50 relief in the case of all children.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether any estimate of that portion of the relief&mdash; he estimates the whole relief at £100,000&mdash;has been made, and what is the estimated cost of giving, say, £50 relief in the case of all children.  I thought that an effort should be made to meet the demands so persistently put up here, and I hope that before these Resolutions finally become law and are embodied <Col N="791" /> in a Finance Act these questions will get very much further discussion and that an effort will be made by the Minister to meet the demands put forward in every quarter of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Formally I should like to say that I understand that this is the seventh successive Budget for which the Minister has been responsible. That is rather a record, and we can congratulate him upon the number of Budgets which he has submitted, though I fear that in regard to this Budget, as with its predecessors, we can hardly congratulate him upon its quality.  However, I wish to join with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party in regretting that the Minister has not found it possible to increase the allowances which we urged upon him last year should be made to the smaller taxpayers in respect of children.  I regret that very much, because I think it is a relief which is long overdue.  At the same time, we are faced with the fact that the Minister refuses to face up to the essential conditions for making this allowance, and that is that some way or other certain economies must be secured which will reduce the total amount to be provided by the Exchequer, and, therefore, the total amount to be secured in taxation.  We feel that because of that our hands in this discussion are very largely fettered.  We feel that we are beating our heads more or less against a stone wall, in view of the fact that the Minister has behind him entrenched the spending departments who refuse to permit him to take the necessary steps that will enable him to grant these concessions to the House.  At the same time, we also feel regret, as Deputy de Valera has expressed it, that the Minister has not this year considered the question of discriminating in favour of Irish investors so far as their income tax is concerned.  It is very difficult to get reliable figures for the geographical distribution of Irish investments. <Col N="792" /> I can only go on the basis of the figures which appear in the reports issued from time to time by the Revenue Commissioners, reports which I regret to say are not issued as expeditiously as they should be.  For instance, at the present moment the only reliable figures we have are figures dealing with 1926-7. On the other hand, in Great Britain the Revenue Commissioners' Report for the year 1927-8 has already been issued.  Therefore, any criticism of the Budget proposals, which is based upon actual ascertained facts, is much more up-to-date and much more timely so far as criticism of the British Budget proposals is concerned than any criticism which can be offered here.  I regret, therefore, that in the presentation of these reports, which after all give figures in a more or less stereotyped form, the Department of the Revenue Commissioners has not been as expeditious as I feel it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back, I have gone into the figures of the analysis which the Revenue Commissioners have made in the report of 1926-7 of the gross value of the estates which have come under them in connection with estate duty, and I have made a very exhaustive analysis of these figures. I find that the total amount invested by deceased persons, whose estates came under the notice of the Revenue Commissioners, in Government and municipal stocks, in shares and debentures, in mortgages on real estate, and in money on bonds and bills would be in all something like £6,566,769 in 1926-7, and that the total invested in Ireland was £1,656,822 and that the total abroad was £4,909,947.  So that out of that sum of six and a half millions approximately only 25 per cent. was invested in Ireland and 74.75 per cent. abroad.  If we consider, on the other hand, the investments in Government and municipal stocks we find that in 1926-7 only 10.37 per cent. of Irish investments were placed in this country, and something like 89.63 per cent. were placed abroad.  The discrepancy in relation to proprietary shares and debentures is not nearly so great, <Col N="793" /> but I find that, at any rate, even in 1926-7, the amount held by these dead investors in Irish companies was only 36.9 of the total investments in such companies, while the amount invested abroad was 63.1 per cent.  We know the considerable difficulties which even investments which seem to offer the greatest security have had in attracting capital here in Ireland. We know that the general complaint is that Irish industries are unable to develop because Irish investors are unwilling to put their capital into them.  I submit to the Minister that one of the ways in which he might secure that capital which is essential for further development of the country is by offering to those who make investments an additional attraction in the form of a discriminative income tax which would increase the net yield secured by Irishmen out of their investments in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to say that is the only thing necessary.  I agree with the Minister that good national credit is essential to the growth of Irish industry through private enterprise.  I agree with that, and I wish he would emphasise that point through his colleague, the Minister for Justice, who at the present moment is endeavouring to damage Irish credit by creating an impression in this country and abroad that the conditions here are so unstable that men must be deprived of their normal rights under the Constitution, and that a general opinion must be formed in the public mind that there is a widespread conspiracy to overturn the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Resolution; then I will proceed to another point. It has been represented to us, and I believe with a great deal of substance and foundation, that Irish investors have considerable sums of money invested abroad which they have not disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the proceeds, or rather the profits, of income they secured in earlier years and failed to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners. The position in regard to them is very difficult.  One does not like to ask the House at this stage to condone a wrong.  Undoubtedly it was wrong that these concealments should be made.  But I understand that a considerable number of them were made at the time when the position in the country was very uncertain. A number of them related to profits earned and incomes secured in 1919 and 1920.  At that time the income taxpayers were generally warned not to assist the British authorities in any way in collecting revenue in this country, and, even those of them inclined to make a disclosure were more or less prevented from doing so.  They did not disclose <Col N="795" /> their profits for income for the boom years.  They were faced afterwards, in 1922 and 1923, with being compelled to disclose them, and they were compelled to disclose them in the very height of the deflation period when they found that their annual income had fallen practically to vanishing point and when the profits made in 1918 and 1919 were gone entirely beyond the hope of repetition.  In that way I believe a number of people did refuse to disclose their incomes for income tax, and I suggest that the Minister might now, purely on the ground of expediency, issue a notice stating that if these income taxpayers came forward and disclosed their present investments abroad he would not proceed to carry any inquiry further back than the year 1923&mdash;six years ago&mdash;and that he should see, by legislation, if necessary, that the Revenue Commissioners would not exact penalties for false returns made prior to that year or since that year.</P>
      <P>The reason I am making that suggestion is this: it has been represented to me&mdash;and I made inquiries from a number of bankers&mdash;that the amount of Irish capital concealed in that way is not less than £10,000,000.  Many of the people have that money on deposit in English banks.  I understand that English banks cater specially for these concealments on the part of Irish income taxpayers and investors for the reason that they have the use of that money at something like three and a half per cent., or at any rate a comparatively cheap rate, and they are able to secure from five to six per cent. return for it. Therefore from their point of view it is a traffic which should be encouraged, and the Irish investor should be encouraged to conceal his profits, if he can, by investing in English banks.  The traffic has gone on on these lines and the English bankers are deliberately encouraging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had that £10,000,000 here it would increase the whole basis of <Col N="796" /> Irish credit, make money very much cheaper, and a considerable number of people working at the present moment on accommodation from bankers would be very anxious to employ that capital in their own business and leave the money market freer to others who need it.  As well as that, there is this fact to be considered, that on the interest earned by that money invested in England the British Exchequer secures a certain amount of income tax, while the Irish Exchequer secures nothing.  Again, the Irish Exchequer, if the holder of such investment should die, secures nothing in respect of estate duty and legacy duty.  If the holder of shares representing a concealed investment in an English company wants to transfer these shares the Irish Exchequer gets no stamp duty on the transfer. Altogether I feel that while one is labouring under a handicap in that you should not condone a wrong, on the whole the balance of advantage would be in favour of the Revenue Commissioners granting such partial indemnity be to those people who made false disclosures as would induce them to make a full disclosure now and bring that capital back here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that last year&mdash;I will not say he gave us an undertaking; I do not want to put it so strongly&mdash; he led us to believe that in one definite particular there would be an alteration in the income tax provisions as laid down.  That was in relation to undistributed profits; that undistributed profits which were kept and used in a business in Ireland for the purpose of increasing the efficiency, production and employment in that business would no longer continue to be penalised in the way in which they are.  I am surprised that the Minister should have forgotten&mdash;I will put it in that way &mdash;that understanding.  Apparently no cognisance has been taken, and no provision whatever has been made for the doing of that very definitely desirable thing.  The Minister told us, in his opening statement, of the <Col N="797" /> absurdity of the income tax position. The Minister for Finance does not need to tell the ordinary taxpayer of this country the absurdity of the income tax position.  We all know it.  It is the remedy for it we want, and we want to know why he has spent his five, six or seven years of budgeting without trying to tackle some of it instead of making jokes about it here.  They are no jokes to the ordinary taxpayer, and he ought to have dealt with the question. He told us that in the last Budget while we have been scourged with whips we will now be scourged with scorpions.  I think the reaction of some of his scourging with scorpions will be on himself, and deservedly, and the sooner he stops it the better.  There has been let loose on the country, in the last five or six months, a series of scorpions, to use his own term, which most certainly is not making for the sweetening of the commercial position or of commerce in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had the position here in 1920 and 1921 where you were deliberately burning down income tax offices to prevent people paying their income tax to the British and you are now sending out your scorpions to get from the people&mdash;having burned the income tax offices to prevent their paying&mdash;that tax and imposing penalties in relation to it.  There seems to be some difficulty, the logical difficulty which is always present to the minds of those narrow logicians, that because they have exacted at a great cost to the commerce of this State, certain amounts of money under this head, they cannot stop any time in the damage that they are doing.  It was exactly the same argument which prevented Asquith stopping the executions in the middle when he knew they were wrong. What is every indemnity Act which exists but the setting of some place, some moment at which the State could say, &ldquo;those whom we have not got up to the present shall go free.&rdquo; Every Minister on that bench is under such an Act of Indemnity in relation to his life and their narrow little logic is that because they have penalised some they must go on disturbing <Col N="798" /> the commerce of this State until they drag out the last penny that they can discover even if in the process of attempting to discover it they keep hidden, for all time from the benefit of this country, infinitely larger sums than they do recover.  Is there any man in this House who knows anything about the actual conditions of affairs who would suggest that there is a sum of less than £150,000 outside this country due to income-tax?  I mean, is there any fool who would put that proposition? There is not a man in this House of any business knowledge, there is not an individual businessman who could not add up cases within his own cognisance, more than that amount.  The Minister has extracted £5,500,000 of pre-Treaty arrears of income tax.  He has added them in year by year and pretended that they were part of the revenue of this country for the purpose of pretending to balance his Budget. He has not put them against abnormal expenses.  If he did, there might be some sense in it but he has regarded them as ordinary revenue while he separated and segregated his expenses into normal and abnormal. He has taken this abnormal revenue and put it against what he called normal expenditure.  Now, he is down to £150,000&mdash;the largest amount he can now estimate is to be got from this source.  Is it worth while going on with it?</P>
    <P>I am looking at it now, not in any way from the point of view of an opponent of the Minister for Finance.  I want this money back into the country.  I want it used in the country, and the methods of the Minister for Finance in relation to his scorpions and that of his scorpions in relation to income tax arrears are keeping that money out of the country.  I know a business in this country which is employing 200 or 300 men.  That business would be bankrupt, down and out, and every single man it is employing unemployed, if it did in fact, pay to the Minister for Finance to balance his Exchequer in its bad years the arrears which year after year had <Col N="799" /> been put into that business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not like to put an estimate of £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 on this money, but I do know there is a very large amount and that there are a lot of people in this country who are only too anxious, if they can do it upon any reasonable terms, to get that money back out of its frozen deposit in England and make it function in business in this country.  The sooner the whips and scorpions and all those C.I.D. methods in relation to that money are withdrawn the better.  Let us try and get to some level now at which we will say, &ldquo;from this point you are clear.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you will bring forward and show us operative in any business in Ireland money of which we did not know up to the present we are not going to ask where you got it until you can get it functioning here.&rdquo; There is no logical or moral principle involved.  Certainly, there could be no logical and moral principle involved in an Act of Indemnity in a House which has passed an Act of Indemnity for every crime against God and man, and it is time, in the interests of the finance of the Minister for Finance himself, that this was done.  I do not want now to go into details as to the methods by which it could be done, but I am perfectly satisfied that if the Minister for Finance will now make an Act of Indemnity in relation to those matters he will, between now and July, get into his possession, voluntarily, far more money than he will ever get by the continuance of his C.I.D. system.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of little snags and details in the Income Tax scheme.  The Minister himself has told you some of the illogicalities that he, as Minister for Finance, has had to stand over in those years. It is time that these little details were got out of the way, but above all it is time that the main principles in relation to income tax finance which are obstructing the use of Irish money in Irish businesses should be taken away.  I hope that <Col N="800" /> when we come to discuss this Resolution a little more closely, on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance will recall himself to the state and condition of mind at which he was last year when he did envisage it as a wrong thing, economically, as a thing which was damaging to the commerce of this State, that men who were prepared to save and sacrifice and keep away from personal consumption all this revenue which they got for their business and turn it back into increasing the productivity and employment in that business should be punished as they now are punished by being asked to pay on that before they could possibly have any beneficial use of it for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the extraordinary steps that had to be taken last year in order to obtain the revenue that was required.  I think that the event has justified the taking of the extraordinary steps.  The only other thing to do at that time would have been to have made definite increases in taxation to a very much greater extent than we did.  We used extraordinary means of getting some revenue for the year, in the hope that at the end of the year the position would be better.  The position, one way and another, has become better, and the use of the extraordinary steps, such as the shortening of the brewers' credit, in my opinion, has been completely justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the question of unemployment.  I am quite clear on this, that the problem of unemployment is not going to be solved by increases in Government expenditure, that no attempt to meet the difficulty by giving extra employment in public works is going to get us anywhere.  I am very anxious, and other members of the Government are and have been anxious, to give employment on public works of a fully reproductive character.  One of the incentives to the undertaking of a big scheme such as the Shannon scheme was the fact that there would be immediate employment given.  But simply to spend more money on undertakings which <Col N="801" /> the Government might carry out does not do more than provide some temporary palliation, and if you carry expenditure of that sort to any excess, it perhaps delays the coming into being of conditions which will reduce unemployment to the minimum amount, which, I suppose, must always exist.  When we try to reduce or keep down the burden of taxation we are trying also to reduce unemployment by encouraging the development of private employment in the State.  The greater number of people who are employed are employed by private individuals, whether those private individuals are persons or joint stock liability companies.  Unless we face up to things in a way that I do not think the majority of the people of the country have any inclination to face up to them, we cannot contemplate having the great majority of people who are employed in the service of the State.  We cannot hope, therefore, to solve the problem of unemployment by having the State offer employment to those who happen to be unemployed.  We must try to encourage and develop industry in the best ways in which we can do so, so that through industries conducted by private enterprise employment would be given to absorb the labour of the State.  Deputy de Valera referred to the fact that millions of pounds worth of goods which could possibly be made here were still being imported, and that if they were stopped employment would be given to 60,000 people.  This is a question that would require more time to discuss than could be given to it at the present time.  It is certainly believed by many people, and I think rightly believed, that the putting on of tariffs in an unconsidered way, while it might give all the employment expected at some particular point, might quite readily cause as much unemployment at another point.  I certainly do not accept the view at all that our unemployment situation can be remedied by simply trying to prevent the importation of goods which could conceivably be made in the country.</P>
    <P>Two or three Deputies have referred <Col N="802" /> to the question of a preferential rate of income tax on incomes arising from investment or employment in Irish industry.  That is a thing that in my opinion can only be dealt with by the giving of relief. I think that if we were to try to differentiate by increasing the tax on income coming from outside, we would immediately increase the incentives to evasion and the incentives to the concealment of foreign incomes, and in consequence difficulties of a very acute kind would arise.  It is quite probable also that a number of people of smaller income living on investment and who do not gain anything substantial from the lower rate here might, when there is a discrimination against them in that way, leave the Saorstát and lose to the country the ownership of the money they possess, and lose to the country the benefit of the income which they derive.</P>
    <P>I think this is a thing which if it is to be done at all cannot be done by imposing burdens on income invested outside Irish industries; it would have to be given by way of relief.  If we give relief there are a great many difficulties. I do not think it will be politically practicable to confine the relief or the preference to money arising from investments in that way, I cannot see how that is to be done. It would have to be extended much more widely than that.  It would have to be extended to incomes from all investments except income arising from investments outside the country.  In certain cases it could be shown to be unjust to introduce at any rate any very substantial difference. Whether a small margin of discrimination, which I believe is all that would be really practicable, is going to bring about any changeover of investments, I do not know. It is a fact that people living here who have money to invest are extremely slow to invest it in any sort of Irish industry.  It is true that they will engage in what are practically gambling speculations in industrial stocks, the stocks of companies of foreign countries and they are quite ready to take their chance <Col N="803" /> of losing the money.  But even these will decline entirely to invest at all here or to take any risk.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the experience that has been gained from the working of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act does not show that there are many good propositions here which are not carried through for want of capital.  I think the experience that has been gained under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, if anything, would lead to the conclusion that the way to get money invested in Irish industries, and the way to overcome the difficulty which Deputies have in mind when they suggest a preferential tax, is really the method of the imposition of a customs tariff which has been adopted. If there is a customs tariff or something like that, it gives to industry, perhaps, a better and a surer chance of earning a profit.  Then the difficulty of obtaining capital will be fairly readily overcome.  Deputy de Valera thought that the tax on sugar might have been reduced again.  I think he, perhaps, during the year, would have better grounds for fearing that the tax on sugar might be increased, because we had for the balancing of last year's Budget to rely on a very substantial slice of income which is not obtainable in the present year, and it certainly was not an easy thing to be in the position of doing without that without adding definitely to taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that the policy of the Government had been too conservative and that money should be borrowed more freely.  I think there is only one object for which we might have borrowed that we have not borrowed, and that is housing.  If the position of the money market had not altered since the last issue of the National Loan I think that there is no doubt that before now we would have opened the Local Loans Fund for the giving of housing loans.  I quite accept the position that a Local Loans Fund must, at the very earliest suitable opportunity, be opened for the issuing of housing loans.  But the present time is a bad <Col N="804" /> time for substantial borrowings and some delay must take place.</P>
    <P>But if we open a Local Loans Fund for the giving of housing loans, the assistance of the kind that is at present given could not continue to be given at the present scale.  I do not know whether, in fact, more houses will be erected.  I think there is a very good movement for the erection of houses now, and if that will continue, only a comparatively little speeding up would be necessary. I do not want to follow Deputy MacEntee over his remarks with regard to the Minister for Justice, except that I do think that the remarks of the Minister for Justice, and the action that has been taken, would indicate that there is a very small conspiracy against the State which can be dealt with by moderate means.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of sums invested abroad, and some undisclosed fund of one sort or another, that is a matter about which various Deputies have spoken to me before now, and it is a matter which I am having investigated.  I do not anticipate that anything like the results Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches have just now suggested, or that other Deputies previously suggested to me, will ensue.  I have not been able to get information about that. Most people think that even if another opportunity such as was given in 1922 or 1923 were given now, so that people might make a clean breast of their affairs, practically nothing would follow, and that nearly all the people who have undisclosed profits would take their chances and hope that on some further occasion they might be given a further opportunity.  I have no doubt at all that the amount of money that is hidden abroad is small. There was nothing in any investigation that has taken place to indicate that there are such large sums. There are, perhaps, certain amounts, large for the individual concerned, but no investigation of the problem has so far indicated that there are very large sums from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The only argument with any great force that I ever heard in connection with the matter was used by Deputy Jasper Wolfe, who holds that people of quite different political views were not aware, owing to the disturbed conditions that existed, of the fact that an opportunity of making a clean breast was given in 1923. He held, also, that the comparatively small result then was really due to that and the preoccupation of people with other things, and it could not be taken as an indication of what would happen if another chance were given.  I admit it is a matter that merits a good deal of consideration. It would require examination of such facts as have come to light on investigation so far, so that we might get some idea of the magnitude of the problem.  I would like to say that, as regards the justice of the matter, what happened in 1919 and 1920 about the payment of income tax was not that anybody was urged to make a false return or to refuse to make returns.  What the people were urged to do was to delay and, finally, not to pay until the bailiffs were in or about to come in.  A project was discussed for paying income tax into the Treasury of Dáil Eireann and the setting up of some sort of an indemnity fund, but that broke down and the position remained that nobody was urged not to pay.  Finally, nobody was urged to do more than delay and nobody was given any hint that he or she should make a false return.  When people suggest that they withheld income tax for patriotic reasons, in my belief in the vast majority of cases they are telling something that is completely false.  As a matter of fact I mentioned before in the Dáil that at one time the Revenue Commissioners were contemplating the use of the special powers which they have to arrest an individual who was somewhat prominent politically, and who had always been a Unionist. Because of these things it was thought that some furore might have been caused about it.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners told me that he was going to do it and I told him to go ahead.  That particular <Col N="806" /> individual alleged that it was through patriotic motives and from a purely national point of view that he had declined to pay his tax.  I think people who were nationalist and who alleged that they withheld taxes for patriotic motives were, in most cases, not stating the real facts of the case.</P>
    <P>I do not remember exactly what discussion took place in regard to the taxes on undistributed profits. It is a matter that has been before me for a good while, and it is a matter on which I have requested the Revenue Commissioners to make certain investigations.  Any change of that sort, any remission of taxation, really involves a loss of revenue and must be left aside because there is not any surplus revenue available.  I have hopes that we will not only simplify the income tax code by degrees and bring it more into relation with the existing needs here, but that we might also develop a scheme of reliefs and allowances which would be suitable and beneficial.  But the simplification can only be done by degrees, and any reliefs or allowances which may be desirable can only be given when there is a surplus of revenue or when some general changes in taxation are being made which will make it equitable to give them. I do not think that it would be equitable to get the money for any income tax reliefs by say, an increase in the duty on tea and sugar. I believe that means throwing a substantial portion of the burden on to people who are very definitely poorer than those who would benefit.</P>
    <P>With regard to alterations within the system, I would not object to certain small increases being imposed on certain people for the purpose of giving allowances, but as far as I can see it is not very desirable to deal with children alone and leave the smallest range of earned income untouched because some of those who have that very small earned income, if they have not children may have other dependents. I think any rise, particularly <Col N="807" /> in the classes of earned income, would be really undesirable, and it would be better to let the matter stand as it is for the present.  The only result of the examination that has taken place is that there has been worked out a scheme which would enable what would be appreciable reliefs to the poor taxpayers to be given at the very minimum of cost to the Exchequer.  If that minimum amount were available for remission of taxation, then we could go ahead with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put a point to the Minister in relation to undistributed profits.  He speaks of them as revenue which would be lost.  I want him to ask himself whether it is revenue in the sense in which he envisages revenue.  To me it seems to be not revenue but extraction, even worse than extraction, of the seed of production.  I am keeping to the point of undistributed profits, that is, profits put back into business for the purpose of development. If you take that seed for taxation you really give back nothing for development.  I am asking the Minister to change his point of view in relation to taxation.  There are certain things in the taking of which you not merely destroy the substance but you destroy the possibility of the whole product of that substance as seed.  I suggest that in turning his back, as apparently he has as between last year and now, on this question of exemption of undistributed profits he is turning his back on what was a very fertile suggestion coming from himself.  We are not trying to press this in any party sense or as one man against another.  The Minister should change his idea of what taxation is and ought not to take as taxation or use as the food for his Government what are equivalent to the seed potatoes of national industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that he is putting his point of view over-strongly, because the whole of the amount of undistributed profits is not taken.  It is only 3/- in the £. It seems to me that while there are <Col N="808" /> very good arguments in favour of encouraging people by remission of taxes to keep money in the business which they are carrying on and to extend that business and better equip it, nevertheless the profit actually earned, no matter what it is intended to do with it, can be reasonably taxed and I do not think it is fair to say that it is exaction to tax such profits. It seems to me to become merely a question of expediency whether it is a good thing, whether it is likely to be a fruitful thing, to remit taxation on a particular portion of income. Then we have to consider, if we suffer a direct exchequer loss by remitting that, how we are to make it up.  As I have said, if substantial taxation changes are being made in the year it may prove possible, and it is likely to be easy enough, to work in a certain number of minor reliefs of a desirable character, but I do not think that it would be justifiable at the present stage to give a relief to income taxpayers and to get the money which that relief would cost by some method of direct taxation which would fall on poor people.</P>

That has been suggested several times here, and has often deen discussed, but the view&mdash; and I think it is the view of expert people&mdash;is that the assembly of motor cars, unless we were to raise the duty, would not be taken up in consequence of the remission of duty on parts.  In order to prevent simply nominal employment being given, and a great deal of revenue being lost, there would have to be some sort of very strict definition as to <Col N="810" /> what is a separate part.  If we did not do that we would have many claims for the remission of duty on entire vehicles which might be in such a condition that they could be put together with a comparatively small amount of labour.

    <P>For the purposes of this Schedule the seating capacity of a vehicle does not include the seat or space occupied by the driver of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>This is the Resolution imposing the additional duty on buses.  I mentioned in my statement to-day why it was some time ago contemplated that the increased charge on motor buses should be imposed by means of a mileage tax.  If that had been persisted in, each vehicle would have had to have a fixed time-table.  The driver would have had to carry a log book showing the journeys that were being made by the car.  He would have had to affix and cancel in the proper place on the log book the appropriate stamp in respect of every journey.  The tax was suggested in that form not merely for the purpose of getting additional revenue for the Road Fund, which was the main purpose, but also because it was thought that it might be the basis of a system of better supervision of the whole bus traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> However, the owners of the motor buses have made representations against the weight of the proposed tax.  They suggested that a bus might travel nearly 1,200 miles a week, and might travel 50 weeks in the year.  That seemed a bit high&mdash; to be higher than any information at the disposal of the Government would lead us to believe.  If the bus owners' figures are correct undoubtedly the increase in the burden that would fall on them would be very sharp indeed.  Not being able to arrive at any certainty in my own mind as to the real facts of the case I came to the conclusion that it would not be reasonable, pending the obtaining of better information, to put on the tax at the rate that had been proposed.  It became a difficult question to put it on at, say, half the rate, but it was thought that the half rate would give much less revenue than had been anticipated, and it was not desirable to initiate a new scheme having regard to the trouble it would mean to the bus owners and the administration expenses which would be involved.  In consequence, pending the obtaining of further, surer information, I have fallen back on the idea of simply increasing the amount of the existing scale by 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, buses have paid something like 4.6 per cent. of the revenue of the Road Fund.  It is very difficult to form a conclusion as to what would be a fair contribution but I feel certain that 4.6 per cent. or 5 per cent. is far too little. The bus owners were hardly out to admit that they ought to pay more but the impression I certainly gathered from them, in my interview with the deputation, was that they recognised that they ought to pay something more.  The tax at the new rate will work out at something like £5 per seat.  Of course, it will not just be that in every case but in general they will pay something like £5 per seat.  If we look, at for instance, the Dublin Tramways and take into account the rates on their line, the way-leave and the maintenance of the roads&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was leaving that out of account.  I was thinking of the road charges, the rates on roads, the payments to the Corporation for way-leave and the maintenance of the roads because the roads for 18 inches on each side of the line have to be maintained by the Tramway Company. The cost seems to work out at somewhere about £8 per seat per tram.  The Tramway has a local monopoly but, of course, it is not so much a monopoly now having regard to the fact that the bus competition covers the whole line.  It seems to me, taking that sort of basis, that an average of £5 a seat is not too much. Again looking at the weight of one of these buses and at the speed at which it travels, having regard to the fact that the road has to be made and maintained at a particular standard largely for the buses, a bus containing 20 seats or thereabouts is not paying too much at all when it pays £100 per year for the use of the roads for making profit, as its contribution towards the maintenance of the roads.  I think this new scheme may not be the final scheme that will be adopted.  It may not be quite as high as we should ever go.  It may not be levied along the right lines; a mileage tax or something else might be better but I do think at any rate it is not too high and that the increase should be made.  While admitting that the roads' position is somewhat difficult to size up, we are satisfied that the roads cannot be maintained at the standard at which they should be maintained especially having regard to the increased number of vehicles, with the present revenue of the Road Fund.  This increase in tax will not go very far but it will go some distance.</P>

      <P>It is not our intention to come to any decision on this Resolution now although we are anxious to get additional information that would help us to make up our mind as to the attitude we ought to adopt on this Resolution when it comes up finally on the Report Stage.  It seems to us that the Minister <Col N="816" /> for Finance ought to have given us more information than he has.  In fact, he went to much greater pains to show why he did not adopt the mileage tax than to explain why the particular form of tax proposed in this Resolution was decided upon. We are all anxious to ensure that motor omnibuses should pay a fair contribution towards road maintenance, certainly a contribution that would be proportionate to the amount of damage to the roads for which they are actually responsible. The Minister, however, has not attempted to give us any estimate as to the proportion of damage attributable to the omnibuses.  There has been, however, somewhat considerable discussion on the matter in the Press and elsewhere within the past few months, and competent engineers and others have given widely divergent estimates in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has informed us that the increase of 150 per cent. proposed in the bus tax will result in omnibuses generally contributing about ten per cent. of the income of the Road Fund.  Is the Minister satisfied that omnibuses do ten per cent. of the damage to the roads each year, or is he satisfied that they do more than that?  I think that we should get some statement from some of the competent engineers who are at the disposal of the Minister in the matter for the information of the Dáil before this Resolution comes forward for its final passing or rejection on the Report Stage.  If he gives us an estimate he should go fairly deeply into the matter and let us have information as to what the estimate is based upon.  This whole matter of the cost of the roads and the damage which particular classes of vehicles do to them is one on which everybody appears to be very largely ignorant, and when we are faced with a proposal to increase by 150 per cent. the tax on one form of vehicle we imagine that the Government should be prepared to put their views on the matter before us.  That has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the Minister, in his statement, <Col N="817" /> occupied the greater portion of the time in telling us why he did not accept certain proposals which were suggested to him, and a very brief portion of the time telling us why he did accept the particular proposals embodied in the Resolutions. If he had given us a similar array of figures and arguments relating to this proposal as he produced in relation to the proposal which he did not put forward, then we would be much clearer in our minds concerning it.  The Minister for Local Government may be able to give us some information on the matter which we would like to have.  I think the last figures available concerning the receipts from motor licence duty applied to the year 1926.  They were published in the report of his Department issued this year.  In these returns the amounts received in licence duty from omnibuses are grouped with the amounts received from hackneys of all kinds, and as they appear here they are not 4.6 per cent. of the total receipts from licence duty, but 19.92 per cent.  I should like to be informed if that position has altered in any way during the last two years.  In the last statement issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce it was mentioned that there were 140 companies or proprietors operating omnibuses in the Twenty-six Counties, and that number represents a fairly substantial increase over 1926. If, therefore, hackneys, in which are included buses and taxi-cabs, in what proportion I do not know, contributed in 1926 £113,000, or 19.9 per cent., of the Road Fund, it is reasonable to assume that they, in fact, contributed a much larger sum in 1928.  Whether that larger sum represents a greater proportion of the total receipts or not, I do not know. Perhaps the Minister for Local Government, who represents the Department concerned, will be able to give us some information on the matter. Certainly we think that some effort should be made to clarify the position in relation to the Road Fund between to-day and the date on which this Resolution will come up on Report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> As one who has no special knowledge on the matter, and does not claim to have any special knowledge, I have been considerably confused by all the conflicting statements and estimates which have appeared in the Press from persons about whose qualifications to speak there can be no doubt.  There are experts on both sides and one of them contradicts the other.  The Minister has experts at his disposal who, whatever else may be said about them, cannot be alleged to have any particular axe to grind, and we should like to get their estimate as to the value of the damage done to the roads in each year and the proportion of that which is attributable to omnibuses; if the present income of the Road Fund is sufficient to compensate for the damage done, and what particular class of vehicle contributing that income is doing damage out of proportion to the amount contributed. Do commercial vans and other forms of commercial cars contribute to the Road Fund an amount equal to the damage they do?  Do private motor cars contribute too much?  I think we should get a statement as to the Road Fund and as to the roads position generally from the Minister before the Resolution comes up on Report, if for no other reason than to help Deputies to make up their minds as to how they will act in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Deputy Lemass upon the very cautious attitude he is adopting in regard to this proposal.  There does not appear to be very much difference between the attitude of the Minister, as disclosed in the Resolution, and the querying attitude adopted by Deputy Lemass.  It is very difficult, I agree, to understand the quibbling and changing attitude of the Ministry.  I have here before me a report of a speech made in Mallow on 9th December, 1928, in which the Minister for Finance in referring to this matter stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government, not, let me say in <Col N="819" /> the interest of the small towns, but for other reasons, to oblige the buses to contribute more substantially to the cost of road maintenance in the country.  It may surprise delegates here to know that buses and charabanes contribute only 4.6 of the total road tax that is paid.  The buses actually pay less than five per cent. towards the Central Fund that is available for road maintenance and improvement, and I think that nobody here can say that they do not do a great deal more than five per cent. of the damage caused to the roads.  The amount, as a matter of fact, that is paid disproportionately represents bus owners' liability.</P>
    <P>In that speech the Minister went on to indicate that it was the intention of the Government, in putting into operation the new tax which he thus announced on behalf of the Government, to increase the revenue to the Road Fund by about £100,000. To-day we hear the Minister using language that would go to show that the speech which he made at that time was not really a speech outlining the intentions of the Government. I have heard it stated, and there appear to be good grounds for it&mdash;in fact I have heard it boasted of by some bus owners, or those who represent their Association&mdash;that the North Dublin election result had a great bearing on the alteration in the policy of the Government in regard to motor buses. The Minister for Local Government, who represents North Dublin, may be able to confirm or contradict that statement.  At any rate, there is a certain change in the announced attitude of the Minister between the speech that he made at Mallow and the proposal which he makes in this Resolution.  I consider that motor bus taxation, or the taxation that is imposed by the Government upon motor users, should have some relation to the use or abuse of the roads by these people.  Under present-day conditions, as far as I can see, bus <Col N="820" /> owners mostly make use of what is known as trunk or link roads.  As far as I can discover, the local ratepayers have to pay, roughly, 2s. 8d. in the £ for road maintenance all over the State.  The contribution out of the Road Fund to the maintenance cost of trunk roads represents 50 per cent., and for link roads 33? per cent.  The question is whether ratepayers should be asked to continue to pay 50 per cent. or less for road maintenance, especially as far as trunk roads are concerned.</P>
    <P>If you compare the use or the freedom given to the user of the trunk roads to-day with the freedom he received on the trunk roads and the link roads ten or fifteen years ago, you will find that there is really no comparison. There is no comparison from the point of view of the danger to the average farmer who drives his cattle or his horse along the roads compared with the danger that exists on those roads in present-day circumstances. Remember the increase in the amount of the Road Fund will, as a result of the new proposals, only increase the Road Fund during the coming financial year by a sum of £45,000.  What is £45,000 spread over twenty-seven administrative counties?  What does that mean to the average ratepayer who complains that the cost of maintenance of those roads is excessive?  The Minister for Local Government knows very well that in the county of Leix he issued an order holding up the payment of the Road Fund grant to that county because, in his opinion, or in the opinion of his advisers, the local ratepayers were not finding a sufficiently large amount out of the local rates for the maintenance and construction of roads in that county.  By issuing that order he forced the county council to summon a special meeting to increase by a great amount the sum already provided at the ordinary roads meeting where the estimates for road service were framed for the current or coming financial year.  Is the Minister going to satisfy the wishes of the local ratepayers in <Col N="821" /> that county by the announcement that his contribution for the greater cost of road maintenance, both trunk roads and link roads, in the coming financial year will only amount to £1,000 or £1,700 over and above the sum given last year?</P>
    <P>The Government or the Ministry have not given any serious consideration to the question of the cost of the maintenance and the relationship between the charges that should be made on those who use the roads so far as motors are concerned, and the use ordinarily made of these roads by farmers and other road users.</P>
    <P>Personally I hold the view that the responsibility for the maintenance of the trunk roads and the link roads&mdash; the main roads in the country&mdash; should be taken out of the hands of the local authority and should be taken over by the Local Government Department.  Anybody who has had any contact with the Local Government Department in regard to the question of road administration or road maintenance must realise that the real and direct control over road maintenance is in the hands of the Local Government Ministry and I would very much prefer to see control taken out of the hands of the local authorities and handed over to the Ministry and let them be responsible for the maintenance of the roads and for the construction of the roads in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us that &ldquo;if the State assumed responsibility for the roads, higher standards and greater costs would ensure.&rdquo;  It may be that higher standards would ensue but I have great doubts that the cost would be greater on the farmers or the person who pays motor taxation.  If the responsibility for the road maintenance or construction as the case may be was in the hands of the Department for Local Government, you would have a state of affairs existing in the country so far as the roads are concerned which does not exist to-day. To-day you have one county setting up a very high standard of road maintenance, whereas you have another immediately adjoining with <Col N="822" /> a very low standard.  That is reflected in the decision of the Minister himself and which he announced to the local authorities in the present year.</P>
    <P>In October last he sent out a circular asking the local authorities to give information as to the amount they were prepared to provide for road maintenance purposes, and up to a short time ago he only got thirteen replies from the twenty-seven administrative counties.  I understand he stopped the grant in many counties as the result of the failure of the local authorities to provide sums out of the rates up to the standard of what was thought necessary for these local authorities to do.  That shows that you have a varying standard all over the State. If a central department was responsible for road maintenance, you would have the same standard of road maintenance all over the State for the same type of road.  That would mean a continuity of employment for a minimum number of road workers all over the area rather than the casual employment that there is in most counties to-day. And what is much more important to the taxpayer as well as to the ratepayer is that you would have a far better return for the money expended on road construction and road maintenance all over the State. You see road plant lying idle in some counties for nine out of the twelve months of the year, and in others for six out of the twelve months, whereas if you had a central authority, as I suggest, that plant could be used throughout the year to far greater advantage in any county or on any road where required rather than casually used, as the road plant is at the present time. The amount of money that would have to be expended by a Central Department that would have control of road maintenance in these circumstances on the purchase of plant would be gradually reduced.  Therefore, I say, in the long run, both from the point of view of giving employment and of giving value for the money spent, the central authority is the proper authority to be in <Col N="823" /> charge of road maintenance and construction work.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the Minister for Finance.  He rather surprised me in the statement he made in regard to motor bus taxation.  Talking of the figures upon which he arrived at the decision contained in this proposal he said: &ldquo;Their figures&rdquo;&mdash; referring to the bus owners' figures &mdash;&ldquo;with regard to the actual mileage travelled by individual buses are not in accord with the figures upon which I relied.  If the bus owners' figures are accurate I am satisfied that the mileage tax originally proposed would be too heavy.&rdquo;  Personally I agree that the mileage tax was a very foolish proposal because the cost of collection and checking would altogether outweigh the amount derived from it.  Without suggesting that every bus conductor is dishonest you would have to have a fairly decent number of governmental inspectors&mdash; to watch the bus conductors so far as the keeping of the suggested log book would be concerned.  That will be avoided in the methods proposed by the Minister now but what I want to know is this: does the Minister accept or doubt in any way the figures on which he is supposed to rely.  These are the figures circulated to Deputies by the Department of Industry and Commerce giving particulars of road mileage and the revenue per month or three months as the case may be.  And these returns which are circulated by the Department of Industry and Commerce, as far as I am aware, are supplied to that Government Department by the bus owners themselves. Therefore, why does the Minister accept the figures put before him by the deputation which waited on him previous to the North Dublin election result and admit that the figures given to him for this particular purpose at that particular period are different from the figures ordinarily supplied by the bus owners to the Department of Industry and Commerce. There must be something radically wrong or the Minister must have taken a very hasty decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> At any rate, looking over his speech on this particular matter, there seems to be some reason which he has not given to the House for taking this quibbling decision with regard to the method of taxation of motor buses.  He states also &ldquo;without coming for the present to a final conclusion as to whether or not buses should be taxed on a mileage basis, or what rate would be fair if a mileage tax were determined on, I have decided not to submit to the Dáil the proposals which I mentioned last December.&rdquo;  I have read from the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; report&mdash;I daresay that report was supplied the night before the speech was made&mdash;the Minister's own language where he stated &ldquo;it is the intention of the Government to introduce and to put into operation this new tax so far as buses are concerned.&rdquo;  What was the intention of the Government on the 9th December last at Mallow is certainly not contained in the proposal before the House in Resolution No. 4, and I suspect&mdash;I cannot prove it, of course&mdash;that the threat to hold a big demonstration, starting from St. Stephen's Green, a day or two before the voting took place in the North City by-election, had some effect in changing the attitude of the Minister and of the Government.  I am sorry Deputy Murphy is not here, but I hope if that is so that the railway directors, or those who represent the railway companies in this House, will take a leaf out of the book of the motor bus owners, because if threats of that kind during a general election, or in or around by-elections, have the effect of changing a Minister's mind in the way his mind has been changed in this matter, then it would be a good thing for the railway companies to adopt the same attitude and tactics which have been adopted with success by the Motor Bus Owners' Association.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole question of motor buses, I do not want to be charged with prejudice or bigotry so far as the motor bus people are concerned. I believe there is room in this country for motor bus traffic, but I believe that if the motor bus <Col N="825" /> owners want the roads of this country to be put into such a condition that they will be able to use them in the way in which they are using them in certain places at the present time, they should pay their own fair and proper proportion of the road maintenance cost of the roads which they use and abuse.  The railway companies, the people who subscribe the capital&mdash;it is all paid-up capital in the case of railway companies but not in the case of bus owners&mdash;have to pay for the construction of their permanent way.  But the bus owners are in the fortunate position of having roads constructed for them out of moneys provided by the ratepayers and the taxpayers in this country.  I think they should not grumble at being called upon to pay a proper tax for the maintenance of those roads which they use so freely and abuse much more than the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance, in addition to the information asked for by Deputy Lemass, when he is making inquiries and looking for the relative figures, ask for the nominal capital of all the motor bus companies of this country as compared with the paid-up capital, I wonder would be inquire from the Revenue Department what proportion of this nominal or paid-up capital is controlled by people outside the country.  I make that point because the capital invested in the railways, which give far greater and better employment, is capital which has been all paid-up by Irish investors. I paid 5/- to the revenue people to have a look at the list of the shareholders of a certain bus company and I discovered&mdash;I dare say this applies in other cases&mdash;that the dominating financial influence in this particular bus company was a motor building firm in Sale, in Cheshire. They send the buses of this particular bus company, on the deferred payment system, over here at £75 per bus per time and they have also their share of the profit of that company. They supply buses which are hired for traffic on the roads of this country.  Therefore, I think, it is <Col N="826" /> the duty of the Government to get at figures which will enable them to say to what extent the bus companies of this country are controlled by financial influences outside the country.</P>
    <P>From the purely labour point of view, I think there is a case for fair play for the railways as against the buses.  When the forced amalgamation of the railways came into operation in January, 1925, the only railway company practically that operates in the Free State employed about 18,000 men.  Partly as a result of the amalgamation policy, but much more so as a result of this unfair road competition, the number of men employed has been reduced by about 4,000.  Are there 4,000 new men employed by the bus companies operating in the Free State?  If there are 4,000&mdash;I know there certainly are not&mdash;are they paid the same and working under the same conditions as those who were lucky enough to remain in the service of the railway companies?  I certainly say not.  You have one bus company&mdash;looking through the hours and conditions of service here some time ago; it was properly called the Pirate Bus Company&mdash;paying conductors £1 a week for 76 hours.</P>

But you have bus companies all over the State paying their conductors from £1 to £2 compared with £2 10s. to £3 10s., the average wage of railway guards and ticket examiners which are the comparative positions. The maximum wage paid to bus drivers is £3 10s. compared with about £5 per week for railwaymen.</P>

As far as I can see, the bus people pay nobody <Col N="827" /> for the regulation of the bus traffic. The taxpayers, as far as I can find out, are paying the Civic Guard for the regulation of this traffic while the railway companies are employing signal men to direct their traffic over the rails.  I hope the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, when they are looking for figures, will find out the nominal capital and the paid-up capital of the bus companies operating in the Free State, and they should have some bearing upon the treatment to be meted out to these people.  I hope the Ministry some day before they go out of office will sit down and give serious consideration&mdash;that consideration which they have not so far given&mdash;to the whole question of motor buses and the taxation that should be borne relatively by them and by the farmer ratepayer who uses the road for his cattle and sheep and his horse and cart.</P>

      <P>Interesting as Deputy Davin's speech was, I rather incline to the belief that it was a little distant from the subject we are considering. The point I would like to lay stress on is the incidence of the taxation proposed in this motion. I have drawn attention in this House, on previous occasions, to the want of a limitation on the size of the buses, charabancs and motor lorries.  Those of us who occasionally use the by-roads in some of the interesting places in our country <Col N="828" /> are horrified to meet these huge charabancs in some cases, and huge motor lorries in other cases, coming along these narrow roads.  When they are coming in the opposite direction it invariably means a stoppage on the part of both parties and a conversation and a consideration as to how they are going to pass one another.  That is a matter to which I have drawn the attention of the Minister in the past.  What will be the effect of this motion as we have it here before us?  The bus which only accommodates 12 passengers and which, in the view of most Deputies, will be a normal bus and more or less of a character that we ought to encourage, is going to pay a tax of practically £6 per seat.  Turn to the bus of the character I have mentioned, which carries 32 passengers. It is only taxed to the extent of £5 a seat.  In other words, the incidence of this taxation is in favour of the larger bus and will encourage the larger bus, to the detriment of the smaller one.  That, to my mind, ought not to be.  I would like to see the moderate-sized bus paying at a reduced rate, and tax out of existence, if you like, the larger bus, which, to my mind, in view of the size of our roads, should be debarred. That is only one aspect of this bus problem, but it is an aspect that is directly affected by the incidence of the taxation proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Davin when he says that the control of buses is a bit wide in this motion.  I think, generally speaking, buses need a much larger degree of control than they seem to be under at the moment. Not alone are they a danger to the passengers, but they are an absolute danger to the other road users.  One would like to see a larger measure of control over that particular form of traffic than there is at the moment. I would also like to see more inspection, as to the suitability and the running of these buses generally. We know that in other countries they are subject to a much greater degree of inspection than in this country, and that has a connection with this actual motion which we have here, because we all know what <Col N="829" /> these large buses are like.  They are growing larger every day. I saw one the other day in which people were supposed to sleep.  I do not know whether they could sleep in it, but they were supposed to sleep in it; it was a bus of fairly considerable dimensions.  If there is not proper inspection of buses of that size, and one of them happens to break down, as is not unusual with buses in this country on one of these narrow roads, the whole traffic on that road will be obstructed.  For that reason I would like to urge, first of all, that this whole system of buses and charabancs, and to some extent the motor lorries, should be under more rigid control than they are at the moment, and that there should be some limitation placed on the size of these vehicles.  Further, the whole question of the method of taxation should be more thoroughly inquired into than obviously it was before this motion was put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel really that I have no grievance whatever this particular day at having been present in the Dáil for I have shared, with other members of the Dáil, the extraordinary privilege and experience of hearing Deputy Davin in the role Rhadamantus.  Judge Rhadamantus was to all, a just judge.  The House, which for half an hour listened to that careful, judicial, well-weighed and carefully measured summing up of the merits of this question by Deputy Davin, could not possibly have suspected upon which side eventually he would come down in his decision.  That splendid and masterly summing up, that remarkable impartiality and discretion with which he martialled the arguments for the bus owners and for their use of the roads, and the careful way in which he distinguished the rights of the various interests and the relation of these various interests to the benefit of the community, was really a model of judicial impartiality and judgment.  If, for one single moment, he marred the perfect picture&mdash;I admit that this is hypercriticism, having regard to the extraordinary merits of the performance to which <Col N="830" /> we listened, and seemed to throw away the ermine of the judge and take upon himself the red tie of the partisan&mdash;it was when he made, in the face of this House, the outrageous suggestion that this Government, in relation to measures which it introduces into this House, can be influenced by a by-election.  Scandalous! I am quite sure that Deputy Davin will be glad, through me, to take the opportunity of withdrawing such a suggestion, and, above all, in relation to North Dublin.  I allude to North Dublin, because it was alluded to by Deputy Davin; which for two successive by-elections was the most remarkable example of self-restraint and abnegation of this Government in not introducing issues of that kind for mere party purposes.</P>
      <P>Now that having been said, and Deputy Davin's apology to the Government for such a suggestion having been so acceptably made, I will come as near to the subject as Deputy Davin did occasionally. First, I would like to say a word about Deputy Good.  You saw the picture yourself, the horrified expression on Deputy Good's face, that he told us expressed his feelings when on one of those by-roads he met one of those buses.  If you want a companion picture to that I would suggest to you that you should see the faces of the ordinary people who were using that bus when they saw Deputy Good passing in his car.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Flinn will now see the Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that, because the grievance which the ordinary user of the roads at the present moment has against the buses in the particular matter which Deputy Good has raised is that, momentarily, it interferes with his abuse of the road and with his abuse of the conveniences of the ordinary passenger.  I was coming up to-day, and on parts of the road between Carlow and Kilkenny I was ashamed of the interference which I was making with the <Col N="831" /> comfort of the ordinary road user, and I was only a very moderate road hog.  I was ashamed of the interference which I was making with the ordinary amenities of the roads due to the dust that was thrown up by my car and that was obscuring the vision and, I am afraid, endangering the use of the roads in the case of the ordinary pedestrian.  If I might take upon myself for a moment the role of Deputy Davin.  I would like to examine this question somewhat impartially.  The first thing you have to face is that these buses are doing a definite service to the community. The fact that they have carried something like 20,000,000 people, that they have created that traffic and that they have brought that transport and transit to the doors of the people; that they have opened up whole districts from the point of view of the habitability of those districts by the ordinary people, has undoubtedly entitled that whole system to be taken out of the position in which certain people are trying to put it, a sort of pariah service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a service to the community, and we have to accept that as a fact; in exactly the same way we have to accept the fact that the railways are a service to the community, and we have, therefore, to accept that these two things together, and in some form of ordered co-operation, must be allowed to continue to exist and be developed in this country. The sooner you get out of the idea that this House, or any other place, is to be used for railway versus bus polemics, the sooner we will get a solution and the nearer we will get towards the solution of this question on ordinary lines.  The taxation of buses, cars or anything of that kind is taxation upon transit, and that, broadly speaking, is undesirable.  To obtain a revenue from the means by which people and goods are moved from one place to another is, broadly speaking, undesirable.  To obtain taxation from that portion of transport which is used in the transport of goods from the place where they are produced to the place in which <Col N="832" /> they are consumed, is radically undesirable, because it is a taxation of portion of the process of production. Taxation of vehicles which move people in their ordinary business is, in the same way, radically and intrinsically wrong if taxation of production during the process of production is wrong; and that is generally regarded as undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about taxation for selling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later on.  That is simply a question of whether you should or should not tax distribution.  Anyone who effectively distributes is a producer, and the extent to which you get revenue by the mere taxation of effective distribution, to that extent you tax production, and to that extent it is undesirable. Compare, for a moment, the car, the bus and the heavy solid-tyred lorry.  You want money from each of these.  You can conceivably take money from each of these under three heads.  (1) for the replacement of the damage they do; (2) for the capital cost of the road they use, and (3) for taxation as a contribution to the State.  If you take the ordinary light car, the amount which you can take for replacement is very small.  I am perfectly satisfied that on a good road the average light car is actually a benefit to that road. I mean that the actual amount which you would charge to that car merely for damage, to a light car properly driven, would be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are entitled to charge for light vehicles a heavy sum for capital costs because we have to provide, for the convenience and amenity of those who use light vehicles for pleasure, roads of a high quality and at a high cost.  Thereafter, what tax you take from a light vehicle which is used for pleasure is not a question of principle at all.  It is a question of convenience and policy.  As far as the light car is concerned you take very light replacement value.  You can take a very considerable capital value depending on the quality of the roads you provide and you can <Col N="833" /> take from the owner of that car any taxation whatever that you think will be electorally suitable.  If you take the position of the bus you will see that in that case the position is reversed.  In the first place the replacement cost is very high.  Any of us who have had experience of an actual road before and after buses being put on that road can tell the difference.  You can pick out a particular pot-hole and say the I.O.C. or the Contemptible or other buses have been on the road.  The damage to the road visibly grows.  The damage is there and can be seen. You have replacement cost and heavy capital costs.  You have to build a heavy road to stand the impact and especially the impact on the sub-structure of that road over which rapidly-driven heavy vehicles pass.</P>
    <P>But when it comes to the taking of taxation from it, merely on the taking of taxation you are taxing purely and simply the transport which affected that twenty million people in this country, and the fact that twenty million people in this country have reacted to it proves that it is an ordinary necessity of life.  In replacement for the buses and under capital you charge a heavy figure, but under taxation you charge practically nil.  Now we turn to the heavy lorry, that juggernaut of the road, that brute, and there is no word you could use too strong from the civic point of view in relation to the iron-shod lorry or its twin brother the badly-worn, solid-tyred lorry.  The damage which that does is extraordinary. You have only got to make some of the very simple tests that many years ago we made.  You do not need to go into elaborations which have since been introduced, rubber blocks, springs, seismometers, and so on.  The damage which is done by heavy lorries on a road once the road begins to break at all increases geometrically, and if this State is going to put large capital costs into these roads it is bound to see, broadly speaking, that that kind of tyre is not used for anything in the nature of rapid transit on the roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> It is not a question of charging them that cost.  No cost that you can put upon those things at which it would be commercially possible for them to continue to run, will repay the damage they will do&mdash;the cumulative and increasing damage.</P>
    <P>As regards capital cost, you can impose a heavy cost on unsprung or badly sprung vehicles of that kind, but from the point of view of getting taxation from them, they will be carrying the crudest of things and the suggestion that you should obtain revenue for the State from that section of transport is, in any opinion, absurd.  If it could be understood that every user of the road must replace the damage he does, that that is simply replacement and restitution and is not taxation at all, and that we should keep taxation off transport which was not purely transport for pleasure, but which was transport of goods or people for the purposes of their ordinary avocations, then we would be able to get some light.</P>
    <P>The next question touches the actual amount of damage done.  Up to the present, I have not heard the slightest suggestion from anybody representing the Government that there has been investigation along those lines.  On what basis was the famous penny a mile put up?  It may have been a guess or it may have some sound basis.  I hope it has, and it will be to the credit of the Minister if he will produce such a sound basis.  If he has not got some actual test or some good basis upon which to found that penny, if he has not some figures which will enable him to formulate a policy along the lines of replacement and restitution, it is simply fooling with the game to talk about this taxation. It is all pure guesswork unless there are definite figures there.  The tax suggested here is in inverse proportion to the profitable use of the vehicle.  You can reverse that and say that it is inversely in proportion to the use of the road by the vehicle. It makes no attempt to be proportionate in any way.  The rate varies from a minimum of £5 to a maximum of £10&mdash;that is, on a vehicle <Col N="835" /> regularly used.  It would seem that the less a man's profit out of the vehicle, the bigger the charge is going to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said one thing with which I rather agree.  He said that to a certain extent there should be more discrimination in relation to handing over the charge of national or main roads to the general community. I mean that the proportion of the maintenance of those roads which are paid for out of the Central Fund should increase.  Take the case of a man coming in a car from Cork to Dublin.  He comes along one of those roads because it is a well-maintained road.  People from outside counties will, in the normal way, use such roads.  The more those roads differ in quality from the ordinary country road, the more such a road will be nationally used as distinct from a locally used road.  To that extent there should be a higher proportion paid for maintenance from the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat my appeal that this question be not regarded&mdash;unfortunately it has been so regarded&mdash;as pure polemics between two interests.  I bought railway shares for no other reason than that I read a speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Cork which satisfied me that there was a pro-railway ramp on.  Immediately after that we found two things happening. First of all, the railways were relieved of £75,000 a year in rates.  Then the Minister for Local Government would not allow any of the district councils to appeal against an apparently illegal bargain. There was behind the doors an arrangement which was not contemplated by the law.  All that was directly after that speech.  I am not attacking the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was the best speech I ever heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Reading through it I said there was <Col N="836" /> only one meaning of that speech&mdash;&ldquo;Buy Great Southern and buy them at once.&rdquo;  On top of that you had the Minister for Finance saying at Mallow: &ldquo;We will put another £100,000 a year on to the buses in order to drive the people back to the railways.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin said that roads were variously maintained and there were various standards.  Surely the lowest of all the standards is the maintenance of the roads by the railways. The next time Deputy Good goes out to horrify the buses he will agree with me that he can close his eyes and tell when he is passing over that portion of the road which is maintained by the railways.  They simply seem to do the minimum amount of work.  This is a national problem. It is a problem which should not be made controversial.  There has to be co-operation, and the principles of that co-operation have to be worked out by engineers who will examine the amount of damage that is being done by particular vehicles.  They will find out the advantages of a particular vehicle in relation to the traffic of this country.  There will be expressed in the taxation of that vehicle something which will represent the amount of damage done to the roads.  There should be co-ordination amongst the two essential and necessary systems&mdash;bus and railway traffic.  The information which will be got by examining the relationship of those different kinds of vehicles to the different kinds of traffic in this country will have an important bearing on the future of transport in this country.</P>

      <P>Most of the speakers to the Resolution emphasised the fact that a certain part of our roads problem must be taken as a national problem and that more or less the financing of the road system, and, perhaps, its administration, must be centralised.  Whether you change the system by actually administering road work by the county councils as at present or not, the fact is that to a large extent there is a national financing of our road system.  The grants for maintenance alone, as compared with the whole expenditure on roads of all kinds in the country for the current year, is one-quarter of the whole expenditure. A similar amount will come from the Road Fund for the general improvement of roads, so that there is a very considerable national shouldering of the financing of the road problem at present.  I agree with certain Deputies that to a greater extent, perhaps to a varying degree in different counties, the counties must be relieved of a further part of the expenditure in regard to roads.  A figure of 50 per cent. over the expenditure for the maintenance of roads in 1914 was suggested some time ago as a figure which we might expect the county councils to provide for maintenance.  A certain number of county councils have not provided that, while a certain number have been providing considerably more. If there has been adispute recently between the Local Government Department and the county councils in connection with this particular matter it has arisen out of the policy of the Department pursuing its responsibility in the matter of roads <Col N="838" /> and with a view to seeing that an equitable burthen of the cost is borne as between the county councils and the Government.  I agree that more money will have to be provided from the Road Fund for the maintenance of certain classes of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the consideration of buses in regard to this Resolution, I find a current going through certain speeches to the effect that if it were not for the tax on private cars and other private vehicles the roads which are used by motor buses would not have been provided, and that the roads which are provided to-day for the extensive bus traffic were provided by the owners of ordinary motor cars and vehicles previous to the advent of these buses.  The question arises whether the buses are to pay the actual amount of the damage which they do to the roads.  Neither my technical advisers nor I find ourselves in a position to state explicitly the amount of damage which the buses do to the roads.  Certain figures have been quoted, but, while quoting them in a bona fide way, I do not think that it would be fair to rely upon them as there has not been a sufficient amount of examination. I do not know whether it will be ever possible to state in actual figures regarding the damage which buses do to roads and, to a certain extent, I do not think that it is material.  I do not agree with the argument that the contribution which the bus traffic should make to the Road Fund should be based entirely on the extent of the damage, or even in great part on the consideration of that damage.  It has been pointed out that the Tramways Company have to maintain a permanent way and to pay way-leave for that privilege, and also that the Railway Company have to maintain the permanent way and to pay rates in respect of their undertakings. We cannot leave out the analogy completely, when we have a very important transport system all over the country, between the bus traffic and the railways and tramways in respect of the roads over which they run.  The Minister for <Col N="839" /> Finance has been queried and, to some extent, criticised, because, having spoken of a mileage tax earlier in the year, he now speaks of increasing the amount of licence fees which the buses will have to pay.  I think the House must convince itself that, in whatever form moneys are taken from the bus transport system for the upkeep of roads, there must be some relation between the actual use of roads by the buses and the amount taken up.  There must be some relation between vehicle-mile traffic and income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In whatever form it comes, because there is an abnormal use made of the roads at present by all classes of transport. In the first place, it is made by new carrying companies which are springing up all over the country and which are carrying goods for profit just as the buses are carrying passengers for profit.  In the second instance, there is the bus traffic itself.  If anyone put flanged vehicles on the railway for his own use they would be regarded as abnormal.  In the same way it would be regarded as abnormal if put on the tramway systems of Dublin or Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that that would be regarded as abnormal &mdash;certainly if put on the railways. When our roads are taken by profit-making companies we will, I am convinced, have to relate the moneys which they take from these concerns for the upkeep of the roads to the vehicle-mile aspect of their work on the roads.  That is why I say that the damage from my point of view is rather immaterial, although I do not say that it is entirely immaterial. The reason that the taxis put on in this particular way as distinct from the vehicle-mile tax, is because it is imposed now.  It is quite clear that the buses, ought to pay more than <Col N="840" /> they are paying at present.  I think it will be found that the licence fees collected from buses of different classes at the present moment are only about £4 per licence greater than they were in 1922 while at the same time there has been a considerable increase in the licence fees charged in respect of vehicles conveying ordinary goods.  As I say, it is clear that buses must pay more and that is the principle enshrined in this Resolution.  If after further consideration of the matter, and of every aspect of the bus traffic, and in view of the road needs, a vehicle-mile tax were decided upon, it would be possible to replace the present system of taxation by a different system, whereas if, without any further examination, a system of vehicle-mile tax were adopted the machinery you would have to set up for it, while not as elaborate as Deputy Davin suggests, would be a particular type of machinery and could not be as easily set aside as the present system of increased licences.  We have to bear in mind in connection with this question of the bus traffic, that if we compare January, 1929, with January, 1928; in January, 1928, the total number of vehicle-miles travelled was approximately 968,000 whereas in January, 1929, the total number of vehicle-miles travelled was 1,859,000, so that the number of vehicle-miles had doubled within the twelve months.  The number of passengers carried in January, 1928, was 1,908,000 as against in January, 1929, 3,515,000, while the gross passenger receipts were given in January, 1928, as £35,000 as against in January, 1929, £54,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exception has been taken to the statement of the Minister that he does not rely on those figures and that he is more inclined to rely on others.  I think a very good case can be made for not relying entirely on those figures.  In the first place, it must be difficult for bus companies to provide through their servants absolutely accurate figures.  It seems to me that there has been a tendency, at any rate since the idea of a tax per vehicle-mile was introduced, to manipulate figures, and we may be <Col N="841" /> in a position ultimately when we come to deal with the matter when we may have to take a guess-work figure.  A figure is known as a guess-work figure when a case cannot be made for it, but intuition can bring one very often to the right figure.  A tax of 1d. or 1½d. per vehicle-mile, may be a very sound and a very satisfactory tax to impose on buses, even though a very strong case cannot be made for it now.  As I say, the Minister for Finance cannot exactly be blamed when he states that he does not entirely rely on these figures.  These figures are provided by the Department of Statistics from returns supplied by the bus companies themselves.  The figures are issued monthly, and if we take the returns for April of last year, we find that the total receipts per vehicle-mile, in respect of the City of Dublin and suburbs, were approximately 8¾d.  In respect of Dublin and other points&mdash;that is, for a bus travelling between Dublin and Athlone, for instance&mdash;the receipts per vehicle-mile were about 11½d.  In Cork they were 9½d.  Generally the average all round would be about 9½d.</P>
    <P>The receipts fell in practically all these cases to about 7d. per vehicle-mile between April of last and January of this year, in spite of the fact that there has been a very considerable increase in the number of passengers carried.  The converging of prices to a particular point suggests in the first place that there cannot have been, both in Dublin and in other places, a fall from 11½d. per vehicle-mile, in April, 1928, to 7d. per vehicle-mile, in January, 1929. Furthermore, the differences between the various classes of buses in April, 1928, have all converged to the practically identical figure of 7d. at the beginning of this year.  We may not be able, as I say, to get absolutely accurate statistics, but we will have to come to the conclusion that the taxation of buses must be related to their use of the road.  Another factor that has to be taken into consideration is that the total mileage of roads in the country is 44,700.  Of these 4,223 are trunk roads.  The <Col N="842" /> total road mileage over which bus routes extend is 4,388, so that the whole of our trunk road system at the present moment is being utilised for bus routes.  We have to realise how widely spread bus traffic is at the present moment, and we have to put it into its proper perspective both in relation, to the cost of the roads and the contribution to the cost given by other vehicles and in relation to other transport systems in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find that there are systematic restrictions on the size of buses.  Following on the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Traffic, in respect of which legislation has to be introduced, in so far as under our regulations we could take steps to control the size, dimensions, and the different safety devices with regard to traffic, under the powers we had already, these regulations have been introduced. So far as heavy traffic using roads is concerned, I think outside the City of Dublin regulations exist which would prevent vehicles of more than nine tons using any road. In respect of any class of road under the control of a county council, the county council can, for any reason that seems proper, restrict the weight and the capacity of the vehicles using such roads.  In case of action like that on the part of a county council, I believe that it would be necessary that the Minister for Local Government should hold an inquiry into the matter to see whether the action of the county council should be upheld or not.  In so far as dimensions are concerned, regulations have been issued regarding these, and so far as the use of any road or any abnormal traffic on a road is concerned, that matter is entirely in the hands of the county councils, except that a nine-ton limit of weight is, I believe, general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea about the Land Commission is that they are more to be sympathised with than censured. Every day you take up a newspaper you will find resolutions passed by public bodies and organisations (1) calling on the Land Commission to reduce their staff, and (2) calling on the Land Commission to expedite the carrying out of the Land Act of 1923, and to give the tenants the benefit of the extra ten per cent.  The first resolution makes the second one impossible.  Therefore, the Land Commission have my sympathy. Our duty here is to give the Land Commission any help that we can. At present in the Land Commission there exists what is called the order of priority, which is based on the fact that the solicitor of a particular estate is able to lodge the particulars with reference to that estate at an earlier period perhaps than some other solicitor.  I hold that simpler cases should get preference over the more complicated ones.  If the simpler cases were taken up first a great many tenants would be enjoying the benefit of the ten per cent. reduction.  The complicated cases should be left to the last and the simple cases taken first, where the tenants had an honest landlord or a landlord who did not leave any bequests, etc., that it takes solicitors from Great Britain and other places to disentangle, and which prevent the tenant from enjoying the ten per cent. reduction to which he is entitled.  If the simpler ones were determined, then the people would see that there was something being done.  That is a matter which should engage immediate attention if the Land Commission will take my humble advice.  Then in connection with the division of land, we are told that the best tenants are not selected.  I hold that the man most entitled to an allotment of land is the labourer who loses his employment by reason of the fact that the land is being taken over.  I would not give land to every labourer on the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would select them <Col N="845" /> carefully.  I would give land to the men who would be likely to pay their annuities.  Unfortunately there are men of all classes who will not pay their annuities.  You will get good tenants from every class, and bad tenants from every class.  I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of the fact that I have been urging on the Land Commission for the last two years the necessity of taking over and dividing a small property of about 80 acres near Killavullen and dividing it amongst the people of the village. There are ten or twelve people in the village adjacent to this property, and as they have houses already it will not be necessary for the Land Commission to build houses for them. The parish priest is very anxious that the land should be divided, and he says that if the land is given to any but the people of the village he fears they will kick up a bit of a dust. There is also a small property of about 150 acres at Glanworth.  The whole matter was settled six months ago, but the land has not been divided.  A great many small farmers with 12 and 14 acres tilled some of their own lands in the hope that they would get some of this land immediately and be able to graze it. If that land were given to them before the end of next month they would be pleased.  Another matter I should like to mention is the fishery rights.  I believe there is a case in abeyance at present, as it has been appealed.  The lawyers took advantage of some little weakness in the Land Act and persuaded the judge that the fishery clauses were faulty.  He took the bait and decided against the tenant and the Land Commission.  In my parish, one man had the courage to appeal against that decision, and I hope he will be backed up by the Land Commission. It is their duty to back up their own Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to call attention is that a great many tenants in my district suffer from flooding from the river.  Deputy Goulding knows all about that.  I think it is the duty of the Land Commission before vesting the lands <Col N="846" /> or paying the landlords to see whether the landlords have been maintaining the river banks for the last 50 years, and, if so, to deduct from the sum to which they are entitled as much as will continue to maintain them.  There are also sluices that need to be maintained which I hope the Land Commission will also see to.  As I have said, I hope the Land Commission will give the simpler cases first attention and let the people see that some of the properties are being vested and that the Land Act of 1923 was not, as some people tell us, intended to be a landlord's Act, but a tenant's Act, and that the tenants will get their reduction of 2/- in the £ that some people tell them they will never get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Daly has reminded me of one or two things in connection with the Land Commission administration which, perhaps, it is no harm to call attention to.  He dealt with the question of the river embankments.  I have a case in my mind in my own constituency that will illustrate the disability under which many tenants have suffered in the last few years in connection with this matter.  When the Land Act of 1923 came into force many of the landlords took advantage of it to evade their responsibilities.  There was one case in particular that caused very great hardship.  A number of tenants, under the impression that the Land Commission had taken over the responsibilities of the landlord refused to pay annuities owing to the fact that the river bank on their land had broken and rendered a considerable portion of the land useless.  They claimed that as the land was useless to them they should not be asked to pay for it.  Now the unfortunate result is that five or six years' annuities have accrued and three of the tenants are unable to meet them and are threatened with eviction.  It is a pity the Land Commission, at the outset, did not make it clear to them that the responsibility was upon the landlord and, then, it would have been open to the tenants to proceed against the <Col N="847" /> landlord.  They were under the impression, all these years, that the Land Commission was the responsible party.  The unfortunate result now will be that there will be some trouble there, I am afraid, if the people are evicted, because popular sympathy will be with them.</P>
      <P>Tenants have also complained to me that they have not been at liberty to let their land for grazing purposes in the endeavour to make some money to be able to pay the Land Commission.  They could not let the land owing to the fact that the Land Commission threatened seizure and actually did seize cattle put on the land to graze.  Now if an arrangement was made with these men by which the Land Commission would undertake not to make seizures provided the grazing lettings were earmarked to pay off arrears, these tenants would be given an opportunity of getting out of their difficulty.  Their complaint is that for the last two years the land is useless.  They cannot use it, and they are precluded from letting it.  It is a pity that some effort could not be made to meet these people.  I have approached the Land Commission officials and found them sympathetic I must say.  They met me very fairly in the matter.  But many of these people are in the position that they cannot pay their annuities and they have not been able to use the land for the last two years. They feel bitter.  They say that if they were allowed to let the land they could procure enough money to help to clear off the arrears.</P>

      <P>One aspect in connection with this Vote that I would like to call attention to has been already dealt with, but I do not think it is any harm to return to it, perhaps at some length.  It is the reduction in the Improvement Vote. I do not know anything more regrettable than the decision in regard to that Vote.  For some years&mdash;the last two years notably&mdash;no money has been provided by the Dáil directly for the relief of unemployment. Members of this House coming <Col N="848" /> from rural constituencies are aware of the fact that any steps taken in that connection had to be taken through the money provided out of this Vote.  Outside that aspect of the case the work done through that means has been of real value to the country.  I am well aware of that myself, and I am very glad to be able to bear testimony to the fact that this money was very well expended and was of real value to all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how it is that at the present time a decision of this kind is taken.  It is more regrettable in view of the fact that schemes in the hands of the Land Commission were left unfinished.  Portion of them were carried out, but they were left unfinished so that the money originally expended is of no real value, having regard to the fact that the principal works are unfinished. I am glad to say that in the constituency I come from the Land Commission have made a substantial contribution to solving the housing question. Deputy Sheehy (Cork) will know that in the particular portion of the constituency near to where he lives a good deal in that direction has been done.  But I think he will agree that in the constituency we come from, as in many other places, there is great opportunity for doing a great deal more, and a great and urgent need for doing more.  In the whole congested area of the western portion of the County Cork I would like to see a great deal more done by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Isolated cases have, here and there, been dealt with and relieved to a certain extent.  But what we expect and need very badly is a bigger effort in that direction, and a more general attempt to come to the assistance of a large number of people who can never be touched by any ordinary housing legislation, no matter what grants are provided.  There are a certain number of very deserving and hard-working people who could never avail of such grants, because they never could provide the difference between such grants and the amount needed to erect a house. With the addition of some amount <Col N="849" /> to their annuities, a great deal could be done by the Land Commission if there was a more generous application of the steps that have been taken already in one or two districts in the constituency towards dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I have to complain also that an old outstanding matter has not been dealt with as well as some of us would like.  I suppose no question has been more fully debated over a long period than the question of the evicted tenants.  There has been some general idea lately that all cases of that kind that anything could be said for have been dealt with.  That is not so.  In West Cork we have a very large number of cases of notorious victimisation and these people have not been dealt with at all.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that we should have some statement as to what steps are being taken to deal with such cases or even to keep in touch with them.  In that connection, it is, I think, right to mention the fact that in a constituency like ours in West Cork, where there is not a great deal of land available for distribution to evicted tenants and other people, the most is not being made of the opportunities that exist for obtaining the land there is for such purposes, and that we have at least two or three cases in the constituency where substantial parcels of land, eminently suitable for distribution to evicted tenants or other people, are not available.  Through some means or another the Land Commission refused to move, with the result that some people who otherwise might have been attended to were not able to avail of the machinery which the Land Commission provided for them in that connection.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Land Commission endeavouring to do more in the direction of the prevention of flooding.  We have machinery to provide for grievances of that kind through the Drainage Acts, but there are certain minor schemes that the drainage legislation, passed by this House, can hardly be said to be suited for.  Through the machinery of the Land Commission minor <Col N="850" /> schemes of that kind might very easily be tackled during the summer period.  They would be of much assistance to the individual small holder of land.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to pay, to some degree, a tribute to the work of the Land Commission in one connection or another which I have mentioned. I regret to see that the Land Commission have decided to suspend what certainly was one of the most useful functions performed by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>On a Vote involving over half a million pounds it is necessary that a strict investigation should be made into the manner of its expenditure, particularly where the Department deals with one of the most important services in the State.  Speaking with the knowledge of a countryman and with the knowledge that has been expressed by various Deputies in this House from all sides, I am forced to the conclusion that that Department which, as I say, is one of the most important in the State and should be one of the most efficient is, in some manner or other, one of the most inefficient and gives the least satisfaction.  I was listening the other morning to the leader of the Farmers' Party, Mr. Heffernan.  What struck me very forcibly was the point which he wished to emphasise very much, and that was that the Land Commission should slow up.  I thought that, coming from a Deputy who speaks as the leader of the Farmers' Party, was very significant, because I am convinced of one thing, that when he told the Land Commission to slow up, except he referred to the fact that it might be advisable to slow up in some of their actions of late years, particularly their harsh methods in compelling farmers to pay land annuities where their means do not warrant it, I am sure he does not represent the voice of any farmer in the country.  Deputy Heffernan mentioned, and it has been mentioned by the front bench, too, that the Department should slow up rather than to proceed.  It is a striking statement to make, particularly <Col N="851" /> in view of all the cases, that have been mentioned in this House where agreements to purchase land entered into twenty years ago have not yet been completed, and particularly again in view of the fact that the Land Acts passed in the British House of Commons over twenty years ago laid special stress and emphasis on the necessity there was for dealing with the congested areas in the country.</P>
      <P>As a result of those Acts certain attempts were made to deal with them, but after twenty years or more have passed the congests are there to-day in a greater state of want and poverty than at any other period since the Land Acts were first introduced. In face of those facts for a Government front bench, or the leader of the Farmers' Party, to say that the duty of the Land Commission is to slow up is not speaking the minds of the farmers or showing any appreciation of their wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the Estimates, you might say the whole of this money is spent for administrative purposes, for administering the various Land Acts.  With the exception of a sum of £161,000, which has to be spent on improvement of estates, all the rest of the money is for administrative expenses.  I hold that a great deal of that money is quite unnecessarily expended.  I have sufficient experience of the working of the Land Commission to know that it is very expensive, and unnecessarily expensive.  Let us take a case where the Land Commission set out to acquire untenanted land, or again, where they set out to purchase an estate and transfer it from the landlord to the tenants.  They set about it in a very elaborate way, which is entirely out of proportion to what the real value of the property concerned would warrant.  Let us take it that a parcel of land down the country is to be sub-divided. The Land Commission inspectors visit the place, and after various visits and inspections, all thorough and elaborate, come to a decision as to the price of the land.  They next <Col N="852" /> set about receiving applications from the various people whom they consider may be eligible for an allotment on that land.  They set abroad the idea that every grievance that an uneconomic holder has in the area is to be rectified and that all persons who claim to be capable of tilling land, all landless men, will be supplied. The result is the raking in of reams of grievances and numbers of applications for land from people who, in the ordinary way, have very little interest in land or would not waste their efforts in looking after it, but inasmuch as they anticipate the possibility of getting something handy they make their application. When the Land Commission has settled with the owner and has spent money on the improvement of the estate, making roads, drains and fences, building and doing other things, they allot according to the applications before them, and only then the incoming tenant realises the price he has to pay for the land.</P>
    <P>I consider that that is entirely a very inefficient method of going about the work.  They are securing land for allotment.  They sub-divide it and they offer it to persons to enlarge their holdings or to landless people.  They secure a number of applications, many more than they are capable of dealing with, and they are thereby in a position to say to people that if they did not take the allotments there were others who would.  In that way they set up a form of competition, much on the lines of an unscrupulous auctioneer when disposing of a farm.  If, instead of that, the Land Commission set up a local committee and entrusted it with certain powers to investigate the local requirements of the small uneconomic holders, they would do much better work.  They could tell that local committee that they could not rectify grievances beyond the land at their disposal, that there were no uneconomic holdings that they could enlarge, or that there were no evicted tenants that they could reinstate, except in so far as there was land available to meet their requirements, and that there <Col N="853" /> was no money that they could give away for drainage or other work that the tenants would not have to pay back.  If they made that committee aware of the situation they would find a committee composed of parties who had an interest in the work, and these people would set about evolving such improvements and purchasing at such prices as would, make the undertakings economic.  All of us have had experience of the methods of dividing land under this very elaborate kind of scheme of the Land Commission.  I have met people in the last few years holding a lot of land under the Act of 1923, and they have asked me to try and get the Land Commission to take back the land that had been given to them under this huge scheme, because the price of it was prohibitive and they were unable to pay for it.  If they worked in that way I am satisfied that a considerable sum of money could be saved in the salaries and expenses of inspectors, and they would get a much more efficient service and better results would accrue.</P>
    <P>There are a few items in this Estimate under Appropriations-in-Aid. I see here a sum mentioned&mdash; Interest on Church Surplus Grant&mdash; amounting to £41,000.  From what I can find out, that grant is put to the credit account of the Land Commission. That represents a sum of money that under the Land Act of 1896 was handed over for the improvement of the congested estates. I am very much surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary, who represents. as I do, a congested area, would approve of the appropriation of that sum of money that was voted in 1896 in the British House of Commons, to improve the condition of the congested areas.  I cannot understand how he would sanction the appropriation of that sum of money for the expenses of the Land Commission, leaving the congests in the destitute condition in which they are.</P>
    <P>Very recently I had occasion to mention in this House the state of one district in Leitrim&mdash;Ballinaglera &mdash;that was subject to flooding. After stating the case, as I saw it, <Col N="854" /> I was answered from the Government Benches by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He stated that no money was then available, but if something was done first by the county council, his Department might afterwards see their way to do something.  The county council have since allocated a certain amount of money to relieve the destitution of that district, but the Land Commission up to the present has done nothing.  Yet there is a sum of money that by right belongs to the congested areas of which Leitrim is an outstanding part, and that money is taken from them and spent on the salaries and expenses of the Land Commission. The whole Vote for the Land Commission is made up of salaries and expenses, with the exception of £161,000.  I appeal strongly to the Deputies representing the congested areas to investigate this sum, and before they give a vote for the confiscation of the sum of £41,000 I mentioned for the general expenses of the Land Commission, I would ask them to examine the situation and to act according to justice.</P>
    <P>Further, there is this wholesale neglect on the part of the Land Commission to deal in any way effectively with drainage.  The Land Commission have been spending certain sums from time to time for what they call the improvement of estates and for the drainage of estates.  At the same time I have known them to spend considerable sums of public money on drainage schemes which were entirely impracticable, because there was another Department in this State&mdash;Public Works&mdash;who had been carrying out drainage schemes, and there was overlapping. One Department had been operating against the other.  Clearly there is something very wrong in having two Departments with interests that clash so very gravely as in the case of these two Departments. I feel that there should be closer cohesion between the two Departments. I am also convinced that where the Land Commission feel it necessary to spend money on the drainage of estates they should have sufficient power to remove any <Col N="855" /> obstacle, regardless of legal rights that could have existed and that were held by the Board of Works. They should have the right to remove these obstructions.  There should be no dual ownership or rivalry in a matter of such concern to the farmers who have to live in the State.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here, from time to time, whenever this question of the land comes up, as to what one Party did in assisting the farmers to purchase their land.  It has been stated that the Government Party introduced a Bill that has gone a long way towards solving the land problem.  The insinuation has been made that another Party has done nothing but criticise and obstruct. No Party in this House should take any credit for any Land Act that has been passed here or for the good work that has been done in dividing land or for taking any of the land that remains from the landlords and vesting it in the tenants. The land question was fought long before this Dáil was set up.  It was the fight made by the people during the land war that settled the land question, as far as any settlement we know exists, and the Acts of Parliament that were passed by the British House of Commons, by the old Irish Party who fathered them, were the result of the fight made by the farmers at home, and I think it is cheap for any Party in this House to claim any great credit for anything that was done in the way of acquiring land in the last few years. I think that claim is too cheap and certainly not much credit to the people who make it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan the other day stated that it might be a mistake to acquire too much land, to move too quickly, or to utilise good land for sub-division.  He made what to me appears to be an extraordinary statement, that bad or poor land was better for sub-division than good land.  Now, if Deputy Heffernan, the leader of the Farmers' Party, stated that the poor land would be less suitable for extensive farming than good land, I would agree with him; <Col N="856" /> but to state that poor land was better in the matter of small divisions than good land appears to me to be a perfectly unaccountable thing.  I leave it at that.  I do not agree with the Deputy and neither do the farmers of the country agree with him.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to an outstanding grievance of mine, the vesting of land.  Though it may worry the patience of the House, still I feel in duty bound to mention the matter once more.  I have repeatedly made reference to the glaring injustice that exists in the cases of tenants who entered into purchase agreements some twenty years ago and whose holdings are still unvested.  If any argument could be brought forward to justify leaving such holdings unvested it would be another matter, but to me it seems there has been grave injustice done to the tenants situated in the manner I have indicated.  I could put forward several unanswerable cases in which grave injustice has been inflicted on farmers.  Until those cases have been attended to I feel it my duty to keep on insisting here that they be remedied.  Under the 1903 Act farmers were persuaded to purchase under certain promises but these promises have never been kept.  In consequence of entering into agreements then, the farmers have been deprived of a considerable amount of money&mdash; they have been swindled in their bargains.  I say that is an injustice and this Government is bound to take some action.</P>
    <P>Let us take our minds back to the conditions that existed prior to the introduction of the largest Land Act passed in the British House of Commons&mdash;the Land Act of 1903.  We will recollect that conditions then existed under which it was no longer profitable, indeed it was impossible, for landlords to collect their rents.</P>
    <P>In such an atmosphere the Bill was introduced, and eventually it passed into law.  The farmers had made up their minds that the issue was knit.  They were determined to resist paying the landlord.  They succeeded with wonderful effect, and then the compromise came along <Col N="857" /> They were told that they could purchase their farms on the basis of a certain number of years purchase. It worked out on an average of 20 years, and they were promised a reduction of 20 per cent. on their annuities.  After a period of 68½ years they would become the owners of their farms.  In that way, on the very worst estates, agreements to purchase were entered into.  Thus faded away the big resistance on the part of the people that beat down the landlords and brought all landlord aggression to a standstill.  The unfortunate people who were highly rack-rented and who lived in desperate conditions, had made a strong fight, but they were misled by the promises made them.  They looked upon the offer as a fairly decent offer.  Thus were brought out of the fray the strongest forces arrayed against the landlords.  The unfortunate tenants were left high and dry, and under the agreements they then entered into they are still paying.  The mortgage they originally contracted for, covering a period of 68½ years, is not reduced by one cent.  These people entered into contracts to purchase on the basis of 20 years' purchase.  They now find that they will have paid what would amount to a 30 years' purchase by the time the lands are vested in them. Can they be blamed for refusing to tolerate that?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the figure may not be accurate.  I will, however, quote the case of a farmer paying interest in lieu of rent for a period of 20 years.  With a reduction of 20 per cent. on his rental, the interest in lieu of rent would be about £13.  Taking that over a period of 20 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The bargain was for 20 years' purchase.  The farmer has been paying interest in lieu of rent for 20 years.  I calculate that the amount he has paid in the meantime would represent an additional ten years to the purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>On the grounds that I have stated.  The farmer has been paying interest in lieu of rent for 20 years and I contend that he has paid approximately a sufficient amount to add ten years to the original 20 years' basis on which he purchased. He was led to believe that he could purchase on the basis of 20 years, but for a similar period he has been paying interest in lieu of rent and the land has not yet been vested in him.  The position is that after all those years the tenants have not reduced their mortgages by one penny. All sorts of promises were made to the tenants.  They were to get good roads, drainage would be carried out, and there would be general improvement on the estates.  The Land Commission inspectors then as now went through the country.  I have lists of cases where inspectors promised tenants that money would be at their disposal varying from £10 to £50 to improve their farms and buy more stock.  Those promises were never made good.  I brought these claims to the Land Commission offices, but they merely regarded them as out of date.  Years ago the Land Commission gave as an excuse that during the progress of the European War they had no funds available for carrying on work under the Land Acts.  They pointed out that England was involved in the war and that consequently money was scarce.  The farmers of this country contributed their share <Col N="859" /> to the general expenses of the war. They paid their share in taxation. The then Government did not observe the promises that had been made to the unfortunate tenants. Apart from making Irish tenants pay their share in taxation towards the war, they taxed them further by withholding the grants that were promised relative to the purchase of the land in this country.  They thereby put a very substantial additional charge on our unfortunate people.  The authorities then in existence failed to carry out their contracts with Irish tenants, and they did not act towards our people in a fair or reasonable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that it is the duty of the Dáil to push home to the British Government a claim for a refund of any sums of money that these farmers have been obliged to pay because of the delay caused them in the vesting of their holdings.  The Dáil should not fail to make that claim because of any inconvenience it might cause to the British Government for the time being.  In addition to that a sum of £41,250 is being unfairly and unjustifiably taken from the congested areas.  That money was held by the Congested Districts Board and given to the general spending department of the Land Commission.  What has become of the £20,000 a year that under the Act of 1903 was handed over to the Congested Districts Board to be spent on improvements in the congested areas?  What became of the £144,000 that was annually handed over by the Imperial Government for the congested areas for a similar purpose?  Have these sums ceased, and, if so, what are the reasons?  I again stress my appeal to the Deputies who represent congested areas to give very grave consideration to this matter and to be very careful before they give a vote on this Land Commission Estimate.  They can surely insist that the moneys that by right should belong to these areas, and which were passed for the improvement of those blots in the country&mdash;the congested areas&mdash;<Col N="860" /> should be devoted to their improvement. They should refuse to give a vote for the spending of one penny until that money is readjusted or handed back for the purpose for which it was really intended, and that is the improvement of the congested areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy (West Cork)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Vote for the Land Commission.  I have much pleasure in endorsing the remarks which my colleague, Deputy T. Murphy, made with regard to the administration under the Land Commission in West Cork.  There is no doubt that we are all under a great obligation to the chief of the Land Commission for his great work in wiping out some very unsightly spots in that part of the country.  Down in Hare Island you had a population of 219 people living in the most horrible hovels in which human beings could dwell. The Congested Districts Board came along there, and now these hardy fishermen are living with their families in comfortable homes.  As Deputy Murphy pointed out, there are other spots along our seaboard that require immediate attention. We have other places along our seaboards in which many unfortunate people have been very patient for years, living in the midst of bad surroundings, and unless the Land Commission come to the rescue, these people cannot be properly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the last speaker giving us a history of the land question for years back.  Well, I wish to inform the House that I enlisted in the eighties as a soldier under the banner of the Land League.  I addressed meetings side by side with Parnell, Joe Biggar, Dillon, Davitt and the other leaders in different parts of Ireland.  I attended conventions, and in my youth and vigour I travelled from meeting to meeting.  When the Land League was suppressed, we established the National League, and I became its first secretary in Skibbereen in 1885.  When that organisation went by the board, we established the United Irish League, and continued the fight and kept up our agitation for the betterment of the <Col N="861" /> people.  We succeeded in getting three great Land Purchase Acts passed, and, thank God, this Dáil has put the coping-stone upon land purchase by the passing of the Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the great fight, looking back at the self-sacrifice of thousands of my fellow-countrymen and remembering what hundreds of the tenant farmers suffered in the Plan of Campaign days, I recall how we were hunted through the country by the old R.I.C. when we were collecting funds for the fight.  Many men in the past sacrificed their homes in the interests of the tenant farmers of the country.  Now, when one hears, as we have heard in the Dáil those last few days, terrible criticism of the action of the Land Commission with regard to the non-vesting of holdings, and when one considers all the row that is made on that matter and contrasts it with the patient and enduring fight that was made forty years ago when we were building up the citadel of Irish freedom and raising the people from the condition in which they then lived, one is surprised.  I remember when the tenant farmers could not keep a dog.  If tenants had nice gardens or if they improved their houses or drained and improved their lands, their rents were immediately raised and they would have to pay these rents or go to the emigrant ship.  These were the things the people had to face in the old days that I remember so well. Thank God we have a better condition of things to-day in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should have a different atmosphere here.  We should not have the carping criticism that I have heard during this debate.  It was an enormous weight of work to vest all the lands in the Saorstat and even if all of it has not been vested I am satisfied that the Minister has been doing his level best all along.  The Land Commission may not be perfect, but I am sure they are doing as much for the country and working as hard for the vesting of these lands as they possibly can.  I say that the tenant farmers of Ireland who worked so hard and endured so much in the <Col N="862" /> fight to overthrow landlordism and who lived until the day when we saw the great Land Purchase Act of 1903, were delighted to be in a position to purchase their holdings.  I say that when decent men supplied them with money to buy out these holdings the decent tenant farmers of Ireland are not going to repudiate the repayment of that money.  I tell you, a thousand times, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  They will do no such thing.  The tenant farmers of Ireland who have gone through so much suffering to get their lands purchased are loyal and faithful to their bonds and they will not throw away the reputation they have won for honesty.  They will hand down to their children and to their children's children farms with a heritage of honour on them and they will do nothing to lessen the credit and reputation of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I attribute a good deal of the trouble and discontent amongst the farmers in the country at the present time who purchased their lands under the Land Act of 1923 to the position in which they find themselves consequent upon their having done so.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture at the time of the passing of that Act was warned of the consequences by Deputies in this House, by, amongst others, Deputies Heffernan and Gorey.  But he disregarded these warnings.  Commissioners who were sent down through the country to purchase untenanted land were latently sympathetically disposed towards the landlords.  The result was that in the prices paid for the untenanted land the landlords reaped a golden harvest.  As far as the tenants were concerned it was the case of &ldquo;Walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly.&rdquo;  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture walked into the mesh that was so ingeniously spun for him by the landlords.  The result is that the men who were put into these untenanted lands are at present paying exorbitant rents. They now find that they cannot pay these exorbitant rents.  The whole proceedings showed a great lack of experience and foresight on the part <Col N="863" /> of the then Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  It may be said that this Land Act of 1923 was for the tenant farmers of the country who fought for it for years and years in order to purchase their holdings.  I maintain that it was a landlord's Act and it was only intended to be a landlord's Act.  At the time the new Government had very little experience in the drafting of Bills.  They were quite a new Government and perhaps it may be hard to blame them.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring under the Parliamentary Secretary's notice a few cases down in my locality of which I wish to complain.  The first is in the case of the estate of St. John Grant in Kilmurray.  Time after time Deputies came up here and interviewed the Parliamentary Secretary, who received them very sympathetically and very cordially, and he gave them a kind of promise that the grievances they were sufferring under would be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited those lands at Kilmurray this time twelve months, when the farmers had sown their seeds, planted their potatoes, and had nearly all their spring work completed. A flood, however, occurred on the Blackwater and swept the seeds down the river.  Their grievance was that they are paying rates and rent for the Blackwater which has a valuable salmon fishery on it.  If they got the fishery rights vested in them they would be partly satisfied, and, in my opinion, that would only partly compensate them for the loss which they sustained by their seeds and crops being swept away.  Nothing has been done by the Minister for Fisheries.  I understand that a lady inspector was sent down to inspect those lands.  I cannot understand how a lady inspector comes to be an official of the Land Commission.  I would like if the Minister would tell us how many ladies there are in the Land Commission. This lady inspector, as I say, went down to inspect the lands, but she never went beyond the town of Fermoy.  If there are any more lady inspectors in the Land Commission <Col N="864" /> perhaps that is a reason why that Department is so slow in vesting lands.  I would suggest to the Minister for Fisheries that he should not get entangled in the apron strings of these lady inspectors.  There is also the estate belonging to Miss Green, which has been acquired recently but has not yet been divided. I hope when the time comes for dividing those lands that the representatives of the people who formerly had land in that district will get preference. I maintain that in the division of those lands the best men should be selected, men of experience who are capable of carrying on farming work.</P>
    <P>Then there is the land at Moor Park, about which I raised a question over twelve months ago.  There about 1,000 acres were handed over to the military after the evacuation of the British&mdash;1,000 acres of the finest arable land in Munster.  It seems extraordinary that the Land Commission would have to go to Swords to commandeer a farm of 150 acres of land while thousands of acres are lying undivided in my district. That land is at present let on the eleven months' system.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us what amount of revenue is derived from those lands and what is the cost of keeping a caretaker on them.  A good deal has been said about the vesting of lands and about the rapid pace at which untenanted lands are being bought.  My advice to the Land Commission is to cry halt in the acquisition of land until the lands have been vested in the tenants who bought them.  It is all very fine to talk about what is to be done for the unfortunate farmers. I say, and I am sure that every farmer Deputy will agree, that with the cost of living, the cost of labour, the depreciation in the prices of cattle, farmers would want land for nothing if they are to pay their way and rear their families.  Deputy Gorey, I think, said that there was too much sympathy for these poor devils.  I know some farmers, poor devils, who have been pulling the devil by the tail all their lives.  The sun of prosperity did not shine on <Col N="865" /> them as brightly as it has on Deputy Gorey and they were not born, like him, under a lucky star.</P>
    <P>As I say, I advise the Land Commission to cry halt in purchasing land until the Government turn the corner about which we hear so much.  They should get a move on and not grope around the corner. When they do get a move on I hope that they will bring the farmers out of the shifting quagmire in which they find themselves and restore them to their former prosperity. Are we to hand down slavery and poverty from one generation to another?  Was it for that that the Land League was formed and was that the prosperity and freedom for which the men of 1916 fought?  The Government should do something practical and get competent men in the Land Commission to do the work.  There is also a case which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will note.  I refer to the estate near Fermoy, formerly held by Mr. Noonan, which was taken over by the Land Commission.  The former tenant paid 13/4 an acre as rent, whereas it is now 18/-, and it is being paid by a woman who was brought from a congested district in the West.  That proves to me that the inspectors who were sent down were more sympathetic to the landlords than to the unfortunate people who got the land.  If that is allowed to continue we will be handing down to posterity a legacy of slavery and poverty which it will take many generations to abolish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some thirty estates in Galway in which I am interested but into the details of which I do not now purpose to go. I may, however, refer to a few of them as examples of how things should not be done.  In the first place, the reduction of the Improvement Grant by £191,000 is, to my thinking, false economy, as such expenditure is in the ultimate resort productive.  In a question on to-day's Order Paper I referred to one case in which, owing to the neglect in draining seventy acres on the Ruthven estate at Portumna, nearly half the land has become <Col N="866" /> soured, sodden, and in danger of being permanently submerged.  The river flows into Lough Derg and was drained annually up to ten years ago, but since then nothing has been done though it was inspected two years ago.  Worse than that, these seventy acres form portion of a farm of 120 acres which was taken over by a Committee of fourteen poor tenants many years ago and who have been paying for it in the hope of getting reductions, getting it vested and of having proper drainage done.  That is one sample. There is one particular case which affects the problem of congestion and also the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the village of Pollough, Ballinderrin, County Galway, in which there are some fourteen Irish-speaking families with farms ranging from 5 to 12 acres each.  Even if they have more, one could scarcely call it land.  It was proposed some years ago to get land in another district for three of those tenants and thus to some extent relieve congestion.  Finally, it was decided to remove one of the tenants so as to give some relief, though it would be very small.  There seems to be no other land available in the neighbourhood and no means of giving relief except by removing some of the tenants to another district.  The tenant to be removed was a Mrs. Linnane.  A new holding was laid out and a house built for her on the St. George and Concannon Estate. There were delays for one reason or another, and some time last year a Mr. Quinn, P.C.&mdash;a very estimable citizen, no doubt; I have not the pleasure of his intimate acquaintance&mdash;was made caretaker, and he has now got the land and house destined for the poor woman, with the result that no relief can be given to congests in the Pollough area.  I was informed by the Land Commission that this Mr. Quinn had no land in 1913 and that he had no living relations except two elderly maiden sisters.  He got married since he was promised the land, but, at any rate, in 1913 he was given a holding <Col N="867" /> and removed from Pollough.  He got a holding the rent of which was £25 and the valuation £35.  He has now also got the land destined for Mrs. Linnane.  The reason he got the land I was told was that a nephew of Mrs. Linnane wrote a threatening letter to Mr. Quinn.  Suppose that that was true, and that the land could not be given to Mrs. Linnane, why not remove one or two of the other tenants out of this congested village and give them the land, instead of giving it to a man who had land already&mdash;perhaps not in his own name, but in his deceased father's name or in his maiden sister's name?  Why not give the land to some of the other congested tenants of that village?  I refer to this case because it looks as if there were something fishy about it.  Mr. Quinn, I have no doubt, got the land because he is a P.C. a reliable citizen, and will pay the annuity.  I heard him speak down there and it was not in Irish.  I was in the houses of these congests and I heard not one word of English.  Of course, we are very sympathetic to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Another case to which I would wish to refer is that of a tenant on the Lewin Estate, Kilshanry, Kilconly, Tuam.  There was a tenant there named Nicholas Canning, who had a small portion of land.  He was a resigned member of the R.I.C., and he applied for a pension, but did not get it, for political reasons, it was stated.  At any rate, he applied for a holding on the Lewin estate in order to make his present holding, which is very small, economic.  It seems very strange that he was the only tenant who did not get any land in that district.  When I inquired into the matter, I was told that his holding was excluded from the Act of 1923.  It is very strange that his was the only holding excluded. On the same estate a shopkeeper&mdash;I have no objection to his getting land, and I believe he is a good citizen&mdash;who has already 10 acres has got another 10 acres.  An ex-teacher and a man who is serving as a sergeant in the Civic Guards <Col N="868" /> have also got land there.  There seems to be something strange about that. I just quote these cases as examples of some of the things that perhaps should not be done.  Whenever I approached the Land Commission I found them very reasonable.  If one had a good case one would be listened to and justice was generally done.  These are two cases, the Pollough case particularly, in which I think the right thing was not done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe, a few days ago, when this Estimate was under discussion, made a fierce attack on the Land Bill which we introduced some time ago.  He spoke away from the Estimate, in my opinion, but at any rate, although he spoke very fiercely and at great length, he finished up really as a lamb in wolf's clothing. He was a great thought reader.  He read our purpose in this Bill, and what it implied.  I do not agree with him, though, of course, I would feel nervous in disputing matters of land law with him.  Still I am venturesome enough to disagree with the conclusions which he drew.  He is an excellent thought reader.  He is positively psychic, and would be a great help to those in search of media over in England.  I think he should get in touch with some of the psychic research people.  He spoke as Sir Oracle: &ldquo;This is the law, and nobody dare contradict it.&rdquo;  He said that we apologised for the Bill. That is something like a legal quibble.  We admitted that the draft of it was not altogether perfect, but we submitted that the House should allow us to amend it in order to cover the two objects that we intended to cover.  Deputy Wolfe also nearly shed tears&mdash;there was a lump in his throat and a break in his voice&mdash; when he came to talk of our treatment of the non-judicial tenant.  We suggested that they should be all dealt with before 1932.  I wonder if Deputy Wolfe believes that the Land Commission will have dealt with them by 1932 at the present rate of progress?  Regarding the position of the tenants under the Land Acts and their treatment by the Land Commission, I should like to go into some figures.  Under the Act of 1903, <Col N="869" /> known as the Wyndham Act, a bargain was made.  There was certainly a delay in vesting then, because cash and not bonds had to be provided, as it would not do to put large blocks of this land stock on the market. While there was a delay, I believe that was the chief cause of the delay winder that Act.  Under the 1923 Act the landlords are paid in 4½ per cent. Bonds, and that difficulty does not exist.  Still, most of the land under the 1903 Act was vested in the tenant within six years after the bargain had been made.  It is now nearly six years since the bargains were made in August, 1923, under the 1923 Act, and yet there is very little vested in the tenants, that is the fixing of the appointed day under the 1923 Act.  It is not correct to state, as the Minister for Agriculture did, that the tenant under the 1903 Act got no reduction till the day of vesting.  What usually occurred was this, if I am right: if it was a second-term tenancy&mdash;that is, a rent fixed between August, 1896, and 1911&mdash;he usually bought at 22 or 23 years' purchase. That was a reduction of between 5/- and 5/8; let us say, an average of 5/6.  He did not get this reduction till the land was vested in him, nor was the Sinking Fund operating to redeem the capital sum.  In place of paying on the purchase price 3¼ per cent. (as when vested) he usually arranged with the landlord to give 3½ per cent. on the price.  In some cases it was higher than that, but 3½ per cent. was the 1903 Act.  This meant a reduction.  That 5/6 in the £ meant 72½ per cent.  of the old rent. At 3½ per cent. it would work out at nearly 78 per cent., and meant during the waiting period, 22 per cent. reduction.  On first-term judicial rents&mdash;that is, rents fixed between August, 1881 and 1896, the fifteen year period&mdash;it meant, of course, a greater reduction.  The Minister for Agriculture says that our Bill meant that the landlord would suffer not 25, but from 30 to 35 per cent. reduction.  But is that not provided in the Act, unless, of course, they mean to keep the tenant paying until the crack of doom <Col N="870" /> money that he should not be paying. What about the gilt-edged security, what about the bad debts and the cost of collection that are avoided by sale?</P>
    <P>Now let us consider what the tenants suffer.  We will take four tenants.  The first and second term tenant pays £75 out of each £100 of rent, but the sinking fund of one-quarter per cent. does not begin to operate until the appointed day.  He should be paying only £65, but the £65 includes sinking fund, because it is 4¾ per cent. of price, exclusive of bonus.  Hence he should be paying only £61 3-7ths.  Seventy-five pounds, minus £61 3-7ths, is £13 4-7ths actual loss, or, working it in percentages, it would be 22 per cent. more than he should be paying, since he is not credited with the sinking fund portion.  The landlord gets £75 instead of £67½.  If the tenant paid £67 10s., he would pay the landlord in full.  The State, of course, escapes the bonus for some years to come, and some other Government will have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>As regards the third-term tenant, he pays £75, instead of £70, but the £70 includes the sinking fund portion. Therefore, taking this from the £70, we get £70 less, £3? or £66?, instead of £75.  Seventy-five pounds, minus £66?, is £8?, and this, expressed in percentages, is nearly 12½ per cent.  Here, the landlord should be getting about £72?.  In the case of a non-judicial tenant, the price, of course, has first to be fixed, if it is not agreed upon, and the purchase will then take place at the new price as a third-term one. In the case of fee-farm and long leaseholds the price has to be fixed. Until then the tenant gets no reduction whatever.  Under Section 38 of the 1923 Act, and also under the 1927 Act, that will be found.  The bonus in this case does not come to his relief.  At present the tenants pay about £100,000 more than they should.  The landlords benefit, and the tenants are no nearer to being absolute owners, and it seems to be a deliberate penalisation of the tenants for the benefit of the landlords. <Col N="871" /> I wonder when it is intended to pay the interest on the bonus portion.  There was a loss of £55,000 last year, I think, on the untenanted lands, and the estimate this year is £50,000 or £51,000, and that seems to me like a subsidising of grazing.</P>
    <P>The British did not acquire in this country compulsory powers until 1909, and I believe distributed one million acres.  Has one quarter of that amount been distributed under the 1923 Act?  I should have remarked above that in paying the £75 on each £100 the tenant is paying a sum exceeding by at least £4 all the landlord should get.  Why could not they so arrange matters as to give the landlord £67 10s, his full rent under the 1923 Act, when vesting occurs, set aside £3 10s. for sinking fund, and reduce the £75 at once to £71?  The State would still have its bonus.  If you take the existing rents under the 1923 Act as £900,000 &mdash;I think that is near the figure&mdash; the loss to the tenants, apart from the sinking fund, must be, I maintain, £85,000 to £90,000 per annum, and if you multiply that by six you have got that in the last six years tenants have lost £500,000 as a result of the slowness of the Land Commission.  If I am wrong in these figures, I should like to be corrected. Another matter I should like information upon is&mdash;and this is just a question put to get a definite answer&mdash; whether or not it is the custom of the Land Commission to inform Deputies or any others concerned of the exact price paid for any estate, and if not, why not?  Some tenants are suffering more than others, of course, by this delay.  Deputy Gorey speaks of the &ldquo;poor devils&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. The Deputy is the fourth or fifth Deputy who has attempted to quote me and, I contend, quoted me wrongly.  It is time that I should intervene before any other Deputy attempts to quote what.  I said, Deputy Nolan was wrong.  He says that I referred to the people who got land after the 1923 Act.  Deputy Hogan made the same mistake, and I <Col N="872" /> think Deputy Kent.  I did not refer to people who got land divided-under the 1923 Act at all, nor did I refer to the people who suffered losses from fluke, or any other such happening.  What I did refer to, or intended to refer to, was people who owe seven or eight, or ten or twelve years' annuities, and whose land is vacant, who cannot farm the land because they have no means, and who cannot let it because people cannot take it.  The class of people I refer to are people whose land is derelict.  It is neither stocked by themselves nor anybody else.  The Credit Corporation cannot come to their assistance because of their position.  While that continues, and while the land is vacant, they are losing their time, because they could be doing something for themselves if they turned their hands to some other means of livelihood.  I refer to people who occupy land and who have no chance of making good, and I am ready to bear any criticism on that point.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into any little arguments with Deputy Gorey.  If he wants these people evicted or dealt with in other ways that is his look out.  There are some who have suffered more severely than others and who have been waiting a long time to get into the promised land.  If Deputy Gorey had consulted Deputy Heffernan he would find cases round about the town of Tipperary.  Tipperary is not my county and I do not want to go minutely into cases there, but I shall quote one.  It is the case of Denis Hayes, and he was, I suppose, a fellow-soldier of Deputy Sheehy (Cork) and was one of the wounded soldiers of the Scully estate fighting for his land in 1868.  He must be a <Col N="873" /> very old man now.  He still has a small piece of land on the edge of the Smith-Barry estate, and he is living in hopes that before he dies he will get portion of that.  But it is surely a long time to have had to wait.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan said he was struck with the unreality of this debate.  He said it is rather unfortunate, perhaps, that, the activities of the Land Commission, more than the activities of any other Department of State, supply matter for election propaganda.  The Minister for Finance to-day, talking about de-rating of agricultural land, said: &ldquo;In Great Britain the cost of making good the rates lost by the local authorities will be about 2.8 per cent. of the national revenue. In the Saorstát it would be about 9.2 per cent. of the revenue.&rdquo;  Later on he says: &ldquo;The present valuation of agricultural land in the Saorstát county areas, including urban districts, is 71.2 of the total valuation of these areas for rating purposes. In particular counties the proportion rises to 84 and 86 per cent.  In the Saorstát, as a whole, the percentage of the total valuation represented by agricultural land and farm buildings is about 65 per cent., while in Northern Ireland it is about 38 per cent.  Agricultural land and buildings in Scotland represents about 6 per cent., and in England and Wales 2½ per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is very little unreality about these figures.  They reveal that the main source of wealth here is the land and the Department primarily responsible for the equities and titles and rights of the main source of wealth in this country should come in for the major portion of the discussion in this House upon the Estimates.  I do not believe that Deputies on any side of the House who realise the vital concern to the majority of the people in the country that the land question is, are using it for election propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out here by Deputy Flinn that if you go in for economically producing agricultural wealth you can do so with a half a <Col N="874" /> million people with labour-saving devices, and you can herd another million into the towns to supply them.  You can get away from all these ideas of Lawlor and the other people who were so foolish as to talk about &ldquo;a peasantry rooted in the soil.&rdquo;  Of course, that is in keeping with the present policy enunciated by the Minister for Agriculture and praised by Deputy Gorey when he talked about getting rid of the &ldquo;poor devils&rdquo; here whom he has recently defined.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Shaw's enthusiasm for the activities of the Land Commission in Westmeath, because I have never seen them. Within a radius of ten miles of where I live there are four very large estates taken over under the 1923 Act&mdash;the Smythe estates.  None of these has been vested, and there is no sign of them being vested. Again I have repeatedly gone to the Land Commission about the lands of Dardistown on the Medge estates. There are uneconomic holders to the number of ten or twelve round this place with valuations of from £2 to £10.  The Land Commission have permitted people recently to come in and buy this land, people who have neither heirs nor heiresses and owned over 300 acres of land between them.  I do not think they will enjoy this land very happily.</P>
    <P>We were told that there were 150,000 letters received by the Land Commission last year.  I suppose that it took a big portion of the staff of 600 employees to answer these in the following manner: &ldquo;I am directed by the Land Commission to acknowledge your letter of such-and-such date, with reference, to such-and-such a thing on such-and-such an estate, and to state that your letter will receive attention. Mise le meas.&rdquo;  You repeat these letters because one does not like to take up too much of the valuable time of the Land Commission interviewing them, considering that they were so busy recently as to erect an inquiry office to keep us from invading the sanctum.  I remember writing after a third answer similar to <Col N="875" /> this for something definite.  I put that request at the bottom of the letter, yet I got back a similar letter saying that the matter would receive attention.</P>
    <P>We were told about the progress of the 1923 and the 1927 Acts and the 1903 and the 1909 Acts are held up in comparison.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to forget that there was no compulsion in the acquisition of estates under these Acts.  I asked a question on February 23, 1928, about the number of estates taken over on that date and the number vested and I got the reply that particulars had been lodged of about 5,550 estates, comprising 2,756,000 acres, concerning 86,540 tenants and that 2,398 holdings representing 663 estates and comprising 110,764 acres had been dealt with up to that date. In a supplementary question I suggested that at that rate of progress it would take 20 years to complete the vesting.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the Deputy would be silly in making such an assumption.  Yet, taking his own figures for the financial year ending the 31st of March, we find, even with the speeding up process, that they have dealt with only 132,000 odd acres comprising 3,700 holdings.  Even taking the holdings which I suppose it will be contended are the main obstacles it will yet take 20 years to complete the purchase under the 1923-1927 Acts.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary adopted my suggestion last year that the staff should be concentrated on the vesting of tenanted estates.  I should like to see that because I believe as I said last year that the price being paid for land is too high, that the proper people are not getting it and that men are put on land without proper capital facilities being placed at their disposal. The ideal state of things I would like to see is the Land Commission working in co-operation with the Agricultural Credit Corporation so that when a man was placed on a farm as in other countries he would be given the necessary amount of capital to work that farm and that he <Col N="876" /> would not, immediately he acquired the farm, have to let it on the eleven months system as I know happened in cases in Meath and Westmeath. What he got for it in the eleven months did not pay his rent and rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy said, in concluding his speech: &ldquo;If the Land Commission was staffed entirely by temporary forces, without restriction as to numbers, it might be possible to make quicker progress with the completion of its main work, but where a large staff of permanent and experienced officers are involved the State must take notice of the danger of being left with a greater number of such officers on its hands than can be fully provided with work for the full period of their permanent service.&rdquo; So that really the Government is more concerned with the welfare of the 600 officials in the Land Commission than with the welfare of the hundreds of thousands involved in the 1923 and 1927 Acts. We have a suspicion that all is not well in the Land Commission and that these officials are not doing their duty effectively and well, and that they are more concerned with the protection of vested interests than with the speeding up of the work of the Land Commission, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Fisheries has shown us nothing to indicate that that suspicion is not well founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. J. White Mr. J. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same complaint as a number of other Deputies with regard to the non-vesting of estates.  So far as my inquiries go. I cannot discover a single estate being vested under the 1923 Act in my county, and in any case there has not been a single estate vested under the Act in my own area, Inishowen. There is a large number of unpurchased estates in that area, large estates, too.  I do not want to reiterate the arguments put forward by a number of Deputies as to the loss to the tenants of unpurchased estates by not having them vested. There is another matter I would like to have the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary on.  That is with regard to the date of the issuing of <Col N="877" /> Land Commission processes for arrears of annuities.  I have a process here.  It was issued by the solicitor for the Land Commission on the 15th December, 1928, for hearing at the District Court in Carndonagh on the 26th April, a period of practically four months.  The tenants who were sent these processes were held liable for the costs of the process by the solicitor acting for the Land Commission from their date of issue, though these processes properly are not served until within a fortnight or three weeks of the holding of the district courts.  The very worst of the old landlords did not issue ejectment processes for a longer period than a month or three weeks.  I think it requires some investigation to see if the Land Commission officials in the collection branch have power to issue bundles of processes four or five months before the date of the holding of the district court.</P>
      <P>I have a complaint here from a tenant named Gallagher, of St. John's Point, Dunkineely.  Bailiffs were sent by the Land Commission to seize cattle from this man.  He states that cattle were seized, valued for £22, by the court messenger or the bailiff in that area.  These cattle were removed from the town of Donegal to Strabane and sold by auction there for £9.  After deducting the court messenger's fees, poundage, keep and rail, the balance of £2 11s. 1d. was remitted to Mr. MacMenamin, for the credit of the tenant.  If the facts, as stated in those letters, are correct, and I hold a letter in my hand from the curate of the parish in which this man resides verifying the statement he made to me, I have no hesitation in saying that that is oppression of the poor.  If the man's cattle were worth £22, some effort should be made to sell them in the town of Donegal and they should not have been brought to Strabane and sold at a sacrifice.  The court messenger's fees were taken and £2 11s. 1d. was handed over.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of this complaint and have it investigated. I would like also to hear an explanation from him with regard to the issue of these processes.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear my&mdash;I do not know whether I should say it or not&mdash;colleague from Donegal attack the Government on their policy in regard to this particular Vote of the Land Commission. Probably the Deputy would not agree with me if I said that I should agree with him.  However, he pointed out certain things which were absolutely correct.  I must say that I find myself also in agreement with Deputy Gorey when he talks about &ldquo;the poor devils&rdquo; who are in arrears with land annuities, because we have, as Deputy White, who has just spoken, would say if I asked-him, a lot of &ldquo;poor devils&rdquo; in Donegal who are in arrears with land annuities.  They are not all in Donegal, because recently some of them have been sent to Sligo Jail.  I think the Deputies of Cumann na nGaedheal and the Labour Deputy for Donegal will agree with me that the conditions there are very bad.  I include in Donegal all those congested areas along the seaboard.  All those areas are in a very bad condition at the present time.  Deputies in this House, perhaps, have been bored time after time listening to the conditions that obtain in those congested areas.  It would not be any harm to tell them a little about them.  Those areas along the seaboard are, as I say, congested in this respect, that the land is not capable of keeping the number of people that are there.  It is no fault of the people that they are there at all.  It is no fault of any Government, either the British Government or the Free State Government, that those people are alive.  It is not because of these Governments that they are alive.  It is in spite of them.  The only thing, to my mind, that keeps those people alive along the seaboard is the amount of money that is sent across from America, and the amount that is earned annually by all those who go across to England and Scotland at harvest time.  The people are so conversant with those things lately that they should know as much about them practically as anyone who comes from the area, so there is no need to dwell upon them.  But <Col N="879" /> the fact remains that for some years past, during the time of the trouble, for instance, and since, people in those congested areas fell into arrears of land annuities, with the consequence that when John Bull, in his role of Shylock, demanded his pound of flesh the Free State Government were in the position of trying to supply that pound of flesh and, unfortunately, it had not quite the same effect as Shakespeare had in his play, because not alone did they take the pound of flesh but they took the life blood with it.  What I mean by the life blood is this: Bram Stoker wrote some thrilling stories about vampires taking the human blood, but Bram Stoker never wrote anything to compare with what anybody could see if they could go to any port in the Saorstát on any Saturday evening, or any evening when a vessel is sailing for the United States.  Bram Stoker never realised what it meant not alone to take the life blood but to take the flesh, blood and all from the nation. That is what is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to a certain thing here in the debate on Friday last.  He was talking about people who objected to expenditure and at the same time, when there was a decrease in expenditure in a Government Department, they were the first to kick.  He said the only expenditure he objected to was useless expenditure.  Fianna Fáil are absolutely on a par with Deputy Morrissey in that particular regard, because what we want is decreased expenditure where it is useless, and increased expenditure where it is necessary.  In this Vote you have £166,000 less for the improvement of estates.  There might seem to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary conflicting opinions here on our benches, but it is not so.  For instance, where estates are vested the moneys paid for improvements in estates would cease automatically, but in congested areas&mdash;this is, I think, well worth the attention of the Minister and it is not put in any critical mood at all&mdash;it perhaps for the time being would not pay to <Col N="880" /> have those estates vested if they lost the amount that was formerly expended in the improvement of estates, because where a man would gain, say, 10/- a year, he probably would have if he were working, say, on the improvement of estates, five or six or ten weeks' work at £1 or 25/- a week, and that would more than compensate for the money he would gain by the estate being vested, which goes to prove not that the estate should not be vested, but that there should be some special treatment meted out to the congested area.</P>
    <P>Suppose I were to say those words here in the Dáil&mdash;I have heard words somewhat similar from our Party here, and the President was the first to take them up&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel quite sure that neither the Minister nor the Government want a renewal of the agrarian troubles in this country, and so far as I can see there is no other prospect before us unless adequate measures are taken to allay the exasperated feelings of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If those were my words, the President would be the first to get up and say: &ldquo;We will not have any sabre-rattling in this House.&rdquo;  He said it here before.  He would stand up like Ajax defying the lightning and say: &ldquo;I yield to no man on points of nationality.&rdquo;  But remember those are not my words; those are the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and to bear out what the Parliamentary Secretary said in 1925, I beg to affirm in 1929 that the people are so exasperated that they are prepared to go to jail or to a hotter climate.  Jail is not so very hot.  I have been there and never found it hot.  But they are prepared to go anywhere for the sake of certain opinions that they hold and that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to in 1925.  I will go no further.  It is time that this question of the Land Commission and land annuities should be considered in a light in which they were never considered before by any politicians in this country.  The Parliamentary <Col N="881" /> Secretary visualised it, and I must say so far as I know the Parliamentary Secretary, he certainly does one man's part in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows the Parliamentary Secretary cannot make any mistake about that.  In 1925 he visualised what was going to happen, and in the congested areas in Donegal that thing is happening at the present time.  There are people living there whose last cow was about to be seized and they resented any such action.  They were not able to pay, they did not intend to pay, and they were put in jail.  All that must stop.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the President is not here.  I would like to be able to tell all this to the President, because I like those fellows who are fond of defying the lightning.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not quarrel with me and the Minister for Lands and Fisheries will not quarrel either. There is nothing to be gained by talking to them.  There are complaints from people in the congested areas.  This does not apply to Donegal alone but to all the other congested areas.  We have here Fianna Fáil T.D.'s and Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.'s and, perhaps, with more experience of the Government Departments, the Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.'s, are more clever in ferreting out things than the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  In various constituencies people hold that unless they are supporters of Gumann na nGaedheal they cannot get a bog road done or they cannot get a portion of land divided.  I would be long sorry to believe that.</P>

      <P>The answer, we are told, will come at the end.  I would be loth to believe that, because my colleague, Deputy Blaney, and myself have been very busy in Donegal in regard to land division.  At least we thought we were busy and I would be long sorry to think that all our efforts were wasted and that the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies for Donegal could simply walk in through the back doors of the Department and get things done&mdash;get land for the people merely by saying, &ldquo;well, old fellow, so-and-so is deserving of a bit of land.&rdquo;  Unless the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister deny it, I will not believe it. They must, however, deny something else.  On Friday last Deputy Heffernan, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, made a statement here.  Whether or not he meant it, I do not know.  He said that he had been instrumental in bringing about the division of land in Tipperary.</P>

Does Deputy Heffernan mean to say that Deputy Morrissey and the rest of the Tipperary Deputies got nothing?  Deputy Heffernan claims to have got all the land divided and unless the Minister contradicts that, what can be believed? Is the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary going to say that those who belonged to the Gumann na nGaedheal Party in the past got the land divided amongst the people whom they favoured and that when the Fianna Fáil people went to the Department they got nothing?  Is the Minister going to say that nothing at all was got by members of other parties, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Farmers' Party, Labour Party or anything else?  If the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary says that all men were equal in this matter, then we are <Col N="883" /> going to believe it, but until they do say it we must take the word of one who is in close touch with the Cabinet. I refer to Deputy Heffernan, who says that he was instrumental in getting land divided in Tipperary. I have heard about the people who were instrumental in getting lands divided in Donegal, Kerry, Sligo, Leitrim and other places.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to tell me whether they have given preference to those who support their Government or whether they give equal facilities to other Deputies in the Dáil who put forward cases on behalf of men genuinely in need of land.</P>

      <P>Like most of the Deputies here, I must congratulate the Land Commission on the work that is being done under the 1923 Act in County Galway.  I do not agree with the new policy of the Opposition, which aims at giving preference to the vesting instead of the acquisition and division of land.  I know that in County Galway the Land Commission are dealing with 160,000 acres, and under the 1923 Act they have divided 47,000 acres between 2,400 allottees.  If the Land Commission were to concentrate on vesting as against acquisition and division, it would tend to hold up matters.  If you are to concentrate on vesting, you are giving double benefit to the people who have already got the land.  That is to say, you are giving them the land and you are also giving them the other benefit of getting their purchases vested.  In a congested county like Galway you have in or about 118,000 acres ready to be divided, and by the policy now put forward these people who are waiting to get this land would have to wait a further period until the 47,000 acres that have been already divided are vested in the tenants.  I think it is most unfair that in a county such as Galway you would leave 118,000 acres lying there undivided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I put up a number of cases in the County Galway that I know very well, and I am sure Deputy Fahy knows some of them, too.  There is a case from Turloughmore, in Galway, where there are six tenants whose valuations range from £6 10s. to £7 10s. a year, and who pay from £40 to £50 a year for con-acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I urge that the division of the land should be carried on with as much speed as possible, because if you do not carry on the division you have these small tenants with small valuations having to pay big prices for con-acre such as I have just mentioned.  I know that these tenants with valuations from £6 10s. to £7 10s. pay up to £50 a year for con-acre.  Deputy Nolan in the course of his speech four years ago suggested that the Land Commission should go slow in <Col N="885" /> the division of lands.  He believed that at the end of the four years the land would be much cheaper than it was at that time&mdash;in 1925.  That is not the case in the County Galway, at all events.  I know one farm of 100 acres set for grazing this year and that farm is carrying £1 an acre more than it was let at last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is on the eleven months' system.  Now, in addition to these 118,000 acres you have also the schemes in Connemara and the Cloosh Valley.  I suppose Deputy Tubridy will say this is a pet scheme.  There are 13,000 acres in the Cloosh Valley and of these there are 6,000 ready for occupation. In the other scheme you have in or about 4,000 acres.  Already the Government have spent in buildings, roads and drainage something like £7,000 there.  That is the position in Galway.  All I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is to reconsider his decision in the matter of his policy of vesting and to try to get the division of the land carried on as fast as possible.  I spoke a while ago of a £6 or £7 valuation, but you have a number of tenants in Galway with valuations as low as £2, £3 or £4.  Certainly these people have a great grievance if they find that their neighbours who got divisions of land four years ago are having these lands now vested, while they themselves are left without any land until all this vesting is finished.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister to consider favourably whether they should not speed up the division of untenanted land as much as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, which has proceeded in its own quiet kind of way, would not suggest to anybody that this is really one of the most serious struggles which has taken place yet in this House.  It is a question of the Irish race&mdash;the Irish nation&mdash;versus the same sort of selfish interests which practically destroyed the Irish race in the past. This is a continuance of the policy <Col N="886" /> which we see back through the history of this country.  We have here a very big issue.  I hold that this question of the division of Irish land is really a question of the existence of the Irish nation.  That question takes a curious form at present, because the enemies of the Irish nation are working most effectively for the destruction of the nation.  The backbone of the Irish nation will be smashed in ten years if the present policy of the Land Commission is allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One meets with courtesy and a certain amount of efficiency from a great many members of the staff of the Land Commission.  One has no quarrel with these people.  We do not attack the permanent officials of the Minister.  The Minister is responsible for this policy, but apparently the Minister is not able or willing to make Irish nationality prevail in the Land Commission.  He is not able or willing to save Irish nationality. I have listened to the debate here, and I have listened to the speeches made from the Cumann na nGaedheal benches, and it is clear to me that the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies are not satisfied with the administration of the Land Commission. Not only are they not satisfied, but they realise that there is something like a big issue at stake now.  There is something here which must be done if the Irish nation is to be saved.  The something that is to be done will come from these Benches rather than from the Government Benches.  The characteristics of the policy of the Land Commission at this time are delay and the high prices of land. These characteristics have not changed.  The whole land war ranged around the handing of the land over to the people at as moderate a price as possible, and at as quick a rate as possible.  Land Act after Land Act has been defeated by the same powers and influences that are driving the unfortunate people now out of Ireland by preventing them from getting land at a reasonable price and from getting the money to work the land.  These influences are working very effectively.  It <Col N="887" /> seems there is no power able to stop these influences in the carrying on of that work.  So far as the prices of land are concerned, they seem to be dominated by minds whose decisions are in keeping with the same mentality as that which advocated the execution of our men in Easter Week.  If the Irish nation is to be destroyed, the best way to do it is by destroying the small farmer in Ireland, for he is the backbone of the Irish nation.  The Irish nation is not composed of the rancher or the large farmer.  The Irish nation is composed of the general mixed type of farmer, the small farmer, and if he is ruined the Irish nation is ruined.</P>
    <P>They are the keepers of the traditions of Irish nationality.  They have been the backbone of resistance to British influence in this country and every fight for freedom has been fought by the small farmers and the workers.  The policy of the Government at present is a policy of letting the land go into ranches.  We have had an indication of that this evening when it was suggested that our policy was that the land should not be divided.  However important it is to end the question of delay in vesting, it is equally important that the land should be divided.  After all it is by their fruits that you judge them.  In Waterford, you have farms that were sold under previous Land Acts which have now become derelict, and some of them have been bought by ranchers who are actually taking the roofs off the houses on those lands in order that they might not have to pay rates.  These things appear to happen by accident, but they do not happen by accident, because I believe that if you had the right type of dominating influence in the Land Commission it could prevent these things, and it would divide up the ranches.  It could acquire the land and divide the ranches, and give them to small holders and other people who are deserving of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two different <Col N="888" /> types of land in mind.  First of all, there is land which was sold under other Land Acts.  I know that there is a difficulty in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>And vested in the tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Then there are the cases referred to by Deputy Gorey which, owing to lack of money or for other reasons, have been put on the market and sold to large farmers in the neighbourhood, who allow the lands in some cases to run into weeds and who use them merely for grazing purposes.  That, I submit, is completely defeating the object of the land movement, which was to divide the land amongst the moderate-sized farmers.  Here you have land drifting back into the condition in which you have nothing but ranches.</P>
      <P>I admit that it is difficult for the Land Commission to deal with such land, because it would be expensive for them to re-buy it.  I do not know whether they have statutory powers to prevent land accumulating in the hands of such individuals, and to see that those farms would be sold only to men who have not farms or, at least, large farms.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will enlighten us on the point as to whether they have such powers, but, if they have, they are not trying to exercise them.  Then there is the case of untenanted land.  The speakers on behalf of the Land Commission, both the Minister for Agriculture and the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands and Fisheries, emphasised the particular point of view that they are now willing to concentrate on the vesting of land, and not to go in so much for the dividing of untenanted land.  There is really no excuse for doing one and neglecting to do the other.  Both should go hand in hand.  You have the scandal of the dismissal of a number of temporary inspectors at a time when they are most needed for the purpose of distributing land. Seventeen of them, I think, have been dismissed.  That is the kind of economy over which no sensible Government could stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine inspectors have been dismissed at a time when the Land Commission is complaining of pressure of work and of not being able to get through with it.  I questioned an official in the Land Commission recently whose characteristic is frankness.  I asked him if he thought that our Bill could be made effective.  He said that Lord MacDonnell had asked him a similar question about the rapidity of vesting land in 1913, and had quoted Wyndham who, when introducing the 1903 Act, said that all the land would be vested in the Irish peasant in ten years.  It was in 1913 that Lord MacDonnell spoke to this official, who replied, &ldquo;Well, I hope that the work in the Land Commission will last for my lifetime.&rdquo;  In other words, he expressed just the view that the Parliamentary Secretary expressed the other day in his speech, when he said that there are a number of people on the staff of the Land Commission, and that they all have to be kept occupied, and for that reason the land of Ireland must be kept unoccupied.  That is subordinating the end to the means. If there is any sacrifice to be made in this matter, and I do not believe there is, it is ultimately the staff of the Land Commission who should be sacrificed to the farmers of Ireland, and not the other way about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether recruiting for the Land Commission has been stopped but certainly it should be stopped.  That, at least, would do something to prevent the accumulation of vested interests, except in so far as it is necessary to take on men who would make the work go more rapidly.  It is always possible to draft men from one Department to another, and even if the Land Commission completed its work in five years, useful work could be found in another Department for the Land Commission staff.  It is remarkable <Col N="890" /> to contrast the rapidity with which annuities are collected on the one hand and the slowness with which the work of acquisition and vesting of lands goes on on the other.  There is one case which I would like to mention in County Waterford and that is the case of the Bosanquet estate, where you have a landlord who is willing and anxious to sell his estate and have it divided up amongst the men who have proved over a period of years to be good workers on that estate.  He has had the greatest difficulty in carrying that scheme through.  There is apparently the influence of the strong farmers who want to divide the land amongst farmers who already have sufficient land for their own purposes.  I suggest that as there is absolutely no difficulty in dividing up that estate it should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible and divided up amongst those who were workers on the estate.  I suggest also that that is in keeping with the best policy adopted in the past by the Land Commission.  In 1926, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins when speaking on the Lynam case expressed annoyance because some of the Lords of Appeal had said that the vesting of Irish land and the completion of land purchase would take a very long time.  He said: &ldquo;The materials necessary for giving the Act effect being now mostly at hand, the proceedings will develop rapidly and at the expiration of about three years it is anticipated that fully 75 per cent. of the tenanted land will be vested and that over 60 per cent. of the available untenanted land will be divided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that 200,000 out of the 690,000 acres of untenanted land, had been divided&mdash;that is to say, 29 per cent. and not 60 per cent. which was the calculation made by the late Mr. O'Higgins.  The number of judicial holdings which remain to be vested is 49,560, and the number of non-judicial holdings, 33,692.  The total number of holdings is 88,702, and of these only 6 per cent. has been vested.  Compare the 29 percent. and the 6 per cent. with the <Col N="891" /> late Mr. O'Higgins's promises of 60 per cent. and 75 per cent. respectively. A great responsibility rests upon those members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who feel deeply convinced that this is one of the biggest issues which this House has had to face.  Mere individual detailed criticism of the conduct of the Land Commission is not going to effect anything.  It has been going on from year to year.  It will go on again.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party in power have not got the right point of view.  The Minister for Agriculture has definitely stated that he stands for the 200 acre farm. It is well-known that he wants to prevent the ranches from being divided up.  The time has come when those members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who feel strongly on this question ought to reconsider their whole position, and to see which is the Party which stands for the small farmers of Ireland, which is the Party relies on the small farmers and the workers and to realise further that if they are to be true to the traditions of Irish nationality and the future of the Irish race, they must vote against this Estimate and for the amendment, and show that they are not giving mere lip service, and that they are not trying to do something that is dishonest.  I believe they are honest.  I believe they really wish to serve the nation, but it is by their acts we will judge them, by their vote on this question, and by nothing else.</P>

I got from the Minister a reply to the effect that he had got the resolution and copies of the affidavits, and that the explanation was that these men had come to the house which had been mentioned to hold a courtmartial on certain comrades of theirs, but that the other members did not turn up, that they had been frightened away probably by the fact that the police had come along.  He said that he had obtained full reports on the matter, that he had read the documents, and that he had come to the conclusion that these allegations were designed to cover their own criminal conspiracies, that is, the criminal conspiracies, as he alleges, of the comrades of the men who had made affidavits.  He said that he did not propose to take any further action in the matter.  Now, I should like the House to hear what was stated on oath by the men in question. I want to ask the House whether they are satisfied with the action that the Minister for Justice took&mdash;or, rather, his inaction&mdash;in this matter; whether they are satisfied that these men deliberately perjured themselves for no other reason than to cover up, as the Minister says, their criminal conspiracies.</P>
      <P>One of the affidavits&mdash;the affidavit of Michael Cahill&mdash;sets forth that he had been at the house of Frank McDermott, Crossmore, Kilmurray McMahon, Co. Clare.  Whilst there a number of C.I.D. men entered, amongst them being men named Harmon, Keyes, Driscoll, MacTiernan, O'Sullivan, Larkin, Hanley, Murphy and Mullins.  These were men whom he recognised.  They came in with drawn revolvers, and then he states that at about 11 o'clock the following took place:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harman then said &ldquo;Come on up here the field.&rdquo;  I was taken to the centre of the field at the rere of the house.  Harman again insisted that I should answer his questions, but again I refused. His queries were accompanied by suggestive clickings of his revolver. <Col N="893" /> After a few minutes and without any provocation on my part, I was seized by the hair of the head by Harman and struck backwards to the ground.  After getting up, I was taken towards MaeDermott's house by Harman and another policeman.  When I arrived at MaeDermott's, Harman ordered me, saying, &ldquo;Go and put your back to that wall.&rdquo;  I stood up by the wall and the police went towards the door.  Some minutes afterwards, I saw John Hassett being taken out by the police.  I saw them bringing him to the field at the rere of the house.  I was then approached by C.I.D. man Hanley, who said: &ldquo;Come on this way,&rdquo; pointing to the haggard at the front of the house.  I walked towards the haggard accompanied by Hanley, who was followed by two others of the police party. While going through the haggard and without any words, warning, or provocation, I was set upon by Hanley and savagely kicked on the back and legs.  I was practically kicked out of the haggard into the adjoining field.  Here I received numberless kicks and blows, which showered down upon me like rain.  I was felled to the ground several times with blows and kicks.  After some time, I was asked by Hanley: &ldquo;What rank do you hold in the Army?&rdquo; I made no reply, whereupon I received another rain of savage blows and kicks.  After this, I saw others of the police party approaching. They gathered round me, and Hanley now asked me: &ldquo;Are you going to put this in the paper.&rdquo;  He asked me this question several times.  I was again assaulted by Hanley and others. I was knocked up against the fence, where I received a further series of merciless blows and kicks all over the body.  At the time I heard one of the police say: &ldquo;We will give him the full charge.&rdquo;  I was pulled from the fence and, while standing, one of the police delivered a calculated and deliberate blow on my <Col N="894" /> stomach.  I was further chucked and knocked about.  At last, I was felled to the ground unconscious. On recovering, I was threatened to be shot by one of the police, who squared out and drew his revolver with the apparent intention of carrying out his murder threat.  After some minutes, I was ordered to proceed towards MaeDermott's and commenced to go there, but I heard another of the police saying: &ldquo;Bring him on this way.&rdquo;  I was brought from the field towards MaeDermott's house.  I was now in a dazed and battered condition. I was bleeding freely from cuts in the face.  My clothes were covered with mud and dirt from the number of times I was knocked to the ground.</P>
    <P>That is one affidavit.  I will read for Deputies portion of another affidavit relating to the same occasion. This is the affidavit of John Hassett. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I was ordered by one of them&mdash; (that is the C.I.D.)&mdash;who said, &ldquo;Come on down here the field.&rdquo; I was taken to the centre of the field, about forty yards at the rere of the house.  I was then questioned as follows: &ldquo;Were you here last night before?&rdquo; My answers were not apparently considered satisfactory by the police.  I was struck on the side of the head and rushed upon and knocked to the ground.  While on the ground, I was kicked on the hip and shoulder. On arising from the ground, I was struck several blows by C.I.D. man Keyes in the face and shoulders, and pressed backwards towards the fence of the field.  I was knocked up against this fence and questioned as follows: &ldquo;Do you know Ryan?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is it long since you met him?&rdquo;&ldquo;Tell us the last time you saw him?&rdquo;&ldquo;Was it a week, a fortnight, or a month?&rdquo; I finally said I would refuse to answer any of their questions, whereupon I was again assaulted and knocked to the ground.  On getting up, replies to the questions were again demanded of me.  I again refused to answer.  One of the police then <Col N="895" /> said, &ldquo;We must give you the lead.&rdquo;  After some time I was taken towards the house and told to come along down the avenue. While going down the avenue I was asked by one of the police, &ldquo;Are you a Volunteer?&rdquo; I refused to answer, whereupon the police then said, &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to answer when we get you down here a bit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice wants us to believe that the men who swore these statements did so in order to cover up their criminal conspiracies. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister for Justice. He is a fish out of water in his present position.  He is left here night after night, by men who know the circumstances, to meet charges like this.</P>

      <P>We understand the sort of happiness the Minister for Justice speaks of.  He is trying to develop a rhinoceros hide.  It is a very serious matter for the people of the country generally that there should be a man in the position who knows as little about the circumstances he is dealing with as does the Minister for Justice.  We know that the men who are responsible for these threatenings are following a tradition which left us a legacy in this country which we will find it very difficult to get completely rid of.  Deputies coming into this House a few days ago were handed a leaflet in which were set out the circumstances of the murder&mdash;the brutal murder&mdash;a short time ago of some eighteen men.  They were arrested, taken out into the country and shot.  Deputy Hogan raised this question first.  On the particular day on which I put this question on the Paper, there was a question raised by Deputy Corrv relating to the same thing.  This thing is happening all over the country, and if we are going to be safe from a repetition of this, we will have to have somebody in the Ministry of Justice who will take his duties seriously, <Col N="896" /> and will not be a mere cipher.  The Minister for Justice should realise that his is the most responsible position there is in the Cabinet at the present time in connection with matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether he realises that or not.  We think he is a mere rubber stamp either for the people who are in his Department or for his colleagues in the Ministry who leave him this most responsible job&mdash;a job they should have giyen to one of their members who knows the circumstances thoroughly, and who would be able to deal with them.  You require for this office a man of determination&mdash;a man who is determined that he will have a disciplined force under him and a force that will command respect in the country.  Instead of that, his replies here give the impression to anybody listening to him that he is condoning the irregularities and the brutalities of these men under him.  When we ask that there should be an inquiry, he puts the question: &ldquo;Why do they not go and bring a civil action?&rdquo; He knows perfectly well that the State is financing appeals when cases of this kind are brought up, and that the men who bring these cases have not got the same purse behind them that the Minister for Justice has.  He should know perfectly well that these men are interpreting this inaction on his part, this condoning on his part as an encouragement, whether he means to do so or not. That is why we have this thing taken up in one part of the country and going all round.  We all know the circumstances in Dublin.  I have affidavits in respect of Dublin.  In the case of Clare alone, there are seven affidavits.  I have another one that was mentioned by Deputy Hogan in to-day's paper.  I am going to let Deputy Hogan continue this particular debate, because it was he who brought this matter before the House first.  So far as we are concerned, we regard the attitude of the Minister for Justice as altogether unjustifiable and absolutely unworthy of anybody who holds the position of Minister for Justice.  We think he is acting in a way that involves <Col N="897" /> serious danger to the country. This whole campaign and all these arrests follow on the policy that was apparently started by the Government in the Dublin election.  They behaved in a manner that I would regard as indecent in this connection.</P>

But this sort of thing which is happening all over the country&mdash;which is widespread&mdash;is not a matter about which we should delay a single hour.  I say that every Deputy here should raise his voice against this sort of thing and use whatever influence he has, whatever party he belongs to, to bring it to an end.  I say the responsibility is greatest on the supporters of the present Executive.  Every one of them who has any regard whatever for fair play and justice, who has any regard for the rights of private citizens of this country, should make his influence felt, so that, though the Minister has developed a rhinoceros hide, there will be some way of penetrating it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so anxious that the Minister should give us some definite and clear reply on this question, that I am going to be very brief.  I am not going to give him any excuse to avoid the issue, if he is desirous of an excuse. As I understand it, specific statements have been submitted in certain cases.  These statements were <Col N="898" /> submitted to the premier body in Co. Clare and also to an Urban District Council in Co. Clare.  They have asked in very explicit terms for a sworn inquiry into the matter contained in these sworn statements. The Minister suggested to-day, as he suggested in previous replies, that these resolutions were inspired by criminally-minded people to cover up their own criminal activities and to create an atmosphere.  Speaking as a local representative in Co. Clare&mdash; I mean as a representative on the Co. Council&mdash;I repudiate emphatically the statement that Clare Co. Council would be either frightened or obliged by action of any kind, or by coercion of any kind, to pass a resolution, as it did unanimously, to create an atmosphere for any party or for any criminally-minded people in any county.  I repudiate that very emphatically.  As Vice-Chairman of the Co. Council I repudiate it, and I tell the Minister that Clare Co. Council has never been badgered and never been forced to pass a resolution of that kind by criminally-minded people.  The resolution was put in very explicit terms, and it gives the Minister the opportunity of clearing the detective division of the Gárda Síochána from any blame in this matter.  The resolution states:</P>
      <P>We earnestly beg to impress upon the Government of the Free State the very grave and serious menace to the welfare and peace of mind of the citizens by allowing such allegations to remain uninquired into, as such a course of proceeding by the elected Government, whether arising from apathy or disdain, will lead the common people of this country to believe that the liberty of the subject has ceased and that this country has reverted to the conditions that existed during the period of the Black and Tan régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not seem to be a resolution which was drafted to hide the activities of criminally-minded people or to create an atmosphere.  That is a resolution rather to clear the atmosphere and to let people in the county know what is happening. The Minister stated he made inquiries. <Col N="899" /> From whom?  What machinery did he use for the inquiries? Did he ask the people who were charged to make inquiries on his behalf?  I made inquiries.  When this resolution came to me couched in these terms and speaking of the Black and Tan régime, I instituted inquiries.  None of us has happy memories of the Black and Tan régime. I asked two or three persons who have to go through the district in West Clare, where these things are alleged to have occurred, what was the position.  One of these persons was a Government supporter. I do not think he would give me a vote in a hundred years, and I do not think he would give Deputy de Valera a vote in any circumstances. I inquired very minutely, and I asked him was there a state of terror in the district.  He told me that the people were as much afraid of being beaten, struck and ill-treated as they were during the Black and Tan régime.  I inquired from another man who has to go through the district every fortnight, and possibly every week.  He told me that a state of terror did exist.  He told me that the only difference between the position now and the position during the Black and Tan régime was that the people were not as much afraid now of being shot as they were then, but that they were just as much afraid of being ill-treated, beaten and molested.  I put it to the Minister, if he is so positive there is no evidence whatever on this matter, that he should take the Clare Co. Council at its word and institute an inquiry. There is no danger of any innocent people being prejudiced. The names of the Gárda are mentioned. If he is so positive that there is no evidence, then he should grant an inquiry as regards the Clare C.I.D. in respect of these statements. That is an easy matter.  He should give every chance.  I tell him distinctly that he ought not to tell this Dáil or to tell the country that any public body in Co. Clare has been inspired by any criminally-minded person, or badgered by any <Col N="900" /> organisation, to pass a resolution that will hide, or attempt to hide, people who are criminally-minded or create an atmosphere for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank Deputy de Valera for his very kind remarks about me.  They are a little inconsistent, because I find that I am a mere bit of sealing-wax at one moment, and at another moment that I have such a rhinoceros hide that even the trenchent eloquence of Deputy de Valera cannot make any impression upon it.  What are the facts of this particular matter?  You have Guards who have got to do their duty.  You have got Guards who are facing men who are engaged in a criminal conspiracy against the liberties of the citizens of this State.  You have such a force existing, and you know it.  You know that, unfortunately, there have been recently two very serious crimes committed, and you know it is the duty of the Guards to prevent that criminal association actively working.  What happened?  The Guards arrest. Whenever a Guard arrests a person there is no simpler thing for him to do than to make a charge of brutality, a charge of having been assaulted, and then he can come here to the Dáil and through Deputy de Valera, or through some other Deputy of that Party, he can pull the strings and make the Deputies opposite dance to his bidding&mdash;that is when he is endeavouring to bring charges against the Guards to prevent them discharging their duty.  These men know&mdash;every single man of them knows&mdash;that the Guards are an effective force, that the Guards are a well-disciplined, a well-organised and a well-conducted force.  The only method by which they can carry on is simply to endeavour to discredit the Guards in the eyes of the public. That they have heretofore failed to do, and that they will fail to do in the future, even though at every single request they make Deputy de Valera or somebody like him can be got to make charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter which has been raised to-night is rather old.  I have not got the actual date by me, but it is <Col N="901" /> a couple of months old.  If my recollection is not at fault, it occurred some time early in March.  Perhaps the Deputy would tell me the date in the affidavits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is earlier than I thought.  The matter is over two months old and is now brought up in the Dáil.  It is alleged that these men were assaulted. There were the courts; why have they not gone to the courts?  There is need, we are told, for a public inquiry; there is need for setting up a special tribunal.  If these men have any grievance, they have the ordinary courts to go into.  They can ventilate their grievance in the ordinary court if they have a grievance. If they were assaulted they can go into the ordinary courts.  Two months have passed.  They have not availed of the law that exists and they have not availed themselves of the courts as they could have done. What have they done?  They have gone to the Co. Council, and the Co. Council, without any more information than these affidavits before them have passed a resolution. They have gone to the Urban Council, and the Urban Council, without having anything more than these affidavits before them have passed a similar resolution.  Why do not these men go into the courts if they have got any grievance?  The courts are there to right any wrong that any citizen of this country may suffer. What is the object of debates of this nature here?  Why does not Deputy de Valera say to these men, if he is in touch with them, and why does not Deputy Hogan through his Co. Council&mdash;I hope he is not in touch with them&mdash;say to them: &ldquo;You have the ordinary courts there and you should avail of the ordinary courts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has not been done.  Why has it not been done?  It is much simpler to go before Peace Commissioners and swear affidavits and get publicity in this Dáil.  It is a simpler thing to do that and to take, one after another, the Deputies from the <Col N="902" /> Opposition Benches; lately it appears Deputy Hogan is joining in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever a citizen has been wronged.  Deputy Hogan's idea is that there should be a sworn inquiry.  What are the ordinary courts for?  Why are we to set up special tribunals?  Special tribunals are only set up in certain circumstances in which the courts cannot reasonably be expected to function.  Are we to set up a special tribunal for every person who says he has been assaulted by the Guards and who is willing to swear affidavits? We know what the value of affidavits is.  To hear Deputy de Valera talk you would think that nobody in this country had ever been known to tell anything but the truth when on his oath.  Deputy de Valera seems to think that because a statement is made by affidavit it must be true, that everybody who makes an affidavit is a perfectly reliable person, who has been telling the truth, and can do nothing else but tell the truth.  That is Deputy de Valera's seeming position.  My position is completely different.  I consider that when any allegations are made against the Guards it is for me to look into these allegations and see if a prima facie case has been established.  If so, then I am responsible for the discipline of the Guards, and I see that the Guards are disciplined, and if any Guard misconducts himself he suffers punishment.  That is the regular course which has never been deviated from, and which will never be deviated from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any single member of this conspiracy&mdash;I do not suppose that anyone <Col N="903" /> in this House will deny that these four men are prominent members in Clare of this particular conspiracy&mdash;considers that by making affidavits before a Peace Commissioner and not going into court, they can have a special sworn inquiry, they are greatly mistaken.  They will not have it.  Deputy de Valera talks about condoning brutalities. There is no condoning of brutalities. If any violence is used by a Guard towards a prisoner, the case is properly investigated and properly dealt with, but there must be a case which requires investigation.  These cases, in my judgment, do not require special investigation of any kind.  They are cases in which the individuals who allege they are aggrieved can take the same course as any other individual in this community&mdash;that is to say, they can avail themselves of the ordinary <Col N="904" /> Courts of Justice which have been set up by this Oireachtas.</P>
