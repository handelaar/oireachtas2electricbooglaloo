      <P>The amount paid <Col N="360" /> for the conveyance of letter mails by the Irish Free State Post Office since April, 1922, when the service was taken over from the British authorities, up to the 31st March last, was £106,633.  This amount was provisional, pending the outcome of negotiations which are still proceeding in conjunction with the British authorities.  Payment for the carriage of parcel mails is made through the Railway Clearing House to which the Post Office pays a lump sum quarterly in respect of its liabilities to all companies concerned. The Post Office has no information as to the amount paid by the Clearing House to any individual company.  The remuneration for the carriage of mails is not assessed on a county basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which has been introduced has <Col N="363" /> three main sections.  I direct Deputies' attention in the first instance to the second sub-section of Section 1.  It proposes that sub-section (5) of Section 11 of the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;five millions, two hundred and ten thousand pounds&rdquo; now contained therein and the insertion in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;five millions, eight hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds.&rdquo;  That is the first purpose of the Bill, to increase the money from £5,210,000, the sum which had previously been granted under the Shannon Electricity Act, to £5,835,000.  The money is to be increased by the difference between £5,210,000 and £5,835,000.  A comparison lies as between these two figures but it is not the comparison that is shown merely by subtracting the one item from the other.  I will go into that in detail more fully immediately.  The first purpose of the Bill is to increase the money previously voted for the purpose of the construction of the Shannon Electricity Works, as defined in the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not mean the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am dealing with the definition in the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is set out in Section 2.  Section 2 amends Section 12 of the Act of 1927 by deleting sub-section (2) of Section 12 of that Act, and reading for it what is down here.  Again, I will go into this in more detail in a moment, but I want to get the purpose clear first.  In Section 12 of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927 it is set out that certain sums of money are to be advanced to the Electricity Supply Board.  While sub-section (3) of Section 12 of that Act, with which we are not dealing by way of amendment in this Bill, gave the amount of money which it was proposed and which it is still proposed to hand over to the Electricity <Col N="364" /> Supply Board for the purpose of distribution throughout the Free State.  Sub-section (2) dealt with a different matter, and it is sub-section (2) that I am proposing to deal with on this occasion.  I only mention sub-section (3) to indicate that we are not changing the amount granted under that sub-section to the Electricity Supply Board for their purposes.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) had this purpose: Under the old Act a sum of £5,210,000 was voted for the purpose of carrying out the Shannon construction works.  A certain division had always been assumed in this sum.  These were the moneys to be expended actually on construction. There was a further sum of money to meet interest on the capital expended on the construction works during the process of building, and during the two or three early years in which it was recognised by the experts that Shannon revenue would not amount to the Shannon expenditure. Extra capital was provided by way of making up for the deficit. We made, acting on the experts advice, a rough and ready calculation in this way: the actual construction money worked out at £4,600,000, and a sum of money to an amount of £600,000 was to be devoted to the payment of interest on the construction moneys during the period of years in which the Shannon scheme was not expected to be a self-supporting scheme, and for the maintenance and operation of the Shannon works when handed over to the Electricity Supply Board in the early years in which their revenue would not equal their actual charges.  Sub-section (2) laid down that there was to be handed to the Electricity Supply Board, in addition to the sum of £2,500,000 mentioned in the next sub-section, whatever portion of the £5,210,000 I did not spend, or else a maximum of £600,000.  The maximum of £600,000 was put in to meet objections to the effect that I was trying to get two sums of £600,000, the old sum of £600,000 mentioned as being interest on erection money, and the new £600,000 that it was <Col N="365" /> presumed I was managing to hand over secretly to the Electricity Supply Board.  It was stated that I was really giving them £3,100,000 instead of £2,500,000.  To meet that objection it was laid down that the Minister shall hand over to the Electricity Supply Board such part of the £5,210,000 as he has not spent on construction, subject to the overriding maximum that that should not be a greater sum than £600,000.</P>
    <P>It is clear why that distinction was made.  If I happened to get the works completed very much earlier than was anticipated&mdash;a year or one and a half years earlier&mdash;I would not have had to spend any portion of the £600,000 myself.  That was the point put to me, although I could not see the circumstances in which I would have spent only the construction moneys and would have £600,000 interest and arrears money to hand over to the Electricity Supply Board.  View now the more natural course of events, and it would have been this: I would spend £4,600,000 on construction works and I would spend some of the £600,000 in meeting interest charges on the moneys put into building from time to time as the work was proceeding and I would have to hand to the Electricity Supply Board some indefinite sum, something that was a subtraction at the most of £4,600,000, my construction costs, from £5,210,000 voted, or some lesser sum according as my construction costs grew, my liability for interest grew, and the time period went against me.  We propose now to delete that sub-section and instead to put in a definite sum of £156,000.  That represents 3 per cent. of the capital costs, and is in accord with the Siemens project and the opinion of the experts.  It is now clear that by the autumn I shall have spent all the money voted for construction and shall have met all interest charges thereon to date of the autumn.</P>
    <P>All that has to be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board now is the three per cent. on the increased capital cost of construction, <Col N="366" /> that being the sum which the experts said was the right sum to meet both interest on construction costs, and also the deficiencies during the early years when the revenue is not expected to be equal to the expenditure. That is somewhat involved. I do not know if I have explained it.  We had £5,210,000. We had a division of that sum&mdash; £4,600,000 to be spent and actually put into building, and £600,000 to pay both the interest on the money put into building, and to provide the moneys which the Electricity Supply Board, or the Board operating the scheme, would have to obtain in order to be able to function and to preserve and maintain the essential works during the period in which their revenue would not be entirely adequate for their purpose. We know now that we will have spent a certain amount of money on construction work up to the late autumn of this year, and we will have met the interest on that with the principal sum of £5,800,000 which I am asking for.  So we see we are able to determine accurately &mdash;it is not final, but it is fairly accurate&mdash;and we are in a position now to get away from the involved calculation of £5,200,000, minus whatever moneys have been spent on construction and meeting interest charges, up to a maximum of £600,000.  We are in a position to determine it accurately, and to say that we are giving £156,000. That is the second purpose of the Bill.  It is to determine the amount of money to be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board in addition to the two and a half millions for their own operating expenses, the building of new distribution network, and the taking over of other works, etc.</P>
    <P>There are other clauses in the Bill, which amount simply to this, that the difficult question of navigation, which always complicated the Shannon construction works, and especially complicated the Shannon accounts, is dealt with here in a limited way.  Previously the experts had reckoned that incidental <Col N="367" /> to the construction of the building, the excavation of the canal and the building of the earthworks, there could be brought about an improvement of navigation on the river.  They added up all the incidentals that they saw occurring, and they estimated the cost of these to be about £94,000.  As the Shannon electrification was interfering with navigation by the old channel they considered it equitable to charge against the scheme the cost of providing a lock in the Weir at Parteen Villa.  They felt that a sum of about £20,000 would supply that lock.  In the old scheme we set out to charge the £20,000 against the Shannon, against the consumers of electricity eventually, and £74,000 against the navigation to be got out of tolls paid by the users of the navigation.  The amount spent in the improvement of navigation has gone up.  We must later decide how this is to be met.  That is not determined in this Bill, but the one thing determined is that that sum of money is not to be paid back, as at present things go, by the consumers of electricity. There is an increase of navigation facilities.  Navigation has been improved. It is costing more than was previously estimated, and we say that navigation is not to be charged against electricity consumers except to the extent of £20,000, which was the estimate for the provision of the lock and the weir.</P>
    <P>We set aside that sum of £132,000. We say that how we shall repay that sum is not finally determined here. It will come up for settlement later on.</P>
    <P>The fourth and last thing which the Bill sets out is that the Electricity Supply Board are not to be asked to pay interest on the £132,000, the amount now decided on as the figure that has been spent on the navigation of the Shannon. These are the purposes of the Bill:&mdash; First, the increase in the amount of money for the Shannon construction from £5,210,000 to £5,835,000. Secondly, the determination, as precisely <Col N="368" /> as we can at this moment, of the amount of money to be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board in addition to the two-and-a-half millions of distribution money to enable them to meet interest on money to be spent on buildings hereafter to be handed over to them, and to meet the deficiency in their revenue in the earlier years.  We reckon this sum to be £156,000.  The other purpose of the Bill is to segregate the amount spent on navigation and to say that in this Bill that money shall not be charged on the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And what you are doing is that you are leaving the electricity consumers to pay interest on the £20,000 but not on the £132,000?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether the £5,835,000 includes the £156,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the £156,000 is additional to the £5,835,000.</P>
      <P>I want to make a comparison between the £5,210,000 and the £5,835,000 plus the £156,000.  Originally there was a Vote for generation, transmission and distribution of Shannon power to the consumers. There were, as between the 1925 and the 1927 Acts, two sums of money, £5,210,000 and £2,500,000.  The second sum, the £2,500,000, is not being charged, so that we can banish it from the present calculation.  There remains, therefore, this comparison &mdash;the sum of £5,210,000 previously voted for generating, transmitting, and supplying Shannon current and the bigger amount now sought, £5,835,000 plus £136,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first contrast is between the £5,210,000 and the £5,835,000, increased <Col N="369" /> by £156,000.  As at present proposed, consumers of electricity are not going to meet certain navigation costs.  Therefore, a deduction has to be made from some side of these accounts, possibly from both. The £5,210,000 did include a sum of £20,000 navigation money properly chargeable against consumers of electricity&mdash;the cost of providing a lock in the weir.  The £5,210,000 included nothing else.  It did not include the £74,000 which the navigation was known to cost additional to the £20,000.  The £5,835,000 includes the £20,000 previously included in the £5,210,000 and in addition includes the £132,000.  Let us wipe out the £20,000 that is common to both. The comparison therefore is between the £5,210,000, the old sum, and the £5,835,000 increased by £156,000 and decreased by the navigation costs of £132,000.  I want to put it in that way because it shows the steps of the calculation.</P>
    <P>I want to build up on the other side.  £5,210,000 was the best estimate at the time when the Shannon Electricity Bill was going through the Dáil of the cost of the Siemens Schuckert project, but at the very time that legislation was going through the project which had been previously put up by Siemens Schuckert was being finally examined by four experts.  These experts made suggestions as to improvements and modifications.  Some of them were known to us, but it was undergoing a final examination when legislation was going through the House and I got what was referred to as an addendum to the Report when it was too late for me to have the sums voted increased. That addendum put on £100,000 to the scheme.  The experts had modified the Siemens Schuckert Report at an increased cost of £100,000. In other words, if I had been coming to the Dáil two months later, the bill of costs would not have been any longer £5,210,000, but £5,310,000.  There were modifications, mainly safeguarding modifications, introduced by them and they ran up the bill by £100,000. <Col N="370" /> There is one other addition to be made to the £5,210,000.  Under the old project, payment for pole-sites, poles which carried transmission lines, was calculated on an annual rental basis.  We have gone on a different plan in carrying out the work.  We do not pay annually any rental.  We buy out the sites and the moneys for the purchase of the whole sites are included in the £5,835,000. As a balance to this the yearly rents will not have to be found by the Electricity Supply Board, but they will have to find the interest on the money now capitalised for the purchase of the pole sites.  Supposing we take the money set aside under the old project as rents for pole sites, and capitalise that, it adds another £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us the parallel figure, the actual cost of the pole sites?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose not to go into certain figures, and I ask the indulgence of the Dáil for not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible, the House would, I think, be anxious to do that, but where we are offered two alternative figures and when we are asked to put one figure against the other we should have the two figures.  We do not want to press for figures which might embarrass, but if a figure is offered as an alternative, a parallel figure, we should have both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that as the Minister is dealing with moneys expended and is accounting for them, in a sense, it is no use giving figures unless we get what the capital value is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to state the amount of expenditure incurred, if it were fixed and certain, but the difficulty I am in is that I have bought only about one-quarter of the pole-sites, and if I revealed my figures I may be mulcted more heavily.  As long as costs are <Col N="371" /> in question I do not think that I should be asked about the moneys I paid so that owners of sites can put them in contrast with the money that I am allowed to pay.  The comparison would not, in fact, always suit the people from whom I am buying sites or acquiring land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to state exactly how many sites he bought or what he has spent on those he has bought.  I am asking him to give us an idea, irrespective of what he has bought, what he thinks the total cost will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple matter to calculate the number of sites required and, if the cost were given, by a process of simple division, to find the cost per pole.  If people think that what I am doing at the moment is cloaking expenditure I make this offer to the House.  I am prepared, after the whole thing has been completed, to introduce a token Vote of £10 in order to enable Deputies to see what the actual difference is between estimates and costs when completed.  The whole thing will be revealed hereafter.  It will not be very long from now, nine months at the latest, when the actual amounts can be given without any item of estimates in them.  I must keep to the region of estimates just now and consequently hide certain things at the moment.  So I get back to my comparison.  I was comparing £5,210,000 with £5,835,000, increased by £156,000 and decreased by £132,000.  I have spoken of two sums of £100,000 each.  There is one of these sums of £100,000 that may be in dispute.  The experts' report added on another £100,000 to the cost, which, it might be said, should not be taken in here as it was not before the Dáil.  One item of £100,000 may be wiped out of the comparison by people who accept that argument.  Where the justice of the case lies will have to be seen afterwards.  I am asking the <Col N="372" /> Dáil to allow this comparison to be made&mdash;£5,210,000 plus £100,000, the capitalised value of the pole sites, plus £100,000, the addendum made in the Experts' Report, the additions to the scheme, making a sum of £5,410,000 on one side to be compared with £5,860,000 on the other side.  There is an increase of £450,000. Again, there are certain items that I cannot go into at the moment, but I can give the bigger items of increase. I would like to get one point firmly established at the moment, because establishing that point is a tribute not merely to the contracting firm who carried out the work, but to the Irish engineers who have watched and kept down the costs of building and kept the work within the limits of the moneys I have spoken of here.  There is a sum of £450,000, or £350,000 in the case of people who accept the second £100,000, to be explained. £150,000 of that goes for administrative expenses during the period of construction.  It is not all expended at the moment, but I have a calculation to cover all the administrative expenses I see ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my own office and outside.  It is the payment to engineers on the scheme of £150,000, for which no provision whatever had been made under the old scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea at one time was there might be a free grant from the Government towards the suggested scheme.  I am not accepting that as point because, when we come to a comparison of the estimates of consumption, we will see that there is no necessity to worry about that £150,000.  Under the old accounts, there was no mention of contingencies. Of the £453,000, £53,000 is under that heading.  I have included this time the sum of about £53,000 for contingencies. There was no item previously for contingencies.  That was commented on at the time.  I am giving <Col N="373" /> a fairly liberal allowance, but I say I am not asking for more money than I think the item is going to cost. I want to present the Dáil with the best picture I can of final costs, and I have included £53,000 for contingencies. That leaves over £250,000 or £350,000 spent on the work more than had been contemplated. There are two big headings.  I will have to deal with this in two sets of figures, one set being addressed to the people who do not accept the £100,000 of the addendum, and the other set for those who do. The civil works have gone up by £234,000.  The electrical and mechanical works have gone up by £134,000.  For the people who accept the take-off of the second £100,000, the civil works have gone up by the sum of £140,000.  Electrical and mechanical works have gone up by a sum of £133,000.  May I put that figure in another way? As far as these two items are concerned, the Experts' addendum put on £95,000, roughly, to the civil works, and something short of £1,000 to the electrical and mechanical works; so that on the work done on the digging of the canal, the excavation of earth, the digging out of rock and earth, the building of banks, the building of the power-house, the installation of the turbines and the transmission system through the country, there has been an increase on the estimate for the actual construction costs, on the one hand, of £140,000, and on the other of £133,000 or £134,000.</P>
    <P>When one considers the rather lugubrious forecast made when this Bill was going first through the Dáil, when one considers all the hidden items there were, all the things that might go wrong and the fact that it was alleged that sufficient borings had not been made or sufficient trial pits dug, and that nobody knew what was the alternation between rock and earth to be excavated, no one knew what the canal bank would cost and no one knew what was going to be the cost of the power house and the intake buildings and all the vast and innumerable hidden items one's <Col N="374" /> imagination could play about with in the early years, the increases I now show are amazingly low indeed.  The canal is now dug to the point when we have almost come to the last item of expenditure on it.  The mechanical and electrical works are so far through that we can see our final costs.  In one case we find an increase of about £143,000 and in the other case an increase of £133,000.  I think the presentation of these two figures constitutes in themselves a tribute to the power of estimation of the firm and the way they carried out the work and the engineers on the scheme who checked out every item on the work. I can go back on these figures to certain further points if it is required and they can be presented in other ways if Deputies view them from different angles.  The costs of the scheme have therefore gone up.  How much they have gone up is a matter people will debate for some little time, and these figures will only get properly established after they have been questioned and tossed about for a bit.  There is something in the region of £500,000 or £600,000 extra to be spent on the scheme, and paid for by future consumers of electricity. In other words, I am contrasting the old sum of £5,200,000 and the new figure, which includes everything that must be charged against electricity consumers.  I leave out of this new figure this £132,000 for navigation, but I include for navigation the £20,000 always thought to be a proper charge on electricity consumers.</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;I include sums to cover the payment for all land acquired or to be acquired.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, revealed as the cost of the Shannon development the sum of £5,835,000 plus £156,000 minus £132,000.  What does the increase of £650,000 mean to future consumers?  To show this I can make many comparisons and use many calculations.  One such comparison is provided on the tables on page 103 of the Experts' Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experts there worked on the basis of two assumptions&mdash;a sale of 110,000,000 units and a scheme costing £5,210,000.  On this they calculated what the revenue of the scheme ought to be to meet the interest and charges, to meet the maintenance and repairs, and a variety of things set out in the Siemens Schuckert Report&mdash;all the charges that would fall against the scheme. They calculated all the revenue that would have to be secured by those afterwards working the scheme in order to make the scheme pay its way&mdash;to meet all necessary expenses.  On page 103 they gave <Col N="376" /> their calculations.  They showed what the price would have to be at the power-house bus bars&mdash; that is to say, what units would have to be sold there and at what price.  There were other calculations of the cost of having the power delivered at the hundred kv. system and the 35 kv. transformer stations and a final cost for delivery of the power in bulk at the end of the ten kv. lines.</P>
    <P>It is calculated if 110,000,000 units were to be sold finally to consumers the price for delivery at the power station would be .41 of a penny; at the end of the 100 kv. system it would be .52 of a penny; at the 35 kv. transformer stations it would be .74d.; at the 10 kv. transformer stations it would be .84d.  The increased final costs now revealed mean that those figures have to be increased in this way: The .41 goes up to .46; the .52 goes up to .59; the .74 goes up to .81, and the last figure, and the figure, I think, I should fasten on for the purpose of comparison, the .84, goes up to .9.  That is the difference in the scheme, looked at in this way.  Instead of there being .84d. charge, there might have to be charged .9.  So we are now in the position that as far as concerns one of the variables in the old Shannon project we can speak now with clarity and precision, and the figure I have quoted shows how much the increase has been.  One of the variables was: How much were the works going to cost?  We did not know that when the scheme was going through.  There were all sorts of mournful prophecies of its eventually costing £11,000,000, £12,000,000, or £15,000,000.  Of course, unit price per current would have to go according to the price of the constructional works and of the whole transmission system.  That was one of the variants.  The cost of the works might have been anything&mdash; one's imagination could multiply it <Col N="377" /> many times.  Actually, here is what we have: The other variable that has to be taken into calculation is&mdash;consider it constant for the purpose of calculation &mdash; the 110,000,000 units to be sold to consumers which, if sold at .9d. instead of .84d. at the 10 kv. transformer station will make the scheme pay. That is the net difference.  If people gave me calculations and time to work them out we could get them worked out in a variety of ways.  That is one good way of looking at it.  That is the net difference: .84d. at the 10 kv. transformer stations now has become .9d.</P>
    <P>I would like to show one further thing against myself in this.  There are certain costs that are a sort of borderline costs between the Electricity Supply Board and myself.  It is very hard to determine sometimes where distribution begins and transmission ends.  At the moment, there are certain moneys that have to be met by the Electricity Supply Board out of the £2,500,000.  I think they are properly met by that Board, but suppose these costs have to go against the Shannon scheme, and I think it is outrageous that they would have to, there would have to be a redistribution of the money, which would make a difference in the cost of the unit at the 10 kv. station.  The highest it would go to in that unlikely event, would be .93d. which adds on another .03d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only on this basis, that there may have to be allocated against the supply in bulk charges which I think are distribution charges and should be met on the distribution side.  It cannot possibly mean any enlargement of the moneys more than £5,835,000, <Col N="378" /> plus £156,000, plus the £2,500,000. The cost that I have put to the £5,835,000 might come off the £2,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the very unlikely contingency I have referred to.  I do not think it is a calculation that can ever be justified. I only mentioned it because there are borderline cases.  We have had certain agreements with regard to charges made against each side, and I think there is a proper division there, but there may have to be a reallocation of the moneys.  The distribution costs may come down and the transmission costs may go up, but I do not think it is probable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made an attempt to figure it out, <Col N="379" /> but he is wrong.  Let me get back to .9 of a penny.  How many units are likely to be sold?  110,000,000 units is what we have to sell. Previously, when I spoke on this matter, I used to go on this type of calculation: First, how many units of electricity are actually being sold in the country?  Look back over a period of years and see what was the normal increase in the electricity sold.  Calculate one other point. Was there any suspicion that we had reached saturation point in certain areas, so that one would say an automatic increase is not likely to occur within the next four years?  We used to calculate round about the time the works would be handed over that there would be an actual consumption in the country&mdash;this is without Shannon power being delivered to anybody&mdash;of about 70,000,000 units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Made in 1924 with reference to 1929.  This was one of the figures that was quoted here when argument was proceeding on the old Act of 1925.  We find that actually on the returns given by statutory, authorised and permitted undertakers that there is a consumption in the country at the moment of 73,000,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything&mdash; lighting, heating, cooking and power, including the tramways, public lighting and other purposes. When I said that the 110,000,000 units had to be sold at .9d. or .84d. under the old calculation I was slightly incorrect, because the 110,000,000 units were divided by the experts into 90,000,000 units for purposes other than heating, and 20,000,000 units for heating, and the 20,000,000 units for heating were to be sold at a very much less rate than the ordinary rate to be charged for lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> So that again to get a calculation I think we should go on this basis: that there is to be sold 90 million units for purposes other than heating and there will have to be sold about 20 million for heating, the latter at a fraction of the price asked for the former.</P>

      <P>I cannot, at present. Sixty-seven million units is returned as being consumed in the year 1928.  If I take the calculation back over the years from 1924, and take the automatic increase year by year, that 67 million units becomes, in 1929, 73½ million units; becomes 81 million units the year after; 89 million units the year after, and 98 million units in 1932, the date at which the experts thought the scheme should be able to pay its way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  1924, 48,662,000; 1925, 51,667,000; 1926, 55,726,000; 1927, 60,447,000.  I have given the rest.  There is the calculation based upon the automatic growth of electricity in the country at the price that ruled before the Shannon power came to be delivered, and without any effort made <Col N="382" /> by the Shannon Supply Board to push electricity into new districts, and without making any impression on the electricity consumers of the State, by reason of the fact that Shannon power was to be delivered by the Electricity Supply Board set up to push the sales.  We are taking the calculation merely on the different rates that at present operate through the country in the towns and small places.  If there was no incentive given to people to consume electricity at any greater rate than previously, if the old price held, if the increase of electricity simply advanced, as it did in the years since 1924, in 1932 we should reach a consumption of 98,000,000 units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will arise later.  I want to take another calculation&mdash;the calculation which the Electricity Supply Board has made as a result of investigations in the country and what they think is the likely result&mdash;at any rate, the result that they hope for, and their hopes are based upon a pretty firm foundation, in 1932.  They divide the experts' figure of 110,000,000 units into three different sections.  They take the 20,000,000 units for heating that I spoke of before, but they divide the other 90,000,000 units into lighting and household purposes, 43½ million units, and power, including tramways, 46½ million units.  The actual consumption for 1928 for lighting and household purposes was 25¾ million units, and the Board calculate that on a very conservative estimate in 1932 we would have reached the 43½ million units which the experts thought likely. They point out that that would represent an increase of fourteen or fifteen per cent. per annum over the years intervening, and the actual consumption taken over a period of years back shows that that has been the increase for household and lighting purposes.  Taking into consideration the fact that the Shannon will be <Col N="383" /> able to deliver current in bulk at less than one penny per unit through the transformer stations everywhere, and the fact that they are pushing into new districts and opening up new areas, they say that it is a conservative calculation that the experts' 43½ million units will undoubtedly be reached in 1932.</P>

      <P>I am going on to power immediately.  Light and household purposes, 43½ million units.  In 1928 the consumption was 25¾ million, and the Electricity Supply Board's calculation is that it is a very conservative estimate to hold that we will have reached the experts' figure of 43½ millions in 1932.  The experts' division then allocated 46½ millions to power.  In 1928 there was being sold 41 million units for power in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure that anything is vitiated, because we have people banking their reputations to a certain extent on the statements they give to me with regard to prospects.  They are the people who have made the investigation and have had agents through the country for one-and-a-half years and they say, as a result of careful calculations, that they are satisfied there is an immediate market in the Saorstát, taking in the three large cities, for 30,000,000 more power units, and in the rest of the country that that two millions should be increased to seventeen million by 1932. In other words, instead of the expert figures of 46½ millions being reached for heating by 1932 they hope to have a consumption of 81 million units.  Let me present the picture fully and then I shall answer any questions.  They hold that the 20,000,000 units set down under the heading of heating will be reached in 1932 mainly through the use of electricity in steam-raising and industrial furnaces.  And they calculate that in 1932 one can look forward to the consumption not of 110,000,000 units but to the consumption of 144,000,000 units.  Making all the deductions necessary from that figure and remembering that what has to be reached is a sale of 90,000,000 units at ordinary prices for household convenience purposes and 20,000,000 units at a very low rate for heating, in the end we find there is a fairly secure calculation that by 1932 we will be selling so many units at .9d. that the Shannon scheme will be paying its way.  That is the point to which the Deputies will have to address themselves now. The scheme is there and the <Col N="385" /> cost of the supply in bulk can be shown.  We are not dealing with the other side, the distribution side, at all.  There is the calculation, and we get back to the experts' figures that I quoted in the old debates, and I prefer in a conservative way to found more upon this calculation of the returns showing the number of units sold under the various heads I have described, showing the total last year of nearly 67,000,000 units and this year an estimated total of 73,000,000, and showing an increase by 1932 up to 98,000,000 units.  That is the picture that I want to present of the Shannon scheme at the moment.  Costs have gone up and are reflected in the change from .84d. to .9d.  The previous estimate made in 1925 as to what would be the power market for electricity automatically arising in the Free State, in 1929, has been more than borne out if we take the 73½ million units reached this year.</P>
      <P>The whole thing to me is very encouraging.  There was a big element of risk about the whole scheme when starting.  It had to be dealt with in a most careful way.  A very big firm of contractors came in and presented this project in particular circumstances.  They had their scheme tried and judgment passed upon it by four experts of international repute, and they said there was a big prospect of the Shannon paying its way by 1932. They made certain calculations as to price and final costs, and they allowed a margin for error, and they made a calculation as to units of consumption, and we see the difference as far as cost is concerned &mdash;the .84d. increased now to the .9d., and the other calculations in regard to units to be sold.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement that at .9d. it would be a paying proposition in 1932 was not based on a consumption of 144,000,000 units?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on a basis of 110,000,000 units sold to consumers. Remember not even 110,000,000 units sold at .9d. but 20,000,000 units sold at something less than .9d. and the rest at .9d.  That is the calculation that people have before them.  I would like to give another opportunity of having this further discussed, simply in retrospect when the scheme will <Col N="387" /> have been definitely completed.  We are at the point where, as far as the canal works are concerned, we are at the end, or almost at the end, of the construction works.  There are certain things that will lag on for a bit, certain works which will not delay the filling of the canal and the delivery of power.  Other work is proceeding, such as the erection of transmission lines through the country. That is a part I am not dealing with at the moment because the figures do not arise for consideration and it is more connected with the work of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of expenditure the whole thing has gone much better than I think most of the prophets hoped that it would go. We have been within the limit, as can be seen, of the margin allowed for and spoken of in the experts' report.  The conditions that have been met do not make such a variation in the whole scheme as to necessitate such an extra charge for units of electricity as would make one doubt whether there will be a demand for electricity at that price. The one thing that is still variable is this question of likely consumption. There we are more or less in the region of calculation; I am afraid some people might be inclined to call it guess-work.  At the same time I think that the calculation that has been made is a fairly accurate one. It is founded on the results of past years and we are simply carrying that forward.  The only argument that could be put forward would possibly be the argument as to whether the saturation point is reached.  If and Deputy is inclined to query that and to argue that we would be still short of sales, I would like him to remember that we still have in the background an invention, not Professor Drumm's invention, but Deputy Moore's invention. That invention is that by reducing the price of electrically-propelled vehicles in this country we can, on the calculation of Deputy MacEntee immediately get a market for 14,000,000 units.</P>

      <P>I want to get a a little clearer about a possible fluctuation of the £150,000 for administrative purposes.

The proportion of that 39,500,000 units, in so far as it is represented by tramway power, may have a hard core which is not, as far as we know, expansible.  We want to know the size of the hard core in relation to the total in order to be able to treat it as an elastic figure. If the Minister has not the figures, will he ascertain them, and, if he will not give them to the House, will he tell us why he will not give them? He may have a perfectly good reason.</P>

One could not obtain returns compulsorily, although there is certain power given to the Electricity Supply Board under which they can see whether a plant is really a private plant and is not selling electricity or supplying electricity for sale purposes.  I do not think they have gone to the trouble of getting particulars about private plants.

      <P>This is a Bill the purpose of which is to give the Minister power to pledge the credit of the State to get funds for the purpose of additional expenditure on the Shannon scheme.  I think that a very large portion of the Minister's remarks was directed towards obscuring that fact.  If one who is not an expert in electricity or one who is not an expert in finance can approach the consideration of this Bill without fear it is very largely due to the fact that those whom we always looked upon as infallible in the past have erred in its interpretation. I notice that the most infallible person in the country, the writer of the leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; has been absolutely at sea in his interpretation of the Bill and if a person of that kind can go wrong I will not worry very much if I go wrong also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to enable increased expenditure on the Shannon scheme to be undertaken.  I say that whatever we may think of the circumstances that led up to the introduction of this Bill, this Dáil has practically no choice but to authorise the increased expenditure.  As I said already, I am approaching the consideration of the whole question from the point of view of the man in the street and not from the point of view of the expert either in electricity or in finance.  When the question of the Shannon scheme was originally before the Dáil I was not in the Dáil and I looked upon the debates that took place here in relation to it as an outsider.  I still have to consider the matter largely as an outsider would and it is as an outsider that I intend to speak in reference to it, because certain remarks made by the Minister are at variance with the general public conception of what was undertaken when the Shannon scheme and the various commitments that were made at that time were embarked upon.  The best course probably to take would be to follow the line that the Minister himself has taken.  Under the old arrangement, a sum of £5,200,000 was mentioned and it was to represent the total all-in costs of the Shannon scheme.  The <Col N="392" /> Minister has endeavoured to confuse that particular fact here this evening. He mentioned it as an estimate that could be secured for the Siemens-Schuckert project.  But there was no ambiguity whatever about the various statements made by the Minister and other members of the Executive Council when the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925 was under discussion here.  It was definitely stated that £5,200,000 would represent the maximum cost of the scheme and that under no circumstances was it likely that that figure would be exceeded.  It is true of course, as some Deputies pointed out at that time, that it did not matter very much what figure was in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has quotations, I presume, as to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have any amount of quotations if necessary.  On the 3rd April, 1925, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;The prices are absolutely fixed and binding. They are maximum prices from Siemens-Schuckert's point of view. They are not the minimum from our point of view.  We have checks and controls by which if we find a reputable firm in any other part of the world that would do any part of this work at less than Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert, then we can beat them down to that or give the contracts on those parts to other firms.&rdquo;  Before that he had said: &ldquo;The only scheme that is under consideration at the moment is the scheme entailing a cost of £5,200,000.  Nobody can question that is the amount which we are considering, because for that we have binding estimates, if we care to accept tenders here and now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not approaching this question from the point of view of the expert at all.  I am approaching it from the point of view of the citizen.  I was a citizen at the time when the scheme was introduced.  I read in the papers the report that appeared there and the debates that took place here and I, like the vast majority of the citizens who took an interest in the matter, was left definitely with the <Col N="393" /> impression that the total all-in cost of the scheme was not to exceed and could not exceed £5,200,000.  As I said, the actual figure that appeared in the Bill was a matter of small moment because once the Dáil decided on embarking on that scheme they gave the Minister a blank cheque.  Some Deputy at the time pointed out that fact because as he stated if, when the scheme was three-fourths completed we found that the total amount mentioned had been exceeded, it would not be possible to leave it there in the air.  The balance would have to be provided and the scheme completed.</P>
    <P>We have paid I think £4,600,000 which was mentioned originally as the total cost of the construction. At least that is the figure that appeared in the press a few days ago in relation to the Finance Account of the State up to the 30th June.  I think it was something like that figure.  I did not think also that there was any question of addenda to the scheme when it was originally brought before this House.  The Minister very generously informs us that we might, if we liked, consider the £100,000 which has been set down additional to the scheme as extra expenditure or as part of the original project.  There is no doubt that this item is for exceptional or for extra expenditure in so far as various items covered by it were not mentioned in connection with the original scheme on which this House decided. These items may have been present in the mind of the Minister.  I do not know, but they were not conveyed to the Deputies or to the general public who have had an interest in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The additional cost involved in purchasing outright the sites for the poles instead of paying an annual rental charge is probably an economy and there is very little to be said in that connection.  The total net increase of moneys, the Minister informed us, was £100,000 for addenda, and his £100,000 represents the capital value of the rentals for the pole sites.  Then there is £450,000, of which £150,000 is for administrative <Col N="394" /> expenses.  Now, I want to be quite clear as to what is the meaning of this item &ldquo;administrative expenses.&rdquo; What are administrative expenses?  Is that £150,000 intended to be a payment in respect of the services rendered by the officials of the Minister's Department for which provision was made in the various estimates of that Department submitted to this House from year to year?  If not, what does it represent?  To whom has this money been paid?  I understand that portion of it has been paid already. If so, I want to know to whom?  The Minister states it represents the expenses of his Department.  I think he could give us some more information in the matter, because it seems an extraordinary method of getting funds for that purpose and paying the administration costs of a Government Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is a sum of £53,000 provided for contingencies. I think that we should get more information on that item also, because that is an exceptional figure in view of the fact that the scheme is now nearly completed, and the possibility of contingencies arising must be very largely foreseeable. Does the Minister anticipate that that sum will be required, and if so, upon what basis was it calculated? I want to know on what basis was the actual figure of £53,000 arrived at?  Taking away from the total additional cost of the scheme, the items for administrative expenses and for contingencies, we find that the actual additional cost for the civil side is £234,000, and the cost of the electrical and mechanical works is £134,000.  The fact that that additional cost has to <Col N="395" /> be incurred, as the Minister indicated, involves a rise in the price of the current to be sold if the scheme is to meet out of revenue the charges for interest and sinking fund upon the moneys invested in it.  When the Minister had completed dealing with the actual figures relating to the additional cost he proceeded to boost the scheme in the style that he alone can do.  He is, of course, excellent as a booster.  He made one short statement here in the Dáil a few days ago, and he boosted the selling value of the Great Southern Railways shares up by £5,000,000.  As a booster he takes first place in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been very largely boosting here to-day, and I think that Deputies should examine the various figures which he mentioned very closely.  It would not be possible to work out any calculations on them at the present time, but it seems to me that estimating that there will be a demand in 1932 for 144,000,000 units of electricity, is stretching the string too tight for credulity.  I mean that we have only succeeded in finding sale for 73,000,000 units in this year, and even taking into account the effects of the propaganda campaign now in progress, and the fact that electricity from the Shannon scheme perhaps will be available, I do not think that we can look forward with any degree of confidence, no matter what the Minister might say to the contrary, that we will be able to consume all the electricity produced in this country during the next three or four years.  However, the Minister says that it is not necessary that we should have a market for the 144,000,000 units in that year.  He said that the 144,000,000 units would be more than the Shannon scheme would supply.  I want to know does he wish us to take it that the total capacity of the scheme to produce electricity will not reach 144,000,000 units and <Col N="396" /> will be something less than that in a normal year.  The rate of consumption of electricity in the Free State is likely to increase as a result of the activities of the Shannon Board, but I think that we should reckon, or take into our calculations, the fact that it will put us to the pin of our collar, to use a common expression, to secure that by the 31st December, 1932, we will be selling the 110,000,000 units which it will be necessary to sell to ensure that there will be no necessity to increase the charge for the current or to put an extra burden on the taxpayers, to make up the deficiencies in the Shannon Board revenue.</P>
      <P>I think that while optimism on the part of the Minister is undoubtedly desirable, undue optimism is likely to be dangerous.  We have had experience of undue optimism from the same Minister in the past, and have had experience of seeing that optimism fade and being dispelled in such matters as the Trade Loans Facilities Act and other legislation.  As I said, he is an excellent booster.  Whenever he comes with a proposition to the House he can undoubtedly boost it in a very excellent manner, but we have to try to forget the fact that he is a booster and to get down to the hard facts of the situation.  The hard facts of the situation do not justify an unbounded degree of confidence in the success of the Shannon scheme such as he has expressed this evening.  I believe myself that the Shannon scheme will be a success, but it will be only made a success as the result of intensive effort. We certainly wish that it should be a success, and anything that can be done by the section of the community which we represent to ensure its success will be gladly performed, because results of the success of a scheme of this kind would be inestimable.  In any case we cannot afford to risk failure at the present time.  I hope the Minister will deal with the various points I have put to him when concluding and give us the various items in relation to the Bill which the Dáil is now asked to pass.</P>

      <P>Of course, so far, I have only made a general statement. I have made no detailed reference to the Shannon Electricity Board. Possibly the Minister anticipates that I may do so, and wants to rule me out immediately.  There are various sections of the Electricity Supply Act to which I want to refer in this matter.  If a Bill is before the Dáil to amend certain sections of the Act, are we not entitled to refer to other sections of the Act, as the section of the Act to be amended may have an indirect relation to another section of the Act?</P>

      <P>I am prepared to speak on the matter subject to your ruling.  It is a matter which I consider is of the greatest importance to the whole community.  The Electricity Supply Act of 1925 was introduced for a specific purpose. That was to supply electricity generally and to bring about, if possible, a very big increase in the use of electricity by the community at large. It was never contemplated, as far as I know, that while the State was going to monopolise the generation of electricity, it was going to monopolise the whole life and soul, as it were, of the electricity business in the Free State.  Subsequent to the introduction of the Act, it was clearly indicated and distinctly understood that the main purpose behind this particular undertaking was to supply in bulk at a cheap cost.  There was no suggestion of interference with the communal life of the citizens or the individual life of private individuals.</P>

I could not allow, on this Bill, any question to be raised on the administration of the Electricity Supply Board, and there is no use in trying to debate it.

I wonder if in calculating the final cost of the scheme he has taken into consideration the viewpoint held by many people that confiscated undertakings have had, and have at the present time, some capital value.  I wonder has he set that side by side with the other basis of calculation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because they have been confiscated.  The Minister talked about extra money being added to the cost of the scheme for the purchase of sites of poles in lieu of an annual expenditure for the rental of the sites.  We have no idea of what the cost is going to be.  Why does he not suggest rather than increasing the cost of the scheme in capital outlay that the scheme is going to cost so much, and in addition to that we are going to spend a certain sum separately for the purchase of pole sites in lieu of rental, which would have brought about certain overhead charges?  Could the Board not have made certain arrangements whereby the cost of the poles or the sites of the poles would be recouped to the State?  I think that would be a better arrangement, particularly when the Minister does not give the exact figure to be paid for the sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed in the original undertaking that the rental of the sites would be part and parcel of the general overhead expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was part of the overhead expenses it would have to be met out of revenue or profit.  The point is that the capital cost is being increased by estimating an amount equivalent to the capitalised value of the rental.  I contend if you are going to add that figure to the capital cost you should know and you should say that the figure is so much. If you do not know the figure or if you choose, for any purpose which may be correct, not to make it public, you should let it be judged on its own merits.  I think it would be just as well to leave it outside.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the figure is any worse or any better, but for the purpose of trying to <Col N="403" /> arrive by some mathematical calculation at the cost of what is a business transaction, a hypothetical case is not something on which you can transact business.  That is why I say that it would be better if it were treated on a separate basis altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister also discovers at this stage that it would not be right&mdash;we certainly agree to that&mdash;to charge the cost of the improvement in connection with navigation to the Shannon scheme proper or to the Electricity Supply Board.  I perfectly agree with that.  When the Minister sets aside this sum of money which is to be the cost of the work in connection with the Shannon Navigation proper, is he making any arrangement whereby the State will be recouped for that outlay?  How is he going to deal with it?  Is he going to bring in an estimate to the Dáil for the cost the Minister outlined of the work which is being done in the Shannon but which is purely a navigation matter and not chargeable to the establishment of this scheme of the Board afterwards?  What I want to say is, I think the Minister should have stated to us how he is going to deal with that particular figure.  When the State is going to make an improvement in the shape of the reconstruction of some destroyed areas they bring into this House an Estimate for that purpose.  They tell us what is the estimated cost.  How is the State going to recoup, if they are going to recoup at all, the certain sum voted for the Shannon scheme?  That money was found insufficient. It is quite possible that it was not reasonable to expect it would be sufficient, but in the readjustment the Minister finds a certain figure for a particular class of work which he decides should not be chargeable to the Shannon scheme or harnessed to the power there.  He says this should be a different matter.  I say this figure should not appear in the Shannon scheme, and that the Minister should introduce an estimate <Col N="404" /> for the portion of the money which was spent on the Shannon scheme itself.  If that is not the case, will he say how he is going to deal with it?  Is it going to be given as a present or is the Minister going to take from the Board of Works certain functions which are prescribed by the Act?  Is he going to debit that money of what is now Board of Works property and will subsequently become Shannon Board property? The Minister may have a simple explanation which will clear the matter up.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a lot of figures with regard to the consumption of electricity in this country for various periods.  We are not disputing these figures but it is very interesting to know whether the figure we have before us is the figure which may vary at a certain point.  It is not the cost of current to the consumer so that we have no idea of the attraction there is going to be for the continued development of the use of electricity.  We know that certain figures have been published for certain areas by way of charges on routes and also by certain supply sources being left as they are but can the Minister state where the relation is between the price charged at present or the price to be charged and the cost of generation?  What I want to be satisfied on is this.  Roughly we had at the time the Shannon scheme was entered into a total consumption of something like 60 million units in electricity.  It is admitted that between Dublin and Cork and the surrounding districts of Dublin at least three-quarters of that amount was produced and consumed. In that connection a certain portion is current used by undertakings such as the Tramway Company.  What I wish to be made more clear on is the ultimate position that the Shannon scheme is going to occupy, what is hoped to be accomplished in the shape of current consumed by the public for domestic use and consumed by the industries in this country rather than by the Tramway Company.  I contend it would not be worth while making this expenditure of roughly £6,000,000 to get <Col N="405" /> current for a small portion of people already a consuming population, the only difference being that instead of existing generating stations which will be taken over, in their place the Shannon power is used.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's argument is going to be based on the saving to the State of the coal consumption let us have some figures.  The Minister should be able to give us some figures on that by now.  He is strangely lacking in information.  As I said at the outset I was rather surprised that the statement he made was confined to the explaining of the Bill.  We should be given some information which would give us a better idea as to the prospects and as to the general situation which arose.  On March 6th, 1929, I addressed to the Minister a question and asked him if he could state the total amount paid to date to the contractors on the Shannon Power Development Scheme and further if he would state the amount which would accrue for payment on the completion of the work. The answer I got was &ldquo;The total amount paid to the contractors up to February 1st, 1929, was: Civil constructional works, £2,140,557 11s. 0d.; electrical and mechanical works, £1,428,904 18s. 11d.; total £3,569,462 9s. 11d.  The amount which will accrue for payment on the completion of the works can at present only be estimated.  The sums will be approximately: Civil constructional works, £2,897,000; electrical and mechanical works, £1,906,000; total, £4,803,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was last March.  Since last March we find that that estimate has been increased to a further figure of roughly £73,000, which suggests that all the figures the Minister has given us to-day are to be taken as nearly final.</P>

      <P>I got a figure, in answer to a question that I addressed to the Minister in connection with the damage which had been caused by the sinking of a bank on the Shannon scheme.  Now we are £73,000 beyond that.  If the figure is not final to-day, I want to know what is the next figure going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to develop.  I addressed a question to the Minister in connection with the damage caused by the sinking of the bank in the Shannon scheme, and the answer I got to that was: &ldquo;The estimated cost of the additional work necessitated by the subsidence of part of an embankment at Parteen village will not exceed £6,000.  The subsidence is about 150 metres in length.  Should any question arise as to the liability for the cost of this additional work, it will be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the contract.  I do not, therefore, consider it desirable that I should express an opinion here on the matter.&rdquo; What I want to try to get from the Minister is: Is this contract between the State and the contractor a contract to do a certain job at a certain price, with certain allowances for contingencies, or is it a time and material job?  I have my own view and I would like a statement here with regard to the cost involved in the sinking of this embankment. We know that it was the contractors themselves who drew up the specifications and offered them to the State, subject to expert opinion on them.  It was not the State that drew up the specifications and tendered them to the contractors to quote on.  I contend that where contractors themselves draw up specifications to do a certain job, and where, subsequently, something is found wrong, the responsibility should be on the shoulders of the contractors.  They should be liable for the repairs.  If it is a time and <Col N="407" /> material job it would be different. The Minister might clear up that point by telling us whether it was a time and material job or a contract.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there should be so much secrecy about this thing.  Time and again, the Minister was asked for closer details with regard to the relation between the contractor and the State.  Various excuses were given at various times. The excuse was given early that the contract could not be exposed; that it would make it difficult for the contractors when purchasing raw materials if the suppliers knew they had to get them for this particular job.  The time for that is now past. The contractors have supplied themselves with all the requirements for the contract.  I would like to know if the Minister is going to facilitate the House some time in the near future in going over all the points in connection with the contract.  We hear all kinds of rumours abroad some of which are not well-founded, and others of which should be taken account of.  If the Minister would say, even now, whether that particular contract is a time and material one or whether it was a contract at a certain price, with certain allowances for contingencies and alterations, we would understand where we are.  As far as I am personally concerned, I see no reason why the Minister should hesitate in putting the liability of the sinking of the bank on the shoulders of the contractors that supplied the specifications. If an architect proposed to build a house and prepared his specification he is responsible if the house sinks.  If I employ an architect to prepare specifications and hand these specifications to a contractor, I am responsible if anything goes wrong.</P>
    <P>The point I wanted particularly to stress has been ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle.  I am not going to attempt, in his absence, to get it in in another way, but I would like to ask the Minister is he prepared to try to negotiate some understanding between the Board and people who are adversely affected by the operations <Col N="408" /> of the Board.  If he is prepared to meet them and see if he can solve some of the difficulties they are up against I will be satisfied.  If he is not prepared to do that, will he suggest some way?  I do not believe that the Minister realises some of the things that have happened.  A number of these people are hard hit and if their difficulties could be solved in some way there would be a little better harmony as regards this scheme.  As the success of the scheme will depend on the co-operation of all sections affected, I would ask the Minister if he is prepared to meet these people without any other people intervening and see what their complaints are.</P>

I wanted to raise certain matters here which it must be admitted apply to the administration policy of the Electricity Supply Board, with particular reference to the electrical workers on the Shannon scheme.  I understand that that is outside the scope of this Bill and is not permissible in debate.  I will content myself by reminding the Minister that this Electricity Supply Board is his own child.  It was brought forth through the instrumentality of the Shannon scheme. Like Deputy Briscoe, I do not think it is fair that the people who have to pay for this should be refused, through their elected representatives, <Col N="409" /> an opportunity of having a say in its administrative policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry that the whole discussion should be left to this side of the House.  I understood there was active opposition to everything Shannon on a previous occasion.  It evidently is not operative now, to that extent at any rate. I think if the Minister had been simply frank and said &ldquo;we have under-estimated the cost of this scheme within a margin which is reasonable,&rdquo; and came and asked the House on those terms he would have met the matter very much better.  I once heard the Minister speaking on the subject of the Shannon scheme in a place which certainly affects his method of speaking.  That is the City of Cork.  He told us that the Dáil, having once committed itself to the 1925 Act in relation to this scheme, had taken up these certain responsibilities and that it would have to implement those responsibilities whatever might be the consequences. Frankly, I see no particular difficulty in admitting that particular aspect.  You cannot do things and then turn your back upon the consequences of those things.  When the first sod of the Shannon was cut certain continuing responsibilities were taken.  If this is one of the continuing responsibilities which cannot be avoided in fact, then it cannot be avoided in an Act either.  If they have found in making their calculations that certain unforeseen things have turned up, or that certain miscalculations have been made, and that more money is required to make what money has already been spent operative, whether it is £500,000 or £700,000, that money, in my opinion, has now to be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual visible cost of the scheme has increased by between £500,000 and £600,000, and no amount of special pleading will get away from that.  We may blame the method of estimation.  We may blame the degree of disclosure or lack of disclosure of the terms of the contract, but we are faced by that fact, and no amount of complaining in future as to what has occurred will affect the fact that this money <Col N="411" /> has now to be paid, if the money which was originally granted is to have any chance of being made operative.  What is shown in this Bill is an increase in the visible cost. There is no attempt whatever to deal with the fact that the actual cost to the State of doing the thing which the 1925 Act set out to do is to-day very much greater than either the £5,200,000 or the £5,991,000, which it is now frankly admitted it is going to cost.  In order to know what the actual cost is, the Minister would have to tell us, and he alone can tell us.  I have made an attempt to ascertain from his Department, and through other Departments to which I have been sent by his Department, the figures which would enable that extra invisible cost to be ascertained, and have not received that information.  We would have to know the total value of pre-existing electrical supplies in the country. We would have to know the total profits of pre-existing electrical supplies and the total rates paid by them to local authorities in relief of rates from ordinary ratepayers.  We would have to know the total amount of income tax paid by these undertakings to the State.  When we have those figures, in so far as the Shannon scheme is going to be made solvent by the non-payment of those things, we should have to add to the nominal cost, now exposed, of £5,991,000, the capitalised value of those pre-existing assets which have been sunk in the scheme.  These are figures which I think ought to have been made evident.  The Minister tells us that the cost at the last transformer is going to be .9d.  On that basis of charge, the Electricity Board that is going to get that .9d. has to carry out the obligations under the Act of 1927, as amended by this Bill.  It has to provide the interest and the sinking fund, no more and no less on the total amount of money issued to it.  But it has to do it within the whole of the powers that are given to it.  One of the powers given to it, which influences intimately this question of .9d., is whether they are going to sell at a <Col N="412" /> profit or at a loss, the retail articles and accessories used in electrical supply.  That .9d., assuming that that is the calculation, is made on the basis of the Electricity Board carrying out its responsibilities and using the whole of these powers, and I take it that is what the Minister has calculated upon.  It is based upon that, adding into that the whole of the profits, or facing up to the whole of the loss, of an installation department run by that Electricity Board in conflict or in co-operation, or competition, if you like, with the existing suppliers.  If in so doing they substitute themselves merely for the whole of the installation trade of the country, then that cost and that capital value, from the point simply of a total charge internal to the State, will have to be added to the invisible cost of this particular scheme.  Take, for instance, a particular case.  The City of Dublin contributed, roughly speaking, when selling a certain amount of current to its consumers at a certain price, £20,000 per year to the central revenue of the country in the form of income tax.  Selling the same amount of current at the same price &mdash;and we have the direct authority of the Electricity Board for saying that they cannot sell it at a less price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You are perfectly wrong, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, in suggesting that I am making any statement to this House which is not absolutely true.  The statement was confirmed by the Deputy behind me. I was amazed to get the statement from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I did not, as you notice, appear to expect it.  We are dealing now with the question as to what is the actual cost of the scheme.  The Minister went into it in great detail.  I suggest to the House that the nominal cost of the scheme, as set out, of £5,991,000 is not the actual cost to the community, and that the work which was contemplated to be done for £5,200,000, and is now contemplated to be done for £5,991,000, is not being done for that amount, but for that amount plus the capitalised value of the whole of the existing income tax, the whole of the existing rates, the whole of the existing profits of <Col N="414" /> all electrical supply undertakings existing in the country plus a proportion of the total value which, personally, I do not think is very high, of the retail distribution of electrical accessories and the installation of electricity in houses.  I think these facts have to be met.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us figures &mdash;and it is the first time we have had them and I personally am very grateful for getting them&mdash;showing the increase in the demand for electricity. I have a graph here as far as I could do it roughly which is a hollow curve and it shows every sign of increasing to something more than a straight line.  I may say I am absolutely prejudiced in favour of believing and hoping that the most optimistic estimate that has been made in this consumption will come true, I hope it will and that it will be altogether better.  It is our business and the business of every one of us to do everything possible to make it altogether better than the Minister has estimated because I believe it will have to be altogether better to cover not merely the visible but the invisible cost now sunk in the Shannon scheme.  But what the Minister does not take into account in this quantity gradient is the price gradient as well.  The price gradient between the introduction of the Shannon Bill here and the present day has been from eightpence to fourpence in lighting current in Dublin.  It has been reduced, I believe sixty per cent. in some of the suburbs.  It has been reduced all over the world as far as I know by fifty, sixty and seventy per cent. during that particular period; because in the one case you are dealing with war rates of wages, with war rates of cost, with war rates for coal and transport.  Now we are dealing with coal at a price when it is practically as cheap as pre-war and in which coal freights are cheaper than pre-war.  Under that stimulation you have had this price grading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that that quantity gradient will increase, but I cannot see any prospect in the Shannon scheme of <Col N="415" /> continuing that price grading.  You cannot reduce the price of current in Dublin from four pence to nothing because you have reduced it from eight pence to four pence.  And the Minister and those responsible for making this estimate will have to take into account the statement of the head of their own Electricity Board that the cost of electricity for lighting in the city of Dublin has been reduced lower than they could reduce it, lower even than they would have put up if they had the choice.  The Minister will have to look into these figures with a certain amount of caution.  Another very interesting figure the Minister has given, and which again is available for the first time is the figure which shows that out of 67 million units used in the Free State in 1928 no less than 41 millions were used for power.  I do not think any one of us would have calculated that.  It is a very curious figure, and it is founded on the fact that the two cities of the Free State are largely responsible for the consumption of electricity in the Free State.  Of that 41 million units for power over half is hard shell&mdash; tramway current.  In Cork the tramways are kept on for no other reason but that they are compelled to keep them on.  There is a certain franchise in relation to the right to sell electricity in the city of Cork, which is dependent absolutely upon their continuing to run the tramway, even though they run it at a loss.  The trams would be shut down to-morrow in Cork so far as I know&mdash;it is purely a commercial proposition&mdash;if there was not that obligation.  There is another question which I do not want to touch on more than is necessary&mdash;how the Shannon scheme supply is going to solve the riddle of getting into Cork and putting its current economically into use and at the same time, keep that 1¼ millions of tramway current available is going to tax all their ingenuity.</P>
    <P>We come to Dublin where you have 18½ million units.  Does anyone think that that figure is going to expand along this gradient <Col N="416" /> indicated here?  Does anyone think that it is going to go up at that rate?  Every prospect, I am afraid, is against that view.  From every point of view I can see no reason whatever to believe that tramway current in Dublin is going to be an expanding factor.  In addition to that, who says they are going to get the tramway current?  Who says that the Shannon scheme at the present moment can generate current and put it on the tramway bus bars as cheaply as the Tramway Company can now put it upon their bus bars?  That would be rather a nice problem. Dublin is apparently fitting in with the scheme of costs, has put down modern plant to carry it over an unexpected winter load.  That is a very efficient plant.</P>
    <P>What reason is there to believe at the present moment that the Shannon scheme can supply current any cheaper than the steam station can develop it?  I hope they can, but I think the calculations which were made should certainly be calculations entirely independent of those who are anxious, and rightly anxious, so to believe.  There you have in relation to your increase of quantity two vitiations; first, that the price gradient which creates the quantity gradient cannot continue to exist; and secondly, that in the power element of that calculation 50 per cent. is represented by a factor which is not, as far as I could see, subject to normal expansion.</P>
    <P>All these calculations will have to be very carefully taken into account, and I believe subconsciously they have been taken into account in the changed atmosphere in relation to the Bill and in the changed atmosphere in relation to the finance of the Bill, which was represented by the 1927 Act as distinct from the 1925 Act, and which will be represented by the 1930 Act as distinct from the 1929 Act.  The calculations which were given of over-estimation or under-estimation on the electrical and the mechanical and civil work represents £134,000 and £140,000 plus £58,000 respectively.  I am rather surprised to find the figure of <Col N="417" /> £134,000 on the electrical and mechanical side.  I do think that that requires a considerable amount of explanation. This £95,000 here was, I gather from the Minister, due to the change imposed by the experts.  I think that was so.</P>

If £95,000 of that had been imposed by the experts through the definite changes which they require it would have brought £40,000 of the discrepancy within a limit which might be more easily justified.  I certainly think that that portion of the over-estimation will require a considerable amount of justification. There is £140,000 on the civil engineering side.  Having regard to the size of the scheme and to the nature of the scheme, that figure, in my opinion, is lower than we could have expected.  Personally, I never had any doubt whatever that when a firm of the standing of SiemensSchuckert took over this undertaking, that from an engineering point of view everything that could be foreseen would be reasonably dealt with and that a sound engineering job would come out of it in the end. I have no apology whatever to make for that.  I believe that any sound engineering firm in the world, when up against a big job of this kind, would value their own reputation too highly to make mistakes within their professional competence.  I have always felt quite confident that, so far as they could foresee things, that a sound scheme from the engineering point of view would be turned out in the end.  If we had run up against a very much bigger difficulty than is represented by £140,000 of a change in the civil engineering side of the work, I think that we might not feel that we had very much reason to complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the actual accident which did occur up there, and I had an opportunity of seeing it, all I can do <Col N="418" /> is to congratulate the House, the Minister and the country that it did happen.  It was the best thing that could possibly have occurred.  It occurred at the right time.  It would have been a disaster if that latent defect had not revealed itself at the time.  If we had flooded that place with water, having regard to the whole conformation behind and below it, and had the defect then developed, a very serious disaster would have occurred.  If that is the worst that is to occur on the civil engineering side, we may congratulate ourselves, and Siemens-Schuckert may congratulate themselves on the soundness of that side of their work.  I say that while I cannot see the justification for the under-estimation of £134,000 on the electrical and mechanical side, I am certainly not surprised to find £140,000 of an increase on the civil engineering side, when £95,000 of that was caused, apparently, by the structural alterations imposed by the experts' additional report.</P>
    <P>We are faced by the fact that this scheme is going to cost more than was previously estimated.  We ought to have been consciously in possession of the knowledge that it has cost a great deal more than the actual visible increase declared by the Minister.  We are faced also by this fact, that that money has now got to be spent.  It has got now to be met and this scheme has now got to be made a profitable one for this State.  Whether it was wise or unwise is another matter.  As one who for twenty or thirty years has been advocating the electrification of the Shannon I say that there can be two opinions as to whether this was the particular moment to start it.  It might be questioned whether, considering capital charges in relation to materials which were used on the scheme, and considering the advance or non-advance of the country in the use of electricity, that that was the right time to do it.  But the fact remains that it was done.  I think the obligation is upon everyone, in so far as they can to the limit of their powers, to co-operate <Col N="419" /> with this, and now they are responsible for seeing that for the benefit of the whole country the whole scheme, whatever it has cost us, shall be made profitable and prosperous.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few remarks, principally because I would like, first of all, to state the impressions which I gathered from the Minister's speech in order that these impressions may be corrected if they are incorrect; and, secondly, because, with the exception of an occasional remark of the last speaker, it seemed to me the real significance of the Minister's statement was very little appreciated by previous speakers.  The Bill asks for more money, but nobody ever expected that more money would not be required.  The whole point turned upon how much more money was going to be required.  It is quite true, as Deputy Lemass said, that a contract was entered into for a certain sum; but in the extract which Deputy Lemass read, it was pointed out that power was reserved in relation to extra work which might be necessary so that it could be carried out by the contractors at the closest price that could be obtained elsewhere, or else have it done at their lowest price by other contractors.  No engineer ever expected that a contract of that magnitude could be carried through without extra charges becoming necessary.  The whole point is what would be the amount of the extra charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I divided the Minister's statement into two parts.  In the first he explained why the extra charge was required and the causes to which the extra charge might be attributed.  In the second part he was occupied with comparing the forecast made four years ago and our or rather his present knowledge.  Then he went on to forecast for 1932, being four years nearer 1932 than in 1925.  Taking the first part, the reason for the extra cost, putting aside the capitalisation of what had been regarded as <Col N="420" /> the annual cost of the working of the scheme, and putting aside what had not been allowed for at all, these administrative costs in connection with the scheme so far, it seems to me the upshot of what the Minister said was that the contractors present us now with a bill of either £300,000 to £350,000 or £200,000 to £250,000, according as you take account of the £100,000 for improvements immediately undertaken in consequence of the report of the experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the contractor's bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractor's bill of costs is either £200,000 or £300,000 in accordance with the way in which you regard the £100,000 consequent on the experts' report.  I wonder would any engineer ever expect that work of that magnitude, involving a contractor's bill for £4,600,000, would be carried through with extras amounting to £200,000 or £300,000.  It is something like 5 per cent. of the total.  If it is the case that that is to be the actual bill for extras which we shall have to meet, and if it is not going to be added to at a later stage, I must say that I congratulate the Minister upon getting off with such a small bill for extras.  It seems to me to be something upon which we may all congratulate ourselves very strongly indeed.  I wish the Minister gave us some details as to how the bill for extras is made up.  It may be that it was made up of a large number of things of small account, or it may be largely accounted for by some big things.  I think the Minister might have given us fuller information on that point.  I think it would also be likely to ease public anxiety, though it is not a very big thing, if he told us whether that amount of extras had been increased by extra charges arising from the giving way of the embankment that occurred a short time ago.  He said that involved only a small expenditure&mdash;about £6,000 or £7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with another and a vital matter, so far as this State is concerned, arising out of the working <Col N="421" /> of that scheme, I think the Minister is to be congratulated.  I refer to the forecast that he gave four years ago as to the probable usage of electricity units that would be experienced in 1929 and the comparison between that forecast and the actual conditions that exist.  I think I, and almost everybody, thought that he was too optimistic in saying that we might expect there would be 70,000,000 units in actual use by this, and that we would be offering for sale electrical units so soon as 1929.  The figure he gives us is 73,000,000 units.  I think this is a matter on which he is to be congratulated and it augurs well for the working of the scheme.  Again, I want to go slowly, and I am not prepared to follow the Minister in his augury for 1932 as compared with our knowledge in 1929.  It may turn out to be correct.  We can only hope that it will be correct. I do not think that we have enough evidence yet to show us that we can hope so soon as 1932 that the total amount of electricity that will be available from the scheme will be in demand throughout the State.</P>
    <P>That is not the important point. The important thing is what result has the knowledge that we have gained up to the present produced upon the figure at which the originators of the scheme hoped to be able to sell the current?  The Minister has told us, in what he regards as final figures, that the effect has been to add .06 per unit to the cost that they held out as the estimated price at which they would be able to sell the current.  He told us these are final figures.  That is to say, that they have only got to increase their estimate, the estimate at which they hoped to be able to supply electricity, by .06 per unit as the result of the experience they have gained and payments that have been made. I think it is too early yet for us to be attempting to estimate what price that will mean in particular districts.  I am not in a position at the moment to be able to say to what extent that compares with <Col N="422" /> what other people hoped they would be able to sell electricity at at this time, but I think it is very satisfactory, so far as it goes, that after four years the promoters who are carrying out the scheme are able to show that experience has justified their estimate to the extent of .06 per unit.</P>

      <P>There have been various points of detail raised on the Second Reading with which I would like to deal very briefly. Deputy Lemass spoke of administrative expenses. Administrative expenses in the sum of £150,000 includes moneys paid to date, or estimated as being likely to fall to be paid before the scheme is completed and before the temporary engineers who have been recruited for the work have been dismissed. It further includes payments made and shown every year in the Estimates for certain officials of mine who have been allocated to the Shannon Office.  To that extent it means that, instead of asking the taxpayer to pay for the cost of civil servants who are doing other work, the consumers of electricity will eventually pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The way it is shown in the Estimates is that there are certain people with asterisks before their names, and it stated that they have been allocated to the Shannon Office and paid for the time being, although they have to be kept separately as civil servants with their pension rights, increments, and so forth maintained.  Their pay for Shannon work is definitely allocated against consumers in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that can be raised in another way at another time.  Officials of mine have been allocated to Shannon work and consumers in the future are going to pay the cost of their services.  The matter of their payment will be raised and dealt with in another way.  As regards the contingencies amount, I regard that as a reasonable provision, and is, if anything, on the safe side.  I do not want to stress that belief of mine in any vehement way, as afterwards it might be found that the sum of £53,000, or whatever it is, is not sufficient.  We are approaching the end of the scheme and we should be able to look forward with some degree of accuracy to the amounts to be put under the heading of &ldquo;Sundries.&rdquo;  There is still an amount of electrical equipment to be ordered.  We found out, on the electrical side, that owing to the advance made in regard to switch gear apparatus and other things, it is put up to us to spend a little more money in order to have, at the end of the job, the best equipment to be found anywhere, and we are paying for it in the belief that we are going to save on the maintenance costs of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe felt that it would have been better if I had done two things in another way.  One was the matter of pole sites.  He would have preferred that to have been done in another way, although obviously not knowing the two amounts that have to be set in comparison, the Deputy could make no calculation as to whether it would be better dealt with in this way or the other way. I can put it to him in this way.  A certain sum of money is set up as the payment to be made year by year for the rents of poles, and if by spending an amount of money at the moment I could reduce the yearly payment by half, obviously that was a better way to do it.  I can be judged now by the fact that I <Col N="424" /> am doing it in this way.  As regards the Shannon navigation scheme figures, I have to deal with certain moneys which have to be paid to the contractors.  I cannot at the moment divide the money, bring it in and show how the money which we are setting aside for navigation is going to be met.  That will be done afterwards.  All I am saying is that no interest is going to be paid by the Electricity Supply Board on money definitely due to navigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain moneys are being expended on the improvement of navigation which is presumably going to be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the implication in the section, that these works will be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board.  Is it intended that the Board will have functions in regard to the navigation of the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly they may have.  The Act of 1927 gives that power, but there has as yet been no order transferring the functions to the Board.  That question will arise on the order.  It is comforting to have Deputy Briscoe's assurance that he thinks that when the contractors drew up their specifications they should pay for the subsidence that occurred.  The whole thing will obviously be ruled by the terms of the contract, and the Deputy knows nothing about them.  I intend to keep him in ignorance as long as possible.  It will arise eventually as to whether the terms of the contract, or any part of it, should be made public.  It should be remembered that a firm's reputation may be at stake, especially as to prices and other matters intimately connected with the firm, and the question will arise as to how far it is right that we should issue such information. It may, of course, be possible to bulk certain things and to show certain estimates and the actual cost of carrying them out.  I am not sure <Col N="425" /> that anyone in this House would press for a document if it was shown that it was going to be detrimental to a firm, and if it were also shown that that firm carried out a very big job in a very creditable manner.  At the moment it is absolutely necessary that the contract should be kept secret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Estimates are one thing but contract conditions are quite different.  It was of contract conditions that Deputy Briscoe spoke.  The Deputy also seems to believe that there are only two types of engineering jobs, namely, the time and material job or the one where a certain amount is allotted to certain specific jobs.  There may be all sorts of conditions in between. As regards the subsidence of the bank, it is the most insignificant thing, so far as cost is concerned, that has happened on the scheme, and I have no doubt as to who is going to pay for it.  On the broader aspect of the matter, Deputy O'Hanlon put a question to me, and on my answer, given in a certain way, Deputy Lemass has, I think, come to certain conclusions which are wrong. He asked me, at any rate, whether it is beyond the capacity of the Shannon to supply 142 million units.  My answer to Deputy O'Hanlon's question obviously referred to the present development and to the experts' estimate of the number of units to be sold to the consumers under the conditions which they found in the driest period in sixty years in this country.  In a normal year there would be more than 110 million units.  In the present year there would be considerably more.  In the full development of the Shannon there would be considerably more even in a dry year. In a wet year in the second stage there will be still more.  One hundred and forty-two million units is not beyond the capacity of the present <Col N="426" /> development in normal times. When we took the estimates previously, we were going on the basis of the driest year found over a period of sixty years and what was the volume of water we would get under peak load circumstances.  We take that very conservative estimate right through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the provision of certain stand-by stations which will have to be kept there could be more than 142 million units. As one gets back along the line that increases.  Deputy Flinn spoke at one time about blaming the method of estimating or to whether one had to blame that method.  I put up against that the remark of Deputy Thrift that there was no engineer alive at the date of the contract who would have gambled on such a small percentage increase on the whole work.  There was not one such to be found amongst the Irish engineers, as almost to a man there was a belief that the whole thing was underestimated. Their most conservative estimates would have ranged far beyond the figure now shown to be pretty accurate.  As to the question of consumption in the future, Deputy Flinn has introduced two or three points which he thinks breaks up that estimate.  One point is the question of the tramways, the units consumed by the tramways, which he previously referred to as being hard core and which did not allow for great expansion.  To my mind that makes my case all the stronger. I say that there is a percentage increase shown from year to year, taking in the hard core which only shows an expansion of two per cent. If I can remove that, and can say that it will be steady, it means that there is a much bigger percentage increase for ordinary matters, and if I take that for ordinary matters I am making up for anything that may be lost.</P>

      <P>It is only spoken of as disappearing in Cork.  The Electricity Supply Board have been given certain powers.  They have been investigating and have been dealing with certain people in regard to acquisition.  It will come to their turn one of these days to say how far the money given to them is sufficient.  I do not say that that money should not be regarded as sufficient, as I have no knowledge on that matter.  They have furnished me with their opinion on the estimate. They believe that by 1932 there will be a big increase beyond the estimate's best hope in the consumption of units in the country. They know the Cork situation and are aware of all the developments of which Deputy Moore spoke.  Nevertheless, they told me that that is frankly an estimate, but it is an estimate based on investigations.  It is not the type of hope that I was expressing three years ago when the scheme was first introduced.  In that case we had experts' figures and certain calculations were made.  People tried to point out that such calculations were vitiated by the fact that those who made them did not know the country.  Here are people, however, who have gone into the whole matter.  They know the country and know the dangers they will be up against better than anyone else.  They have to consider whether hereafter they will be able to sell to the tramway systems or sell under the present Dublin rate to secure consumers in Dublin and the tramways. I do not found too much on that letter, but they, having got certain information, have given certain figures.  Deputy Thrift asked whether we might give some details as to increased expenditure.  I do not want to go into details to any great extent. The increase on the electrical side has been queried.  That increase might really be described as an increase on the transmission system side.  Quite a large amount of it comes from a big increase necessitated in the building of transformer stations all over the country.  It is a figure which I might hereafter publish as being a useful commentary <Col N="428" /> on the cost of building in this country.  That matter was rather accurately dealt with in the estimates previously.  The building costs of certain types of transformer stations in Germany were taken and related by two experts, one to Swedish costs and the other to Swiss costs.  They got the Irish employees wage figures, and got so far as they could the cost of material in this country.  There was a miscalculation on the first estimate.  The comparison with the cost of building in this country over Germany, which is not the cheapest country, is between 60 and 100 per cent. over.</P>

      <P>There was a big miscalculation.  After three people had investigated that matter that big error was shown.  It is the most abnormal thing that happened in the whole contract.  There never was anything like it.  There was no percentage equal to that.  On the whole, the transformer station building shows a very big increase over the estimates.  The contract on the electrical side was not entered into until a year after the other contract and the price of material had gone up in the meantime.  There was an increase in wages and the price of material in Germany.  We were, for instance, buying copper nearly always in a rising market.  In addition, there were innumerable extras on the electrical side.  We could, of course, have cut them out, but we had to calculate whether these would give us a better scheme from the point of view of efficiency to start with and reduce the maintenance costs hereafter.</P>
      <P>On the other side there were very big losses here and there, and very big savings here and there.  The scheme was not three months old when the decision was taken that in order to have better security with regard to the intake buildings to move the inlet works about a mile up stream.  The point at which they were first projected gave sufficient security, as far as building was concerned, but did not give absolute security that was to be got from building on an absolute rock foundation, and the weir was shifted a mile up stream.  That meant two miles of banks, one on each side, and meant a loss of £180,000, which was saved afterwards on certain things. There were pluses accruing and minuses coming against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one big item.  There was a big item of expense at the Power House building itself, and the expenditure was incurred in the interest of the security and stability of the works.  There was a third item that increased the cost on the civil side.  We did really more work in the tail race with a view to future development than was at first projected. <Col N="430" /> So that the partial scheme which was at first contemplated bore a considerable amount of the cost of the second development.  In fact it bore a greater amount of the cost of the second development than was originally intended, when the Power House would have to be in continuous operation.  We decided to incur expense at this point.  However, hereafter better details can be given in these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Flinn's statement to what he describes as an accident in Parteen Valley, and congratulated the House that it happened at this time, and that if it had not happened now a great disaster might have come on the whole scheme, I doubt very much if it is a proper thing to describe the subsidence, even in the language which the Deputy used, that he envisaged it as a likely disaster.  It might have been an inconvenience, and held up the operations for a bit, but the term &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; I do not think should be used.  It never would have remained over, because if the accident had not happened, we would have dug out the bank.  The method deliberately taken of dealing with the sub-stratum of peat was to put this bank on top in order to squeeze this peat matter out.  Actually the accident did not happen according to plan.  The bank was built in particular circumstances, hoping that the pressure as it came, daily increasing, would squeeze out this matter. Instead of this particular soft matter coming out by degrees, it suddenly came out.  If there had not been the accident, I doubt if there would have been any chance of water being let into that bank as long as we knew that it was built on that particular type of foundation. We wanted to squeeze out the peat, but it did not emerge.  That is not going to occur at another portion of the work, because where boring has shown peat foundations elsewhere other methods have been adopted. That is the only peat foundation attempted to be dealt with in that manner.</P>
    <P>I want again to say to Deputy Thrift that I have not put up these <Col N="431" /> figures as absolutely final.  I do not think the Deputy misunderstood me, but I want to make the point quite clear.  Deputy Thrift and other Deputies will recollect that I always refrained from saying that £5,210,000 was the absolutely final cost of the scheme.  I refused to be dragged into any statements of the type.  I can get interruptions of mine scattered through all the debates where I refused to do it, even in cases where it would, to a certain extent, have eased the progress of the Bill through the House to let the debate go on the assumption that it was final.  Time and again I contradicted and said I was not making that contention.  There is the 10 per cent. variation that the experts referred to in their report.  I always referred to that and founded on it. I never made any statement such as Deputy Lemass pretended to quote me as saying.  I want to be clear.  I do not put these forward as absolutely final figures to a nearer degree than can be judged by the nearness of our approach to the end of the works.  That is the most I will say on it.  I was very glad to find from Deputy Thrift an appreciation of what had been revealed to the House this evening.  Deputy Lemass says I am a booster.  It is a good thing to be the kind of a booster whose statements can be challenged afterwards. That particular epithet might be recalled when what is described as boosting is proved by after events to be so near the facts as my own boosting statements are now found to be.</P>

      <P>I am taking that. I am saying take the old estimate. Take the conditions under which it was put up.  Take the fact that I refused to put myself beyond this, that it was within the 10 per cent. variation the experts stated it should be regarded as.  I take that and put it in opposition to all the pessimism there was about this scheme, and I come now to present actualities and <Col N="432" /> to contrast £5,200,000 with the present £5,800,000 or so.  I claim that the application of the word boosting to what I said with regard to the Shannon scheme is not merely an ungenerous term, but a very unjust term.  If the things that the Deputy has committed himself to with regard to other schemes in this country are found by trial to be as nearly accurate as I proved these figures to be it will be a good thing for the country.  It is an amazing thing that Deputy Flinn should stand up and say that he regretted something should be left to his Party. What was left to that Party was left a little bit vague, but the phrase preceding it was that there had been active opposition to this scheme.  I want to recall that there was never a division challenged on this scheme in all the time it went through this House.  There was never such an ungenerous statement made about it when it was merely a project as has been made about it by two or three speakers on that side to-night, when it is revealed, to my mind, as an amazing success.  There was accurate, severe questioning, there was a lot of people who asked had the experts looked into this, that and the other thing.  There was an enormous amount of cross-examination, but on the scheme itself, on the motion which was put down asking that the Government should proceed to carry out this scheme, on the various stages of the Electricity Act, there was never a division challenged.</P>

      <P>There was no active opposition.  The most active opposition to this scheme arose from one member of the Oireachtas, not in this House.  As far as this House was concerned there was never a division, and I challenge anybody to read the reports on the different stages of the Shannon scheme and find if they can see words equal in the point of being ungenerous, to some of the things said here to-day.  Now when the development is definitely proved, as far as one side is concerned, and the costs of the scheme <Col N="433" /> prove to be much nearer the estimate than the big majority of those who oppose the scheme after hearing it debated here for many days believed it was going to be, Deputy Flinn complains that I have not come along to make a frank announcement.  I wonder could there have been anything more open, clear and frank than what I said to-day.  I suppose the Deputy would prefer that I should come in and say we underestimated this to the extent of £700,000 or £800,000 and let that figure go.  Is that a proper way to represent this to the country?  No matter what the Fianna Fáil Party may think, there is a very big section of the community whose fortunes are bound up with this scheme.  You might say that the whole of one profession in Ireland is definitely packed in the hold of the Shannon Scheme, and it is very ungenerous to have made about these people comments of the type that were made here this evening with regard to wrong estimation and with regard to querying details as to why expenditure went up on this, that and the other thing.  The active, youthful and enthusiastic members of one profession in the country have been engaged on this scheme and the result is a marvellous tribute to them.  The members of that profession, having nothing like the experience of the men they were up against, fought out the contractors' men with such ability that they saved this country an amount of money that carelessness or inefficiency on their part would have lost.  We have a big scheme and a big development.  People might query units of consumption in the future and estimates on them.  Would anybody listening to the debate here to-day come to the conclusion that we had made a very big step forward as far as this scheme is concerned; that we have got out of the woods and are now in the open with regard to one thing, the cost of the scheme and the final cost of the bulk supply to the customer? I use the word &ldquo;final&rdquo; again with the reservation I put on <Col N="434" /> it to Professor Thrift.  Would anybody listening to the debate realise that in relation to a scheme so severely criticised and subjected to so much pessimism in the early stages, the difference between the estimation and the fact is reflected in the difference between .84d. and .9d.?  That is what I am presenting to you.  I am presenting it to you as the work of a very big number of Irishmen engaged in opposition to a very big number of experienced foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the greatest credit is due to these people for the way everywhere&mdash;in the office, on the job and through the country&mdash;the scheme has been handled.  There ought to be a most enthusiastic welcome given to this statement.  Instead of that I find myself criticised for not being frank.  Would it be fair to these people if I had come in and said &ldquo;I want to admit an increase of £100,000 on this scheme?&rdquo;  Would it be fair to take one item only and let it pass without mention of the fact that it included a certain sum of money in the way of capital costs&mdash;the acquisition of pole sites&mdash;that was not previously included in the £5,200,000?  Would it be fair to pass over the £100,000 of the addendum?  Personally I would prefer to have the case based on the increase on the original estimate on the electrical and civil side, not on the figures as increased by the addendum.  I think I was bound, in justice to the people on the works, to say what I did say here to-day.  I did not try to make any false case.  I was as frank, I think, as anybody could be expected to be, in the presentation of a mass of figures, some of which were not previously included in the £5,200,000.  I would like Deputies to think over it and let them put to me on the Third Reading any points that they want to have made clear. Let us try to see what is the final cost of the Shannon Scheme in so far as we can recognise it.  Let people try to get away, in this case, from trying to down a Minister.  Let them think that there is one profession <Col N="435" /> engaged in this job through the country and that it is those young men's reputations that are at stake. They are Irish people, and let us register an appreciation of the character of the work that they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Roddy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the <Col N="437" /> Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This Bill is a very short one and should not give rise to very much discussion.  Section 1 provides for the appointment of limited administrators for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission to dispose of a large number of holdings they have on hands, particularly in congested counties.  Section 2 gives the Land Commission power to fix the standard purchase annuity for non-judicial holdings automatically.  The remaining sections of the Bill provide for the acquisition of the fishing rights by the Land Commission in connection with land vested under the Act of 1923, with the object, among others, of enabling the Land Commission, in accordance with Section 1 of the Act of 1903, to sell fishing rights in particular cases to tenant purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is intended to obviate the difficulty and delay which are often caused in the vesting of new or re-arranged holdings on the C.D.B. and Land Commission estates, owing to the fact that the original tenant or registered owner of a holding has died and there is no legal representative to him with whom the Land Commission can enter into the necessary agreements. The Land Commission consider that power should be given to them in such cases to appoint a limited administrator to the deceased tenant or owner for the purpose of consolidating or exchanging holdings. There are before the Land Commission at present a considerable number of cases of migration for the purpose of relieving congestion in which proceedings were commenced by the late C.D.B. and which cannot be completed under the existing machinery owing to defective title of the occupier of the lands proposed to be taken.  The general case is that of an occupier who paid the annuity in respect of a registered holding to which he has not a legal title, he not having obtained a grant of administration to the estate or proved the will, if any, of his predecessor in occupation and registered his title at the Land Registry.  The <Col N="438" /> practice of the C.D.B. was to take possession of the intended migrant's original holding, making temporary lettings of it to the intended allottees and to put him in occupation of the new holding under a grazing or other temporary agreement. The result in the cases referred to being that these temporary arrangements have continued for a great many years and the Land Commission are as far as ever away from the stage at which they could effect a re-sale of the migrant's original holding and the sale to him of the new holding.  Experience has shown that it is almost impossible to get these migrants to incur the legal and other costs involved in order to obtain the grant of administration or otherwise procure registration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if I quote a typical case it would help to show the difficulties that the Land Commission have to meet in dealing with such cases.  A tenant, A, entered into an agreement with the C.D.B. upon a certain date in the year 1917 to exchange his holding for a new parcel.  The Board at once put four allottees into occupation of the holding under lettings for temporary convenience, and the tenant A was given a new holding under a grazing agreement.  On investigation of the title to A's holding it was discovered that his mother, since deceased, was the registered owner.  From 1917 up to the present day.  the C.D.B at first, and the Land Commission subsequently, have been endeavouring to get the tenant A to clear his title and to get himself registered as the owner of his old holding, so that he might execute a conveyance of it to the Land Commission, but he has ignored all our requests and, until his title is made good, the exchange cannot be effected of the old holding and the new parcels vested in the intended purchasers or migrants.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have power under Section 46 of the Land Act of 1923 to migrate tenants even though their titles to the holdings from which they are migrated are not registered in the Registry of Deeds, or are not legally correct.  In such cases we have power to transfer the <Col N="439" /> burdens appertaining to the old holding to the new holding.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 deal with fishing rights.  Section 45 of the 1923 Act provides that fishing rights which are appurtenant to lands vesting in the Land Commission under the Act shall also vest in the Land Commission.  It will be observed from a reading of this section that these fishing rights vest by right of the statute, and no action of the Land Commission is required to effect the vesting.  At first sight this would appear to be a very easy and effectual method of dealing with such rights, but in practice it has been demonstrated that it is very difficult to say in any particular case what rights really have so vested in the Land Commission.  Section 45 does not define &ldquo;appurtenant,&rdquo; and the position is that when lands have vested the fishing rights, if appurtenant, have vested, and if not &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; have not vested. There is no provision in the Act of 1923 or the Act of 1927 by which the Land Commission could declare that fishing rights have vested, and if such a declaration were made it would not, as the law stands at present, have the effect of vesting the rights, though the rights, if appurtenant, have vested by statute, according to the interpretation of Section 45 of the Act of 1923.  Section 41 of the Act of 1927 makes provision for the sale by the Land Commission to tenant purchasers of fishing rights in any rivers or waters adjoining or intersecting the holdings purchased by them at such price, payable by means of purchase annuities as the Land Commission may consider reasonable, such annuities to be consolidated with the land purchase annuities of the holdings.  This section does not use the word &ldquo;appurtenant,&rdquo; but implies that the appurtenant rights within the meaning of Section 45 of the Act of 1923 comprise fishing rights in adjoining and intersecting rivers and waters.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; was the subject of a legal decision in the courts recently, the effect of <Col N="440" /> which was that a right appurtenant to a holding must mean in law some right in connection with the enjoyment of the holding, and could not be extended to include the right to property which was separated therefrom and not enjoyed by the tenant or necessary for the enjoyment of his holding.  This decision, in fact, means that the word &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; should not have been used in Section 45 of the Act of 1923, or, if used, it should have been defined so as to include the rights referred to in Section 41 of the Act of 1927.  As the law stands, only those fishing rights which were appurtenant and which were previously enjoyed by the tenant can be considered to vest in the Land Commission as appurtenance to tenanted land.</P>
    <P>There is one very important point connected with fishing rights which the experience of the Land Commission proves to require legislation. Fishing rights sometimes extend beyond the confines of the lands which have vested in the Land Commission; such rights, under no construction of the word, could be held to be appurtenant, and so could not vest automatically in the Commission, and the Commission are not empowered to acquire such rights voluntarily.  In cases such as these, it might destroy the value of these rights altogether if part of them vest in the Land Commission automatically, and the rest of them do not vest and cannot be acquired by agreement.  It is proposed, therefore, in Section 5 of the Bill to give the Land Commission power to purchase by agreement extraneous or non-appurtenant fishing rights in order to avoid destroying them by the vesting only of part of them.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, and 5 are really designed for the purpose of defining the word &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; in such manner as to make it clear what rights will and what rights will not vest in the Land Commission, and in so defining them the expressions used in the Land Act, 1927, are incorporated, and the word &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; is given a wider meaning so as to include all fishing rights <Col N="441" /> owned by the vendor of the lands. The Land Commission is to declare in each case what rights as so defined have vested, so that the tenant need not be in any doubt hereafter, when these rights are being disposed of, as to what rights are actually vested in him, and power is also sought by the Land Commission to determine whether or not any particular rights should or should not be declared. Powers are also sought in Section 5 to acquire by agreement extraneous fishing rights, where such acquisition is necessary to the enjoyment or user of appurtenant rights.  The two remaining sections are purely formal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 gives the Land Commission power to fix automatically the Standard Purchase Annuities in respect of non-judicial holdings.  One of the causes of the delay in vesting of holdings subject to non-judicial rent has been that under the Land Act of 1923 the Commissioners, in default of agreement between the owners and the tenants, fixes the standard purchase annuity.  For this purpose a report of an inspector must be obtained and notice subsequently published fixing the standard purchase annuity. This notice is served on the parties&mdash;both on the owner and on the tenant, and it carries with it the right of appeal to the judicial commissioner. The proceedings in such cases must necessarily await the result of such appeal.  It has been found, as a result of our experience during the last two or three years, that the average reduction where the standard purchase annuity has been agreed upon, between the owner and the tenant is 33.4 per cent., and where fixed by the Land Commission is 37.9 per cent., or an average of 35.1 for both classes when taken together.  Thus the average has varied between 34 and 35 per cent. in the last twelve months.  Thirty-five per cent.  may be taken as a very fair average and likely to hold good in respect of all <Col N="442" /> the other cases that remain to be fixed.  This average corresponds to that provided in the 1923 Act in the case of judicial rents fixed prior to the 16th August, 1911, which was 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Northern Ireland Land Act, 1925, non-judicial rents are treated as second term judicial rents unless objection is lodged by the owner or the tenant, in which case the standard purchase annuity is fixed by the Land Purchase Commission.  I have ascertained as a result of enquiries made, that the percentage of objections in Northern Ireland in these cases is less than ten.  It is proposed by this section to treat non-judicial rents on the same basis as judicial rents fixed prior to the 16th August, 1911, thereby saving the time and the labour involved in the inspection and fixation of standard purchase annuities.  This saving will be very considerable and it will apply to the majority of the 24,000 non-judicial tenants in respect of which standard annuities have yet to be fixed.  Standard purchase annuities have been fixed in respect of 12,000 out of the 35,000 non-judicial tenants.  In 9,000 cases standard annuities were agreed upon between the owners and the tenants, and in 3,000 cases they were fixed by the Land Commission.  If we continue to follow the procedure of the last few years in the majority of the remaining cases the standard purchase annuities will be fixed by the Land Commission because it has been noticeable in recent months that the cases in which the annuity is fixed by agreement between the owners and the tenants are getting smaller and smaller, and possibly in a few months these cases of fixation would cease altogether.  I do not think there is any other point in connection with the Bill that I need enter on at this stage.  I have endeavoured to explain it as lucidly and as clearly as I could.</P>

      <P>There are cases of individual hardship in connection with some non-judicial holdings.  I have one case in mind.  The rent is generally recognised as a rack rent and the landlord accepted a greatly reduced sum from the tenant always. However, when he sent in his return to the Commission in connection with the Land Purchase Act he returned the old gross rent with the result that if an arrangement is not come to the tenant will have to pay an amount far in excess of the amount formerly accepted by the landlord.  At the present stage that rent is demanded from him and has to be paid to the Land Commission so that in this case it would be very necessary that a settlement should be made as quickly as possible, because the man has a distinct grievance.  He has been paying this for some years and will have to continue until a real settlement is arrived at.  That is only one case, but I have reason to believe that there are other cases.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Dáil declines to proceed further with the consideration of the Bill until the Government have submitted proposals for the amendment of the Land Act, 1923, to provide further for the more expeditious vesting of land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in putting down that amendment is to call attention to <Col N="444" /> one particular aspect of the work of the Land Commission and that is in connection with the vesting of land. There are very many aspects of the work of the Land Commission which on an occasion like this might be dealt with.  I propose, however, to confine myself to one specific question. There is all the more reason for that on account of the fact that we had been discussing this question of the vesting of land some time ago and it is well known that the Party opposite as well as the Party on this side of the House were very much interested in this question and were anxious that steps should be taken to complete the vesting of land as early as possible.  We expected now, when the Government were introducing a Bill, that definite steps would be laid down for the completion of that work.</P>
    <P>The Bill, however, I think, is extremely disappointing.  It deals with the matter in the usual tinkering fashion.  It does not propose to face the problem in the way that it ought to be faced, and if difficulties have to be removed all parties in the House should apply themselves to their removal and to finding out solutions for them.  But I think that since the Government have taken the trouble of introducing a Bill with reference to this question of vesting &mdash;because I presume, though it does not specifically state in the Bill that it has to do with vesting, the second section of it contemplates vesting&mdash; it is a step forward in that direction, they might have taken further steps towards the vesting of the non-judicial tenants.  The position of both classes of tenant is most unsatisfactory.  Of the non-judicial tenant, of whom there are some 35,768, only 2,385 have been vested up to the 31st March of this year, leaving 33,383 tenants still to be vested.  In that way it would take, I calculate, 84 years more to complete the vesting of non-judicial tenants. Although the difficulties in the matter of judicial tenants are not so great all that is necessary&mdash;as is now presumed in this Bill&mdash;for the non-judicial <Col N="445" /> tenant&mdash;all that was formerly necessary, in the case of the judicial tenants, was to take 65 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the judicial rent. Nevertheless, we find in the last figures that we have for year ending the 31st March, 1928, that about 50,000 judicial tenants have not been vested, and I calculate that it would take about 70 years more to complete the vesting of the judicial tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>By dividing the number vested yearly since the passing of the Act of 1923 into the total.  At that rate I think that about 1,000 is vested every year.  I think that is the rate at which the Land Commission is going.  Undoubtedly there has been an improvement, for which we will give the Parliamentary Secretary credit, and where there is an admission that there can be an improvement, and where we find the Land Commission vesting, during the past nine or ten months, more holdings than they vested in the preceding five or six years, we are tempted to ask why these steps were not taken before?  When we see this evidence of good intention on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department we are apt to say: &ldquo;Well, since we have the intention, let us get to the root of the thing, and let us make a complete job of it in this generation.&rdquo;  I hope that when replying the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to convince us that this work will be completed not only in the life of the present generation, but in a few years&mdash;in the lifetime of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another way we look at it is this. If the Parliamentary Secretary is not satisfied with these figures let him take the progress of the work during the past five years and base his estimates upon that.  He will find that the remainder of the work will not be completed for the next 70 or 80 years.  Then if he is not satisfied with that he will turn to the report on the work of his own Department as to the work that had been done <Col N="446" /> up to the 31st March, 1928.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find that for the year ending 31st March, 1928, the total amount of annuities collectible during that year in the case of tenants who are vested under the 1923 Act comes to only £50,000, representing annuities collectible from 1,363 tenants.  That is the number of tenants from whom annuities were being actually collected in 1928.  The amount collected was £50,000.  That is leaving out the arrears.  The number not vested was 94,568. Those tenants who had not been vested at that period, and of whom, of course, the vast majority have not yet been vested, were paying £950,000 annually interest in lieu of rent.</P>
    <P>I claimed here before, and I claim here now again, that that means that these people were not properly treated by reason of the failure of the Land Commission to implement what I claimed was the intention of the 1923 Land Act, to do away with the interest in lieu of rent period, and to give the tenant all the benefits in respect of reductions, and in respect of his payments going in liquidation of his purchase price.  By failing to give the tenants these advantages the Land Commission have been depriving the tenantry of a sum of £80,000 or £90,000 a year.  In any event, the amount payable by way of interest in lieu of rent for the year 1928 was £950,000. No portion of that money was going to clear off the liabilities of the tenant purchasers in the matter of the purchase price of their holdings.</P>
    <P>When I introduced a Bill here some time ago the Minister for Agriculture said that these difficulties were inherent in the processes of the Land Commission, and that the House could not solve the question. It was an impossible one.  The Minister went on to tell us that the 1923 Land Act did not contemplate, as far as I could make out, two processes but one single process.  That is to say, it didn't contemplate a preliminary step for vesting the rights of the holding in the Land Commission and afterwards vesting them in the tenant himself.  He said that the <Col N="447" /> two things took place together, and that they are, in fact, one operation. What I have been striving for here is to try to get to the position where, if necessary, instead of a single process you would have two operations, first vesting, as the Land Act of 1923, I think, contemplated, or, as it in fact says very definitely, first vesting in the Land Commission and then giving the tenant the full reduction on the spot, and secondly, giving him the benefit of having all his payments made after the vesting in the Land Commission go to pay off the purchase price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture will not deny that he said that the two things were the same&mdash;vesting in the Land Commission and vesting in the tenant.  Section 28 of the Land Act of 1923, sub-section (1), says: &ldquo;The tenant of every holding of tenanted land vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act, and to which this section applies, shall be deemed from the Appointed Day to have entered into a subsequent purchase agreement from the purchase of the holding to the Land Commission at the standard price.&rdquo;  There it speaks of vesting, and it also speaks in Section 24 of vesting the holding in the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the Minister may now claim that he did not intend in the Act of 1923 to abolish the interest in lieu of rent period, I say that he has specifically stated that fact&mdash;that the interest in lieu of rent period was to be done away with, and that was what he meant and what his intentions were at the time, but they have apparently been nullified by the Land Commission itself.  His intentions were that all the land would be vested in the Land Commission straight away, the reductions to the full extent would be given, and that afterwards the complete legal vesting would take place.  The Minister says that if we attempt to do what I strove to do in the Bill that I introduced here, that it would mean that <Col N="448" /> you would have to give a new interpretation to the term &ldquo;Appointed Day.&rdquo;  I think that no matter what step you take it will have to be in the nature of amending the Land Act of 1923, to secure your objective. When the Minister, in Section 2 of the present Bill, admits that a certain step can be taken, and when he provides for taking the standard purchase annuity of the non-judicial tenant at 65 per cent., or at a figure equivalent to that of judicial tenants whose rents were fixed before August, 1911, when they have put that down in their Bill, I think the House ought to insist on their taking a number of other steps, the first step being that contained in Section 2, which is undoubtedly a step in advance in so much as it conveys: &ldquo;We will take all the non-judicial tenants, whose circumstances vary widely and who would be entitled, if they went to court, to different percentages of reduction in their different cases; we will take them in a body in order to try to get through with the work, and we will fix a definite percentage for the whole lot of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fault I find with the section is that it does not state that the work should be completed in a certain time.  When the Land Commission says: &ldquo;We will fix the purchase annuity at a certain price,&rdquo; the House ought to say: &ldquo;Yes, and not alone will you fix it at a certain price, but we will see that the tenant is going to get the benefit of the reduction as soon as possible.&rdquo;  There is no use in passing this or any similar section into law if we have not some guarantee from the Minister that it is going to come into operation within a certain time. There is no guarantee whatever, and the Land Commission, even if this Bill is passed, can still go on in the slow and piecemeal fashion that we have had experience of in the last five or six years.  I want to see in Section 2, when amended, a provision that the work will be done within a certain time.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House to see that that is done.  They are just as much interested in the question as we are. <Col N="449" /> Now that the Bill is before the House it ought to be the object of every Deputy to improve it.</P>
    <P>The annuity is going to be fixed under sub-section (2).  It was very noticeable when I claimed before that it could be fixed by taking an approximate percentage that the Minister refused to discuss that aspect of the question.  He said there were legal difficulties and legal objections to giving the tenants the advantages we sought to get for them.  A sum of £950,000 is being paid every year and none of it is going to pay off the purchase price of the holdings.  What is to stop the Ministry from saying in the present Bill that from to-morrow all money paid as interest in lieu of rent will go to redeem the purchase price?  If they contend that the standard purchase annuity cannot be fixed immediately, even though they are taking a step in that direction, why do they not at least take the preliminary step of seeing that all the money the Irish tenant farmers are paying will go from to-morrow, or from some date in the near future, to pay off the purchase price?  I cannot see where there could be an objection to that.  If there is an objection it is on the financial side; it is on the plea that the Land Commission and the Treasury would be losing £90,000. But that £90,000 would be left in the pockets of the farmers instead of going to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>We can appreciate, therefore, why the Minister for Finance would not like that to be carried into law.  We certainly cannot appreciate why Deputies on the other side, claiming to represent the Farmers' Party and rural constituencies, can agree with the Minister for Agriculture when he says that there are legal objections. If there are any objections at all, they are financial.  They are objections to the loss by the Treasury and the Land Commission. The fact that the Land Commission are now prepared to fix the standard purchase annuity in the most difficult types of cases that they have had to deal with, and on a basis which <Col N="450" /> they have calculated, is significant. The cases that have passed through their hands amount to five per cent. of the total number and it is on that basis that they propose to fix these reductions.  Why can they not take a further step and say &ldquo;Let us start immediately giving the tenants further benefit, not alone giving them the reductions at once, but arranging that the amounts they are paying will go to pay off the purchase price?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a matter here which I was not in a position to reply to at the time, not being a lawyer and not being an expert in land law.  It was undoubtedly a point which took me somewhat unexpectedly. He brought in the question of the Local Registration of Titles Act.  He said that Act would be completely upset, and that the operation of the registration of titles would be thrown into confusion if we attempted to fix a date for the vesting of lands, or if we attempted to do what I say we should now do under this Bill, or else throw it out, and that is, see that this work of vesting is completed by a certain date.  I have since discovered that this Local Registration of Titles Act was passed in 1891.  It was passed in order to render the records of titles to land more easily accessible.  The fact that all transactions which come under the Land Purchase Acts have to be registered under a particular section of that Act merely means, in my opinion, that the British authorities at the time tried to implement their intentions by saying that all future transactions will have to be registered in this way.  When my Bill was under discussion the Minister for Agriculture said that the registration of titles which has to take place under Section 23 of that Act was coincident with and, if not synonymous with, was very closely related to the vesting of the land.</P>
    <P>I have discovered, and I shall be very delighted if the Minister can contradict me on the matter, that the registration of land does not take place until after the vesting. <Col N="451" /> The 1891 Act which the Minister stated would be rendered nugatory if we carried out the vesting of land immediately, contemplates that when a sale is carried out by the Land Commission, the Land Commission has to send a certain document specified under the Act in order to have the title registered.  But the land is first vested, the registration of title comes along afterwards.  If the Minister is right in his contention, I hope he will be able to prove it.  My information is that he is wrong, and that the two things are not coincident. If the Minister is right in his contention that the registration of title must accompany the vesting of the land and be part of the operation to some extent, I say, &ldquo;Can you not postpone the registration of title until such period as you can open your folio and transfer your fee-simple rights to the tenant?&rdquo; Can you not postpone that part of the legal effects of the Bill and give the tenants a material reduction now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the Land Commission have completed the work in their office.  Postpone it until the ordinary processes, which the Minister says cannot be expedited or improved on, are completed.  If that means giving a new interpretation to the term &ldquo;appointed day,&rdquo; or if it means amending the Land Act of 1923, I cannot see why that should not be done.  The Minister is greatly taken up with the question of title. He has seen that when it suited us, or rather suited him, in other directions we have had to pass retrospective legislation, and we had to say that things are not what they were. This is an extremely difficult matter. I say that the tenant is more interested in getting the financial concessions that were intended in the Act of 1923 than in the fee-simple of his land.  Once he gets possession of his land he knows that the rest will proceed as a matter of course.  Even when the land is vested under the present unwieldy and complicated system it is only vested, I believe, <Col N="452" /> subject to equities, that famous phrase which we have heard before.  It is not an absolutely unimpeachable title at the end of it all.  I raise these matters to show that there are difficulties, but that they are capable of solution.  When I introduced the Land Bill, which the Minister said was full of legal jargon, but which had only a single line, I tried to get agreement on the principle that if necessary the term &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; should get a new meaning, and should get the meaning that the financial benefits accruing to the tenant should be given to him at once, and also that legislation should be passed enabling the Land Commission to say, &ldquo;We will give the tenant reductions, but as to the folio and the transference of fee-simple, we can postpone them further.&rdquo;  I cannot see why the Minister cannot go back and carry out what I thought was his original intention in the 1923 Act, and have two processes &mdash;first, the process of vesting in the Land Commission and giving the tenant the benefit when that stage is completed, and then proceed with the vesting in the tenant himself.  The Minister no doubt will have answers to all these points, but will he go to the Land Commission officials and say that he wants this thing done, that he wants a way made out, and wants the draughtsman to complete what we are all anxious should be completed&mdash;namely, the vesting of lands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that even the officials of the Land Commission who have to do with the business of vesting will admit that the thing can be done and that you can give reductions at once, whatever the financial objections may be.  They are certainly there, but there cannot and ought not be legal objections.  You can complete your legal work afterwards. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us, in reply to a question which I put to him yesterday, that the average reduction of non-judicial rents when the tenants were vested was 35 per cent.  It was something over 33 per cent. when agreement was reached between the tenant and <Col N="453" /> the landlord, and where there was no agreement and when the case went to the Judicial Commissioner it was somewhat higher and went to about 38 per cent.  If we are going to take as a basis all the transactions before the Judicial Commissioner or all the vesting the Land Commission has already made, 35 per cent.  would be reasonable; but there is another side to the question.  The total number that have been vested up to the present is very small&mdash;only five per cent.  Is that a fair basis to take for the remaining 95 per cent.?  Is it fair to say that because in five per cent.  of the cases already dealt with there has been a reduction of 35 per cent., the remaining 95 per cent should be treated in the same way? I think that even the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that some of them were rackrented in the way in which Deputy Goulding mentioned.  They have been deprived of the benefits of the Act and have been paying these rackrents, and is it now the policy of the Executive to give them only 35 per cent.  reduction, despite the fact that they were paying rackrents while other tenants, who had the good fortune to be vested, have got their reductions and have been paying off the purchase price?</P>
    <P>I think it is quite unjust, even if the proceedings under the Judicial Commissioner and the Land Commission show an average reduction up to the present of only 35 per cent., to put these tenants on the same basis as judicial tenants.  I would like to hear arguments in support of it.  These tenants have not been able to get fair rents fixed for generations. Some of them, the Minister will no doubt say, could have got fair rents fixed, but they did not get fair rents because they were well enough off before.  But the majority of them have been suffering from the burden of heavy rents and have not had the advantages of the Land Purchase Acts like those whose annuities have been fixed.  I therefore say that the reduction should be very much greater.  If there are reasons against that I would like to hear them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> Therefore, as this Bill does not contemplate vesting of the lands in the near future, and as there is nothing to show that land will be vested more quickly as the result of its passing, I move this amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishery rights I have only to say that it is a pity that the Land Commission could not take up that question and deal with it in a more national and whole-hearted fashion than it has been dealt with so far. The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that the Bill provides that where the owner and the landlord agree the rights may be purchased.  Supposing the owner does not agree, and that it is necessary, or that the Land Commission deem it right, to purchase certain rights, such as exist in my constituency, on several fisheries that are not preserved by the landlord, they will not have power to buy them under this Bill, because they will not have the consent of the owners.</P>
    <P>In connection with Section 4, the correction of the term &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; and the remedying of the defect in the original Act where the Land Commission decided to vest certain fishing rights which they considered are appurtenant or belonging to the holding, the landlord or owner can still appeal where the Land Commission decide that the fishery is an essential part of the amenities of the holding.  I cannot see why there should be a right of appeal even if in sub-section (2) of Section 4 the Land Commission in the Bill determine in advance what the decision of the Commissioner shall be, that he shall have no option except to say that certain fishery rights which belonged to certain holdings are to be vested in them.  What principle is the Judicial Commissioner going to approach this question on?  I think that the section is defective when it leaves no discretion to the Judicial Commissioner, that is, it leaves him no discretion where a clear principle is not laid down on which to approach the matter.  There is no principle laid down here, and in fact the Commissioner will, in my opinion, still have the right to say that the fishing <Col N="455" /> rights are not appurtenant and should not be vested.</P>

      <P>I am prompted to advise the Land Commission to be very careful in the drafting of this Bill because of the fact that a tenant farmer in my district was a victim of the looseness with which the last Act was drafted.

      <P>Deputy Derrig dealt with this matter in an absolutely relevant fashion.  What we are considering here is the land law and an amendment of that law. The Deputy was arguing that the amendment suggested here is not going far enough to achieve his particular purpose.  Here we are dealing with the law as it stands and a delay that is apparently due to a defect in the law, and not due to the administration of the Land Commission. I feel that if we get into examples from particular areas we will simply get into a discussion of particular cases dealt with by the Land Commission.  I would prefer to keep to a discussion of the state of the law and suggested amendments of the law.  I do not think we should use the debate to ventilate particular cases, because experience in the House has shown the Deputy as it has shown me that, unfortunately, we would never get to the end of them.</P>

      <P>I simply say that the Land Commission should be more careful than it has been and that it should not leave any loop-hole in the present Bill.  I do not believe that there is any provision in the Bill for dealing with the 1903 tenants.  They should be included.  It may be contended that the 1903 tenants signed an agreement.  They did, but a great many of the tenants as we are <Col N="456" /> all aware, at that time signed under duress.  For that reason, I think it is the bounden duty of our Government to see that they are relieved of the oppression, as it was nothing else at the time.  I think some clause should be inserted in the Bill that would deal with the 1903 tenants as well as the 1923 tenants.  Care should be taken to see that the Bill is left watertight and that it will not be as loose as the last one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing this Bill, described it as short and simple.  His explanation was good and his description of the Bill was quite correct.  It is too short, and it is, in ways, too simple.  That is one of the faults that I have to find with it.  Section 1, of course, is to remedy defects, not in draughtsmanship found in previous legislation, but in the interpretation given to certain terms in actions in the Courts.  It will be at least the second improvement in the 1923 Act, in which several flaws were discovered.  We have been twitted by the Minister for Agriculture for faulty draughtsmanship in connection with another Bill, but we get frequent examples of it from Government Benches and from Ministers who, of course, have expert staffs at their disposal whose services we cannot avail of.  When we suggested that it was possible, or not beyond the ability of the Government or the Minister for Agriculture, if they so desired, to separate vesting from registration, he poohed-poohed the idea.  Now we find that one of the suggestions made in our Bill has been partly adopted in this Bill.  I submit that is in connection with the non-judicial tenancies set out here.  The Minister is inclined to make a fetish of registration.  I do not see why, even if it does mean a further amendment of the 1923 Act, we could not delay registration until after vesting, so as to give tenants the two great advantages of the reduction which generally follow vesting and the commencement of paying off the purchase price of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have instances of neighbours who are jealous of one another over <Col N="457" /> the different positions in which they are placed on the same estate or on neighbouring estates&mdash;some of them vested and some of them not vested, some of them getting reductions and some of them not.  We do not know how long they will have to go on paying interest in lieu of rent at the rate of £90,000 a year.  We have in this House the example of a man who is paying interest in lieu of rent for seventeen years, and he does not know how long more he will be so paying.  In a recent debate, figures were put up by me showing that the delay of the Land Commission in vesting has in the last few years mulcted tenants to the extent of half a million pounds.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that he did not quite believe these figures, that the figures were complicated and required investigation. I presume he did not look into them since, as his hands were pretty full.</P>
    <P>Of course, we will hear from the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;at least, we hope so, because it is a pleasure to listen to him.  In connection with the Agricultural Credit Bill I put a certain case to him in reference to mortgagees which he controverted. Subsequently he adopted the case I made because it suited his purpose. He can make the worst appear the best cause whenever it suits him. Some time ago he painted a doleful picture of the troubles that would arise in separating vesting from registration and the employment that would be given to lawyers.  I think if the Deputies in this House excluded the lawyers and if all parties got a committee together to go into the question of the Land Commission, they could do very useful work.  They could afterwards get the legal gentlemen to put their ideas into proper form so that they would be water-tight. There is undoubtedly dissatisfaction with the working of the Land Commission on all sides of the House. It would be much better to face the whole problem at once than to be bringing in piecemeal legislation such as this, and see what could be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> Arguments might be brought forward to show how long it will take to complete land purchase and the vesting of estates at the present rate of progress.  I might, if I so desired, prove that it would take 150 years at the present rate of progress. I do not want, however, to go into figures here, because I do not think it would serve any useful purpose.  We all agree that it is going on too slowly, and we all agree that the cherished hopes of the Minister for Agriculture in 1923 are not being fulfilled.  He is a sadder and a wiser man.  We still have hopes that the 1923 Act can be amended to achieve the purposes which the Minister had in view and can do it very rapidly also.  We think that a committee of Deputies of the House should be appointed to consider the whole question of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A very important point arises here, and that is the question of fisheries.  Inland fisheries, particularly, should be considered from the national point of view.  The whole law relating to them as far as I can grasp it&mdash;it is very difficult to get accurate information&mdash;is in a chaotic condition. You have Charters and Royal Grants going back 700 years in cases.  I wonder how are those to be dealt with.  These inland fisheries are and should be a great national asset and should be dealt with, I think, as a national problem. In tidal and non-tidal waters, at present, some tenants have fishing rights vested only half-way across the river, and the riparian owner on the opposite bank has no rights whatever.  Those problems are not faced in this Bill.  It would require a much wider Bill and much more careful consideration.  I submit it would be better to withdraw this Bill and consider the matter much more fully.  They talk here of buying out with those 4½ per cent. Land Bonds.  So far so good.  Rules have to be made, and there is a <Col N="459" /> danger in that.  I believe that is dealt with in Section 6 in this Bill.  I think the Ministry should go very carefully and cautiously into this matter.  It would be possible if a wrong person were introduced into a key position to vitiate all legislation and nullify the intentions of this House.  I am not quite satisfied with the suggestion put forward in Section 6.  Might it not be possible for the Ministry of Fisheries to nominate somebody for the position as set out in Section 6?  In view of the whole position&mdash;the concessions made here considered impossible a few months ago, the necessity of dealing with the fisheries problem and of the land legislation much more fully than is done in this Bill and perhaps the advisability of setting up a Commission of members of this House of all sides&mdash;I have pleasure in seconding this amendment of Deputy Derrig.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Section 4 leaves the fishery question very much where it is.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever, after the passing of this Act, any land to which a fishery or fishing right is appurtenant within the meaning of Section 45 of the Land Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately when this question of fishing rights occurred the landlords always claimed that the fishery rights are not appurtenant to the land, and they have insisted that the fishing rights be retained by themselves. That is a very serious bone of contention in many parts of the country.  Apart from that proposal, there is the question of the fishery rights in tidal waters.  These rights are claimed by the old landlords to go back practically to Magna Charta.  Reading an account of the life of Sir Walter Raleigh, it was stated boldly there that Sir Walter Raleigh got possession of certain fishing rights along the River Black-water. It was stated that these were the property of the public. They were taken over, and that still holds.  These fishery rights should be the property of the Irish public, <Col N="460" /> and not the property of any individual, and an Act which is going to remedy that is required.</P>
    <P>Going back to the question of non-tidal fishery rights, the fishery rights along the rivers adjacent to the holdings are a very serious cause of trouble.  The Act as it stands will not remedy that trouble.  I think we should defer this matter until we are prepared to tackle this question seriously, and define once and for all who owns these rights.  It is a matter of argument whether the rights are to be vested in the individual farmers or the State, but it should be clearly understood, whether they are to be vested in the farmers or the State, that they should not be left in possession of the men who claim them now.</P>

      <P>I intend to deal with Clause 2, one of the main clauses of this Bill.  This is a very broad question applying to the class of tenants coming in under the same head.  What were understood as non-judicial tenants were tenants who did not go in of their own accord, or whom the landlord did not bring in, and who did not have rents fixed.  Then there was a type of tenant debarred by previous Acts from going in.  There was also a type of tenant who came in under the 1923 Act, because of the clause permitting short-term leases here. That was a different class of tenant altogether.  In most cases that type of tenant came in at a very heavy rent, running up to £2, and in some cases more per acre.  In dealing with non-judicial tenants, the one term cannot be made to apply to the three different types.  We have always accepted in every Act that the judicial basis should be the basis on which all Acts should work.  Reductions were made for a particular type of judicial rentals, such a percentage from the first, such a percentage from the second, and so on. Every judge and judicial commissioner should bear in mind what would be the judicial value of tenancies under previous Acts.  The security of the State was always the guiding principle.  Where you have <Col N="461" /> an increased rental or what would be a judicial rental, the security of the State in that case is very much affected.</P>

      <P>This Bill is just aiming to remove a few of the difficulties that exist with regard to the speeding up, and why it should be postponed until something further is done I am at a loss to understand. There are several difficulties.  This is one of them, and it proposes to remove it.  There may be other difficulties. I am sure there are, and it is only a method of getting out of those.  Why should we stand over this particular amendment?  The process always was that where there was a non-judicial tenancy the Land Commission was bound to send down an examiner in every case to see that the Land Commission had security.  Even though the tenant was going into court the Land Commission had to send down an inspector to see that security was sufficient.  It is proposed to dispense with that.  The inspector will only come down where the tenant or landlord refuses to agree to a price and on the application of one or the other.  That will lessen the question of inspection considerably, I should say about 60 or 65 per cent., because a majority of the estates coming in under the 1923 Act were large estates and not isolated estates let on leases.  In many of these estates there was a considerable number of non-judicial tenancies that had to be examined. This is a proposal to dispense with that.  I cannot understand the objection of Deputy Derrig, and I cannot understand the object which he has in suggesting to fix a date on which certain things will be done. If you fix dates there are obstacles on the road which must be removed and the thing cannot take effect until those obstacles are removed. There are obstacles of title, survey and registration.  You can make a proposal that any or all of these be dispensed with.</P>

If Deputy Derrig introduces a Bill dispensing with these or with some of them, we will know where we are, and we will argue it, as to whether it is right to dispense with these formalities or not, or whether we are giving the tenant security in whatever holding he gets.  Here we have a scheme that takes no cognisance of the obstacles on the road.  I do not want to make personal comments.  I am a tenant myself, and I am personally interested, but while you have all these things to be done you have either to comply with them or pass legislation dispensing with them.</P>

      <P>I think I proposed one year.  I cannot remember a discussion of six years ago, but I think, roughly, I am right.  I remember distinctly the Minister for Agriculture agreeing to the term; as a matter of fact, I think the phraseology was his own, that the net rent actually paid on the gale day previous to the passing of the Act was to be the basis on which the Act was to operate.  While we have these present regulations, and while all these formalities have to be complied with, I do not see any reason in the objection to the Bill becauses it proposes to remove one or two of the difficulties.  If there are other difficulties it is our business to dispose of them altogether.  Deputy Derrig said that they had shown that these difficulties were capable of solution. I would not have commented at all on his speech were it not to ask what he means by the phrase, &ldquo;they have shown that these difficulties are capable of solution.&rdquo;  He has not attempted to show how they can be solved, except by a pious expression <Col N="464" /> of opinion, to fix a particular day, without taking any cognisance of the obstacles or doing anything to remove them or to simplify them.  I want to emphasise that judicial commissioners, or any officials brought into existence in this or any other Bill, must bear in mind the opinion of this Dáil and the mentality of the people who passed these Acts when they say that all land purchase must be based on judicial value Some decisions have been given based on war-time value, a fictitious value that will have no relation to the future no more than it has any relation to the period before the war. I know that the Land Commission have been forced by misguided clamour to pay fictitious prices, war prices for land in many cases against their will.  That is one of the things that must be guarded against.  Anything that tends to get away from judicial value I certainly will not welcome or give any sanction to, if I can help it.</P>

      <P>No; but there is a section which allows either the tenant or the landlord to appeal to the Judicial Commissioner to fix the amount, and in that way it is.  I am not talking so much about what an Act does, as what might get into the mind of judicial valuers who might be called upon to make a decision.  I want them to realise that every Land Act passed has been based upon judicial value.  I think it is ridiculous to oppose the Bill for what it does <Col N="465" /> not do, when what it does is useful and will go a long way to remove the undoubted difficulties that exist. Why it should be opposed because it does that, I cannot understand. There may be other difficulties, but let them be put up in some other form and let suggestions be made for dealing with them.  Not one sensible suggestion has been made to get over the difficulties.  No solution has been offered, and it is ridiculous to claim that solutions have been offered.</P>

      <P>He has stated what ought to be done.  I do not want to go any further in discussing what ought to be done at this stage, when people are at loggerheads about it and are going to get annoyed with one another.  The advantage of the amendment is that it affords both sides of the House an opportunity to agree to certain amendments being brought in on the Committee Stage without committing themselves to them.  If the Government will allow certain amendments to be discussed in Committee on their merits, they will not be committed to those amendments, but those amendments will enable us to put forward the case in detail, clause by clause.  The main purpose of the amendment is to show that we are dissatisfied with <Col N="466" /> the Bill because it does not go far enough; but if an understanding could be arrived at that we would agree to discuss new clauses in Committee, a very satisfactory step forward would be made, and I hope that that course will be seriously considered by the Government. There will be a great many cases where the fixing of the sixty-five per cent. will not be satisfactory from the point of view of the tenant. There are tenants who never got a chance of having a judicial rent fixed.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of the story of the dispensary doctor who had a curious way of dealing with patients.  A poor man was asked how did he like going to Dr. So-and-so, and he said that the doctor took them in clusters&mdash;he took all his patients together and treated them as if they were one.  This section is dealing with the tenants in clusters. The Government are basing their average of what is fair to non-judicial tenants on an estimate, as Deputy Derrig pointed out, of only five per cent. of the whole lot.  If that is not correct I shall be glad to hear another view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the difficulty is that these tenants are put in the position that they are going to have an immediate reduction if they accept the sixty-five per cent., whereas if they refuse it, they may get better terms.  It looks very like the old trick by which the land movement was broken in the time of Parnell, when by giving an immediate advantage to the tenant the solidarity of the tenant movement was broken.  I do not wish to place the thing in so hostile a light as that, but, at the same time, there will be the same tendency on the part of the tenants to be drawn into accepting a reduction and not going before the Judicial Commissioner and getting better terms.  The advantage is for the landlords here, <Col N="467" /> because the terms will be advantageous to the landlords.  If there was a reduction under Section 2 to sixty per cent. instead of sixty-five, it might be nearer to what would be fair to the average number of non-judicial tenants.</P>
      <P>As to the other sections dealing with the fishery rights, I want to associate myself with what Deputy Goulding has said.  There are some very valuable fishery rights in Ireland which really should belong to the Irish people, to the Fishery Department or in some shape or form should be to the advantage of the Irish people, because at present they are simply to the advantage of strangers.  In some cases we have London firms owning very valuable salmon fishery rights and simply shipping the salmon out of the country and drawing the full profits. In the case of the Devonshire estate one man owns very valuable rights which extend from the harbour of Youghal up to Lismore.  I think it would be much fairer to take these rights over and compensate the owner, so far as compensation is either desirable or equitable, but, at any rate, to see that these rights are placed to the benefit of the Irish people.  Of course, it goes very much beyond the limits of this Bill, but the Bill suggests the idea and a good idea is always worth mentioning.</P>
      <P>Then there is the disadvantage in the way in which Sections 3 and 4 are framed.  Section 3 deals with the rights which would be vested or might be vested before the passing of this Act, and Section 4 deals with those which might be vested after the passing of the Act.  They give unlimited discretion to the Commissioners. The use of the words &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;not advisable&rdquo; is very vague.  You could hardly find more vague words than these. I would suggest that some sort of definition of what the word &ldquo;advisable&rdquo; means there, should have to be introduced into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall not say any more about it, but what I want to get at is, you may have a Judicial Commissioner, where the terms are so vague, who may be more favourable to one side than the other, and past experience, covering not merely from five or six years, but from a great many more years, shows that the tendency in these matters is to favour the landlord rather than the tenant.  I am not speaking of any individual, but I think that this is fair criticism of the administration in the past.  In conclusion, I would urge upon the Government to take that point of view of our amendment, and to say whether they would be agreeable to discuss amendments which may be introduced from this side of the House on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this amendment must, I greatly fear, cause a very painful impression amongst those who are so vitally interested and affected by it.  It must be to them, as, indeed, it must be to all of us, very regrettable to find a political party claiming to act with some sense of responsibility proclaiming in one breath that they are in favour of the speeding up of land purchase and in favour of redressing the undoubted grievances to which the non-judicial tenants are almost of necessity subjected, and in the next breath to find them opposing a provision which they admittedly and confessedly state is a step in the right direction, or, to use Deputy Derrig's words, a step in advance.  In advance of what?  In advance of the conditions under which the non-judicial tenants are labouring to-day.  &ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; says Deputy Derrig, &ldquo;we do not <Col N="469" /> want it.  This step, if you make it law, will advance the condition of the non-judicial tenant.  We do not want to do that,&rdquo; says the Deputy. And, mark you, that attitude and policy are in keeping with the attitude and policy which Deputy Derrig and Deputy Fahy, and those associated with them have proclaimed not now for the first time.  They have proclaimed it openly and above board not many weeks ago, when they introduced into this House a Bill which they still complain was not passed, a Bill which, it was clear to anybody possessed of the meanest intelligence, could only have one result, and that was to throw land purchase into chaos and to delay, embarrass and inconvenience the non-judicial tenant.  To-day the Party opposite are back upon that.  They still proclaim that they are unable to understand why that legislation which was the most foolish and childish ever introduced into a responsible assembly, was not passed. It was a Bill that I might venture to say was conceived in ignorance, born in dishonesty, and died at the hands of the Minister for Agriculture from exposure.  And the Party opposite complain that should be so.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputy Derrig, when that Bill was before us, make suggestions which no human being could carry into effect.  The Minister for Agriculture made it perfectly clear to everybody why these steps should not be taken, and that you could not vest land until you first had ascertained the preliminaries.  But to-day we find put before us by Deputy Derrig as representing the land policy of the Party on whose behalf he speaks, a proposal to vest land without first ascertaining the owner or the persons from whom you are going to take it and put it into the hands of somebody else.  That is the first step, and Deputy Derrig tells us there would be no difficulty whatever about it if you could get rid of the unfortunate lawyer.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe is quite wrong in his statement that I said you should vest.  I said you should give the tenants a reduction at once, <Col N="470" /> and that you could vest later on. That is the only full and legal meaning of the term &ldquo;vest.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>We all heard from Deputy Derrig the suggestion that vesting and registration should be separated. They are separate transactions. Even now he does not see that.  He agrees, and has conceded that a reduction cannot be given until the land is vested.  You cannot vest one person's land in another until you first ascertain by investigation of title the name of the person to whom the land at present belongs, and from whom you intend to take it and put it into the possession of another person.  That is the first step.  And by no human process that I know of, or that can be conceived by anybody having any knowledge of law or morality, can you take from one person his land without giving him some notice of it or seeing that you have got before the court the person to whom the land belongs.  I do not know, and it would be for Deputy Derrig to tell me, how you can proceed to vest land without ascertaining the purchase price.  You can, says Deputy Derrig, give the tenant the reduction to which he is entitled.  In the name of heaven, does not the Deputy realise now that the annuity depends upon the purchase money and that the purchase money must first be ascertained, and that until you do what Section 2 of the Bill contemplates and which he is trying to thwart, you cannot ascertain the annuities and purchase moneys, and you cannot vest the land.  Even at this time I ask the Opposition will they oppose Section 2, and are they serious in the vendetta they are pursuing against the non-judicial tenants?  Beyond any doubt or question Section 2 has gone very far to advance the position of the non-judicial tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig admits that.  So must anybody admit it.  That being <Col N="471" /> so, why is the Bill being opposed? Why is it being opposed by people who suggest that they are in favour of the non-judicial tenants?  Could anything more ridiculous be conceived than the suggestion submitted to a responsible House: &ldquo;We agree that this Act helps the non-judicial tenants; we agree that it is a step in advance, that it is a step in favour of the non-judicial tenants, but we want to throw it out?  We are opposing it, and we have brought forward amendments, and we ask you to put one more barrier in the way of the non-judicial tenant by passing an amendment declining to proceed further with the consideration of the Bill until certain steps have been taken?&rdquo;  Ought there not be some limit to common sense, or is it to be conceived that there is not to be any common sense in the consideration of a Bill of this sort?  Is it to be conceived that you are going to get into the Division Lobby against the non-judicial tenants?  Are the Deputies who sit on the opposite benches going to go into the Lobby against the non-judicial tenant?  Let them go there, but let them go there openly and say: &ldquo;We are going there, but we are going there because we are going against the non-judicial tenants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thought as a result of what has already occurred on the previous Bill that the Opposition would have shown that they had learned what, I think, Deputy Fahy has learned, the simple problem which Deputy Derrig has not yet learned, and that is how to calculate the progress of land purchase.  It is very easy, Deputy Derrig says, to do it.  I tried already on the discussion on the Estimates to show the House how easy it is not to do it.  But here is the explanation the Deputy gives: If a thousand cases are going through the Land Commission, and if at the end of five years 100 of them have been advanced to completion, then, says Deputy Derrig, no matter how far the remaining 900 have gone towards completion it will take 45 years to complete them.  That is a calculation which, apparently, the Opposition <Col N="472" /> Party give as their considered view. That is the sort of method by which they measure the progress of land purchase.  Of course, the whole thing is false.  It is all nonsense.  Of course, it is only eye-wash.  I do not suggest that any single member opposite could be so absolutely bereft of intelligence as to suggest that Deputy Derrig is serious in putting forward such a case.  I suggest that Deputy Derrig is not serious when he proposes that as a basis of calculation to be adopted, on the face of which it will take 84 years to complete the vesting of non-judicial holdings and 70 years to complete the vesting of judicial holding.</P>

      <P>Of course the Deputy does not believe that, but why put eye-wash like that in the eyes of the public?  Why bring such a proposal forward?  There is no sense or meaning in it.  I tell the Deputy that it is unsafe to assume that the farmers of this country are fools.  They have sense enough to know that calculations of that sort are as absurd as the campaign for the abolition of the land annuities, and are only conceived and manufactured for political propaganda and only used for the sole purpose, if possible, of gulling the farmers into believing what everybody knows is not true.  I appeal to everybody in this House who has an interest in land purchase to pass this Bill now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not often throw bouquets at Government Departments, but I do say that I would be proud to take my hat off to the draftsman who drew Section 2 of that Bill, because in my respectful opinion and submission to this House he has clearly and concisely dealt with a serious difficulty; in that short section he has drawn a provision which can only have the effect of immensely greasing the wheels of land purchase in Ireland in favour of the non-judicial tenant.  Deputy Little really makes the only argument which might, perhaps, appeal to him <Col N="473" /> and which might appeal to me as well.  It might not appeal to other members of the House, and I am not so sure that it does appeal to me either.</P>
    <P>Really the only thing that can be said against the section was said by Deputy Little.  Deputy Little said, in effect, &ldquo;It will interfere with the advance of litigation.&rdquo;  Let every man mind his own job.  Deputy Little and I will mind ours.  Deputy Little said: &ldquo;If you pass this Bill I am afraid the tenants will not make objections, they will be inclined to accept without litigation and the landlords will be inclined to do the same.  They both will be anxious to get to the end of land purchase.&rdquo;  I agree with Deputy Little that this section has a very serious objection, if a serious objection it is at all.  That serious objection is that beyond any doubt or question it will succeed largely in doing away with a vista of litigation that otherwise will take ten, twenty or thirty years to settle or get rid of between unreasonable landlords, on the one hand, and unreasonable tenants on the other side.  All that litigation is to be got rid of, as Deputy Little pointed out.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe made one very fair admission.  He said that he was going to mind his job and I think he has proved this evening that he has at least intelligence enough left to try to mind his job. I take it that Deputy Wolfe is Deputy Gorey's legal adviser in connection with the speeches he makes. The speech that Deputy Gorey made struck me with amazement, particularly when I remember the speech he made in this House on the 7th <Col N="474" /> March last when he was dealing with the Vote on Account.  The reference is Vol. 28, No. 3, col. 1095. Deputy Gorey was speaking on this very question of the vesting of the holdings, and he showed all the difficulties that stood in the way.  He said: &ldquo;The question of charges as against an estate should cease now, and whatever charges there are against an estate should be against the stock or whatever is going to be held by the landlord until such time as these mortgages are cleared. There ought to be no difficulty in this matter, but lawyers seem to be too strong for the best intentions. The whole thing could be done in six months.  The Government had better make up their minds that people will not stick it any longer. Machinery ought to be found, and must be found, to end the matter.&rdquo; That is what Deputy Gorey said last March and, lo and behold!  in July he says there are a lot more obstacles in the way besides what have been dealt with here and we must proceed patiently.</P>
      <P>As for Deputy Wolfe's argument that tenants cannot get the reduction until the land is vested within the full meaning of the Act, we maintain they could get the reduction without vesting within the full meaning of the Act and without registration of title and all the other legal difficulties which Deputy Wolfe's fraternity have thrown in the way.</P>

      <P>Section 2 presumes to fix the land purchase price.  It sets out that &ldquo;the standard purchase annuity shall (save as is hereinafter otherwise provided) be an annuity of an amount equivalent to sixty-five per cent. of the rents payable in respect of the holding.&rdquo;  We had an admission from the Parliamentary Secretary that agreements between the landlords and tenants were nearly finished with.  He said that in a month or so the cases in which landlords and tenants agreed would be finished.  That shows that though we have only about five per cent. of those dealt with, still we have reached the end of our resources under the recent Land Acts which have been produced from time to time in this House.  The tenants have no way except to get the inspectors down, to go into the matter in that fashion and get the thing fixed by the Land Commission officials.  I wonder how the figure of sixty-five per cent. was arrived at. This measure, like every other measure introduced here, puts on the tenant all the legal difficulties and charges.  In practically every case the tenant will have to make his appeal to the court.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and every other individual who knows anything about land is aware that sixty-five per cent. for a non-judicial holding is unfair and unjust.  It is not by any means sufficient for non-judicial holders who have been up to the present rackrented and unfairly treated.  Of course the landlord element in the Land Commission offices is too strong.  The landlord element is there, and there, too, are the comrades whom Deputy Wolfe will favour when there is a job to be done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig's amendment asks the Dáil to decline to proceed with the consideration of the Bill until the Government has submitted proposals for the amendment of the 1923 Act to provide for the more expeditious vesting of land. There is no definite date indicated on which the land would be vested, whether it be in five, ten, or eighty-five years.  Of course, we recollect the famous statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary on one occasion to the effect that permanent officials cannot be interfered with. Section 3 deals with fishing rights. Those sections leave the whole matter practically where it was.  There is no hope for the unfortunate tenants. As Deputy Goulding pointed out a while ago, there are tenants on one side of the river who have fishing rights, but the tenants on the other <Col N="477" /> side have no such rights because the landlord is still in possession.  I am more than anxious that we should put an end definitely to this matter of the landlord owning all the fishing rights.  It has gone too far, and the tenants have suffered too much under this particular heading.  I hope to introduce a few amendments to these sections on the Committee Stage, if this Bill gets so far.  I hope it will not go that far, particularly because there are no proposals in it to hasten the vesting of holdings.  I hope if this Bill is to go through at all that the sections will be carefully considered and amended in such a way as to render them water-tight, and so make the position of the tenant more secure.  I do not want to have a continuance of what now exists in my constituency&mdash;unfortunate tenants suffering from year to year, as the landlords refuse to allow them to purchase because they will not hand over the fishing rights to the landlord.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of these cases; they have come up here before him and he has gone into them. Acting on the knowledge which he got from these cases, I think he should definitely put an end to this injustice that is going on.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I have very much further to say as regards this Bill.  In my opinion, the knowledge that the Parliamentary Secretary and those others acting for the Land Commission have gained through being faced with the failures which exist in the 1923 and 1927 Acts, should induce them to produce a Bill that will enable them to finish the job.  They should by now have sufficient knowledge to do that and finish this question, so that the unfortunate tenants will not be losing at the rate of £90,000 a year by reason of the non-vesting of their holdings.  They ought to be able to finish it in such a way that from the date of the passing of that Bill, or this Bill amended so as to bring in all these questions, those tenants' payments will in future be payments of the purchase money and not payments of interest in lieu of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I think that that could be done. There should be no difficulty about it.  The unfortunate tenants would not then have to pay £90,000 a year more than they should for their rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies I just desire to say a few words.  As has been explained before&mdash;even though Deputy Wolfe may try to confuse the minds of some innocent Deputies&mdash;Section 2 fixes the standard annuity for non-judicial tenants at sixty-five per cent., but no one has suggested that the non-judicial tenants are going to get the full advantage of this section until they are first vested. If they are not vested for five, ten, fifteen or twenty years they will be in the same position as if this Bill were not passed.  In the interests of non-judicial tenants I think that we are justified in bringing in an amendment on Second Reading to have vesting done as speedily as possible.  If we had an opportunity of bringing in such an amendment on the Committee Stage we would have done so, but amendments such as this can only be introduced on the Second Stage.  Therefore, we have brought it in in this particular place.  Deputy Wolfe talked about a Bill which was introduced here some time ago and which he said was born in dishonesty.  The honest and independent member for West Cork went on to talk about our leaving the non-judicial tenants in the wilderness for the sake of the judicial tenants.  If Deputy Wolfe, who held this party up as dishonest in regard to that Bill, had been honest enough to read the Bill or to remember what was in it, he would have known that it was provided in that Bill that non-judicial tenants must be vested within three years.  Nobody in this House, not even Deputy Wolfe who has the hardihood to assert almost anything, would assert that the Land Commission at the present rate of progress will have all the non-judicial tenants vested within three years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the landlord obviously.  To whom do the Land Commission give over the payments in lieu of rent when they come from the tenant?  Do they make any inquiries as to who is the rightful landlord or do they merely hand them over? Surely if they do not inquire the Land Commission are not fit to handle public money.  Surely they know who the landlord is before they give it to him and, if he is the rightful landlord, he has the right to get the money.  How are you going to calculate the standard annuity? You have only to read up one particular schedule to the Land Act of 1923 to see how the standard annuity is to be fixed.  Even a Deputy without the mathematical knowledge of Deputy Wolfe would understand how it is fixed.  There is no difficulty in getting over the question raised by Deputy Wolfe against giving reductions to the tenant of ten or fifteen per cent.  as the case may be.  He is entitled to that on vesting.  The principal point made by Deputy Derrig was that it appeared to be contemplated in the 1923 Act that the land would first be vested in the Land Commission, who would then vest it in the tenants, but that during the administration of the Act that came to be regarded as one operation; in other words, that the vesting in the Land Commission and the vesting in the tenant synchronised.  I would like when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying that he would give us his opinion, because he should have some knowledge of the land law.  I do not think that Deputy Wolfe has</P>

      <P>The Deputy spent most of his life in other branches of the law, and he shows by his speeches that he knows very little about land <Col N="480" /> law.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would point out what particular difficulty there is in having the land first vested in the Land Commission, then giving the reduction which is due to the tenant, and then allowing the legal formalities consequent on vesting to go through. If there is any difficulty I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to point it out.  The tenants under the 1923 Act got a 25 per cent.  reduction, and now, before they are vested, they have to pay what is called interest in lieu of rent. I am fairly certain that that interest in lieu of rent is collected by the Land Commission as agents and handed over to the landlord.  Why is it called interest in lieu of rent and not called rent, as it is collected in the ordinary way?  The landlord is saved the expense of having an agent to collect it.  Why is it not called rent, except to throw camouflage over the whole thing, and to give the impression to people that vesting has been advanced a further stage?  I know that there is a reduction of 25 per cent., so far as the tenant is concerned, but is there any other change?  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to point out any legal or financial difficulty in carrying out our proposal.  We all realise the financial difficulty, that the Government would be embarrassed in having to find the £90,000 required to meet all the reductions if given immediately.  Would he point out the difficulty of having the land vested in the Land Commission, and then, when all the stages are gone through, having it vested in the tenant?</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether it is intended that this clause should apply to patches of land that become derelict and that have already been vested in the Land Commission.  Will the Land Commission undertake under this clause to deal with such land?  Deputy Wolfe said that he gathered from speeches made by Deputies on our benches that we were not in favour of assisting the non-judicial tenant. I am sure that Deputy Wolfe was <Col N="481" /> not sincere when he made that statement. He knows perfectly well that our attitude is in favour of assisting the non-judicial tenant and tenants in general.  Our reason for criticising the Bill is that we are not at all too sure that full justice is being done to the non-judicial tenant.  The maximum reduction allowed to them under this Bill is 35 per cent., whereas we find that in the 1903 Act the maximum reduction was 40 per cent.  It is very difficult to understand why 26 years later a very much increased price should be made compulsory in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Where agreements were reached the price was arranged. It might be between 20 and 30 per cent. or between 30 or 40 per cent. As regards Deputy Wolfe's statement in reference to vesting land without knowing the owner, I am very anxious for a further explanation of that statement.  What does Deputy Wolfe mean when he says that it is childish to advocate the vesting of land before the Land Commission knows the owner?  Let us assume that there is a difficulty about finding the owner.  Where does the Land Commission enter into it?  If there is a difficulty in discovering the owner, we are not in favour of the Land Commission being utilised for such a purpose.  We have no interest in searching the world over for an owner before the vesting of a holding. We are not satisfied that it is our business to follow him up.  I remember when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking on this matter some time ago, he said that there was great difficulty in some instances in locating the owner or a number of owners in any part of the world so as to get their signatures before the land could be vested.  I say that where difficulties are raised, because the owners are not available within a reasonable time in order to complete the transaction legally, the onus should be put on them, and they should be made amenable and bear the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Wolfe's speech was intended to be a reasonable argument or one that would bear reasonable investigation. We are not opposing the Bill, or any clause of the Bill, which has any useful purpose in it, but we are very slow to accept a Bill of this sort because of our experience of previous Bills.  If there is nothing more to be determined by legislation of this sort than to fix the price and to determine that the transfer of the land shall take place on a certain date, that the position of the landlord shall cease, and the position of tenant as owner shall begin, if we were merely to look at the matter in that light, it would be quite a reasonable thing to <Col N="483" /> proceed on these lines, but in dealing with this matter of land purchase there are many and varied aspects to be considered.  The main feature is not so much the completion of land purchase and the elimination of the landlord as purchasing the property at a fair price, so that the annuity placed on it will be something that the tenant can pay.  In addition to that, there is the very important work of improving those estates and providing them with the necessary conveniences as regards rights of way, bog accommodation and housing accommodation.  My experience in the West of Ireland is that the congests have been entirely neglected under all the Land Acts passed by the Dáil up to the present.</P>
    <P>While I see some good points in this Bill, I am disappointed with it in as much as no particular provision is made to deal with that particular class in the country which has been very much in the forefront of all the battles in which the land question was made a dominant issue. I suggest that the Government are seriously to blame because of the manner in which they are dealing with congests.  They are sufficiently long in office now, and people consider that some practical suggestion should come from them as to their policy on that very important phase of the land question.  In the congested areas we had a number of estates acquired under the 1923 Act. I say unhesitatingly that the services the tenants received on estates acquired under the 1923 Act have not been equal to those received on estates taken over under the earlier Acts of 1903 and 1909, particularly on the estates where the C.D. Board were the officiating department. I think that these estates taken over in the congested areas should not be acquired on the general standard of prices fixed for transferring estates in the whole of the Free State.  These are specific cases, and they require specific attention.  There is no use in assuming that a Bill passed here in this House setting up a standard price which was considered equitable for <Col N="484" /> the whole of the country, will meet the requirements of the situation in the congested areas.  In the past the British Government recognised that it was a special problem, and to deal with it they established a special department to take charge of the specific requirements in these areas. The only service the present Government rendered to these areas was to abolish that particular department. As a result, the congests have since been left without any attention whatever, and they are made to subject themselves to the general conditions of legislation which may be fairly applicable to the more well-to-do and better counties.  Heretofore, when an estate was taken over, the Congested Districts Board, if that Department dealt with the transfer of the estate, made provision to deal with the evicted tenants, to provide houses where houses were required, either dwelling or out-offices, and made provision for sufficient turbary with a right of way to the turbary.</P>

I suggest, if the Bill is to be made a workable Bill and put to the useful service of the community in general, it will have to be on a much wider basis and that the clause which would be essential would be that particular clause which will give special attention to the provision of those essentials as well as the fixing of prices.  I see no provision for bog roads and such things.  We have experience of previous Bills where provisions of this kind are provided.  No such provision is made and the farmers who hurriedly entered into transactions of this kind in the belief that good would follow, have been disappointed.</P>

      <P>There are clearly a good many matters to be considered if this Bill is to be made workable in a way to meet the full requirements of the community.  As it stands, it must be very short of all the requirements the farmers anticipated by way of what is due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to fishing rights, I would like to know if it is the intention of the Land Commission to apply for compulsory powers where they consider it necessary to apply for these rights, and in considering arrangements such as are proposed here, I think it would be advisable to extend it to include mineral rights.  We are very often in the anomalous position of the tenant having certain rights.  Where such a thing as a mine or a quarry exists on his land, he has certain rights known as surface rights.  When we have to deal with them we have to deal with a person who claims rights to minerals, and that is in many <Col N="486" /> cases the landlord.  I think where a transfer of estates is made the whole of these matters should be more carefully considered.  We should not be doing things piecemeal, but should examine all the things required for the final and full settlement of this whole land question. Merely introducing a Bill as it is here that deals with a little item here and there and leaves out a number of big questions that are involved is in no manner of means tackling the question in a real, national or beneficial manner.  I suggest that the Bill might, with advantage, be withdrawn for the present, and that a representative committee should be set up to deal with it on the lines I have endeavoured to give expression to.  It should be an attempt to deal with this whole question in an exhaustive way, and to embrace all the requirements that we consider should be embraced in a Bill that would make an honest attempt to settle, in a final way, the question of the ownership of land and the appurtenances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the criticism of this Bill is not seriously meant, because the criticism has been directed not so much against this Bill as against the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927.  Deputy Derrig has complained that the reduction of 35 per cent. provided for in Section 2 of this Bill is not adequate to meet the case of non-judicial tenants.  He went on to state that the estimate is based on a calculation representing only 5 per cent. of non-judicial cases.  There are 35,000 non-judicial cases.  We have already fixed standard purchase annuities in respect of 12,000. The figure of 35 per cent. was arrived at as a result of the experience we gained in fixing the standard annuities in respect of these 12,000 cases, or in approximately 40 per cent. of the non-judicial cases.  Many of the most difficult cases have been dealt with, cases undoubtedly in which numbers of tenants would be paying high rents.  I imagine that in the 24,000 cases that have still to be dealt with the average probably would be <Col N="487" /> something less than the average in respect of the 12,000 we have fixed. I am quite satisfied, as a result of that experience, that the figure 35 per cent. represents a reasonable reduction to these non-judicial tenants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig complained of the delay in vesting tenanted land, particularly under the Act of 1923.  I have explained over and over again that in considering the number of holdings vested under the Act of 1923 in the six years in which it has been in operation it must be remembered that vesting was held up from the very beginning because of the question of compounded arrears of rent.  It was not until the Land Commission got over this difficulty by a section in the Land Act of 1927 which enabled them to add compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money, that we were able to make any sort of substantial progress in the vesting of tenanted land under the Act of 1923.  Consequently Deputies should calculate the progress which has been made in the vesting of land under the Act of 1923 from the date on which the Land Act of 1927 came into operation, namely, about the 21st or 22nd of September, 1927.  During the years between the coming into operation of the Land Act of 1923 and the coming into operation of the Land Act of 1927 only 640 holdings were vested in tenants who came under the Land Act of 1923.  Since we have been able to add the compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money, in other words, a little over a year, the Land Commission have vested something like 8,000 holdings.  So that since the coming into operation of that section in the Land Act of 1927 very substantial progress has been made in the vesting of tenanted land. As I have explained, the rate of progress is being accelerated month by month.  We have not yet reached the maximum rate.  Probably we will not be able to reach the maximum rate of progress for some months to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on the subject of vesting, I will just give a few figures for the <Col N="488" /> purpose of showing how the number of holdings which have been vested up to the 31st March this year, under all the Land Acts since 1923.  Forty-five thousand holdings have been vested since the 31st March, 1923, by the Land Commission.  Of these, approximately 8,000 were holdings acquired under the Act of 1923.  The balance were holdings acquired under the Acts of 1909 and 1903.  If you compare that rate of progress with the rate of progress in the ten years prior to 1923, you will find that the rate has been very much greater since the Land Commission was transferred to the Free State Government than it was during the earlier period.</P>
    <P>I wish to say with regard to the vesting of land that every step has been taken to speed up the vesting of tenanted land.  The procedure has been simplified in many ways. Already, as we go on accumulating experience, the procedure is being still further simplified so that we may be able to vest land at a still faster rate.  That process is going on month by month, and this section in this new Bill of 1929 when it comes into operation, as I hope it will very shortly, will have the effect of speeding up particularly the vesting of non-judicial holdings very considerably.  It will, as I explained in my opening statement, have the effect of eliminating completely the inspection of these holdings and incidentally it will represent a saving of something like £120,000 to the State.  That, in itself, is a very substantial saving, quite apart from the fact that we will be enabled as a result of the operation of this section to deal with this particular class of holding much more rapidly than otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig, apparently, still hugs the illusion that it is possible to name an appointed day on which all holdings, either judicial or non-judicial, can be vested.  I would remind Deputy Derrig that as a result of the experience gained by the Northern Ireland Land Commission <Col N="489" /> under the operations of the Land Act of 1925, in which there was a general appointed day mentioned for the vesting of all tenanted land the Northern Land Commission introduced the amending Act of 1929 in which they have taken power to fix a separate appointed day for each estate.  In other words, they adopted the same procedure as was adopted in our Land Act of 1923 and which is being followed by the Land Commission here.  I think that the idea of a general appointed day is absolutely unworkable in practice.  I think after the discussion of that ill-fated Land Bill of the Deputies he is quite satisfied that it would be impossible to fix a general appointed day for the vesting of all judicial and non-judicial holdings.  There must be a separate day appointed for each estate because the conditions applying to each estate vary enormously.  There are very few difficulties in connection with some estates and, consequently, they can be vested much more rapidly than others.  In the case of other estates serious difficulties arise in connection with turbary, mountain grazing, drainage maintenance rates, and many other problems.  All these have to be dealt with by the Land Commission prior to the vesting of the estate.  A general appointed day is quite impossible in practice, and as I have reminded the Deputy, under the Land Act of 1925 in Northern Ireland a general appointed day was named and in practice it was found to be unworkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is a great deal of difficulty if you are going to have two appointed days.  It means that much more work must be done in connection with the investigation of certain particulars before the vesting date can be named.  It means, to a certain extent, duplication of work.  It was as a result of the experience we gained in the working of the 1923 Act that we took steps in Section 17 of the Land Act of 1927 to name one appointed day for the vesting simultaneously in the Land Commission and in the tenant.</P>
      <P>In connection with the fishing rights, this Bill does not propose to deal with fishing rights on any big scale.  It is merely intended to clarify the meaning of Section 45 of the Land Act of 1923, particularly in view of a recent judicial decision.  The first three clauses really explain the meaning of the word &ldquo;appurtenant.&rdquo;  In addition to that, the Land Commission take power to declare what rights vest in a tenant and what rights do not.  If he wants to dispose of his rights the tenant will know, when he is in possession of this declaration, what fishing rights exactly are actually vested in him and what are not.  We do not propose to do anything more than that in this Bill.  It does not contain anything revolutionary, and it does not deal with fishing rights under the Act of 1903.  The sections in this Bill merely deal with fishing rights on estates coming under the Act of 1923.  As I say, the object of these sections primarily is to explain and clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;appurtenant,&rdquo; as it is used in Section 45 of the Land Act, 1923, which explanation is necessary in view of a recent judicial decision.</P>

We are anxious to give the tenant the benefit <Col N="491" /> of two things&mdash;first of all, the benefit of the reduction in the amount he pays yearly, whether in rent or annuity, and, secondly, as from a certain date to make these payments go towards the redemption of the moneys that will be ultimately advanced for the purpose.</P>

One question which I want the Parliamentary Secretary to answer is why, if it is possible to fix in the way contemplated in Section 2, the standard purchase annuity at a certain amount, it is not possible also to arrange that the annuity should go towards the redemption of the advances made, and why is it not possible to deem the tenant, at a certain date, to have entered into a contract to purchase?  Is it not possible to do that?  Is it impossible for a draftsman to draw a clause which will make that possible?  If the Parliamentary Secretary can show us that that is not possible we will be satisfied, otherwise we will continue in the position in which we have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mountain grazing is held frequently by a number of people who have been grazing it in common.  It is difficult sometimes to define what particular portion one man is entitled to and what portion another man is entitled to.  Until you know what rights you are going to vest in a tenant, what turbary you are going to vest&mdash;particularly where the area of turbary is small and adjoining an estate&mdash;you must, before the vesting order is published, decide on what particular area of turbary you are going to vest in the tenant.  These are a few of the many difficulties which have to be disposed of.  You have to survey the estate and maps have to be prepared.  It is useless to say, as some Deputies said on the last Land Bill, that the fair-rent orders contain absolutely accurate particulars of the estate. As a matter of fact, the fair rent orders do not contain any particulars worth speaking of, or that are really of any value to us in dealing with an estate.  Fair rent orders merely contain the area, the rent, the valuation, etc.  They do not contain any maps, except in cases where the fair rents were fixed by the subcommission, <Col N="493" /> and they only represent a small percentage of the cases.  In the overwhelming majority of the cases a survey has to be made, maps prepared, and certain easements and rights and other matters appertaining to the property shown on the maps.  That is the first stage of the survey.  Then the provisional list has to be prepared, and time must be allowed for objection.  Incidentally I might mention that the period provided in the 1923 Act for this was two months.  That has now been reduced to one month to expedite the vesting of land.  Innumerable other difficulties of that kind arise. Then the owner has the right to object if he considers the particulars wrong, and the tenant has the right to object.  These are statutory rights, and until these difficulties and many others are disposed of it is quite impossible to vest the fee-simple in the tenant.  Deputies should also remember that the vesting order must be accurate in so far as we can make it accurate.  It is difficult to alter a vesting order after it is made.  It cannot be altered without the sanction of the Judicial Commissioner. You must get the parties to agree to any alteration, and that alteration must be subsequently ratified by the Judicial Commissioner.  If the vesting order is not accurate and if it is not a correct record of particulars of the estate or the holding vested in the tenant you are likely to give rise to a series of difficulties and to possible litigation, and you are likely to put the tenant to a great deal of expense subsequently.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to trespass again on the time of the House but I think this will be helpful. Deputies on both sides are anxious for a solution of this question. Everything that the Parliamentary Secretary has said appears to me to be quite pertinent to the final vesting.  We see the difficulty, and we acknowledge that there must be delay in the case of final vesting, but the Land Commission does not wait, for instance, to take money from the present occupier and to assume that he is the tenant, nor <Col N="494" /> does it take all that time before it hands the money over to the landlord to see that he is entitled to it. It seems to us that all these difficulties are pertinent certainly to the final vesting, but are not difficulties that are insuperable or that interfere with fixing the time from which the standard annuity has to be paid, with the possibility, I admit, of certain adjustments later; and the other, also subject to the possibility of adjustment&mdash;what I might call the sinking fund, to deal with the ultimate paying off of the sum advanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We note that one of the sub-heads for which money is asked under this Vote is the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland for a Grant in Aid.  I think before this sum is granted the House ought to take into consideration the recent history of that body and take particularly into consideration the attitude of that body and the strictures which were passed at its meetings upon the proposal which in the rightful exercise of its powers came before the Dáil and was accepted by it.  I refer to the proposal which was embodied in what was known as the Legal Practitioners Bill.  Under that Bill, which I am glad to see has now become an Act of the Oireachtas, in pursuance of the policy which not only the Opposition Party in the Dáil, but also the Government Party has espoused since the foundation of the Free State, the policy of making Irish again if not the only language, at least one of the languages in common use in this country, is recognised. With a view to making certain that those who desire to have recourse to the courts of the State and who desire to have their business there transacted in the national tongue, this Dáil ventured as a right to prescribe that all persons who enjoyed the privilege of practising before those courts, and that all persons acting in the capacity of solicitors and therefore acting as officers of these courts should be competent to transact the business which come before these tribunals in the national tongue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the action of the Dáil in this matter did not meet with the acceptance of this particular body. In that matter the Dáil represents the overwhelming mass of the people of this country.  But so bitterly antagonistic were those who controlled the policy of this particular association or society, an association or society which, I understand, does not embrace all the solicitors in this country, an association or society which only speaks for a portion of that profession and, possibly, not for the most influential portion of the profession at that, took upon itself to condemn and criticise, in terms which were not justified by the relations which existed between that <Col N="499" /> body and the Dáil and the people whom we represent, the action of the Dáil in prescribing certain educational requirements for those who desire to practice in the courts of this country.  We feel that, in view of that action, the time has come to make it clear that if this body exists at all, it can only exist by accepting whole-heartedly what is the common policy of the great mass of the people of this country.  It has been said that in making the Legal Practitioners Bill law we were not carrying out the wishes of the people of the country.  A number of members of this particular society ventured to express the opinion that the result of a certain election was due to the dissatisfaction which a certain body of political opinion felt with the action taken, not only by the Opposition Party in this House, but by the members of the Government Party in the House.  I say this, that if there is any doubt whatever in the minds of that association, or any association representing the professional classes, or any association representing other interests in this country as to what the real feelings of the people are in regard to the national language, I would suggest to them that whenever an opportunity offers again in the country of testing the feelings of the nation at an election, that they should put up an anti-Gaelic candidate and see if they will secure as many votes as will save the nomination fee in the most West British constituency in this country.</P>

      <P>I agree, but what I am saying arises from the fact that the members of this particular body ventured to say that the Teachtaí here representing the people of this country do not express the real wishes and feelings of the people of the country when they made the Legal Practitioners Bill the law of the Oireachtas.  Now, in view of the action of that body, we on this side of the House, at any rate, are not <Col N="500" /> going to allow this to pass without challenge.  We are not going to allow the grant of a sum of money to any association or society which takes up the attitude which the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland took upon this matter, and we intend to pursue that in regard to every other association.  If this House grants public money to any body or corporation of people in this country the grantees must accept whole-heartedly the position which is written in our Constitution that Irish is the national language of our people, and that they must co-operate to the very fullest extent not only of their will but of their capacity to make the Irish language again the national and generally spoken tongue of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the House to Sub-heads B and C.  Under Sub-head B the House is asked to vote a sum of £1,000 to the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. As a consequence of voting that money I understand we are allowed the concession of nominating one director on the Board of Directors of that theatre.  Although we have that concession I understand that there is no report received as to the working and the finances of the theatre.  The object of the theatre is to develop the talents of the people in regard to literature and drama, and it is intended for the encouragement of a special form of national drama.  It is mentioned on the Abbey Theatre programme that the object is to hold the mirror up to life.  No doubt the object for which the theatre was established is very desirable, but I ask Deputies can we afford to continue subsidising this theatre?  There are some people who think that the theatre could be made pay its way without this House being asked to vote any subsidy.  There are people who believe that if a larger hall were obtained in Dublin, in which to present the plays staged by the Abbey, the receipts would be augmented to a very great extent.  Anybody who has the experience of going to this theatre will tell you that it is practically <Col N="501" /> impossible to get into it unless you book your seats beforehand. I believe if a little more initiative were shown by the directors, and if it were possible for them to secure a larger hall in Dublin in which to present their programmes, that the theatre would pay its way and there would be no necessity for a subsidy from this House.  If we are asked to subsidise any concern surely the House should be given some information as to the finances of that concern?</P>
      <P>I notice in the Estimates that there is a footnote in connection with the grant and that footnote states that the expenses out of this grant-in-aid will not be accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, nor will any unexpended balance of the sums issued be surrendered by the payees at the close of the financial year.  The House should have some information as to the actual financial position of the Abbey Theatre.  Is the Minister able to give us any information in regard to the balance sheet, if such is issued by the theatre?  It is desirable to encourage the aims and objects of the theatre and it might be even desirable to encourage certain of the dramas which are staged there, but I put it to the House, can we afford to subsidise the theatre? Can the taxpayers in Kerry or Tirconaill afford to subsidise drama in Dublin in view of the poverty and unemployment that exist, and the emigration that takes place from those counties?  Can we afford it, more especially at a time when the Government are cutting down social services which, instead, should be improved?  I would like to make reference to Sub-head C.</P>

We should also be told if the directors have made any endeavour to secure any larger premises in Dublin.  If they did secure larger premises they might be able to pay their way, and that would relieve the House of the necessity to subsidise them.  I presume I will be permitted to refer to Sub-head C later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that this vote for the Incorporated Law Society appears every year.  I would like to point out that the grant-in-aid towards the expenses of the society is followed by a reference to an Act <Col N="503" /> of Parliament&mdash;61 and 62 Vict., Chap.  17&mdash;and that is the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898.  I have read through that Act and I cannot find in it any obligation on the Government to make this grant-in-aid.  I presume it is an ex gratia grant.  It is a grant that we are giving without any statutory obligation on our part. If that is the case, I think that a certain amount of courtesy towards the State is due from the society to which we make this ex gratia contribution. If, on the other hand, it is a statutory obligation on our part to pay, it will be a different matter. Perhaps the Minister has got some information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy MacEntee in his criticism of the Incorporated Law Society went out of his way to be nasty.  I would like to point out to him that surely we have not come to the position in which anybody, when the law is in process of making, should not be allowed to express his opinion.  If the Incorporated Law Society refused to recognise the law made here, or if it came into conflict with this House, there might be some justification for Deputy MacEntee's remarks, but I have not heard that the society has done so.  From my knowledge of the society, I would say that this grant-in-aid for the functions it performs is quite justified.  Surely it is unfair that Deputy MacEntee, through lack of courtesy, should utilise this opportunity to fire against a society which has in the past always submitted to the law which it helps to administer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Sub-head B, I desire to say that on the ground of apparent economy it would be a terrible thing to cut off the subsidy of £1,000.  I am not talking of the Abbey Theatre itself, but of the activities generally.  Valuable work is being done in other countries through subsidised theatres.  England is, I think, the only country in Europe which has not a subsidised <Col N="504" /> theatre, and I do not think that we should follow its particular habit of mind.  We are badly supplied with theatres which could give us classical plays, be they Irish or international. We have theatres which give the worst type of commercialised productions. I do not want to give my own views of productions which are often given in the Abbey, as I do not desire to say things which might injure the theatre, things which are largely my own individual opinion. I think that the Minister might exercise a certain influence in getting plays acted in the Abbey which are closer to real Irish culture.  The most valuable work is done by Comhair Dramuiocht, but that is purely in Irish.  It is possible to give expression to Irish tradition and culture where English is spoken.  I suggest to the Minister that he should use his influence, without interfering with the freedom of the theatre, which is, of course, essential, to try and balance up against certain types of realist drama which, I think, require a good deal of dilution. They do not at all times represent what is best from the traditional and educational point of view in Irish culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the grant of £1,000 to the Zoological Society I desire to say that no doubt from an educational point of view they are doing good work.  The Zoological Gardens are, of course, entertaining for visitors to Dublin, but while it may be desirable to keep animals and birds there, the Dáil ought to consider whether we can afford to give this subsidy every year.  Before Christmas last year I remember the President, in regard to demands for more money to relieve unemployment, saying that any money given in that direction should be on the condition that we must get one pound of value for every one pound of expenditure.  I would ask the House whether we are getting pound for pound under this grant.</P>

      <P>As I say, it may be desirable to keep the animals in the <Col N="505" /> Zoo and feed them, but I suggest to the House and to Deputy Byrne that if this money were spent in feeding poor people in Dublin, in Deputy Byrne's constituency and other parts of the country, it would be much better spent.  I think the Deputies should consider that aspect of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of amalgamating in one Vote the various grants which are voted for the development of culture and art.  We have under this sub-head grants for the Hibernian Academy, the Royal Irish Academy, and the Academy of Music.  In Vote 49, Science and Art, we have grants for the National Museum, the National Library, the School of Art, and so on.  In my view it is desirable that all these should be amalgamated in one Vote. There is a certain amount of overlapping so far as the cultural requirements of the State are concerned. When we had an Irish Republic in 1921 there was a Minister for Fine Arts.  Of course he had not control of these institutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the points put to the House by Deputy MacEntee I agree that the action of the Incorporated Law Society in connection with the Legal Practitioners Bill was not only absurd, but utterly unjustified and gave grounds for people being annoyed <Col N="506" /> with the Society.  Nevertheless, this sum is paid for a service, for a public duty, which was transferred to the Society in 1898.  Up to that time the roll of solicitors and the disciplinary duties connected therewith had been in the custody of the Registrar of the Chancery Division of the High Court.  It was then transferred to the Incorporated Law Society, which is a voluntary body, and an arrangement was made at that time that a proportion of about two-thirds of the cost of carrying out their disciplinary duties should be given to the Society as their disciplinary functions are not only in the interests of the members of the profession but also in the interests of members of the public. I do not think that because we dislike the action or attitude of the Society in other directions we should proceed to cut off the assistance given to them for carrying out duties imposed on them by statute, and, of course, with reference to the Legal Practitioners Bill it has, as the Deputy said, become law.  I am satisfied that the society, once that Bill became law, will carry it out.  If they try to evade it or refuse to carry it out I would take stringent steps against them, but not along the lines suggested.  I would go further than cut off the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Deputy Cassidy's point about the Abbey Theatre, the position, as I explained on other occasions, was that for a long period of years the Abbey Theatre continued to lose money.  Over a period of twenty years there was, I think, a loss that ran to something like £600 a year.  There were one or two years in which it made a profit. Some years there was a small loss and in others a substantial loss. Since this subsidy has been given the theatre every year has made a profit. If it continues for a period of years to make a profit then, though I would not like to strike the subsidy out of the Vote, there might be grounds for not making the payment. So far the theatre has not been able to accumulate any funds that would carry it over even one bad season.  Therefore, I think the <Col N="507" /> subsidy should be paid.  I am satisfied that good value is got for this money.  I believe that the educational value, not merely directly arising from the work of the theatre but from the stimulus given by the existence of the theatre, is considerable. If you look at it merely from the point of view of tourist traffic it is an asset, as strangers, especially Americans, are deeply interested in the work of the theatre.  This grant is probably as effective as any equivalent sum spent on tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Little's remarks about the type of plays produced, I may say that my own feeling is that the Government cannot very well interfere.  I do not know what arrangements are made in countries where subsidised theatres are definitely State theatres, but I believe that, in some cases at any rate, the principle is to appoint some sort of director and to give him practically a free hand as long as he is there.  I do not think that it is desirable that any pressure should be brought to bear on the theatre. Experience shows that there are fashions in plays.  Some author, for instance, writes a play which is very successful and which interests, not merely audiences, but other writers, and so we have a run of that particular sort of play.  Some people may dislike it.  It probably has its disadvantages, and the result is that audiences begin to get tired of that type of play, and then another type is produced which may be better or worse.  I do not doubt that the particular type of play produced in the Abbey Theatre lately will go out of fashion in due course, and that plays of another type will take its place. As regards the work done by Comhair Dramuiocht, while I could find fault with it, I do not want to over-praise it.  That work is, of course, more important from many points of view, but I do not say that more assistance should be given, because there are difficulties at present in that direction, and I do not think that more money could at this stage be usefully expended.  In <Col N="508" /> regard to the Zoological Gardens, I think that they are really an educational institution and that good value is given.  If we take Deputy Cassidy's point of view we might not, perhaps, abolish our public parks, but we would probably abolish the flower-beds and other things on which money is spent, and spend it instead on the very utilitarian way in which Deputy Cassidy wants it spent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about amalgamating these services.  The position is that in regard to the money voted under these sub-heads the Government has no direct responsibility for the expenditure of the grants.  In the case, for instance, of the National Library and the National Gallery, the money is expended by the Government, but in the other cases which come under this Vote, though the Government give grants, they have nothing to say to their expenditure. As to the point raised by Deputy de Valera in regard to research grants to students, I should say that these grants are generally given on the recommendation of university professors, and are generally given in connection with chemistry and physics.  Last year I think that Deputy O'Kelly asked me for some particulars.  The following are the names of the students who are in receipt of such grants:</P>
      <P>Vincent C. Barry, University College, Dublin&mdash;Preparation of derivatives of benzodifurfuran.</P>
      <P>Timothy V. Creedon, University College, Cork&mdash;Chemistry.</P>
      <P>Eithne McGuinness, University College, Galway&mdash;The Constitution of Algin.</P>
      <P>Declan T. MacSweeney, University College, Dublin&mdash;Chemistry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Thomas E. Nevin, University College, Dublin&mdash;Diffusion of Iona.</P>
    <P>Frederick Thomas Riley, Trinity College, Dublin&mdash;Physical chemistry: (a) Negative Catalysis, (b) Vapour pressures.</P>
    <P>George E. W. Sexton, University College, Dublin&mdash;Condensation of arisaldehyde (and other aromatic aldehydes) with methyleithil hetone (Thyaldali).</P>
    <P>Sylvia Wigoder, Trinity College, Dublin&mdash;Effect of X-rays on cells.</P>
    <P>The grants are given generally for a year or two years.  As a rule they run for the period of the academic year beginning on the 1st October. At present there are four students in receipt of grants of £100, one in receipt of £65, one of £60, one of £35, and one of £25.  The actual recommendation for a grant comes from the Minister for Education acting on the advice of university authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state whether these students remain in the country afterwards and whether the country derives any benefit from these grants.  My experience is that the majority of students who get exhibitions and scholarships generally leave the country, and though the taxpayer pays for their education he seldom gets the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>You cannot guarantee that they will remain in the country.  What Deputy White says happens to a considerable extent; but, on the other hand, some may stay and do a great deal of good for the country.  I do not accept the view that we are not to have research work and that we are not to have people specially trained in this direction simply because some of them, or even for the present, most of them may go.</P>

      <P>Last year when this Estimate was being discussed I mentioned that there were rumours abroad that large quantities of material belonging to the Ordnance Survey Department had been sent away.  The Minister said that there was no foundation for them and that the thing was investigated by a Committee.  I looked for the report of that Committee and found an Interim Report.  There was a promise of a further report.  I inquired at the Library but there was no trace of it.  In the meantime, the official who reported this at the time&mdash;he was at one time in the National Army&mdash;a Mr. MacNamara, at present in an engineering works in India, wrote to me.  I have his letter.  He gave what to me seems to be good evidence that a great quantity of valuable material was taken away. He said that forty men were employed daily packing up and dispatching printing plates, maps, manuscripts, etc., etc., to England. Further down, he refers to a Committee of Inquiry which was set up. Some gentleman named Close was asked several questions at this Inquiry and he handed in a return of the time occupied by the men packing this material.  Secondly, he was asked if he could prove that what they packed was sent away.  He said &ldquo;I handed in a certified extract from the contractor's ledgers.  One hundred and eight tons during January, February and March, 1922. Asked could I prove what the cases contained I handed in a copy of the ship's manifest (one of the most legal documents in business), showing copper printing plates, zinc plates, etc.  I was to be recalled by the Committee.  What a hope; I never saw them again.&rdquo;  A gentleman called Mr. O'Connor was called upon to investigate, take stock and report on the state of the trigonometrical or defence documents.  I think that is one of the items which this Committee <Col N="512" /> did not report on but promised to report on.  That is my recollection of what I have seen in this report; they were to report on this.  Mr. MacNamara says that no man living knew how to do the job better.  His report showed that 4½ tons of books and 500 diagrams were missing.  This was the report which Mr. Blythe said in the Dáil was not worth printing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another thing that was brought in by the Minister.  I did not raise it when I was dealing with the way in which discrimination was shown against the civilian employees. The people who were mostly favoured were those who were persona grata with the British Government, members of the British reserve still for all we know.  The Minister said that he was satisfied that certain leaflets were printed by these civilian employees to cause trouble.  These were leaflets dealing with the election for the Seanad. This man MacNamara was brought up over this matter.  &ldquo;Now, to get rid of me,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;every dirty device was thought of.  Hickie's bills were printed, and not long afterwards Mr. O'Neill and another detective came to arrest me for having had Ordnance Survey type brought out to me in the city and the bills printed down town.  I did not want to go to prison, so I pointed out to Mr. O'Neill that granted I could get the type out how did I get that large quantity of paper, seeing, as I pointed out, that the paper used was special survey paper used for the printing of small scale maps.  Mr. O'Neill satisfied himself by a visit to the Stationery Office that the paper was what I said it was.  All this was done after a sub-committee of inquiry, consisting of the Commissioner of Valuation and a Mr. Cregg had spent two days at the Survey Office investigating as to the printing of these bills.  After their inquiry I was called up to the Valuation Office and told by Mr. Carbury (Commissioner) that the bills were not printed at the Survey Office at all. Two days afterwards Mr. O'Neill turned up to arrest me.  In a very short time after this I was summarily <Col N="513" /> dismissed from the Civil Service with entire loss of pension and gratuity, no cause for my dismissal being stated.&rdquo;  This man had something like 25 years' service.  The people who are in charge of that particular office, I said on the last occasion, are people in whom the British military authorities have full confidence, and the Minister sidetracked that the last time.  He simply brought in a thing I had not mentioned.  I would like him now to answer the quotation I have read from the letter of this man, who is now in India on survey work.  That policy has been pursued right down the ranks.  There was another case of a very small man.  He was a sapper.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise, on the motion for the adjournment this evening, the matter arising out of Question No. 1 on the Order Paper.  The question was as follows&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" />&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of persons in South Sligo who have received refunds of their subscriptions to the Dáil Loan (Internal), 1919-20; the number of claims remaining to be dealt with, and if he will state when Savings Certificates will be issued to the remaining subscribers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his reply, stated: &ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question asked by him on the 17th April last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply given by the Minister on the 17th April was that the form in which the records of the Department are kept is such that the preparation of the information asked for in the Deputy's question would entail an amount of labour on the part of the staff concerned, which would not, in his opinion, be justified, and, further, that applications which have not yet been disposed of will be dealt with as expeditiously as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not consider the reply given by the Minister regarding this important matter, which affects thousands of subscribers, as either complete or satisfactory.  I do not consider it complete, because he has refused to give information as to the number of persons, if any, who have received a refund of their subscriptions, and the number of claims remaining to be dealt with; I do not regard his answer as satisfactory because he has failed to indicate any definite date when Savings Certificates will be issued to the remaining subscribers.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister does not maintain that the records in his Department are kept in such loose fashion that he is unable, at any time, to state the number of subscribers from a particular area who have received refunds of their subscriptions.  There is no reason, at least, why this information should not be given.  It could scarcely entail so much additional labour on the staff concerned as not to be justified.  Perhaps it may be more correct to state that his refusal to give this information arises from the fact that so far no <Col N="515" /> subscriber in South Sligo has received a refund, or because the number of those who have received repayment is so very small that the Minister is ashamed to give it.  At any rate, we can only conclude, in the absence of more definite information, that such is the case, and that the Minister, for good reasons of his own, does not wish this House to know the ridiculously small number of persons in this area who have received a refund of their subscriptions.</P>
    <P>It is now nine years since this Loan was raised.  It is almost five years since the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, which gave the Minister power to issue Savings Certificates to subscribers, became law.  Ample time, it must be admitted, has been given to the Minister to deal with all the outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister, speaking in this House on the 22nd June last year (page 1303 of Official Report), stated: &ldquo;I am confident that by the end of the present financial year repayment will have been authorised in all cases in which particulars of the subscriptions are recorded in my Department, and applications have been made for repayment; and also in cases in which, though the particulars were not recorded, satisfactory evidence in support of the claim has been submitted to the Department of Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, in the particular area to which my Question refers over £3,700 was subscribed towards the Dáil Loan.  From every parish authenticated lists of subscribers have been furnished to the Department. Individual applications have also been made by almost every subscriber, and these individual applications have in most cases been vouched for by the collectors in writing.  During the last two years I forwarded to the Department several lists of subscribers from various parishes all over the former Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo.  These lists in every case have been fully vouched for by the collectors, <Col N="516" /> and evidence is also in the possession of the Minister to prove that the amounts stated in these lists were handed to the Hibernian Bank in Ballymote for transmission to the then Minister for Finance.  In addition to the lists supplied to the Department, I also handed in hundreds of individual applications from the subscribers, and in almost every case these applications had been certified as correct by one or more collectors.</P>
    <P>All the lists and applications to which I have referred are now more than one year in possession of the Minister, and some of them almost two years.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was so confident in June of last year that all applications, where satisfactory evidence in support of the claims was available, would be dealt with before the end of the financial year, why is he to-day not in a position to state the amounts refunded in South Sligo to date, and when the remaining applications will be dealt with?  Does he consider it fair that those who so very generously subscribed to the Dáil Loan during 1919 and 1920 should be left for nine years without repayment? Others who fought on the side of the British during that period have long since been compensated at the expense of the Irish tax-payer. Why treat those who came forward with their money to assist in the struggle against the British in such a shabby way?  Why not fix a definite date on which all subscribers, who have submitted satisfactory evidence in support of their claims, will be paid?</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain no person in South Sligo has received a refund so far.  The Government is treating these people in a shameless manner. Certainly more consideration should be expected from a native Government. Surely sufficient time has elapsed to enable the Government to discharge their liabilities towards those who subscribed to this loan.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister, when he comes to reply, the number, if any, who have received a refund of their subscriptions in <Col N="517" /> South Sligo and by what date he expects to be in a position to authorise refunds in the remaining cases. There is just one other matter arising out of this question on which I would like to get information from the Minister.  The Dáil Loan closed on the 17th July, 1920.  After that date, certain sums, which had been collected in South Sligo, were handed to the Hibernian Bank in Ballymote by different collectors for transmission to the Department of Finance.  These sums had been collected before the date on which the Dáil Loan closed, but, for some reason, the collectors were unable to lodge these sums until months after that date.  In some cases, the money was not lodged until over a year after the date on which the Dáil Loan was closed.  The total sum, according to my information, that was lodged in the Hibernian Bank after the 17th July, 1920, was £731.  This money came from various parishes throughout South Sligo.  I should like to know what is the position regarding this money?  Did it reach the Department and, if so. will the Minister see that people who subscribed before the date on which the loan was closed, but in whose cases delay occurred in forwarding the money to the Department, will receive payment in the same way as those whose money was received before the 17th July, 1920?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about the matters to which the Deputy last referred.  He should have given me some notice of them. With reference to the position in South Sligo generally, there were very few names furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance or, if they were furnished, they were lost. I think they were not furnished. Therefore, the original register contained practically no names from South Sligo.  That, necessarily, resulted in delay.  In any areas where the original register was fairly complete, I think very little remains to be paid except in cases where applications from the individuals have not been forthcoming.  Another difficulty in connection with areas where <Col N="518" /> we had no register of names was that until a month or so ago claims were still coming in.  It was almost impossible to do anything in those areas where there were no names on the register until we had stopped the influx of claims.  It was dangerous to admit claims in an area where they equalled, or where they were even less than, the amount in hands, because of the possibility of other claims coming in equally well vouched, which would exceed the amount in hand.  In areas where we had no names on the register and where we had claims in excess of the amount in hand, we were faced with the difficulty of deciding between them.  That is the difficulty which we are now attempting to solve, and we hope that, within a very short time, we shall be able to devise a method of deciding which of the claims which are equally well vouched are to receive repayment in respect of areas where the claims are in excess of the amount in hand. Now, that no fresh applications are being received, where the claims are equal to or less than the amount in hand and are reasonably well vouched, we hope to get on pretty fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In South Sligo no payments have actually been made yet.  Certain payments will be made shortly. There has been, for reasons that the Deputy is aware of, a great deal of furnishing of evidence recently.  The Deputy has been active, and the new Deputy for the constituency has been active, and all sorts of evidence has been flowing in.  South Sligo is not alone as an area for which practically no records were available.  There are certain other areas in the same position, and in those areas people, through no fault of their own, have had to suffer delays, while in other areas payments were made.  I cannot undertake to go into the case of South Sligo specially.  All these cases are now in hands, and I believe that under the new conditions we will be able to dispose of them all very much more rapidly than in the past.  I should say that, certainly within the present financial year, we will be <Col N="519" /> able to reach a point where very few cases will remain to be disposed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now every prospect of being able to get on with the work much more rapidly, the main factor being as I have stated, that in an area where the claims equal the amount available there is no danger now of fresh applications coming in.  In cases where the claims exceed the amount, we know exactly whom we have to deal with, and some process of eliminating those who seem to be the weakest can be carried through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a great deal of complaint from all parts of the country&mdash;I have heard complaints myself&mdash;at the delay?  The people who are entitled to get the money cannot understand why the Minister will not make provision so that, this year at all events, these claims will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy-five per cent. of the loan has been repaid.  The exact figure may be a few pounds under or over that.  There remains 25 per cent.  to be repaid.  That covers a number of very difficult cases in some extremely difficult areas.  Of that 25 per cent., portion would be moderately easy to deal with.  I do not know when we will deal with the last of the cases.  I am afraid that, no matter what method of dealing with the matter we adopt, there will be some cases that will be almost insoluble.  With reference to delay, it is often difficult to explain delay to an individual. I had a case brought to my notice recently in going through the country where the delay was due to the claimant's own carelessness. He made several applications, and actually had a receipt. With that receipt in his hand, he made a mistake in the particulars furnished.  He was informed that his <Col N="520" /> application was not correct.  My Department could not understand how he could give those particulars if he had a receipt.  We did not, for reasons of prudence, point out to him what the mistake he was making was.  He continued to make the application, and he continued making the mistake.  He was extremely indignant about the delay, which was entirely his own fault.  Owing to the fact that we have in large numbers of areas more people applying than there is money for, the Department do not, if claimants make mistakes, correct the applications. We cannot say: &ldquo;We have received your application, but you should state you live in such a place, or your name is not James Joseph, but John.&rdquo;  We cannot correct applications, because we might be helping somebody who was not really entitled&mdash;who was brother or relative of the person entitled, or a person of the same name&mdash;to make an application. I do not see how we can get over that.  Some of the delays have been caused by carelessness of that sort.  There is also a very common form of delay where, in perfectly good faith, people apply for more money than they actually subscribed. A lot of cases have come to my notice in which I could not believe that the people were wilfully applying for more than they subscribed. In the course of time they probably began to think that they had given more than they really had. All these difficulties cause delays, and I see no way of getting over them.  While in areas like South Sligo very little has been paid, in other areas, where the records happened to be good and facilities were available for the Department, practically all the money has been paid.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that he has already been furnished with a certified return by the manager of the Hibernian Bank in Ballymote, who also furnished me with a copy of the return.  That return was sent to the Minister almost a year ago.  A number of people whose money was handed in to this particular bank after the loan had closed are very uneasy as to whether or not they will receive a refund of their subscriptions. I should like if the Minister would look into the matter and get his staff to deal specially with this area.  There is a sum of £731 involved. It relates to 12 different parishes, according to my information. I should like if the Minister would give me an assurance that he would look into this matter.</P>

      <P>The question will all depend on whether or not that money was received.  If the money was received it will be repaid on the same evidence as the other moneys. If it was not received the presumption is it was used for other purposes. I am sure the Deputy is aware that people did not really regard this money as a loan at all. <Col N="522" /> They regarded it as a subscription, and they were quite willing to have it put into the Self-determination Fund, or some other fund.  There have been cases where money was collected for the loan, and the permission of the subscribers was sought to devote it to some other fund.  In some cases permission was not sought.</P>

      <P>Can I take it that when the money was collected from the subscribers before the Dáil Loan closed, and handed in afterwards by the collectors to the bank and later transferred to the Department of Finance that the money will be refunded to the subscribers even though it reached the Department after the loan had closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point is: was it accepted as loan money?  If it went to the Dáil Department of Finance, I presume it was accepted as loan money.  If it were, it would be refunded.  It would not, I think, have been accepted by the Department of Finance except as loan money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put the question is because I have heard&mdash;I do not know whether the reports are well founded&mdash;that some of this money which was handed in to the bank, for transmission to the Department of Finance, was later drawn from that bank by one or more individuals and used in one case for private purposes and in another case for purposes alleged to be in connection with the Army.  I do not know whether these statements are correct or not but I am giving the Minister the information.  That is one of the reasons I should like to have this matter specially investigated. As I stated, there is a sum of over £700 involved.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until Friday at 10.30 a.m.</P>
