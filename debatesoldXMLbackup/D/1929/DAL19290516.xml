      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that notice has been given to the workers employed in the Great Southern Railway workshops, notifying them of changes in the rates of pay, to come into effect on the 27th May, 1929, and that as a consequence considerable unrest prevails, and whether he proposes to take any steps to bring about a meeting of the Company and the representatives of the Trade Unions with a view to preventing the risk of a dispute.</P>

      <P>I would refer to the answer to a question by Deputy Ua Dubhghaill on the same subject given on the 1st May, 1929. Since that date I received from the Irish Railway Shops Joint Committee a request that a joint conference should be arranged with the railway company.  I accordingly communicated with the company, which informs me that it has assured the representatives of the trade unions of its willingness to meet them.  I would suggest, therefore, that the trade unions should communicate with the company and arrange a meeting.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when we were discussing this matter, Deputy Ruttledge was referring to the necessity for bringing the game laws here into consonance with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  One of the worst features of this Bill is that there is no effort to view the question of game preservation, as Deputy O'Reilly has suggested, in a national manner, or approach it from the point of view of the production and replenishing of the game in the country.  On the other hand, it does not seem to be in line with legislation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister told us in his opening statement that the value of the game in this country was extremely great, and he quoted the example of Scotland. Scotland is on an entirely different plane, and when we are discussing this question, we have to bear in mind the entirely different circumstances of the Saorstát as compared with Scotland.  There you have large landed proprietors who devoted generations to the cultivation and preservation of game.  Here you have a peasant proprietorship, and you have not the land question properly settled.  I submit that if you want to proceed on the lines of teaching the farmers to appreciate the value of game and the virtues of citizenship and of restraint in this matter, it would be much better to take the representatives of the farmers into consultation, and as has been suggested by Deputy Shaw, to have made some effort to get in touch with the County Committees of Agriculture or other representative bodies that could speak for the farmers, put the whole question before <Col N="2092" /> them, and ask them to give their views either to the Ministry or to a Commission that, in my opinion, could have been usefully called into being for that purpose.  When you had got the farmers interested in the matter you could then make certain proposals to them.</P>
      <P>This Bill bears all the defects of a measure recommended and sponsored by the Minister on the direction or instruction of a certain number of people, who undoubtedly are interested in game preservation.  It is very valuable to have unselfish people of that class, but, as the Minister himself says, the farmers, the owners of the sporting rights, are the people who, in the long run, will have to undertake the brunt of this work.  They are the people, he says, who will have to take the responsibility of ultimately preserving the game.  Now, this measure comes along with a series of new prohibitions when the House has clearly expressed the desire, in the case of the Forestry Bill for example, that this question should be tackled in another manner.  Certainly, the Minister ought to do the things which have been asked, that is, give a definite inducement to the farmers for the destruction of vermin, and reduce the £2 licence to 10/-.  That is a matter that has been discussed in the House frequently and a matter that will come up.  So long as you put on a very high licence on the one hand, and on the other hand give the farmer no inducement to destroy vermin do you think that any number of prohibitions or any legislation that can possibly be devised will attain this purpose as well as securing the co-operation of the owners themselves would do.  I submit, therefore, the Minister has not met the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking up this matter and I found that in Great Britain a good many years ago an important committee recommended that the occupiers of the land should have the full rights of destroying ground game.  If the Minister cannot give the occupiers that right he ought not simply to pass legislation prohibiting them from doing so.  He ought <Col N="2093" /> to say that this is a temporary measure which he proposes to pass but which he realises is defective and that at a later stage of this Bill he proposes to make it more acceptable to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of holding up and searching people.  I think that is capable of creating a great deal of dissatisfaction.  It is not sufficient, and it seems to me only a quibble.  It is not really providing a solution to give the Superintendent of the Civic Guard, or other persons nominated by the Minister, the right to hold up and search people and to seek entrance to certain places.  I think the Minister in reply to Deputy Kent said that it was not suggested that people should have the right to trespass against the owner's wish. If that is so, I do not know what the meaning of the particular section is. It seems to me there is a clear right there for any person whom the Minister sees fit to appoint as representative to invade any premises or property and to search any person for game.  I think that that is not the best way of dealing with the question. It would be much better to bring those people who are charged with destroying game, and who apparently are in the mind of Deputies, in a nebulous way, although not referring to them directly&mdash;it would be much better, since whole communities at present are practically living on the killing of rabbits, to bring them into the open to see what their case is rather than drive them underground.  I submit, in the long run, it is like Prohibition in the United States.  If the people want to do these things, if they want to go out and shoot at night and so on, they are going to do it in spite of prohibition.  The best way is to get co-operation of the different classes represented in this matter and then produce a proper national measure and put the whole game question on a sound footing, and if necessary make the country, as Deputy Anthony suggested, a bird sanctuary for a certain period of time.</P>

      <P>Some faults are alleged against this Bill.  There is no fault in the Bill from my point of view or from any sensible man's point of view in so far as it is a measure for preserving game.  But the great fault in the Bill, and in fact the damning fault, is the fact that the Bill in itself is no good for preserving game when you have no game to preserve.  Side by side with this Bill, or even before this Bill was introduced, a scheme should have been worked out whereby the whole question should have been built up from top to bottom on a solid foundation. You have to get after the propagation of game in the year or two that this Bill excludes shooting. You must also get&mdash;and this is essential, from my point of view, if you are to have the Bill a success&mdash; you must get in the first instance the co-operation of the occupiers of the soil in a whole-hearted manner, and to do that you must get the owners of the game and instil into their minds the idea that the game is there to be paid for the same as the chickens in their yards.  There may be some conflict of opinion upon that.  In some of the Land Acts the game has been given over to the tenants, but in the majority of the Acts, and especially in the 1903 and the 1909 Acts, on the majority of estates the game rights are still retained by the landlord, if there are any game rights there and ever exercised.  While those rights are there they are a stumbling-block to preservation, and game cannot be made a great national asset here until those obstacles are removed and you set the foundations right.  I have no hesitation in saying that the game possibilities in this State are worth annually as much as the whole <Col N="2095" /> land annuities put together.  When the Minister mentioned here the last day a figure of £2,000,000 and something odd&mdash;I do not remember the exact figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what game he had in mind.  I do not think that we can contemplate deer forests in Ireland, but we certainly could contemplate with certainty and success valuable grouse shoots.  We have a good deal of mountain and certainly bog, where as good a class of heather is produced as in the mountains; as good if not better for the propogation of grouse.  I would like to know if it included, in addition to deer shooting and grouse shooting, ordinary shooting on the arable land of Scotland, because here you have a country very similar to the south of Scotland in many respects. You could have here, with the co-operation of the occupiers of the lands, a system where you could give the occupiers the ownership, where at least the price of the game when killed would be given to him, if not a little more.  In that way the game of this country could be raised in the only way it can be raised as a real national asset.  It may be said that the tenure of game rights in England and in Scotland is different from here.  It is.  In England and in Scotland most of the game preserves are held by landlords in game areas in the country, while here most of them are in the possession of tenants, and if they have not game rights now, by their opposition at least they could exercise an influence to prevent game being developed here as a national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take France or Belgium, where you have a thickly-populated country. I have not been there, but I know from soldiers who have been there during the war that the whole country was thickly populated with partridge, some pheasants, and hares, and a different class of partridge from the English or the Irish partridge.  This Bill is no use unless you have a well thought-out scheme <Col N="2096" /> running side by side with it.  You may require legislation, but certainly you will have to perfect a proper scheme embracing the Ministry of Agriculture.  I see no reason why the Land Commission should not come in, because they will have a lot to do with game rights, and also the Ministry of Justice.  But a scheme, if it is to be of any use, will have to come, I think, from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly referred to this Bill.  Reading his speech I thought it was an attack upon the Bill.  He gave one the impression that he was rather against it, especially when he said that when the game season was opened and game came on the market the prices of beef went down, and that on account of that the Irish farmer should not be enthusiastic about it.  I hope I did not misunderstand him, but I think that is not a point of view that could be justified at all.  Even though the price of beef went down, and even though the demand would be slightly less, there is no reason why game should not be raised in this country and the price of beef not be reduced on account of it.  Deputy Derrig says that the present licence should be reduced from £2 to 10/-.  What is the object of that?  Everyone knows that the 10/- licence running alongside the £2 licence is the great cause of the destruction of game.  Men went out with the 10/- licence.  They began on the 1st September and ended on the last day of the season. They shot the seven days of the week. It was impossible to prevent them shooting game.  They were shooting it all the time.  That was in the early days, and when the occupiers of land saw people coming on the land and shooting game every farmer and farmer's son started the same thing, with the result that we have no game at all to-day.  I know men who have been continually shooting for 15 or 20 years, and they have not seen a partridge during that time.  Partridge are extinct because they have been shot down, and also for other causes. You had the hostility of the occupiers of the soil, and until you enlist their full co-operation you will never <Col N="2097" /> have a successful Bill.  What they have been able to do in France and in Belgium I think we can do here. You might do it on the mountains and in the bogs, but when you come down to the arable land and the small holdings you will have to work on the continental system.  I do not know what has enlisted the sympathy and co-operation of the Belgian and French farmer, but at any rate they got them.  The game is here, and what they were able to do we should be able to do.</P>
    <P>You must get the good will and the co-operation of the occupier of the soil, and you must build up from that.  The ordinary holding is too small for a special preserve.  You get them into groups of two or three townlands.  You must begin there and the only Department that can do it is the Department of Agriculture. You may need an instructor. A scheme can easily be adopted.  Men who know all about this matter can sit down and work out a scheme.  I admit there are considerable difficulties in the way.  I know them.  There is no difficulty I have come up against in my consideration of the matter that cannot be got over.  It is a question of detail, of what price or compensation the owner of the soil should get for game.  It is no use going into it now.  With regard to the broad principle, I think that it is perfectly sound.  You must get the co-operation of the farmer for two reasons. First of all, he is the owner of the soil, and therefore he has the only right to anything that is raised on it. I may be taken as being prejudiced, but, I think, considering all the equities, that no one should have a right to the game except the occupier of the land, the man who feeds them. That is one reason, but there is another, and that is that he holds the key to the whole situation, to success or the failure.  No amount of preservation of stock on the land will prevent him from killing that stock and making all your efforts null and void if he is hostile.  He must be taken into consideration apart altogether from the equities.  This Bill, as I <Col N="2098" /> say, as far as it goes, is a good Bill. It may need some slight improvements, but if we aim at making game a national asset it falls very short.  A big broad scheme must go side by side with it to get the full effect.  It will be useless without it. It aims at giving protection, but it gives no protection at all from vermin; it gives no protection from birds of prey and other animals that prey on game; it gives no protection from the hawk, the weasel, the stoat, the owl, or from magpies or scald crows.</P>
    <P>I have heard an outcry against interfering with nature and that we ought to have a sanctuary for birds for two or three years in this country. I am prepared to have a sanctuary for the useful birds that are in the country, but I would make war on the others.  I am not prepared to make the country a sanctuary for them even if I offend the old maids of both sexes in this country. I have heard a whole lot about upsetting the balance of nature. Anything we do is wrong.  It would be just as sensible to ask why make war on microbes?  Why make war on bacteria?  They, too, are preserving the balance of nature.  The same thing can be said about the shark and the crocodile.  They are preserving the balance of nature.  This question of preserving the balance of nature can be taken too far.  It can be brought even to the point of the ridiculous.  If man is going to live and multiply in this country these obnoxious animals that are preying on the food of man must go.  Either they have to go or man has, and I think I am right in being on the side of the human being.  I hope the suggestion that the Department of Agriculture should take the initiative in this matter will not be lost sight of. There is no other body, to my mind, more fitted or capable to do it.  I think it falls to no other body in the same way as it falls to the Department of Agriculture, because it is a branch of agriculture.  It can be treated in the same way as our fowl, our pigs, eggs or other agricultural produce.  You can introduce regulations <Col N="2099" /> and schemes the same as you did under the Dairy Produce Act and the Eggs Act.  Rules and regulations can be made having State sanction, and any legal steps that may be necessary to get over the difficulties can be taken.  I do not see any reason why we should not get the same position here as they have on the Continent or in England and Scotland, or why the game here should not be worth anything between two millions or three millions a year.  There would be two distinct lines, the mountains and bogs and the arable land.  You are dealing with two classes of game.  On the arable land you will have partridge, pheasant and other ground game, and on the mountains grouse and perhaps hare.  You will not have partridge and you probably will not have pheasant on the mountains, because there is not the cover there.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the man who takes out a licence being entitled to some rights.  He has rights, but they should not override the rights of the occupier of the soil.  Except for the man taking out a licence who has a shooting right of his own or has a lease, or is a member of a club that takes out a shooting right or has a lease, I think the whole position will have to be reviewed. It is not enough that an individual who has no property in the country can take out a licence and go anywhere he likes.  That would be detrimental to the working of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Even in that case the occupier of the soil has certain rights. Of course, these details can be worked out having regard to everybody's interests.  There is nothing insuperable about them.  Whether it should be within the province of game clubs, whether a rate should be struck, or whether the licence money should be set aside for the destruction of vermin, I am not prepared to say at the moment.  That also can be decided later, but it is absolutely necessary that the question of vermin <Col N="2100" /> be tackled.  Since the Black-and-Tan period in this country, when ammunition became scarce, vermin has multiplied by leaps and bounds. Ground game has multiplied by leaps and bounds.  Rabbits a few years ago were a pest.  I think that it was these Deputy Derrig meant when he spoke of ground game.  There is nothing in this Bill with regard to the destruction of ground game. There is no reason why a 5/- licence should not entitle a man to kill ground game on his land.  As a matter of fact, an inducement ought to be given to the occupier of land to destroy all ground game, for they are useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Hares are ground game, but rabbits are not game at all.  I accept the correction.  I remember a few years ago some Englishmen being over here on a visit. I remember driving from Kilkenny to my place with one of them.  He remarked that he saw more magpies from Kilkenny to my place than he saw in all England for five years. That has happened all over the country.  Everywhere you go you will see magpies.  They were bad enough before, but they are a plague now.  That question must be tackled either by the State or game clubs or with the co-operation of both.  This Bill does not go far enough.  I have a few extracts here from speeches on the Bill by the Minister, Deputy O'Reilly and some others that I do not agree with.  I do not think there is any good reason for my going into them, but I would like to get some idea from either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Agriculture, with regard to getting some measure to run side by side with this for two years from the passing of this Bill.  If this is going to be a measure to prevent the shooting of game, we must lay down a stock.  It is easy enough to get pheasant, but it is a different matter about partridge. We need partridge much more than we need pheasants.  I do not know the best way of getting partridge.  I know the eggs can be <Col N="2101" /> hatched out under a hen, but a better way is to net a covey of partridge wherever they are to be got, take them here alive and distribute them.  Pheasants need not be brought here alive.  The eggs can be bought here at a reasonable figure and distributed. I believe you will get good results in that way.  If you had a reasonable breeding stock procured for next year there would still be from one and a half to two years of this Act to run, and at the end of that time your whole ambition would be realised and the intention of the Act would be achieved.  If I got an assurance that this matter would be considered by the Department and a proper scheme put into operation, I would be quite satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I object to is that the open season for hares is prolonged until the 1st April.  Representations have been made to me by some coursing clubs that the open season should not extend beyond 18th March.  I would go further and suggest the 1st March, with special permission to clubs to carry on meetings up to 17th March.  The ordinary close season should come into operation on 1st March.  That has always been so, and it should continue to be so.  Anybody who knows anything about hares is aware that large numbers of doe hares are heavy in young on the 1st March, and there are large numbers of leverets found knocking about.  It may be information to some people that the best time for the propagation of hares is in October and November. I had a dozen leverets on my farm bigger than rabbits.  They were born before Christmas.  In my time I have netted as many as half a dozen hares in the day, and many of these would be carrying young. Up to March nearly all the doe hares are in young.  Early in March quite a large percentage of them will be in young, and large numbers of leverets will be running about.  If it is arranged that the close season will begin on 1st March, with special permission to clubs to go on to the 17th March, I think it will be found generally satisfactory.  As a matter of fact, it was to meet that point that <Col N="2102" /> permission had to be asked from the County Councils to enable clubs to carry on until the 17th March.  The general open season ought to expire on 1st March, with permission to clubs to have meetings up to the 17th March.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey said that the owners of the soil in this country have not, in many instances, game rights.  He was quite right in saying that under the 1903 and the 1909 Acts the game rights were not given to the people who bought the land. Under the 1923 Act, until the land is vested, the tenants have not the game rights.  By far the bulk of land in the country has been dealt with under the 1903 and the 1923 Acts, so that the Minister for Justice would appear to have been wrong when he said that the farming community, with few exceptions, are the real owners of the game rights all over the country.  As a matter of fact Deputy Corry raised the point that farmers saw very little use in preserving game for the sake of some absentee landlord living in England or somewhere else.  Deputy Corry was interrupted and asked to point out a case where farmers did not own game rights.  He mentioned Cork and other places, and it would appear now that he was quite right. If farmers do not own game rights on their own lands, there would appear to be very little inducement to them to take an interest in the preservation of game.  The only effective way would be what Deputy Gorey suggested&mdash;that some Bill should be introduced vesting the game rights in the farmers, just as the land is vested in them.  If farmers were permitted to own the game rights, they would naturally be interested in the preservation of game.  From the debate it would appear that the ordinary farmer and his sons are the enemies of game.  In fact it would seem that they should not be allowed to shoot any game at all.</P>

      <P>If everything was done <Col N="2103" /> as Deputy Gorey has suggested; if farmers become owners of the game on their own land, in some places a farmer with 30 or 40 acres might see only one or two pheasants in the whole year.  It would hardly be worth his while to take out a £2 game licence if game were so scarce as that.  Under old conditions he was permitted to shoot game on his own land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They may have been acting illegally in doing it.  Deputy Gorey mentioned that exception was taken here and elsewhere to the killing of birds of any sort.  There are people who hold very strong views on the killing of birds.  There is, perhaps, some justification for killing birds as a matter of necessity, rather than for sport.  If it is necessary to kill birds of prey in order to protect other birds I am sure that would satisfy even the most humane person.  I refer to such birds as hawks, magpies, and birds of that sort.  They should be shot whenever there is an opportunity offered. Perhaps there may be difference of opinion about the shooting of game as a matter of necessity, or as a matter of sport.  Deputy E. Doyle held that the man who went out to net plover was more of a sportsman than the man who went out to shoot plover.  Of course, a lot depends upon the definition of a sportsman. The accepted definition of a sportsman is the man who shoots game&mdash; whether he is a sportsman or not, it does not matter.  The important point is whether there is not more justification in the case of the man who goes out with a net in order to eke out a living.  The question is: <Col N="2104" /> Is he not more justified than the man who goes out with a gun?  There does appear to be some justification for allowing a man to use a net in order to make his living.  Perhaps the opposite view to that of Deputy Doyle was expressed more clearly by Deputy Daly when he said that it is not the man who goes out for a shot who does the damage; it is the little sneak who goes out and tries to make a few shillings.  I think the little sneak who goes out in order to make a few shillings, if he has no other way of making the few shillings, is justified.</P>

      <P>I think that man is far more justified in doing what he does than the man who comes over here from England, or who comes from the nearest town or village, in order to shoot plover or other birds for sport.  The man who nets game in order to keep himself and his wife and family is more justified. That brings me to the section relating to export.  The Minister said game birds, dead or alive, will not be exported, the object being that for the next two years there will not be commercial or semi-commercial shooting in this country.  The Minister put in a section with regard to export, and permission can be got under it to send birds out of the country.  As far as we can understand from the explanations, permission will be given to a sportsman who comes from England to send back a brace of snipe or partridge to his wife and family so as to show how well he is doing.</P>

      <P>At any rate, there is a section put in here on which, in Committee, Deputy Gorey can question the Minister, to see whether it is not against the poor man I speak of.  There is another section which I would like the Minister to take into consideration during the Committee Stage.  That is the section which deals with the burning of gorse and heather, and so on.  It is an absolute necessity for certain mountain farmers who keep sheep to burn these mountains.  It is necessary every second or third year, as far as I know, to burn the skin of the gorse or heather in order that new grass may come up for the sheep.  Some of these mountain farmers have no other way of feeding their sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a question as to the date of the burning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is quite true, it is the date of the burning.  From where I live I can see this burning going on very plainly on many of the Wicklow Mountains, and I know that the burning is done practically altogether in the month of April. These places are not dry enough before the 1st of April.  The 14th of July would be too late on which to burn.  I think there should be at least some provision under that section to make an exception where this burning was found necessary.  I notice under this Bill that the Minister is again going to call in the Civic Guards.  They were called in here before under the <Col N="2106" /> Forestry and other Bills.  They were made wood-rangers under the Forestry Bill, and now they are going to be called on to act as gamekeepers. If we read Section 25, it will be seen that they can enter any place practically on land and sea, and if Deputy Dr. White gets his way, they will also be supplied with aeroplanes, so that they will have full control over land, sea, air and water in order to protect game.</P>
      <P>There is one little thing I would like the Minister to explain under Section 26.  In that section in parenthesis it is stated that &ldquo;unless a person satisfies the court that the carrying by him of such shot-gun without having a firearms certificate authorising him so to do was in the circumstances not unlawful.&rdquo;  I cannot imagine any circumstances where a man can carry a gun without a firearms certificate and not be acting unlawfully.  I thought it was absolutely essential in the case of every man who carries a gun to have a firearms certificate.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to explain why Sections 6, 7 and 9 are put into the Bill.  They seem to be contradictory.  Sections 7 and 9 do not seem to be necessary at all when you are finished with Section 6.  This Section seems to provide for protection orders in respect of hares.  It makes an exception lower down and, therefore, I do not see what necessity there is for Sections 7 and 9.  I would be glad if the Minister for Justice would answer some of these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this Bill now before the House is a very important measure and one which should be made as water-tight as possible.  If it is made as water-tight as possible it will, I feel sure, lay the foundations of the development of a very great natural asset to the people of this country.  Apart from the actual form in which this Bill may become law, the hope of achieving the object of developing this great asset depends on one central factor, and that is the co-operation of the occupiers of the land.  To my mind the small farmer is just as <Col N="2107" /> valuable in this connection as the large farmer.  Once the farmers realise that having game on their land is a valuable asset, then we shall see co-operation and game preservation raised to a very high state of efficiency.</P>
      <P>Not very far from where I live a game preservation association was formed about two years ago.  There are about 100 members in that association. The holdings of these members run from five acres upwards. That association then decided to shoot no game for two years.  I was talking to some members lately and they told me that the increase in the game was so rapid that they would have to start shooting hares and pheasants this year.  That has been brought about by co-operation amongst the farmers and the occupiers themselves.  They had their difficulties to get over, and one of the chief difficulties was to satisfy the smaller farmer.  They got over that difficulty.  Personally, I believe that it is only a question of time when we shall see all over the Saorstát many similar associations formed.  That brings me back to what I think is the real question of the whole future of game in this country.  That is the hearty co-operation of the landowners and the occupiers of the land.</P>
      <P>There are a few sections in this Bill to which I would like to draw attention.  I observe that under Section 5 (1) the Minister for Justice can bring in a Game Birds Protection Order.  This Order can be annulled by either the Dáil or Seanad. But if a Game Birds Protection Order is in force, exemption from this Order can only be given by the Superintendents of the Gárda Síochána in the districts in which the Order is in operation.  Personally. I have the very highest opinion of the Gárda Síochána.  I know that they have done very good work, and that they will continue to do good work.  For this very reason I fear that placing the responsibility on them would be putting the Superintendents of the Gárda in a very invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that no matter <Col N="2108" /> how careful and correct the decision of the Superintendent would be, he would always be open to criticism for refusing to grant an exemption order.  He would be accused of favouritism by disappointed applicants when he granted an exemption. There is this possibility&mdash;the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána decides that in a certain area where a prohibition order has been issued that a syndicate, or it may be a private person, there applies for an exemption order, and he grants that exemption order.  Later on, the Superintendent might be given a day's shooting, or several days' shooting there.  That would be perfectly right if he could get it; but I can visualise what the people would say in that event.  They would say: &ldquo;Oh, yes; he got the shooting there simply because he gave the exemption order.&rdquo;  That is why I would like to see the whole matter kept in the hands of the Minister.  To my mind the granting of an exemption under Section 5 is a very serious and important factor.  I feel very strongly that the power of granting same should be in the hands of the Minister, as in the case of the Hares Protection Order, Section 6 (2).  In regard to Section 6, I would like to see some provision made for the protection of gardens, nursery grounds and plantations from the possible destruction by hares.</P>
    <P>Section 16, sub-section (4) does not apply to the holder of a firearms certificate the excise duty on which is £2.  There is certainly a class of individual who wants looking after, namely, the professional poacher.  I mean by that, the man who has taken out a £2 licence and who goes around the country shooting over land over which he has not permission to shoot.  He is generally a good shot and he hawks game around the country, selling chiefly to private individuals the game which he shoots.  Personally, I can see no hardship in compelling every holder of a £2 licence to sell only to a holder of a game dealer's licence. That would go a long way to check the ravages of the professional <Col N="2109" /> poacher.  Should an amendment to that effect be accepted, then Section 22 sub-section (1) would have either to be amended or deleted.  Section 22 appears to me to be unnecessary, as it is already covered by Section 16 sub-section (3).  In Section 18 I would like to see an additional sub-section prohibiting the selling or keeping for sale of any species of game during the annual close season for such species except for a period of five days from the date on which the close season commences.  That would allow stocks on hands to be disposed of.  In regard to Section 23, the remarks I made with regard to Section 5 apply with equal force, and I would like the Minister to keep in his own hands power to give permission to export game and not to leave it in the hands of the Superintendent of the Civic Guards.  There is another point I would like to mention in connection with Section 23, that is, in regard to the inclusion of pheasants. It seems to me that the prohibition of the export of pheasants will seriously interfere with people, especially with syndicates who run big shoots and rear a lot of birds. These people generally export to make good a large part of their expenditure by the selling of pheasants, and if they have to sell four or five hundred pheasants simultaneously to the Dublin market, they will get a ridiculous price.  Under the Bill as it stands they can apply for a permit.  There is, however, a possibility that they might be refused, and therefore they would be reluctant to undertake the expense necessary to rear six or eight hundred birds if they feel there is a chance of these birds being left on their hands. That point could be met by deleting the word &ldquo;pheasant&rdquo; wherever it occurs, or by the Minister giving permission to syndicates who satisfy him that they are rearing so many birds.  They would thus have permission from the start to export.</P>
    <P>The question of Sunday shooting has already been spoken on by other Deputies.  Personally, I would like to see no shooting on Sunday, but if that is not possible, I would like to see no shooting start before noon on <Col N="2110" /> Sunday.  I think that birds should have even half a day in the week free from being shot.  I notice in the Second Schedule, Part II, that the Game Trespass Act of 1864 is repealed in its entirety.  I would suggest that the law on this subject should be codified under this Bill, if necessary under a separate and new part altogether.  I think that that is very important.  Finally, I note that landrails constitute game birds under Section 2, but that no close season has been fixed for them under Schedule 1.  I suggest to the Minister that they should be protected from 1st February until 1st September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with a good deal of what Deputy Gorey said in connection with this Bill.  I feel the fears he expressed that the people will not co-operate with the Minister in giving effect to it will be justified. Farmers have complained of the uselessness of preserving game and preventing its destruction when men who are absolute strangers can walk in on their land and shoot over it without their permission while they themselves are precluded from shooting. They say that they have applied time and again for a five-shilling licence to help them to kill vermin, but they have been refused.  The point made by Deputy O'Mahony with reference to permission to be given by the Superintendent of the Civic Guards is certainly applicable. These men complained that they were refused a licence as the Superintendent of the Guards had given them a bad reputation.  He stated openly, and did not make any attempt to conceal the fact, that the reason was that he wanted the shooting for himself and his friends.  The Superintendent and his friends can go out and shoot while farmers are not allowed to shoot over their own land. Undoubtedly, if that section is retained as it stands, that feeling will exist all over the country and where a local Superintendent refuses permission for a licence personal motives will be immediately attributed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> I think that Deputy Gorey made some reference to deer.  I hope for the sake of farmers deer will not be allowed to go at large in the country. I know of a case myself where some deer escaped from a preserve and they did far more damage than any sort of vermin.  The result was, however, that the farmer was in such a position that he was unable to take any measures to protect his crops from deer.  Shot-guns are of no use against them.  He is looking for protection from that sort of thing, and some effort should be made to give it to him.  A gunman should be sent down to destroy these deer if they cannot be impounded. I think Section 26 of the Bill will lead to endless trouble.  An Irishman will not stand for that condition of affairs.  If a farmer is shooting over his land and if he is suddenly confronted by a stranger who demands his licence I am afraid it will lead to trouble, and there is great danger that it may cause unrest.  In regard to Section 24, which deals with the burning of mountains, I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan that in parts of the country farmers are compelled to burn mountains on which they graze sheep.  As the Deputy pointed out, this has to be done when the gorse is dry.  If this section is retained without amendment it will impose a severe hardship on those people. Sub-section (2) of Section 8 should also be amended.  Of course, it is a matter for the Committee Stage, but I might call attention to it now.  It says that the section shall not apply to nor render unlawful the setting by an occupier of land of traps, snares or nets for the taking of rabbits on the land occupied by him.  It should be amended by inserting the words after the words &ldquo;occupier of land&rdquo;&ldquo;or persons authorised by him.&rdquo;  I raise that point because many people eke out a more or less precarious livelihood by trapping rabbits.  If this section is allowed to stand as it is such people will be precluded from trapping even if they got the permission of the owners of the land unless the section is so <Col N="2112" /> amended as to give the occupier permission to give them authority to carry on the trapping.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey also referred to the fact that the whole question of game rights will have to be dealt with.  I agree with him.  He suggested that the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should co-operate in the matter.  I suggest that the Minister for Fisheries be also asked to co-operate. The most valuable portion of the game rights in this country is the inland fisheries.  Anybody conversant with fishery laws will admit that the feudal laws still exist, the result being that the inland fishery rights which are so very valuable are left the property of a few individuals and are of very little benefit to the country at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, and I think it will go a long way towards attaining the object for which it has been introduced.  Of course a great deal of the success of this Bill will depend upon its strict administration.  Deputy Gorey suggested that with this Bill another Bill should be introduced to try to get over the difficulty of re-stocking the country.  I think if the people interested in the preservation and the protection of game in this country see that they are getting adequate protection under this Bill and if, when offences are committed, adequate fines will be inflicted, local co-operation, in the form of game preservation associations, will spring up.  It is through such associations that game will be preserved and that the country will be re-stocked.  I agree with Deputy Shaw and Deputy Bennett, who hold that these game protection associations, which they hope will spring up when this Bill becomes law, should have statutory powers such as are given to coursing clubs under the Bill.  I think that would go a long way towards getting over the difficulties of re-stocking and preservation.  The two most important clauses in the Bill, to my mind, are those dealing with the licensing of game dealers and the exportation of game.  I think <Col N="2113" /> that a great deal of the game destroyed heretofore was very often shot by people who held no game-licence at all but a 10/- or a 5/- licence.  Game shot under these conditions was brought into local towns and could be sold to anybody.  Under this Bill a game dealer will have to keep a list and will have to make sure that the person from whom he buys game has a game licence.  If there is a proper check kept on the game dealer I think it will go a long way towards securing the preservation of game.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony raised the point about the exportation of game and said that a person coming over to this country for a few days' or a few weeks' sport would find one of his greatest pleasures in being able to send back a few brace of pheasants or partridge to friends on the other side.  He said that he did not like to be put to the trouble of having to go to a superintendent of the Civic Guards and that it was only when he got to the post office that he would find that he could not send them away.  I think that that difficulty might be got over if those coming into the country applied to somebody for a permit or a game certificate.  I am not sure as to what office he would have to apply, but if he could get a permit to send so many brace of game out of the country at that time it would save him a great deal of trouble afterwards.</P>

I want to stress the point that the object of preserving and protecting game would be better attained by the formation of game protection associations and local co-operation and that these associations should be given statutory power under the Bill.  I think that is the proper way of dealing with it rather than through the Department of Agriculture. I think that people who are really interested will find a means of purchasing partridge and other game when they know that adequate protection will be afforded under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to know that.  The speech made by Deputy Dr. White was very interesting. I should like to know if it represents the policy of the Government or if it was just a brilliant thought of his own.  Our idea in Connemara is that before they begin to pass laws for the preservation of game, the Ministry should pass some laws for the preservation of the Irish language and the people in the Gaeltacht.  I have absolutely no interest in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am replying to a speech made by Dr. White.  As far as the preservation of game in Connemara will be helped by this Bill, I think the people of Connemara will give it the very smallest amount of co-operation they can give it, for the reason that the game in Connemara is not owned by the people of Connemara&mdash;it is owned by strangers who visit there and do the shooting.  We in Connemara are not allowed to shoot game or to course. One section of the Bill prevents the shooting of hares and that will affect us in a rather peculiar way. Deputy Gorey will think it very strange when I say that Connemara is absolutely unsuitable for coursing. Hares cannot be coursed there, and if they are allowed to spread indefinitely, if there is no shooting or netting or trapping allowed, they will, undoubtedly, in a year or two, <Col N="2116" /> cause considerable trouble to small farmers.</P>

      <P>Yes, if we could catch them and sell them to you it would be all right.  Another matter is the burning of furze.  It is customary on the mountains in Connemara to burn furze, and that is necessary in the sheep area.  Deputy Gorey and Deputy Dr. Ryan referred to certain dates for this burning. In Connemara the burning takes place when the weather is suitable. As soon as the furze is ready for burning, it is burned by the people who rear sheep.  I also object to Section 26.  I think that authority should not be given to every Tom, Dick and Harry to question individuals, as it is bound to lead to abuse.</P>

      <P>If we want to preserve game in this country we must first of all be supplied with the game and I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to give a small grant for the re-stocking of the country with game.  I suggest £5,000 for a start to re-stock the country with partridge, which is almost extinct in the South.  If the Minister were prepared to grant that sum, what an advertisement it would be for the Tourist Development Association. Sportsmen would be so anxious to come into the country that they would be tripping over each other. The Department of Agriculture has already done a good deal for the preservation of game by re-afforestation work, as the plantations will be a means of protection for pheasants. My point is that if we preserve fish and game in this country we will be doing a considerable amount of good for this land of ours, which will teem with milk and honey once more, and the golden harvest which we will reap from the fin and feather will be very considerable.  I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to the point I have put forward. A nod is as good as a wink, even from the back benches of the intellectuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point to which I should like the Minister to give consideration.  One of the most essential things in connection with the preservation of game, and it is the means whereby you fill the pockets when you are out shooting, is the shot gun.  While we are taking steps to preserve certain classes of game, there is a certain amount of what we call vermin actually robbing the farmers of the country.  I know instances in Galway where farmers who were in possession of guns for the purpose of the protection of their property had them taken from them by the R.I.C. or in later times, and, although they have made repeated applications for the return of the guns, they have not got them back. I should like the Minister to give some consideration to that question, and give these guns back to those respectable citizens who want them for their own protection.  For some petty reason some enemies of theirs, or some other people, have sent in reports to the authorities which are believed to be true, and these people have not got back their guns, with the result that they are not reaping the harvest which they sow, because their crops are destroyed by crows and other birds of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Houlihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to say a word. The way to preserve game, in my opinion, in this country is to observe the close shooting season, to prevent the burning of gorse and heather, and things like that, and to encourage the destruction of vermin.  I know that long after the 28th February we find fellows who will shoot game.  Only last year I knew of a professional gentleman, who ought to know better, who went out shooting grouse before the 12th August, and shot upwards of a dozen young grouse.  And he was not the only one.  Shooting in the close season is, I believe, doing away with more game than most things, and the burning of the gorse and the heather in the months of April and May destroys a lot of young birds in the nests.  Then we have the vermin to deal with&mdash;hawks, magpies, scald <Col N="2118" /> crows.  I would like if the Minister would insert a section in the Bill for the encouragement of the destruction of these pests.  It should be as easy to encourage the destruction of these as it is for the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to encourage the destruction of the enemies of fish.  I suggest that the Minister should utilise the proceeds of the two pound licences for giving rewards for the killing of those pests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press one or two points with regard to the close season for hares. I suggest that the close season for hares should be from the 1st March to the 30th September.  I believe the 1st April is too late, and the hunting from the 1st March to the 1st April is certainly of a very poor class.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which I think is a step in the right direction.  I heard Deputy Corry stating last Friday that people carrying a two pound licence have really no authority to shoot over their lands.  I see no objection whatever to people holding lands under the Land Commission shooting over these lands. He also suggested that people ought to be allowed to shoot game with a ten-shilling licence.  At the same time you have another Deputy from Cork coming along and asking the Minister for a grant of £5,000 for re-stocking the country with game, and Deputy Corry asks that a ten-shilling licence should be a sufficient authority to shoot this game.  I do not know that there is really much sport in that.  For the shooting of game there should be no licence under two pounds.  In the past few years I have known people going round the country trying to make a living out of the shooting of game. They have trenched upon preserved ground and sold game at a very good price.  I am pleased to see that under this Bill one has to have an exporter's licence because that will help to do away with the boys who try to make a living from the gun.</P>

      <P>It is a real pleasure to see a Bill introduced into <Col N="2119" /> this House which has the approval and sympathy of every section of this House and of those interested in the preservation of game.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the hopes of the poachers are destined to be shattered.  I hope before this Bill is passed the provision of that very useful section, George III., Ch. 35, Section 8, which is being repealed, will be reintroduced and, if I may respectfully suggest it to the Minister for Justice, reintroduced and renewed in very much stronger and more vigorous form.  As I remember that statute, nine out of every ten prosecutions for poaching were brought under that section which when this Bill is passed will be no more.  I take it perhaps that that was a draftsman's slip and that it will be remedied and that it will be renewed and re-enacted I hope in a form that will get rid of the difficulties and objections which the preserver of game had to meet when prosecuting under the old law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not point out these to the Minister, as they are there in decided cases, not more than half a dozen of them, and these difficulties, I hope, will be got rid of.  One of these difficulties I remember well, because, perhaps, many a time I utilised it when prosecuting, and sometimes it was utilised against me when I was for the defendant in prosecutions for trespass in pursuit of game, that these gentlemen were only looking for rabbits.  I am sure the Minister will get rid of that little difficulty, and that that will be no longer a defence, and that people who look <Col N="2120" /> forward to this Bill with so much eagerness will find, when it becomes an Act and when it goes on to the Statute Book, that it will have renewed and revived the old Act of George III and that Section 10, Cap. 25, will be re-enacted and made firmer.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might also consider, if I may respectfully suggest it to him, that it might be necessary in the new section which he must introduce to define more clearly the necessary proofs to establish trespass in pursuit of game.  I do not say that is an easy thing.  I do not say that in doing it he should not have regard to the rights of defendant as well as the prosecutor.  I am sure he will.  I would ask the Minister, if possible&mdash;I have not considered it very closely&mdash;to make it clear and to get rid of the difficulties surrounding the law in the old poaching section which we have met so often.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey struck the keynote on this Bill when he told us that the Act by itself would not work, that it would only work with the assistance and sympathy of the farmers, and he broached to us a very large and difficult problem which, he said, had given him a lot of trouble, namely, how to procure that sympathy. I agree it is a very difficult task.  I also agree with him it is work that ought not to be beyond the reach of human possibility.  I think we should strive to get the sympathy of the occupiers, and in order to make that sympathy effective we must get co-operation between the farmers.</P>
    <P>We must get co-operation between the occupiers of land.  Deputy Gorey has suggested, and I was trying to think of a better solution, that we must invoke the assistance of the Department of Agriculture to bring about that co-ordination.  Were it not for the assistance of a Deputy in this House who, I think, gave me a better solution of that real difficulty I would myself say that I knew no better way out of that than that suggested by Deputy Gorey.  But I do think as we have been amalgamating land, sea and air we might also get <Col N="2121" /> our fisheries and our game rights amalgamated.  You have throughout this country Boards of Conservators. You may criticise them as you please. I am sure some of them are not above criticism, but through and through you will find this that amongst them there are the best of sports, members who have a real interest in the preservation of game, men who are true and real sportsmen working energetically for the pure love of sport.  Why not, if we can at all manage it, amalgamate the preservation of game with the preservation of fish?  Give our Boards of Conservators the protection both of game and of fish and they can do it with the same staff.  To give the water bailiff his due, he is, as a rule, a sportsman.  I do not say he is always so but he will do the two jobs at the same time and do them both fairly efficiently.  I would suggest that is a matter well worth the consideration of the Minister for Justice and those who take an interest in the preservation of game. I can only repeat the pleasure it is to all of us to find all parties working together with one common object, which is entirely apart from anything political, the preservation of game and of a great national asset which I believe will have far more value than many of us can realise.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made no provision in the Bill for the destruction of vermin.  Would the Minister state if, on the Committee Stage, he would be prepared to accept an amendment by which a fund would be created that would enable something to be given to people who would produce hawks or magpies?  I suggest that a fund should be provided in the following way.  A permit to sell cartridges which costs £1 could be increased to £4 or £5.  I understand there is a considerable profit being made on them. That would give him a fund that would deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question is that which has been raised by Deputy Wolfe. If Section 10 is being recast or embodied in some other form in this Bill provision should be made for costs, as the Minister knows under <Col N="2122" /> this section there was no power to allow costs.  In Section 5, page 3, the Minister when satisfied, may order a special close season for certain game birds.  I would ask the Minister whether he would consider an amendment to the effect that the local enquiry should be carried out by the District Justice in the same manner as the official by-laws have been formed at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the question which Deputy Wolfe put and which Deputy Ruttledge reiterated, it is my intention to introduce an amendment and place it before the House for its consideration which will strengthen the existing provisions for the preservation of game inasmuch as it will strengthen the section dealing with trespass in pursuit of game.  This discussion has gone on at very considerable length and a great deal of it seems to me to have been completely irrelevant to the Bill before the House.  Such criticisms as were passed upon the Bill actually before the House are small criticisms going to minor points and sections.  It will be impossible for me now to trace every single point which has been made in the course of the debate.  I will only deal with a few general ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I said that a great deal of the speeches were entirely irrelevant.  Deputy Ruttledge's speech, which was not quite as long as his question, was entirely irrelevant.  Deputy Jordan's speech was entirely irrelevant, and a great number of other speakers were entirely irrelevant.  This is a Bill which deals with the preservation of game.  It has nothing on earth to do with either the repeal, alteration or modification of the Firearms Act, 1925, or with the Finance Act of 1925.  Under the Firearms Act of 1925 certain classes of licences are created.  Under the Finance Act of 1925 certain fees must be paid to get out these licences.  That is not a matter which can be dealt with in this Bill at all, and if Deputies think a 10/- licence ought to be sufficient for the whole country, a view that I do not agree with at all, their method is to put in an amendment to the <Col N="2123" /> Finance Bill now before the House. It is not to discuss it upon a Bill which has nothing on earth to do with it.  This is not a Finance Bill.  It is merely a Game Preservation Bill. It has nothing to do with firearms at all, and a discussion on fees which are to be charged on the issue of licences is completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with the terms of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been another matter introduced here which does not very much concern the present Bill.  That is the question of vermin.  In my opening statement I said I was perfectly aware of the great damage vermin were doing in this country, and I agree with Deputy Kent that hawks do a great deal of damage to chickens in country places.  I happen to know it to my own cost.  I live in a rather wooded place, and I know the damage done by hawks to fowl is very considerable in the fowl yard.  That gives rise to a different consideration, which is this: Should the Government do everything, or should the people do something for themselves?  That really is a question which that gives rise to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was very strong upon this.  So were other persons, but it seems to me those who were pressing that the Government should re-stock the country with game and that the Government should put so much per head upon vermin are showing a great distrust in the people themselves.  They seem to think that the people can do nothing for themselves and that the Government must do everything for them. They seem to think that the Irish people are an inefficient people who cannot organise themselves, think for themselves, or act for themselves, but are so many babies who are to be led.  I cannot take that view.  I believe as soon as the people of this country realise that game is a real asset for them that they will themselves <Col N="2124" /> take the necessary steps to destroy vermin which must be done, a great deal of it by trapping and more of it by shooting.</P>
    <P>For instance, the hawk, I think, can be more effectually destroyed on the moors by the hawk traps than by the shot gun.  It is practically impossible to shoot a hawk on a mountain. He will never come near you, but a great number of hawks are caught on moors by a trap set on the top of a stick.  It is my view that if you get people to recognise that there is money in this a war will be carried on on vermin.  As Deputy Shaw pointed out, game protection associations will spring up and members will make it a point of honour to destroy vermin as far as they can. If they like they can put up certain sums of money, so much for each head of vermin that is destroyed in their neighbourhood, but that is the people helping themselves; it is co-operation. That is quite a different thing from always coming to the Government for everything, even though it may not be a very large sum.  Deputy Gorey and several other Deputies spoke about the occupying tenants not having the right to shoot on their own bogs. That may be so in certain counties. I do not know all Ireland.  I only know one part of Ireland, but I know it very well.  It is not correct to say that under the 1903 Act and the 1909 Act game was automatically reserved to the landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put Deputy Ryan's sins on <Col N="2125" /> Deputy Gorey.  They may be too heavy.  Under the 1903 and the 1909 Acts the landlord could reserve the rights to game.  In some cases, I know he did, but in very large areas in the country the rights to game were not reserved.  In other cases, they were merely for the life of the owner or for the life of his eldest son.  I think there are very few cases where the game rights were reserved under the 1903 or the 1909 Act.</P>
      <P>As far as the financial side of this is concerned there is some confusion of mind.  Some Deputies, especially Deputy Derrig, seem to think that you can have your loaf and eat your loaf.  That is to say, you can make an income out of your game by setting your game rights and at the same time you can shoot the game. It must be either one thing or the other.  You must make up your mind that you are going to give over the shooting of game to somebody else that you are going to shoot it yourself.  In one case, you provide yourself with sport which some people enjoy, the sport of shooting, and in the other you add to your income. I am only dealing with cases in which occupiers of land treat game as a potential source of wealth to themselves.  The only way in which I see these game rights can be made valuable to the occupiers of land in this country is if associations are formed, either by persons taking the shooting from them or by the farmers themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way in which successful preservation of game can be carried out, it seems to me, is not by the payment of so much per year to the owners of the shooting, but by the payment of so much per head for the game shot upon their land.  That is an experiment that has been tried very successfully. Somebody said that partridge were extinct in this country. They are not entirely extinct.  Dr. Tubridy talked about Connemara.  I happen to know an instance in Connemara where a well-known sporting <Col N="2126" /> gentleman brought over partridge and let them out.  He has now a very successful shoot of partridge. Connemara is a very poor place.  It is not a partridge country, in the sense that some of the counties round Dublin are or ought to be, but there is a very successful partridge shoot there because he pays the owners of the land so much per head for the partridge shot.  My belief is that as soon as the persons in this country who have shooting rights realise this they will take advantage of it.  If an ex-landlord has shooting rights, say, over Deputy Gorey's farm, it might pay him extremely well to pay Deputy Gorey so much per head for the partridge shot on his land.  That would be the way in which really good game preservation could be carried out by persons who have reserved game rights and do not utilise them themselves.  Those persons, I hope, will let their rights to syndicates who will be willing to work them.  That is really one of the main features of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will only just run through a few other features of the Bill.  One of the main things which has given rise to discussion here is the question of Sunday shooting.  I must admit that a certain case has been put up against Sunday shooting.  The strongest arguments, I think, against it, were the arguments put forward by Deputy Law that persons who live in the neighbourhood of large towns may suffer very heavily if Sunday shooting is permitted.  If you have a grouse moor, say, twenty miles from Dublin persons can come down from Dublin by car and shoot your game in the early hours of Sunday and then go back to Dublin having destroyed your shooting for the year.  That is quite possible.  It is a strong argument that Sunday shooting should be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if a person pays a £2 licence and has the right to shoot over his own land, I do not think his rights should be interfered with.  If a person owns land and has brought himself within the law by paying for his shooting rights over the land, I do not think it right to <Col N="2127" /> interfere with the liberty of that person, and certainly I would oppose any amendment which would make Sunday, or any part of Sunday, a close day for shooting.  There is another question, and that is the question of green plover.  Green plover, from the sportman's or the shooting man's point of view, is a negligible bird.  Nobody gets very much pleasure out of shooting green plover.  It is only if one happens to go over your head that you shoot him, but green plover may be very valuable birds, from the farmer's point of view.  Green plover is very necessary for the check of fluke both in sheep and cattle.  I need not go through the life history of the little insect that creates fluke, but at one stage of his career it is necessary for him to inhabit the water snail, and these water snails are eaten by the dozen by green plover.  In that way, green plover are a great preventative of fluke in sheep and cattle.  It is generally recognised that they have been reduced extraordinarily in numbers.  In some countries shooting them at all is prohibited. I think that although one or two persons may make an income by trapping them, or other persons may make an income by collecting and selling the eggs, they are birds which, in the interests of the whole community, should be preserved and not exterminated.</P>
    <P>I come now to a very argumentative question, so to speak&mdash;the question of the close season for hares. It appears from what has been said here that the coursing men are of the opinion that the ideal close season for hares should commence on 1st March, or from the 1st March to the 17th or 18th March.  On the other hand, the hunting men are of the opinion that the close season should not begin until 1st April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> That is the view of the hunting men. As a matter of fact, I have had a communication from the master of a very well-known pack of harriers saying that if the March hunting was done away with he would give up hunting with his harriers altogether in this country.  I never was very much of a hunting man and, in fact, I have not been on a horse's back for over twenty years; but I know that as far as harrier hunting is concerned, the real season for hunting with the harriers is in the month of March.  Hares are better for hunting with harriers in the month of March than at any other period of the year.</P>

      <P>The explanation is that the jack-hare in March wanders very far afield; when he is hunted, he goes home in a straight line, and the result is that he gives a long straight run to the hounds.  On the other hand, a hare roused from the form in a country which he knows very well will go circling round and round and he never leaves his own area.  The month of March is the one month in which the hare does leave his own area and travels far afield, and when he is hunted he gives a straight run home.  That is the reason why I have always heard from hunting men that the hunting of a jack-hare in March is the best form of harrier hunting.</P>

      <P>I have gone through the main points of this Bill.  There are just a few points which have been mentioned, and I will deal very shortly with them, because most of them are Committee points.  Deputy Derrig talked about persons having a right to destroy ground game on their own holdings. He said that was recommended by a Committee in England.  Of course it was recommended by a Committee, and it was followed by the Ground Game Act, under which the occupier can destroy hares and rabbits on his own land.  Except in so far as the <Col N="2130" /> hares will be protected in certain areas by this Bill, a man can still destroy hares on his own land.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Mahony thought it would be better for the Minister to give permits in cases in which they could be granted.  That would be hardly feasible because there may be a considerable number of permits wanted and the Minister would not know the particular needs of the county.  He could only act on the advice of the Guards.  It would take a great deal of time before the permit would be issued.  I think the superintendent would be the proper person to give the permit and he might be trusted to act fairly in the matter.  The spirit in which the Act will be administered is that the Guards will be told that a person shall not have the right in prohibited areas to shoot game unless he can show a reasonable prima facie case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to shoot old cock grouse, but it is highly advisable to shoot cock pheasants.  Everybody knows that the grouse is monogamous and the pheasant is polygamous.  You must have one cock grouse for every hen grouse and, on the other hand, the allowance is one cock pheasant to twenty hen pheasants.  Therefore, you must keep the number of cock pheasants down.  That is a thing that would have to be considered in places where there are large shoots and where there are great numbers of pheasants.  Deputy O'Mahony has pointed out that if a person rears a great number of pheasants or grouse and has a fully-stocked shooting, it would be necessary to shoot down those birds and it would be right and proper that he should get permission to shoot them, first, in the interests of game preservation and, secondly, because he might have gone to a great deal of expense and he would be able to get something back on the sale and exportation of game birds. I cannot agree with Deputy O'Reilly that Ireland never can be made a grouse country.  I think the very opposite is the case.  I think grouse is just the very class of game to which Ireland is suited.  I hope in a few years we will find game flourishing in Ireland, and producing a very <Col N="2131" /> considerable amount of revenue for this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to the figures of the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday I noticed that he laid great stress upon the fact that he had succeeded in reducing the debit balance by a considerable sum.  In the ordinary way credit is given and should be given to any responsible Minister who succeeds in reducing expenditure as far as the State is concerned, but we will have to view the position as the result of the reduction. We find that machine which the Parliamentary Secretary has now left is pretty much a poorer machine in efficiency than it was prior to the reduction of expenditure. Expenditure has not been reduced as a result of greater efficiency in the Post Office from a business point of view.  Expenditure has been reduced as the result of the curtailment of the postal service in the State.  I maintain that, however that curtailment may be justified from the point of view of economy, the Parliamentary Secretary has tackled the problem at the wrong end.  Most of these economies have been effected in the rural districts. To my mind, that is tackling the problem at the wrong end.  If we take this postal service as a necessary service of the State, we will have to regard the whole State as one unit, and we cannot attempt to localise it into various units.  For instance, the Parliamentary Secretary has had before his mind certain areas in this State <Col N="2132" /> which can be run with a margin of profit while other areas in the State showed a deficit.  In order to reduce that deficit the Parliamentary Secretary reduced expenditure on services in those areas which showed a deficit or that they were not being run economically.</P>
      <P>I feel that if the business people in the City of Dublin or in any other city or large town that is entirely dependent upon the rural area for its business, found that it was expedient for them and their business to attend at the post office for the collection of their letters and to send a messenger for the despatch of their letters that the business men in these towns would do it.  That would be done without any great inconvenience to these people.  In most cases they have not a quarter of a mile to travel to the post office.  One member of the staff of a business house could bring the letters on his way back from lunch or could take the letters when coming to work in the morning.  All this could be done without very much inconvenience by business men and people in the towns.  In the case of the rural people it is quite different.  There you have areas where a person, in order to reach the post office, has to travel three and a half or four miles. These people, whose ordinary business is not done through postal service and who merely receive letters irregularly, would find that it would not be good business for them to make provision to attend the post office in order to get their letters, or to post their letters.  For that reason, as the rural districts are necessary for the continuation of the postal system, it is these districts that should be catered for first from a business point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case, and if the Deputy who disagrees with me feels that the opposite case can be put forward, well, he can do so.  It may suit you either to support this service as a State service or to run it on the lines of a joint stock business transaction. Well and good.  It may be found an <Col N="2133" /> economical proposition from the point of view of a joint stock transaction to continue the service from the point of view of having each area economically run.  But if you continue it from that point of view how long will that service be maintained if it is confined to the cities alone?  The Deputy who says &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; will find, if he stretches his imagination, that it is he and not I who is speaking nonsense.  If anyone follows up that line of reasoning he will find that quite logically a business person in the city who is doing a large business should have special facilities through the postal service as against those who are doing a small business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The city people are only paying portion of the deficit the Post Office leaves behind.  I may again remind the Deputy that if he only knew more of the conditions that apply to business in the city he would realise that the business in the city comes from the agricultural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>That only bears out my statement that the Deputy does not understand business conditions. Again, we find the Parliamentary Secretary, when he comes to deal with another department, namely, the telephone service, endeavouring to treat the matter there from the point of view of the joint stock director.  He says the telephone service is not a good thing for the State, but a service that must pay its way, and before he instals a telephone in a rural district he must have a guarantee from that district that that will be a paying asset from the start.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why special guarantees should be sought for from the general public for a service that has to be maintained by the whole State as one unit, and the deficiency in which has to be made up by the whole State.  If the telephone <Col N="2134" /> service is to be regarded as a State service and part of the State department of the postal service for the general public, then the general public ought to have facilities, and the various post offices throughout the country should have telephone facilities without any special guarantee being asked of them for these services.  Clearly the whole matter of the postal service is a very unsatisfactory one from the point of view of the countryman.  He is asked to put up with all the inconveniences when the Minister applies his economy.  It is in the rural areas that the postmen have been asked to submit to cuts in their salaries, I suggest, to a greater extent than any other department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the deliveries of letters in the country are never satisfactory. A delivery once every two or three days in a rural area is really a very unsatisfactory service.  The result of that curtailment will be that the post office which has been showing a deficit for the State during a number of years, will show a growing deficit in the time to come, with impaired machinery, and this deficit will grow each year as the service becomes impaired.  These are the main points that appeal to me, and I want to urge specially by way of some concession to the rural districts that the telephone system should be extended there and the restrictions by way of guarantees that are asked before telephones are installed in rural areas should be withdrawn. We have instances in the present arrangement whereby people living in the country have to pay from ? to 3/6 for the delivery of their telegrams in some cases, where they live a distance from the post office. Clearly that is a very unfair arrangement, and it can, on no basis of equity, be maintained.  Last year, when this estimate was under consideration, I remember the Minister responsible made a statement or a promise that he would make some provision to deal with the inconveniences and unfairness suffered by those who live a distance away from the post office, and who had to pay for the delivery of their telegrams. <Col N="2135" /> Up to the present nothing has been done, but I suggest now that not alone should that grievance be dealt with but that further facilities in the way of installing increased numbers of telephones should be made available for those resident in rural districts. So far as the present policy of the Post Office is concerned, it gives every encouragement in an indirect way to those who live in rural areas to go into large centres of population.  That is not an arrangement which the Parliamentary Secretary should have in mind; rather should it be the reverse.  Social amenities should be the first consideration for rural districts rather than conserving them for the cities and larger towns, which, after all, are dependent on rural districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I happened at one time to be an official in the Postal Service inasmuch as I received a salary of £4 a year for attending to five or six Post Offices in my district. In 1924 I received a long rigmarole from Aireacht an Phuist. Incidentally, I may say that I do not see why they should not call it Teach an Phosta as we all do in the West. The communication I received on that occasion stated that as a result of my complicity in the Irregular campaign I was to be dismissed the office which I held.  I would like to know whether the cases of people like myself who were dismissed for these reasons are to be considered. A salary of £4 a year for a medical officer attending to five or six post offices is not a very big one.  I must say whatever money was lost by a medical officer like myself by being implicated in the Irregular campaign was very well made up to me in fees, inasmuch as where I made £4 a year before I made £20 or £30 since in treating and attending Post Office officials.  I would like to know if Aire an Phuist would re-consider his decision in these cases, and if the cases of those who like myself were dismissed for complicity in the Irregular campaign would be looked into in view of the changed conditions. As I am on that point it may be appropriate to ask that the <Col N="2136" /> description Aireacht an Phuist be changed to Teach an Phosta, which is a much better term to put over the doors of post offices.  I am talking now from the point of view of the Western Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Sheehy Mr. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(Cork): I wish to place one matter before the Parliamentary Secretary.  It refers to the serious condition of the mail boat that runs between Baltimore and Cape Clear.  She is not suitable for the weather conditions prevailing along that part of the coast.  We are very much afraid in that locality that some morning we will wake up and learn that a desperate tragedy has taken place.  The boat is not suitable and is not large enough for the traffic which she carries, not alone in passengers, but in goods. The inhabitants on the island have to use that boat when they come to Baltimore to sell their provisions, and it is generally pretty well loaded with goods and passengers.  I would appeal to the Minister to take that matter into consideration.  I am sure that the Minister for Fisheries, who is deeply interested in that portion of the country, as fishing is the main industry there, would give a helping hand so that we would not have to continue in that state of alarm about that boat.  Anyone who passes through the Gassinane Sound will realise the danger that exists. When the weather is bad the islanders may have to wait two or three days before they can return home.  So far as the crew and captain are concerned, they are all to be desired, but what is the good of that if they have not a good boat? We must have a safe and seaworthy boat to carry on that service between <Col N="2137" /> the island and the mainland. I wish to congratulate Deputy Moore on his statement last night regarding the necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary to try and secure that the money from this country in the English Savings Bank should be brought back here with a view to helping the Department financially. That is an excellent move.  Deputy Moore also suggested that the postmasters and sub-postmasters throughout the length and breadth of the country should canvass people to put their money into our Post Office Savings Bank.  That is most gratifying, but there is another side to the question.  What is the reason that a lot of Irish money is lying in the English Savings Bank or that a lot of it is kept in stockings at home?  It is because the people consider that there is some element of danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question about the telephone service in the Dublin area.  Within a radius of one mile of the different exchanges there is a flat rate for telephones of £5 a year and outside that radius the charge is £10.  That, in my opinion, is merely a survival of the infant days of the telephone and is now very inequitable to the public.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the suggestion of equalising the rate for the whole Dublin area. It might perhaps result in a loss for the next year if he adopted it now, but I would like if he and the Minister for Finance would consider it between this and the next Budget, and although I do not care to assume the gift of prophecy I think it would mean an increase of revenue eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the <Col N="2138" /> point raised by Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, I think the Deputy is not quite accurate in regard to the facts. The facts are, I believe, that there is a flat rate of charges, within a radius of one mile, the rate being £5 for private residences and £6 10s. for business premises.  Outside a radius of one mile there is an increase for every furlong of the additional distance beyond that mile. That applies to the service all over the Free State.  I think I can assure Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll that, in connection with the extension of the automatic system in Dublin, the question of varying the system of charges will be considered and that we will be able to deal with the point raised by the Deputy.  I was surprised and sorry to hear that the Post Office within recent years has lost the services of such a valuable official as Deputy Dr. Tubridy.  The Deputy probably knows that a committee has been set up by the Government to inquire into cases which the Deputy mentioned, that is, the cases of officials who were dismissed because of their connection with the Irregular activities, and if the Deputy approaches that committee, I have no doubt that they will give sympathetic consideration to his case.  I cannot answer his question with regard to the proper Irish spelling of the Irish term for Post Office.  I thought that possibly An Leas-Cheann Comhairle might have enlightened the Deputy in view of his recent sojourn in Spiddal.  However, we can probably discuss that matter at some other stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony has put down a motion that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  I am rather surprised that the Deputy put down a motion of that kind, because I consider that the case made in regard to it is hardly justified. The facts of the Deputy's case evidently are that a comparatively small number of the engineering staff in various parts of the Free State have had their services dispensed with because of the fact that the engineering work is not proceeding at as rapid a rate as in the past. The number of workmen dispensed <Col N="2139" /> in Cork is twenty.  There are others whose services have been dispensed in other districts.  Those are workmen who were employed in a temporary capacity and the Post Office was under no contractual obligation to retain their services.  At the same time I might say that it is with reluctance we found ourselves obliged to dispense with the services of workmen who had given satisfactory service.  The position in regard to Cork area was that those men were employed in the area up to the end of 1927.  At the end of that year, when the work they were employed on had sufficiently advanced, it was thought that it would be necessary to dispense with the services of many of them.  Development works were commenced in the west and north-west, and it was found possible to employ these twenty men in these areas for about twelve months.  On the return of the men to Cork there was sufficient work to keep them going until March, 1929, and their employment in most instances would have continued were it not for the fact that the original programme of work marked out was reduced to a considerable extent.  I have here a copy of a circular issued by the engineer-in-chief to his various district engineers in connection with the dismissal of those men, and the circular itself shows that the instructions are that the dismissals should take place in such a way as to cause the least possible hardship to the men dismissed.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the method of dismissal is that the most junior workmen and the workmen most recently employed would be the first to go.  That is the system which the engineer-in-chief recommends to be carried out.  He also recommends that consideration be given to the domestic and family conditions of the various employees who are losing their jobs.  Consideration has been given to such cases.  The only concession I can personally offer to make to the Deputy is that if there are cases of extreme hardship, in regard to the domestic conditions of such <Col N="2140" /> men, I will personally consider such cases if representations are made to me although I cannot guarantee that in any particular case the men will be re-employed.</P>
    <P>Considerable comment has taken place in regard to the manner in which this Vote was placed before the House.  Several Deputies referred to the fact that figures were given to them which there was no possibility of understanding or assimilating in the time at their disposal. I want to say that on a Vote dealing with a Department of this kind, involving so many activities and dealing largely with matters of pounds, shillings and pence, and with matters which must be referred to in great numbers, without embarking on an explanation involving a great many statistics, the practice has been to give these statistics.  I have to a considerable extent adopted that practice and in certain cases elaborated on that practice.  However, one aspect of the debate last night made it clear to me that it is possible to get a grasp of the figures even if one has not access to the figures before they are given to the Dáil.  That was the criticism of the Vote and of the Department made by Deputy Lemass.  I want to say that I appreciate the manner in which Deputy Lemass approached the activities of this Department and the manner in which he analysed and criticised the figures placed at his disposal.  I do not agree with the conclusions he arrived at, but I do say at least that he made a reasonable case from his point of view, and that he did not, to any considerable extent, exaggerate the argument which he was making in order to arrive at the particular conclusion at which he was aiming.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, in replying to the case made by Deputy Lemass, again to embark on an explanation of the figures which I have given to the House and the figures which he gave in reply.  I believe that a debate of this kind is not the proper place in which to develop a cross argument between the Opposition and these benches on the various <Col N="2141" /> statisties, because, as the Deputy said, figures can be made to prove anything.  Doubtless Deputy Lemass and I could speak on these figures for hours without convincing the Dáil one way or another as to which of us had made the best case.  I am, of course, aware of the fact that by giving so many statistical statements and figures on public matters concerned with the activities of this Department I am leaving myself open to attack, and that I am providing the Opposition with ammunition to be used on this occasion, and on future occasions, but at the same time I believe that the figures which were given can be relied upon.  I am so satisfied as to their genuineness and accuracy and the deductions I have arrived at with regard to them that I am taking that risk.  Deputy Lemass's examination of this Vote, and the method by which he tried to show that if his advice was followed, the deficit which at present exists in the Post Office might be reduced or made to disappear altogether made me realise that Deputy Lemass has given a considerable amount of consideration to this Vote.  I flatter myself that amongst his other numerous activities in the shadow Cabinet of the Opposition the Deputy must be contemplating at some future time his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Whether he intends to amalgamate that with some more important Ministry I cannot say.  In any case, I felt he honoured me by indicating that he has some view of that kind in mind.</P>
    <P>The Deputy endeavoured to show that in his opinion the present deficit on the Post Office could be made up in certain simple ways which he pointed out.  Leaving aside for a moment the question of the telegraph charges, I shall deal with some of the other points he made.  These changes appear much simpler to one who has not the inside knowledge which one gets from being conversant with the working of the Department. He refers to the statement of gains and losses on the postal branch, which was furnished in the past to Deputies, and which <Col N="2142" /> was furnished to Deputy Lemass by request.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we did not furnish the Dáil on this occasion with these figures because, as a result of examination by a Departmental Committee, the Committee stated that they were not satisfied that these figures are such as can be fully relied upon. When I say that what I mean is that these figures are based on a fairly exact system of accounting, which consists of computing the amount of time, etc., devoted to various activities on a unit basis.  Taking it from an accounting point of view, it is probable that the apportionment of the various gains and losses on the postal service is correct.  But although we recognise that from an accounting point of view it is correct, if we take, for instance, the particular item of registered correspondence mentioned by the Deputy, upon which a loss of £145,000 is shown, which undoubtedly is an accounting loss, by simply wiping out the registered correspondence service, we are satisfied no saving of that kind would occur.  We are satisfied that the saving which would accrue would be comparatively small.</P>
    <P>The same explanation applies to all these losing services.  They are so interlaced and connected with the general activities of the Post Office staff that the lopping off of them would not cause a reduction of expenditure to anything like the amount of the loss in regard to each particular service&mdash;in fact, the reduction would be only a very small proportion of each particular loss. But, if you view it from the point of view that, instead of abolishing these services, you should increase the charges, again we are satisfied that in these cases the increased charge would not have the effect of bringing in increased revenue to the extent of the increased charges, because the services would suffer to such an extent that the revenue would fall and the loss would still continue to exist.  As I am dealing with that point, I might as well deal with the comparison which will be made with the telegraph service.  In <Col N="2143" /> connection with the telegraph service the people have an alternative service at their disposal to a very large extent in the telephone service. But if you wipe out various activities of the Post Office on the postal side, for instance, you do not offer any alternative to take their place.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to enter on a discussion with regard to the effect of the increased charge on telegrams. All I can say is that I have made my case.  I was obliged to make it at considerable length, because it could not be made otherwise.  My case will appear in the Official Report and so will that of Deputy Lemass, and it will be for Deputies, who have any doubt about which case has been best made, to decide which of us has justified the case which he was making.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later.  Deputy Lemass dealt with the increase of the cost of the administrative side of the Post Office since it has been taken over by the Free State and gave figures to prove the increase which he maintains has taken place in the cost of the administrative side and in the number of the staff employed.  I do not intend to follow the Deputy into those figures, but only to make a short general explanation of the situation. The same point arose last year, and I pointed out that if the estimates were examined carefully it would be seen that the amount devoted to temporary staff has decreased very much and, in fact, has almost disappeared, whereas the permanent and established staff has, I believe, increased&mdash;I am not sure of the exact figure.  It is obvious that when the Free State Government took over the Post Office they had to build up the administrative machine at headquarters almost altogether.  There was practically no headquarters machine under the British regime.  It was merely an agency service and most of the headquarters work was done in London. Therefore, we had to build up the <Col N="2144" /> administrative machine.  Naturally, it took some time before we were prepared to make permanent and established appointments.  Practically the whole of the headquarters administrative side has now been placed on an established basis and we do not contemplate any considerable increase.  It is further a fact that economies cannot be effected in the administrative work in the same way as in the work of the Post Office throughout the country. In fact, it would be unwise economy on the administrative side, and might very well result in a greater loss than would accure by keeping the administrative side up to the number necessary to keep a proper check and record of the work done in the country.  Also, since the taking over of the Post Office by the Free State the administrative work has increased to a very considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass dealt with the printed papers coming into the country and suggested that something might be done in regard to readjusting the charges in this direction which would help to reduce in part, the deficit on the Post Office. As I pointed out yesterday, the postal traffic in regard to newspapers and other matters, with the exception of parcels, is governed by an international convention, and if we were to increase the internal charges for newspapers posted in this country, which we have the right to do, we could not affect the fact that countries outside could have their papers posted at the rate existing in these outside countries, with the result that we would help to flood this country with papers posted in outside countries.  I think he suggested a delivery tax as an alternative to that.  It would be quite impossible, as a matter of administrative working, to impose a tax to be collected on the papers delivered.  Deputy Cassidy and Deputy Carney and Deputy Davin made certain other points and perhaps I can answer these in one statement.  Deputy Cassidy dealt with the staff at Lifford Post Office.  His statement of the fact is approximately correct and <Col N="2145" /> not entirely unknown to me.  I happened to visit Lifford and the temporary post office there on the occasion of a tour I made through the northern part of the country, and I saw the conditions that prevailed there.  The fact is that the staff in the Lifford Post Office if not altogether temporary is to a large extent temporary&mdash;and it is not within my power to have a temporary staff placed upon established basis.  A staff of a post office can be placed upon established basis now, only through the Civil Service Commission. It is our intention to endeavour to provide those temporary post office officials who render satisfactory work, with temporary employment as long as we can give it to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if, when the new Post Office is erected at Lifford, the Parliamentary Secretary will see that the people who have rendered very good service will be continued in employment even if it is of a temporary nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot undertake more than I have said, but we will give sympathetic consideration to claims of that kind as long as we can be economically justified in giving it.  Deputy Carney dealt with another matter which is one that I am rather reluctant to enter upon because it dealt with the appointment of an established officer to the Postmastership in Lifford.  The only answer I can make is that I am not aware whether the officer in question has a knowledge of Irish or not, perhaps he has not, but in my opinion it is not necessary for the carrying out of his duties at Lifford that he should have a knowledge of Irish.  We are satisfied that in appointing him we appointed a thoroughly efficient man and a man worthy of getting the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection of appointments Deputy Davin raised the point that certain members of the staff were dissatisfied with the method of promotion.  As I pointed out in my statement, naturally promotion in a department of this kind, where the great bulk of the men employed <Col N="2146" /> are not doing very highly paid duties and where the number of higher appointments are comparatively few, must naturally be slow. Answering for the time I have been responsible for the administration of the Department, I can say this, that I have taken particular pains to see that promotion is based, and will absolutely be based on the question of merit and the other essential qualifications, but principally seniority and merit, and that any servant of the Post Office who is in line for promotion will secure an absolutely square deal and no influence of any kind will be allowed to be brought to bear upon me, or upon the officials of my Department, to promote an official in any way otherwise than because of efficient service and because of seniority on the list.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy referred to the effect of the increased charge of sixpence on telegrams in the Border counties, and pointed out that people go across the Border and send their telegrams at the lower rate.  That is a thing we cannot check; it must go on if people want to do it, but I would point out incidentally in that connection that the question of the increasing loss in telegrams is not a question confined alone to the Free State.  It is a question they were also confronted with in England.  In England the Government thought fit to have an inquiry into it by a special Commission, and that Commission recommended an increase in telegrams which would mean a greater minimum charge than the charge imposed by us.  We had the courage to carry into effect our ideas with regard to the increased charge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy dealt with the same points raised by Deputy Anthony, but I do not propose to enter into them again.  Deputy Kennedy referred to the policy of the Department in regard to the appointment of ex-National Army men.  The position of the Post Office Department in that regard is presumably the same as other Departments.  We are acting under the Executive Council regulations, and the line of policy that we should follow in the future is not one for me but one to <Col N="2147" /> be decided by the Executive Council. As a matter of fact, certain modifications have been made in recent times, particularly in regard to temporary employment given at Christmas. Although first preference is given to ex-National Army men, second preference is given to non-Army men with families.  That is, a non-Army man with a family gets preference before an ex-National Army man without a family.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin raised the point of the cost of delegates to the postal convention at present sitting in London, and suggested that we might effect a considerable saving by sending only one delegate instead of three.  The fact is we are free to send as many delegates as we wish, but I want to point out that one delegate would be quite insufficient.  At a Convention like that one of the first things is the appointment of numerous sub-committees to consider various matters on the agenda and make recommendations to the main Conference, and even three representatives will hardly give us sufficient number to be represented on the various sub-committees upon which we would require representation if our interests were to be properly guarded.</P>
    <P>I further want to point out that the decisions arrived at by conferences of this kind may have a certain effect, considerable or otherwise, on the finances of this Department, and the saving which would be effected by sending only one delegate might be considerably offset by the loss which would accrue by the neglect of our interests in not being represented on the committees in the way in which we should be represented.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies dealt with the question of interference with letters passing through the post, the insinuation being, if the actual statement was not made, that the Post Office Department acts in the capacity of a censor of letters.  That is not so.  I have stated several times in answer to questions in this House that the Post Office does not perform <Col N="2148" /> in any way the function of a censor. The Post Office officials will not interfere with any correspondence passing through unless acting on a warrant furnished by the Minister for Justice.  As a matter of fact the actual number of letters retained and passed on to the Ministry of Justice in that connection are very few indeed and generally deal with suspected criminal cases or cases where the Lottery Acts are attempted to be infringed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, would the Parliamentary Secretary state upon whom the responsibility rests for the ultimate delivery of those letters, whether they are to be returned or not by the Ministry of Justice or police officers to the Post Office people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not information on that particular point at the moment and therefore any answer I give on the matter may not be exact.  My impression is that letters are passed on to the Department of Justice and that when the Minister for Justice has made the examination that is necessary the letters are passed on to us for delivery with, I think, an appropriate tag on them to show that they have been examined.  On that particular point I am not sure, but I am prepared to get exact information at a later stage if the Deputy cares to have it.  Anyhow, the number of letters examined are comparatively few.  There is no such thing, as Deputy Fahy suggested, as a black list.  We deal with the list current at the time being.  We have certain names given to us with regard to correspondence being intercepted. We deal with the letters on names, and when the Ministry of Justice is satisfied we are told that we need not intercept any further correspondence. It is altogether a matter for the Department of Justice and not for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Parliamentary Secretary think that public confidence in the Post Office would be much stronger if this practice were discontinued?  Does he not <Col N="2149" /> think that letters entrusted to the Post Office for delivery do not become the property of the Post Office and that therefore any interference is unwarranted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question would the Parliamentary Secretary quote the authority under which the Minister for Justice is acting in forcing the Post Office people to hand over those letters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quote it, but I am sure that there is proper statutory authority for doing it.  No doubt Deputy Lemass is aware that it is the universal practice in the interests of Justice that letters are intercepted.  It applies to all postal services in the world, and to a greater extent to other countries than this.  I do not like to embark on an explanation without having exact information, but I think that in other countries, particularly the United States, it will be found that interference with letters passing through the post applies to a considerable extent more than here. Interference here prevails only to a slight extent.  It is almost negligible, I might say, dealing altogether with criminal offences, and altogether of a non-political nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin was anxious to get some information as to the cost of setting up telephones in the various places.  Yesterday I said I was not able to give him the information.  I spoke without giving the matter very much consideration at the time.  It must be obvious to the Deputy that the cost of setting up telephones must vary from place to place and depend on the different places where the telephones are set up.  I presume the Deputy was thinking of call offices or exchanges in country districts. The cost would depend on various factors; for instance, how far the exchange was from the next one which ought to serve it.  That, of course, would depend on the number of poles and wires necessary to connect the new exchange with the nearest serving exchange.  There would be other factors, but that would be the main factor, the setting <Col N="2150" /> up of poles, wires, and the necessary apparatus.  The cost varies from place to place.  Consequently, the financial feasibility of setting up a telephone in any particular district must be governed to a considerable extent by the geographical conditions together with the possibility of getting users of the telephone.  For that reason there would not be established anything in the nature of a standardised method or system in regard to the cost of setting up a telephone in any particular place.  There is, as a matter of fact, a standardised system of charging and costs, but there is a governing and overriding rule controlling us in regard to the setting up of telephones in rural districts, and that is that the Department must be satisfied that the revenue which would result from the establishment of a telephone exchange or call office in any particular district will be such that it will bear the annual charges resulting from the capital expenditure on the establishment of an exchange.  That is, we are not free to set up a telephone call office at a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I actually asked the Parliamentary Secretary, if he will look at the records, is the average cost for 73 telephones installed during the last year, so that I would get something of a reasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the information at a later stage.  I do not think, however, that an average of that kind would be of very much use to the Deputy.  If he wishes, I will furnish him with the figures at a later stage.  Deputy Davin.  I think, raised the question of wireless licences and the reporting of information regarding people who have wireless sets and aerials.  The Deputy is correct in his opinion. Postmen are asked to report cases where they see aerials and where no licences are issued.  They are under no compulsion whatever to make that report.  They are asked, if they see fit, to do so, and it is to our advantage if they do; if they do not, it is our loss.  Deputy Briscoe raised the question of the telephone annuities <Col N="2151" /> due to capital charges in the past.  I think the Deputy has not gone to the trouble of making a very exact examination of the figures and of the situation.  Possibly he had not the figures at his disposal.  Anyhow, the Deputy is puzzled by the fact that certain annuities are decreasing, while other annuities are gradually increasing on telephones. The position is that certain annuities which have fallen as a legacy to us from the time of the British régime are being paid year by year. They will end after a time.  These are reducing annuities.</P>
      <P>There are, on the other hand, annuities in regard to telephone extensions under the Telephone Capital Act, 1925.  As a telephone extension takes place we are gradually drawing upon the million pounds placed at our disposal by that Act.  Naturally, as we are increasing our indebtedness under the Telephone Capital Act we are decreasing our charges.  One side is gradually decreasing while the other side is gradually increasing.  Deputy Goulding raised an old point in regard to the status of the staff of the Waterford post office, and the pay consequent upon the status of that particular staff.  That matter has been examined and re-examined in the Post Office Department.  It has been personally examined by me, and it has been forwarded in recent times to the Department of Finance. I am now informed by the Minister for Finance that he sees no good reasons why the status of that particular office should be raised, with a consequent increase in remuneration. I think it may be taken as accepted that the Department of Finance do not see their way to sanction the raising of the status and consequent increase in remuneration of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy was worried about the fact that in telephoning between Ballina and Sligo the message had to go by a circular route over a large mileage of wires, while the direct route would be comparatively short. It happens that in that case in the direct route there is a gap.  There <Col N="2152" /> are no telephone wires there at present, and the bridging of that gap at the present time would not be justified by the resultant revenue. However, the matter is not absolutely final.  Certain developments are about to take place in the neighbourhood, and if these developments take place consideration will be given to the question of the establishment of a more direct connection between these two towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore dealt with the question of the Savings Bank and the possibility of diverting a considerable amount of Saorstát money at present invested in the British Post Office Savings Bank.  As the Deputy must realise, it is a matter which we cannot control, certainly not by legislative measures.  As a matter of fact, there is a gradual withdrawal of the money deposited in British Post Office Savings and a gradual access to our Post Office savings from that source.  In the Free State the Post Office acts as agent for the collection of money from the British Post Office, but we do not act as agents for depositing money with the British Post Office. Many people are finding it convenient to withdraw savings lodged to their credit in the British Savings Bank and deposit them in ours. Probably in the course of time the greater portion of Irish money in the British Post Office Savings Bank will be transferred here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore also referred to the matter of Savings Bank cheques. That is a matter that has been discussed many times by the Post Office administrators.  I believe on the Continent arrangements have been made in certain countries for the use of cheques on savings bank accounts. That has not been found feasible in Great Britain or here.  The main point in the argument against the introduction of such a system here and in Great Britain is the question of the banking facilities at the disposal of the average person.  They are much more ample than those at the disposal of the people on the Continnent.  However, it is a matter that has been considered by us recently, and if the Deputy cares to <Col N="2153" /> make any representations in regard to it we will give it further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned with this point, that in recent years there has been a big development on the part of the ordinary banks to get what they call thrift accounts and to encourage people who have only a few shillings or pounds to spare to invest in their banks.  I am more concerned as to whether the Parliamentary Secretary is watching that movement and is endeavouring to combat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we watch any movement in the nature of competition, but it is not our duty to take any exception to it.  Evidently it is a definite move in the right direction.  We are not similarly situated to the banks.  We are dealing purely with savings bank accounts.  If we embark on the system of paying on cheques it will involve us in a completely new departure. However, as I said, this is a matter that has been considered already, and I will have it given fresh consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehy raised a point in regard to the mail boat between Baltimore and Cape Clear.  Our position in that regard is purely deparmental. We are only concerned with the safety of the mails.  We call for tenders for the convevance of the mails to such places.  The practice is to appoint the applicant whose tender is lowest provided we are satisfied that he has the means of carrying out the contract satisfactorily.  Once we are satisfied that the boat is sufficiently seaworthy to carry the mails, we are not concerned with the carrying of passengers.  It seems possible that arrangements could be made whereby a boat that would be both seaworthy for carrying passengers as well as mails would be employed. I would be willing to enter into discussion with the Deputy to see if anything can be arranged if it would not involve us in any increased expense. The provision of transport of a more seaworthy kind would be a very useful service to the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">

      <P>I am not altogether a free agent in the matter.  Deputy Ruttledge was anxious to get information in regard to the terms of appointment of the various sub-postmasters throughout the country. As a matter of fact, the various sub-postmasters throughout the country approximate to people who take contracts to perform certain services. They are not established civil servants and are not pensionable. When a vacancy occurs a local advertisement is issued and the amount of remuneration is stated.  The remuneration is on what is called a scale payment basis, the scale being a computation of the amount of work that falls to be done in the office, and it varies from place to place according to the amount of units of work carried on in the particular office.  Although the remuneration is not by any means high, we usually receive a great many applications and we have no difficulty whatever, except in very rare instances, of securing suitable persons for carrying on the work of sub-postmasters in these various small towns.  As a matter of fact, the sub-post office in a small town is usually associated with a small shop, and people are very anxious that the post office should be attached to their shop, because it brings them custom.  We have no difficulty whatever in securing competent, reliable and honest people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are occasionally exceptions to it&mdash;there is the work of sub-postmasters in small towns.  Personally, this is a form of appointment in which I would be particularly well pleased if it were made in some other way, because it involves me in continual representations, references and applications from all classes of people all over the country.  Taking everything into account, we are <Col N="2155" /> fairly successful, and our officials are fairly competent in picking out the best men for these appointments. We get fairly competent people.  It would not be possible to carry on the work of the Post Office in this country were it not for the fact that we are able to get the services of sub-postmasters at a comparatively low rate of remuneration.  If they had to be paid at the rate at which civil servants are paid the expenditure on the Post Office would increase to an enormous amount.</P>

      <P>The practice has been when a Deputy puts down an amendment that the estimate and the amendment would be discussed together, and when the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for it has replied that the decision is taken on the amendment, and that the Vote would then be put without further discussion.

      <P>The position under the Standing Orders is that a Deputy may speak more than once in Committee.  The practice has been that the amendment and the motion are discussed together. If the Deputy insists as an absolute right, and is prepared in order to exercise that right to break a practice which has grown up in the House, then I certainly am not going to prevent the Deputy from getting what he is entitled to get under the Standing Orders.  I have pointed out what the practice in the House has been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to break that practice.  I do not want to go contrary to usage and custom so far as this Vote is concerned. But if I had known that I would not be allowed to reply to the Parliamentary Secretary because of that practice, I certainly would have interjected occasionally while the Parliamentary Secretary was making his speech.  One of the few things I do not do is to interrupt a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary when he is making his speech. That is a thing I deprecate.  At the same time, the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2160" /> was interrupted several times during the course of his reply.  I refrained from interrupting him because I thought I would have a chance of analysing his remarks and because I thought I would be able to deal with the cases I was interested in, the cases of a number of people discharged from the engineering branch of the Post Office in Cork.  I also wanted to refer to certain statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not want to infringe on usage and custom, and I do not want to disturb what has come to be regarded as a practice.  I want to register my protest and I suggest that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could usefully consider this whole question of the rights of ordinary members of the Dáil to reply in such cases as this.  I do not want to be giving undue trouble, but this is one thing that the Committee might consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The full amount of the Vote for the Broadcasting Service for the current financial year is £26,510, which shows a reduction of £845 on the Vote for last year.  The receipts from licence fees amounted to £13,382 and from the import tax on wireless apparatus to £27,500 and from miscellaneous receipts £83, making gross revenue of £39,965 or, after deduction of the cost of collection, net receipts of approximately £35,969.  Total expenditure amounted approximately to £26,811, so that on the year's working there was an estimated gross surplus of £9,158.  Of this about £2,500 must be regarded as a set-off on a commercial account basis against interest on capital and provision for depreciation, leaving net estimated surplus of £6,658.  All these figures are subject to such minor alterations as may be necessary when the various accounts have been closed.  The number of licences issued during the year was 26,000, or about 9 per 1,000 of the population, showing an increase of 2,000 <Col N="2162" /> over the previous year.  Increase of licence revenue is dependent for the most part upon development of the service, but the rate of increase is not up to expectations and if receipts from licences only were credited to broadcasting the service would be run at a considerable loss. Full credit has been taken in the Financial Statement for the revenue from the Customs tax.  The return from this tax last year was more than had been anticipated, mainly because of large sales resulting from the introduction of new types of receiving apparatus.  The revenue from the Customs tax is not likely, however, to be maintained at so high a figure proportionately to the licence revenue, and it is probable that in future years revenue will keep step more or less with expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The receipts for the current year are estimated at £15,000 from licences and £21,000 from import tax, making gross receipts of £36,000, which, it is anticipated, would be balanced by total expenditure. As regards development of the service, the position is that this Department has decided that the best means of giving a satisfactory service throughout the Free State&mdash; i.e., a service which would afford reception on simple sets throughout the greater part of the country&mdash; would be by the erection of a central high power station.  Proposals accordingly have been prepared and submitted to the Minister for Finance for consideration.  The problem of the distribution of wave-lengths to European stations has been considered by several International Conferences during the past year.  The International Radio Union, which is a voluntary association of European broadcasting organisations and of which this Administration has membership. evolved after prolonged investigation a plan of redistribution of wave-lengths called the Brussels Plan and which was put into effect in January last.  Under this plan the Saorstát was allowed two exclusive wave lengths&mdash;411 metres for Dublin Station and 222 metres for Cork <Col N="2163" /> Station.  This plan was considered by an official Conference of Governments held at Prague a few weeks ago, and it has, so far as we are concerned, subject to a few minor alterations, been accepted.  This revised Brussels Plan, which will come into effect in June, gives a wave-length of 413 metres to Dublin and 225 metres to Cork.  It must be understood that on account of the overcrowding of broadcasting stations in Europe there can be no free choice of wave-length.  The distribution must be fairly made between countries having regard to all the circumstances in each case.  The Saorstát claimed and secured two exclusive wave-lengths, and from the technical point of view these are quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The range of the Dublin Station is longer on the new wave-length than on the old one, giving the same reception conditions, and any difficulties in reception experienced by individual listeners within normal range are probably due entirely to the design of the set in use or to the conditions under which it is operated.  The wave-length of the Cork Station, though rather low in the wave-band, is technically quite efficient although the range is not so great as the Dublin Station. Moreover, as the design of some sets does not permit of tuning to the low wave-length, some slight and inexpensive alterations may be necessary in some cases in order to secure the best results.  The Department cannot accept general responsibility for satisfactory reception and cannot undertake to investigate every complaint.  Several test examinations have, however, been made and improvement has been effected in all except a few cases in which the difficulties were clearly due to unsuitable apparatus.  The Department is prepared to investigate wherever the complaints indicate general difficulty in reception in any district in which, from a technical point of view, the reception should be satisfactory, but it cannot investigate isolated complaints.  In cases in which difficulty is due to <Col N="2164" /> the apparatus, manufacturers and wireless traders are, as a rule, willing to assist listeners.  The new studios in the General Post Office building were opened some months ago and the transfer from the old studio was carried out without any interruption of programmes.  There are three studios, one very large, suitable for full orchestras and other combinations, one for general purposes and one for talks.  They are equipped in the most up-to-date way and the transmissions from them show great improvement as compared with those from the old studio.  In regard to programmes, there has been an all-round improvement in the standard during the year.  The musical programmes were more ambitious than in previous years.</P>
    <P>A full Symphony Orchestra has been organised by the Musical Director and concerts given by it have been highly praised.  The support of the concerts given in public has been disappointing, but it is hoped nevertheless to continue them next season.  The very fine concerts of the Dublin Philharmonic Society and of the Waterford Musical Society have been broadcast, and there have also been very successful relays of concerts from Sligo, Galway and other provincial centres.  The Dublin Station Opera Company produced ten operas during the year.  A special event was the very successful broadcast of a complete opera from the Gaiety Theatre, but it is a matter for regret that difficulties in regard to performing rights prevent more frequent broadcasts of a similar kind.  Several of the symphony concerts given from the B.B.C. stations have also been broadcast. The Irish part of the programme has been given suitable prominence, and an event of special interest was the organisation through the Radio Union of an International Irish Programme Night on the 20th March when most of the European stations put on special Irish programmes including a short talk on Ireland.  Many broadcasts of running commentaries on football and hurling events were given, and <Col N="2165" /> these continue to be very popular.</P>
    <P>Considerable advance has been made in the production of radio plays.  A number of repertory companies have been formed and many first-class plays and sketches have been given.  Authors and producers are gradually accommodating their work to the special requirements of broadcasting, so that better results are being obtained and the listening public are showing an increasing interest in this part of the radio programmes. The scope and quality of variety programmes have also much improved.  Dublin artistes are taking up this class of work more extensively and are proving very successful in arranging and producing revues, sketches and similar turns. The broadcasting of talks is a very vexed one.  There is little doubt that the majority of listeners consider broadcasting only as a source of entertainment, but it is incumbent on any broadcasting organisation, particularly one under State control, to make use of the resources of broadcasting for educational and cultural purposes.  For that reason well-selected lectures on subjects of serious interest must form an important part of the programmes.  A fairly wide ground was covered by the Talks given in the past year, but it is proposed to give the matter special attention in the future with a view to the arrangement of a series of Talks by recognised authorities on various subjects.</P>
    <P>The problems of programme construction are very difficult.  It must be the aim of the directors to maintain a balance between the various classes of items forming the programme which shall reflect as nearly as possible the balance of public taste.  Generally speaking, individual preferences about cancel out, but it is a peculiarity of criticism that persons who dislike a particular class of item have an impression that that kind of item predominates in the programmes, so that people will write complaining that programmes are overloaded with talks, or with classical music, or with light music or with any other item, whereas examination shows that <Col N="2166" /> these items are fairly balanced. Moreover, critics when expressing their individual views always appear to believe that they are speaking for the majority of listeners.  Letters received by the directors praising programmes are far more numerous than letters of criticism, but unfortunately people rarely write to the newspapers except to express a grievance of some kind, whereas the many who are pleased seldom take the trouble to say so.  Considering the limitations in resources and material, the programmes from the Dublin Station may justly claim to bear favourable comparison generally with the programmes from stations in other countries.  Finally, the working of the Broadcasting Service has been successful from the beginning.  It has not become a burden on the general taxpayer, and it is hoped that notwithstanding any expenditure on development in the future, the Broadcasting Service will continue to be self-supporting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to oppose this Vote.  There are, however, a few items of general interest to which I would like to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. As he said, there are something like 26,000 listeners in the whole of the Saorstát.  There is no possibility under present conditions of that number being substantially increased.  Wireless broadcasting means a great deal to the people of this State.  Apart from the amusement and interest that would be obtained from intercourse with the outside world and from the reception of messages, the educational point of view has been completely lost sight of by the Department.  Education costs this country £5,000,000 a year, and yet with a very small capital outlay and a very small addition for running expenses after such capital outlay has been made, the education of the community at large could be advanced by means of broadcasting in such a way as to interest practically every person in the whole Free State area.  At the present time it is impossible to get any reception from either Cork or Dublin station in <Col N="2167" /> various parts of Ireland.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there are schools in certain areas of the Free State, the managers of which are anxious to instal wireless apparatus, but they know that under present conditions it would be useless because they would get no reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a point raised here on the last occasion when this Estimate was under discussion.  On that occasion the Parliamentary Secretary gave us to understand that practically all the plans had been completed for a central high power station, and that we might expect almost in the immediate future to hear an announcement from him with regard to the matter.  A whole year has since gone by&mdash;the Estimate was introduced on the 11th May last year&mdash; and we have heard nothing further except the same pious wish and the same pious hope expressed that we will have at some future time in the country a high power station that will serve every member of the community. I am not at all satisfied that proper steps are being taken now to push the matter forward.  I understand that the staff of the Department concerned with this particular Vote and the Advisory Board are unanimous in their recommendation to the Parliamentary Secretary that the erection of a central power station should be proceeded with immediately.  I understand that the Minister for Finance, who is also the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, received in the former capacity the appeal for a high power station, and replied as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a sympathetic way, promising to convey the matter to the Minister for Finance.  He replies to himself as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and regrets that the Minister for Finance cannot see his way to sanction expenditure for that purpose.  That is all very fine on paper.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs are one and the same.  I am satisfied from what I have heard <Col N="2168" /> that the Parliamentary Secretary is not to be blamed in this particular matter.  I believe he has not in any way impeded what should be done. It is through him, however, that we have to appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to permit the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some indication as to when we may expect something in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the estimate referred to the arrangements entered into by European countries in agreeing upon various wave-lengths.  The wave-lengths we have received up to the present for low-power stations, while allowing a slight increase in the case of Dublin, are not in any way going to make for the permanency of the reception throughout the whole area of the Free State. The Dublin wave-length would be permanent for the area which it at present serves.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what wave-length was allocated to the Free State for the high-power station? Surely to goodness in the making of arrangements for the stations we have already steps should have been taken to secure a proper wave-length for the future central power station and to see that our rights were secured in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our present wave-length of 411 metres is quite sufficient for a high-power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed then to abolish either Dublin or Cork, or both, after the high-power station has been established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to run two stations, one a high-power station and the other a low-power station, with the same wave-length in the same country with different programmes.  It was for the purpose of eliminating interference in that way that highly populated districts, from a broadcasting point of view, in European <Col N="2169" /> countries recently met.  In the Free State area to have a high-power station and a low-power station with different programmes on the same wave-length would lead to great confusion.  I take the liberty to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that matter was overlooked, or that the Ministry of Finance has no intention of permitting the erection of a central high-power station.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might satisfy me to a certain extent if he were to state what site has been decided upon.  We were told last year that a great many technical experiments had been made in order to satisfy the Department that they were going to get the best class of high-power station.  The Parliamentary Secretary also used the argument that, in view of the fact that wireless broadcasting and the instruments used therewith had not become properly stabilised, it would be bad policy to embark upon a huge expenditure for the erection of a high-power station and purchase of plant which might have to be scrapped after a very short period. Last year the Parliamentary Secretary indicated clearly that the time had been reached when such instruments and materials had become fairly stable, and when it would be fairly safe to embark on the erection of the station.  He has, however, neglected to refer to this in a definite manner, and I hope that when he replies he will give some satisfactory indication as to the proposed position of the central high-power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the fact that broadcasting would be of great service to the schools.  It is considered essential to embark upon a huge expenditure for the electrification of the country, in order to provide current to light the homes of the people and provide power for industry, but the farmer, if he were asked to choose between an electric bulb in exchange for his candle or lamp or a crystal set to receive some little entertainment during the dark winter nights, would choose the crystal set.  I have made inquiries, <Col N="2170" /> and I find that in the rural areas the introduction of receiving sets into the homes, even if they were only crystal sets, would be a great boon. Even if some of these people are not going to get light from the Shannon scheme, at least they should get that little bit of brightness in their homes.  I believe that the return in the way of licence fees and import duties on the sets would amply compensate the Department and that there would be no loss to the State.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the Board constituted to control broadcasting. I understand that the Chairman of that Board is the Secretary to the Department, and that the Secretary of the Board is the Director of broadcasting. I have nothing to say against either of these gentlemen, and I do not wish to be misunderstood, but I do say that as permanent civil servants they are, to a certain extent, in the position of having the right to sit in judgment on themselves.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might study the regulations setting up that Board to see if he could not allow the Committee, which represents the Department and outside interested bodies at each particular sitting to elect their own chairman. The position now is that if the permanent chairman is absent a member of his Department, who is not a member of the Board and has no statutory right, acts as chairman.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of that or not, but it shows the necessity of getting this Board to work on a different basis.  I do not suggest that the Board should interfere with the working of the Broadcasting Station, other than to recommend certain changes or alterations, and, in particular, to make recommendations in regard to the matter to be broadcast.</P>
    <P>As to the Director of Broadcasting, the position appears to me this way: the Director is a member of the Civil Service, and if he, for the time, were changed and somebody else put in his place he would not suffer in any way.  I am not suggesting that any person should lose his position, but I say that a change of Director would mean that we would have <Col N="2171" /> better chance of getting a complete change of programme.  I do not know whether my Party will approve of my quoting from the official organ of the Government, &ldquo;The Star,&rdquo; but I shall take the risk.  In the issue of 16th March that paper winds up an article on wireless in this way: &ldquo;The opinions of the Director are not always infallible, or disinterested, so why not consult the people at the other end?&rdquo;  I say that the Advisory Committee, which is chosen to act with the officials of the Department, might be able to have some of their recommendations accepted and put into operation if (1) the chairman was elected by the Committee themselves; (2) if the Director could be changed so as to have one person one day and another person another day, as having the same individual all the time does not allow for any real change in programme.</P>
    <P>The number of licence holders in the Free State is 26,000.  I want to show that there is evidently dissatisfaction of some kind with the broadcasting station as at present run.  On several occasions an appeal was made from the broadcasting station to listeners-in to express an opinion with regard to certain matters.  I understand that the greatest number of replies received to any appeal, no matter how urgent, did not exceed forty.  If an urgent appeal to the listeners-in by the station for the purpose of getting suggestions for a better service is only answered by 40 out of 26,000 licence holders&mdash;and we may assume that at least one-third would be listening-in to Dublin&mdash;it goes to show that there is evidently no very great hope of getting any change made under present circumstances. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that several written complaints have been made to his Department. Several matters have received attention, but the complaints themselves have never been adjusted in the sense that the person complaining has got complete satisfaction. As against that, there is a wireless organisation in Dublin that on one occasion issued an appeal to the public to turn up to a particular <Col N="2172" /> meeting, and while there were only ten or twelve members of the organisation present, the appeal was answered by over 150 people, which shows at least that they had the ear of more listeners-in than the broadcasting station itself.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are great demands for a central power station, and various reasons are given as to why it cannot be gone on with at the present time.  One of the reasons I took note of one time was that the high power station would be erected when it was possible to get power from the Shannon Scheme.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that a stand-by plant will always have to be kept in the central power station because in the event of a break-down in the power supplied by the Shannon, that stand-by power plant would come into use and you would get into touch with the whole country independently of the Shannon Scheme.  It will have to be there; it will have to be got some time, and it might as well be got sooner as later, and that should not be one of the stumbling blocks that would impede the erection of a central station.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know whether he has any recommendation from his engineering staff in regard to it, but as far as I can judge the overhead wirings of the Shannon scheme, when the power is turned on, will react in the shape of a carrying wave which will interfere with reception.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary had any information from the engineers in his Department upon that matter and will he see that some precautions are taken whereby the whole overhead wiring, particularly from Dublin to Limerick, in connection with the Shannon Scheme, is not going to act as an aerial which is considerably over a hundred feet in length and gives off a carrier wave much greater than the listeners-in with one hundred and fifty feet which is prohibited because of the interference caused by the carrying wave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2173" /> On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary gave us some information about the news.  I wonder if the position is the same to-day. Are we still broadcasting the news we are getting free and which it was agreed upon on the last occasion was more or less in the nature of propaganda? We are all aware that the news broadcasted by the English stations is only such as the British Censorship or the British Government, after condensing or receiving, allows out.  I think we should try to arrange now to get news independent of the English broadcasting stations, and I believe it is not a matter that would entail any great cost.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary on many occasions for a programme for at least half an hour and if possible for one hour during the day.  These representations were made on the one hand by those concerns that sell wireless accessories or sets.  At the present time unless they keep their business houses open until eight or nine at night it is impossible for them to demonstrate a loud speaker or a wireless receiving set by tuning in to Dublin, and while it may seem peculiar, one of the main points concerned in the purchase of a set is that people want a set that will permit them to cut out Dublin when required.  The only way that can be tested is when Dublin is in operation, and as Dublin does not operate in the afternoon except an occasional Saturday afternoon it is impossible for those traders to demonstrate their sets to prospective purchasers. One hour per day I understand would cost something like £100 or £200 a year.  You do not necessarily need to give a programme in the sense of the programmes given in the evenings. Gramophone records, as are used on Continental and English stations, would suit, and not only would that be of use at the present time in helping people who make these representations but it would be a start off towards the general idea of developing a midday programme which <Col N="2174" /> eventually could be taken advantage of by schools in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has taken steps to find out the number of users of crystal sets as distinct from those who use valve sets.  It might appear a very difficult problem at the outset, but inasmuch as it is very easy for the authorities to tell whether a person owns a male or a female dog it would be just as easy for the authorities to know whether a person was the owner of a crystal or a valve set, and instead of having a licence, as we have, which is practically a copy of the English licence, we should endeavour to have one of our own, and when a person is taking out a licence for a wireless he could very easily fill in an extra column and say whether the licence was for a valve set or a crystal set, so as to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to know how technically to distribute his programme and to get in touch with listeners-in on a proper basis and he would know how many crystal as well as valve sets he had to cater for.</P>
    <P>I am told, of course, also that there is a view by the Department that it would not suit them at the present time to erect a central high-power station because of the fact that while there is no high-power station the people in the country are bound to have a set of a rather expensive nature, a valve set.  If a central station were erected there would be the possibility of these people being able to use crystal sets and thereby the revenue derived from the import of valve sets would be eliminated and the State would have to suffer a loss.  I do not think that people generally would quarrel with the erection of a high-power station and the use consequent upon them by a great number of people of even crystal sets.  I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary will answer all the points I tried to bring to his attention, but I would like to emphasise that there is a persistent demand for a definite statement as regards the erection of a <Col N="2175" /> high-power station.  A year ago we were told it was in contemplation and that we could expect an announcement in the very near future.  That question was asked by two or three Deputies on the last occasion, and if the Parliamentary Secretary will read the Debates he will find that when the question was asked the first time he answered &ldquo;in the immediate future.&rdquo;  When it was asked the second time he answered &ldquo;in the near future,&rdquo; and when it was asked the third time he said &ldquo;in the future.&rdquo;  So I take it that according to the Parliamentary Secretary the nearer he gets to it the farther away we are from it.  I would like an approximate date as to his future so far as the high-power station is concerned and when it will be gone on with.</P>
    <P>He referred also to the capital expenditure on the installation of the stations themselves.  From the Estimate it is not quite clear that the amounts spent upon plant were charged on the capital accounts.  I would like the Secretary to state what is the actual expenditure on the existing stations.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that there was a decrease in the Estimate but there is no decrease. The fact of your having to buy a little less plant for your already erected station does not mean you made any saving, but that you ceased to make further capital expenditure. Therefore there is no decrease. There is, in fact, a slight increase. If you were to take the Parliamentary Secretary's method of calculating, the difference between expenditure in excess or expenditure in less amount under E in 1928-29, the amount spent for purchase and erection of plant, renewals, maintenance, etc., was £2,300, and this year it is proposed to spend £1,350. It is between these two figures the item of decrease comes to a great extent and brings about a saving.</P>
    <P>The Department has to be congratulated on the change they have made in the new addition, in the sense of having their studio erected <Col N="2176" /> in a different place.  It has given, I understand, great satisfaction from the point of view of broadcasting, and will, I believe, be usable even when the proposed new central station is in use.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary also if he would be prepared now to state that he himself will consider the possibility of giving the Advisory Board some powers with regard to the recommendations which they make being put into operation.  I believe that if he will agree to have this Board sit if they like to discuss programmes only, and on those occasions to permit them to elect their own chairman for the time being, then a particular difficulty will be overcome and there will be a great deal less complaints received by him from particular members of the Advisory Board, wireless organisations and the public generally.  By putting on the extra hour's programme during the day he will be doing a great service to the traders to whom, on his own admission, he owes a lot and from whom revenue is derived on the importation of wireless sets and parts. As ratepayers and people who have helped tremendously in the development of wireless in this country, they should be considered.  The cost is going to be a very small matter in comparison with this whole Vote.  I hope the Minister will give those points the same attention as the criticism offered to him on the previoue Vote which he has had under discussion, and I hope his reply will be more favourable to those who are interested in having those improvements brought about.</P>

      <P>Last year I congratulated the Parliamentary Secretary on the great improvement that had been made in the previous twelve months in the broadcasting programmes. I am afraid that I cannot say that the same rate of improvement has been maintained. I fear that interest in broadcasting in the Free State has not developed as it should, notwithstanding the fact that we have been told that 2,000 more wireless apparatus have been erected than there were last <Col N="2177" /> year.  It is not fair to criticise any Department unless you can suggest what improvements you consider could be made that would make broadcasting more popular.  I intend to suggest a few improvements which I consider would.  I believe more news concerning Irish events of importance would be appreciated. I believe, for instance, that developments in connection with the Shannon Scheme ought to be broadcasted and that the public should be given, I would go so far as to say, weekly talks in connection with this gigantic matter of importance that concerns, in my opinion, more than anything else, the future prosperity of this country.  I would say that the vast majority of people who are very much interested in it do not know very much about it.  I certainly say that that would be a matter, if it were dealt with, that every person in the country with a wireless set would listen-in to.</P>
      <P>I know that we have had news broadcasted to us with reference to the Horse Show.  I do not think we have had sufficient news.  Even I would go so far as to say that the various stands for Irish produce and Irish machinery should be gone into in detail.  I believe if that were done it would be listened-in to with very great interest by the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to music, I would like to hear more relays of opera from British and Continental stations.  I listened-in to Gilbert and Sullivan operas from Toulouse and Koenigsburg some time recently.  I will only say that they were superb. I will not say that they were a bit better than what our Irish artists broadcast.  I am sure we would all like some variety in that matter.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that.  I am sorry to see that there is a profit of £6,658, because I think there should not be a profit in a matter of this kind. You have world-wide competition in broadcasting and people can listen-in to where they please.  You should endeavour to popularise and develop Irish broadcasting.  Of course people <Col N="2178" /> can go to Daventry and other places which they can get just as easily.</P>
    <P>I would like more music from the Army and Garda bands, and particularly from the bands in the Dublin picture houses.  The orchestras in the Capitol, the Metropole and the Grafton picture houses, in my opinion, cannot be beaten.  There may not be sufficient money available for the orchestra belonging to the broadcasting people.  I think if there were a larger number of people, even though it might cost more, it would be well-spent money. I also would like to see two hours' music on Sunday afternoon, because you do not begin until 8.30 on Sunday. I would certainly ask the Parliamentary Secretary to order relays from those picture houses between 2 and 4, or, if you like, any other time.</P>
    <P>The talks on bridge which have been broadcasted from Daventry are very interesting to a large number of people.  You have, in Dublin, a considerable number of people who are second to none in the world.  Of that I have no doubt.  If you invite those people to come to the studio weekly or fortnightly, as in Daventry, there would be a great many people interested.  I know that the ladies in Dublin consider they are fit to compete with any persons in the world.  I will put that to the Parliamentary Secretary if he wants something to interest a great many people.  I am sure he would get plenty to do it free of charge.</P>
    <P>I come now to my annual grumble, and that is while Ireland is the most sporting country in the world we are the only people who exclude racing news from being broadcast. It is an extraordinary thing that we have to go to Daventry and Belfast to hear what won the Irish Derby, the Irish Grand National, the Baldoyle Derby, or the races at Punchestown, Fairyhouse, or anywhere else you wish.  Irish bred horses this year, and always, but particularly this year, have swept all before them.  They have won every single big race run in England this year.  I will read just one <Col N="2179" /> extract from an English paper in connection with it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Many comments, indeed were being made on the extraordinary series of Irish racing successes which this year has seen.  It is a remarkable fact that every big race in 1929 has, so far, been won by an Irish horse.  Elton won the Lincoln, Gregalach the Grand National, Adieu the Liverpool Cup, Parwiz the City and Suburban, First Flight the Chester Cup, Athford the Newbury Cup as well as Saturday's Jubilee, Royal Minstrel the Victoria Cup.  And both the Guineas winners, Mr. Jinks and Taj Mah, are Irish, too.</P>
    <P>We did not hear one word of that broadcasted from the Dublin Station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary, because I know he is a bit of a sport, but I would like the Broadcasting Committee to be more broadminded.  I believe they are taking a narrow view.  There are 250 stud farms in this country, 40 large and 200 small.  There are 3,000 brood mares with young stock in these stud farms, and all these winners that I have read out are closely related to them.  They are doing more every day to uplift the name of Ireland than anything else. If that news were broadcasted you certainly would, in my opinion, have a greater number of sets than you have at the present time.  It may be said that to broadcast these results would encourage gambling.  I do not believe it.  There are thousands of breeders and of small and large farmers who want to know how the stock they have produced are getting on.  I certainly am aware that the people of Limerick, Kildare. Meath, Westmeath and Kilkenny would like to hear of the great victories of the horses that are bred in <Col N="2180" /> these counties, not alone in England but all over the world.  Irish horses last year won £500,000 all over the world, but we did not hear one word of that from the Dublin Station.  I mentioned that matter before and the Parliamentary Secretary said last year that the matter was not considered since he became Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to know if it has been considered since, and if so, what the decision has been. If it is an adverse decision, I want to know the reasons for it, because we are isolated in regard to that particular matter.  As I said before, persons who may possibly take a certain view do not consult the public.  The vast majority of the people want to have the general news.  I do not suggest for a moment that all the racing news should be broadcasted.  People do not want minor news, but when Ireland has a singular success the Dublin Broadcasting Station ought to let the people of Ireland know it.  An innumerable number of people would be delighted to hear of these successes.  I hope my friend from Kilkenny, on my left, will bear me out.  As a matter of fact, he asked me a moment ago what would win the Derby.  Mr. Jinks was bred in Kilkenny and he ought to be able to tell us more about him than I could. That is all I have to say on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a high-power station is going to be erected, I presume it is going to be erected in Athlone, which was decided on before.  I believe that every town in Ireland ought to have a wireless set erected by the Urban Council at the expense of the ratepayers. It would cost very little, and it certainly would be a matter that the people would like to have and would be prepared to pay for. I have a pretty good set, and whenever there is anything important on in the way of football or music, or when there is a relay of the Grand National, a great number of people are very anxious to hear it.  I certainly throw out that suggestion, because a set would only cost £50 to erect and £5 a year to maintain.  In conclusion, I would like to say that <Col N="2181" /> I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary, because I believe he would like to remedy these matters. I want to ask him now to say whether it has been turned down or whether it is going to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>My only reason for interfering in the debate on this Estimate is to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a grievance under which a few of the workers employed at the Dublin Station are labouring.  I understand that there are four plant attendants employed at the Dublin Station and they only receive a basic wage of from 28/- to 32/- a week.  I put forward the claim on behalf of these men that this work merits a higher grading.  It is work of a highly technical character and involves responsibility. I understand that representations have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department to get increased wages or salaries for these men, but the Post Office Department claim that the work is merely routine and is not of an arduous character.  I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that in last year's Estimate these men were referred to as plant men.  There are only four of them engaged.  I notice in this year's Estimate they are referred to as skilled workmen.  I submit that it requires a certain amount of skill to perform the work that these men are engaged in.  They have been responsible for the smooth running of the Broadcasting Station, looking after the technical plant, and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the wages which these men are receiving and to get some recognition of their services.</P>

      <P>I only want to make two or three remarks which are prompted by what Deputy Briscoe stated.  I am sorry he has left. I think he is under a misapprehension, and what he said would leave those who heard him under a misapprehension. He referred to the Advisory Committee, and he seemed to indicate that the operations of that committee were cramped by the fact <Col N="2182" /> that they had a Departmental Chairman and Secretary.  I wish to say, as a member of that Committee, that, in my opinion, that is an entirely erroneous view.  It is quite true that various views have been expressed before the Committee, but on no occasion that I can remember was there any restriction on dicussion at these Committee meetings. Further, as far as I can remember, various recommendations were made after full discussion, and many of these recommendations bore fruit. In the case of those that did not bear fruit the reasons as to why they were not carried out were reported to the Committee.  I think it would be very regrettable if any wrong impression was created as to the way in which that Committee has been worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to deal in detail with the points raised by Deputy Briscoe, but I must say that I am sorry we do not seem to be appreciably nearer to our high-power station.  References have been made to the number of subscribers and it is estimated that we will have 30,000 in the coming year.  If Deputies would look back on the debates in connection with this matter that have taken place ever since the original Committee on Wireless Broadcasting sat, they would be greatly astonished at the views that were then expressed as to what the likely number of subscribers would be.  I am sure that 30,000 would be thought an absurdly optimistic figure at that time.  I agree with Deputy Briscoe that it is not likely there will be any big increase in that number.  I think, however, that it will increase.  The big increase will only come when we get our high-power station.  That station will make broadcasting widely accessible to those people throughout the country who are not able to afford big valve sets.  I believe it is in that respect that broadcasting in this country is likely to be most successful. I think it would pay us in the end to be optimistic in this matter. Even if we had to take the cost of the high-power station as something to be paid for over a number of <Col N="2183" /> years, it would be well worth undertaking the expenditure because of the good it would do the country socially, educationally and otherwise. I am sure a very large number of new licences would be taken out following the construction of the high-power station.  I am sorry we do not seem to be appreciably nearer the erection of that station than we were two years ago.  Beyond what was told us last year, when it was decided that there should be a high-power station, nothing seems to have been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to criticise the programme broadcasted from the Dublin station because of the fact that I am unable to get that station.  I complained to the Parliamentary Secretary before, and he mentioned that possibly the alteration in the wave-length would help to improve matters, but quite the contrary has happened. There are other people in the same position as I, and they have not been able to get the Dublin programme so far.  When the high-power station is erected, I hope there will be a better form of transmission. I was able to get the Dublin station before the change in the wave-length, but the reception was not at all good.  Interference was of such a nature as to spoil the musical programme.  Certain German stations are always audible.  I have been told by a person interested in wireless that the wave-length allotted to Dublin recently is too low, and that the change over to the new wave-length has not been successful in other stations also, and that the whole system will be recast after some time.  I hope that when the wave-lengths are being recast, the Parliamentary Secretary will get a better wave-length for Dublin than the present one.  When we succeed in getting the Dublin station again, I hope the transmission and reception will have considerably improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what Deputy Shaw has said. There is no doubt that people generally <Col N="2184" /> take a great interest in horse racing, particularly when Irish horses are entered.  I never had the good fortune to be able to pick a winner, so that horse racing has not a personal appeal.  The great masses of the people, however, are deeply interested.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider Deputy Shaw's suggestion that the results of big races in which Irish horses, and particularly Kilkenny horses, compete, should be broadcasted. The reception of the Dublin station, although it has been improved as far as our area is concerned, leaves a good deal still to be accomplished.  I do not think there is any way out of the difficulty other than the establishment of a high-power station.  People who are paying licences for sets are eagerly looking forward to such a station, and there is a great deal of disappointment that it has not been erected.  So far as the Dublin programmes are concerned, I believe they are as good as the programmes of many other stations and they can hold their own with any station. The music is good and the programmes generally are excellent, but the reception might be improved.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about a licence on performing rights. That is a thing that ought to be tackled in this country.  I understand there is an association in London which insists on collecting fees for royalities on music and songs, and there is no court of appeal. Seemingly they can charge what they like.  In this country we should not tolerate that.  I recognise that composers of music and songs ought to get paid for their ability, but it is an intolerable thing that a society in London can fix the fees and no one can question them.  Although the Dublin programmes are excellent, I do not think there is enough of ancient Irish music broadcasted.  I do not think I ever heard &ldquo;The Boys of Kilkenny&rdquo; broadcasted from the Dublin station.  It is an excellent old Irish song, very popular, and I have not heard it so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to endorse what has been said in regard to the broadcasting of racing results.  I am not very much of a racing man, but because horse-breeding is such a national asset I think such a course as has been suggested would be very much appreciated, particularly by people residing in the counties mentioned by Deputy Shaw and others. Racing does not appeal to us very much in my constituency; we do not go in very much for racing there; but in some of the counties mentioned, Kilkenny and so on, where the horses are fine roving blades&mdash; they proved that when they went across the Channel&mdash;I am sure the people would appreciate the results of race meetings on the wireless.</P>
      <P>The transmission from the Dublin Station is not what it should be.  It may be that the distance is too long, but nevertheless the transmission should be better.  From the scientific point of view it cannot be correct that the reception in a place like Donegal should be so faint as it is. There is also a considerable amount of interference with reception, but that will happen in the best-ordered world.  The transmission recently has been so bad that proper reception from the Dublin Broadcasting Station could not be got.  There has been some criticism of the programmes and we are told that they have not been what they might be. Certainly there has not been as much of the old music broadcasted as one would like.  Of course, I know it is not much appreciated by certain people in this country.  At the same time, the rank and file of the people who pay for licences would appreciate it very much and they should be catered for, and not the people who raise an objection because national music is broadcasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk about a high-power station.  It is not within the province of everybody to instal an expensive receiving set.  If there were a high-power station it would <Col N="2186" /> be possible for people, for from £5 to £12, to instal a set which would give proper reception.</P>
    <P>That has been talked about for a long time.  There is a big expenditure that we are expected to vote for in this Estimate, and at the same time nothing has been done towards the erection of that high-power station.  Any station on the Continent of Europe can be got more easily than the Dublin Station at the present time.  One can tune in to Berlin, Madrid or any other European city and get proper reception, but the broadcasting station in Dublin remains practically unknown. That ought not to be the case, and it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that, if he is going to have a big expenditure on broadcasting at least we will get an opportunity some time of hearing the Dublin Broadcasting Station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two remarks I would like to make on this Vote.  It seems to me that the broadcasting authorities are fighting too shy of controversial matter in the preparation of their programmes. I think that most people recognise that you cannot arouse interest in any particular thing until you have succeeded in arousing controversy about it.  There would be more interest in the matter of broadcasting from Dublin if that matter contained in it items of a controversial nature.  Some time ago the broadcasting authorities here appeared to embark upon such a programme. Certain matters which would be considered controversial were broadcasted and I know that they aroused considerable interest, but apparently that policy has been lately reversed. I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is intended to embark upon that policy again or if there has been any definite decision with regard to it?  The general remarks which one hears about the Dublin programmes are to the effect that while the standard is generally good, the items are somewhat monotonous. In other words, the same type of programme is repeated evening after evening, and even though the programmes include items that <Col N="2187" /> are worth listening to, it is the similarity of the programmes that causes dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>There is a good case to be made for the suggestion made by Deputy Shaw that such items of news as the result of a big race should be broadcasted. Personally, I do not take an interest in those matters, but I know people who do, and those who live outside the cities are anxious to get the late news about these matters, news which they cannot get in the Press, and they would be glad if the broadcasting authorities decided to give such items.  The various horses to which Deputy Shaw referred are unknown to me. He mentioned one name, a possible winner of the Derby, Mr. Jinks.  He may win that stake, though he was a non-starter in Sligo-Leitrim&mdash;he may do better outside his own country.</P>
      <P>There are other items of news which could be broadcasted also to advantage.  Having listened to some of the news items broadcasted recently they seemed to me to contain very little beyond what is contained in the evening papers.  Most of them were items that were in the evening papers.  If there is to be broadcasting at 10.30 p.m. it should include items which reach Dublin late in the evening, such items as reach Dublin too late to be inserted in the evening papers.  That very rarely happens except when there is something of a highly sensational nature.  I would like to have from the Parliamentary Secretary his views on that, and whether he would say if it is intended to rule out controversial matters altogether from the programme or whether it is intended to include those matters; if so, to what extent.  I would like if he would say whether it would be possible to extend further the news items service at present being given.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has touched on three of the most important items of criticism in connection with wireless broadcasting.  I will deal with his criticism first. With regard to the news items, we <Col N="2188" /> are aware that the news broadcasted from the Dublin Broadcasting Station is not the best possible service. As a matter of fact, we work at considerable disadvantages at the present moment in that regard.  We have in our employment a news editor who is responsible for providing the news entirely.  Negotiations and discussions have been going on for a considerable time between the various interests who would be able to supply us with a better supply of news&mdash;with a more up-to-date supply of news at the time of broadcasting. These include the various newspaper interests in Dublin, as represented by their newspaper society and, I think, various forms of Press agency. But so far we have been unable to come to a satisfactory arrangement with any of those people with regard to the supply of any of these services. Consideration was given also to the possibility of developing a much more elaborate and a much more expensive news service of our own.  Personally I am of opinion that that proposition was not feasible. The suggestion was to develop a complete service of our own, partly in opposition to the newspapers.  If we were to do this it would be a very expensive undertaking indeed.  I believe it is not possible to get a listener to listen with appreciation to a news service for a long period. You can give people five, seven or ten minutes of a news service twice in the evening.  However, the matter is being reconsidered at the moment, and personally I hope that we will be able to arrive at some satisfactory decision in the immediate future, and that we will be able to give a better service in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also accept the criticism that the programme in the Dublin Broadcasting Station is monotonous.  I quite agree with that criticism.  But Deputies must realise that in that regard we are hampered.  The variety of artistes in Ireland is not so great as it would be in London and in other cities.  However, we are constantly on the watch.  We are constantly looking out for new ideas of a broadcasting interest, and we are ready to receive suggestions <Col N="2189" /> from anybody.  In that connection I am also in agreement that controversial matters in broadcasting would be listened to with a great deal of interest.  As Deputy Lemass knows, we did embark some considerable time ago on a very controversial matter.  I do believe that a lot of listeners-in were very pleased with the debate which took place on that occasion.  One of the main speakers was the Deputy himself.  I refer to the broadcasting of the debate on fiscal matters, Protection versus Free Trade.  Every Deputy recognises in dealing with controversial matters that an undertaking that is under Government control is under a considerable disadvantage, particularly in view of the fact that almost every controversial matter in this country is really a political matter.</P>
    <P>Unless the Leader of his Party can reach an agreement with the Leader of the Government Party, the Leader of the Labour Party and the Leader of the Farmers' Party as to what may be broadcasted and as to who may speak I could not guarantee to recommend the broadcasting of political matters.  Perhaps when the next general election is in the offing we may reconsider it.</P>

      <P>I did not catch the Deputy's remark.  Deputy Briscoe in his various criticisms dealt with the question of educational broadcasting.  That matter is somewhat difficult.  In fact, it has not been fully worked out in other places where greater resources are available than here.  I understand that the B.B.C. have not arrived at a definite policy in regard to educational broadcasting.  There are a great many difficulties to be overcome. Naturally the difficulties here would be greater than in Great Britain. It is really a matter principally for the Department of Education. In so far as we are concerned, we have offered that Department <Col N="2190" /> facilities for putting on the air any matter which they desire, and we have offered them the use of the station for that purpose, but we do not think that the duty is cast on us of supplying matter for educational broadcasting to schools.  Arrangements would have to be made with the schools and for the provision of receiving sets in them.  I do not think that there are financial provisions for supplying sets to schools nor are there any arrangements by which a large number of children could listen-in for a considerable time.  It is a matter on which there is not, so far, any very definite general consensus of opinion. I may say, however, that we are prepared to do our part if other people come to a decision as to what is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost every Deputy who spoke referred to the advisability of establishing a central high-power station.  I have stated my views previously on that matter, both in the Dáil and outside, and I still hold the same views.  I think that it is practically up to the Government of the country to provide such a station.  The Department which I represent has submitted proposals to the Ministry of Finance in that connection and, so far as I am aware, the difficulty up to the present has been mainly financial.  It would be necessary to provide a considerable amount of capital, but although we believe that it would be repaid over a period of years through the increase of licences and other sources of revenue we can only estimate that such will be the case and there is no guarantee that the State would not be called upon permanently to bear portion of the cost of a high-power station.  It has not yet become an established principle that broadcasting should be subsidised by the State.  So far as our Department is concerned, we have put our proposals before the Department of Finance and we suggest to Deputies to recommend that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should confer with the Minister for Finance and try to arrive <Col N="2191" /> at a decision whether we should have a high-power station.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly well aware that if we are to meet the requirements of rural areas it will be necessary to establish a high-power station.  I also agree with Deputies who say that it is more essential that people in agricultural and rural districts should be given an opportunity of listening to wireless programmes on cheap crystal sets and that they should have educational and entertaining programmes placed at their disposal than supplying such programmes to people in cities who have many alternative means of amusement.  As I say, I believe that that should be the main function of broadcasting in this country.  Deputy Briscoe entered into a discussion on the functions and working of the advisory committee.  I do not want to enter into any deep controversy on that matter.  The Deputy has been answered in part by Deputy Thrift, who is a member of that committee.  Personally I am satisfied that the committee is serving a useful purpose.  It is, of course, only an advisory committee.  We have reason to be thankful to the various members of that committee, who have given freely the benefit of their time and intelligence in helping us to provide the best possible programmes.</P>
    <P>Certain objections have been taken to the fact that the Secretary of the Post Office acts as Chairman to that committee.  I am satisfied, as Deputy Thrift said, that he is performing his duties in that connection satisfactorily, and is giving general satisfaction to most members of the committee.  Also I understand that it is a general practice in regard to advisory committees set up to advise Government Departments that the Chairman should be an official.  From many points of view I think that that is the correct course to follow.  You must have continuity in regard to the chairmanship, and you must have the official point of view maintained right through the proceedings. I am rather afraid that a <Col N="2192" /> great deal of the criticism directed against the advisory committee has been inspired by motives which are not altogether meant to be for the advantage of the broadcasting undertaking.  I cannot say what the motives are, but there seems to be in certain quarters a certain type of pin-pricking and non-constructive criticism.  I doubt whether those behind it are really anxious for the welfare and development of the Dublin Broadcasting Station.  I hope I am misjudging them, but I am rather doubtful, considering the continual form of criticism that has come from certain quarters, which are also responsible for the criticisms of the work of the advisory committee.  Deputy Briscoe also referred to the suggestion about changing the Director of Broadcasting. Evidently he had in view the idea that the changing of the Director would mean more satisfactory programmes.  I am not at all agreeing with that suggestion.  I believe that the existing Director is performing his difficult duties satisfactorily, and I have no reason to think that changing the Director for some other person would result in more satisfactory programmes being broadcasted from the Dublin station.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made some comments in regard to interference by the Shannon Scheme.  There is no doubt that the Shannon Scheme, when it is in working order, will interfere with wireless broadcasting to a certain extent, but to what extent I am not in a position to say.  I might as well acknowledge that I yield to no man in my ignorance in regard to the technical side of broadcasting. It will interfere, I admit, to a certain extent; but what can be done?  Is Deputy Briscoe prepared to suggest that we ought not to carry out the Shannon Scheme in order that people will have a better reception?  It seems that there is no technical process existing which will prevent interference or improve reception in certain instances.  If the Deputy has any simple means whereby interference will be prevented perhaps he will be able to meet me, but I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> Various Deputies have referred to the fact that in certain parts of the country reception has proved very unsatisfactory.  Deputy Goulding referred to some blind spots.  That, again, is a technical matter.  It is a fact that the science of wireless broadcasting is not a fixed science so far, and that there are many factors which are not yet understood or the reasons for which are not properly known yet.  There are certain blind spots in various parts of the country.  It is difficult to tell what is the reason at the moment, but the science of wireless broadcasting is improving from day to day, and the reasons for these blind spots may be discovered and a remedy found in the course of time.  One of the curious facts in that connection is that people from far away write to us telling us that they get a very satisfactory reception.  We get letters from the coast of Wales and from the Orkney and Shetland Islands expressing approval of the reception and of the programme, especially contributions by the Ceilidhe Trio. These people in far-away parts seem to appreciate Irish national music much more than people at home. Deputy Briscoe also referred to the suggestion that programmes should be put on at certain hours during the day so as to give traders in wireless instruments an opportunity of demonstrating their sets.  This suggestion was put to me by one of the trade members of the organisation. I informed him that we would give the matter consideration to see if it could be done.  It will largely depend upon the expense involved.  I do not think that the amount suggested by the Deputy, £300, would cover the expense.  However, it is being considered and a decision will be arrived at shortly.  The Deputy suggested something about getting information as to the numbers of crystal and valve sets by means of supplying space on the wireless licence form for the purpose.  That seems quite a reasonable suggestion, and I will look into the matter and see if it could easily be carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also wanted some information in regard to capital expenditure <Col N="2194" /> on the broadcasting service. The Deputy will probably notice if he looks back over the the accounts since the inception of the broadcasting undertaking that capital expenditure has been met out of the Vote from year to year and that the revenue in effect has paid capital expenditure so far.  The various amounts expended of a capital nature since the establishment of broadcasting are as follows&mdash;they also include renewals and maintenance expenditure, so that they are not strictly of a capital nature:&mdash; In 1925-26, £63,066: in 1926-27, £62,023; in 1927-28, £68,011.  I think these three years cover the main expenditure. The total is £193,100, but for accounting purposes it is regarded as capital expenditure, as it is paid out of the Vote from year to year.  Deputy Shaw, I think, referred to the programme and suggested improvements, particularly in regard to broadcasting matters such as Horse Show events and more operatic music from the Continent. The Deputy's suggestion will receive careful consideration.  As regards the suggestion in reference to the broadcasting of the results of horse races.  I want to say that we did relay a running commentary on the Derby.  It seems to me possible that similar commentaries on important races, or even the results of important races, might be broadcasted. The question of a general broadcast of results of racing is a matter on which I am not prepared to give any definite opinion at the moment. I think it would hardly be a generally acceptable policy that a State wireless broadcasting undertaking should broadcast racing results to the extent of stimulating betting, so that those who have now to wait for their morning or evening papers to know the results of races run in England would have the knowledge provided for them by the broadcasting institution.  However, it can be, and will be again considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy referred to the pay of skilled workmen&mdash;a wage of 28/- to 42/- for our skilled workmen at the station.  That is a matter that has not been brought to my notice <Col N="2195" /> before.  I cannot give any information on the merits of the case now, but I will look into it and give the Deputy the information at a later date.  Deputy Goulding referred to the difficulty of reception in his district, and he suggested that there should be a change in wave-length. I am afraid that Deputy Goulding's district must also be one of the blind spots, and I do not know that a change in wave-length would have any effect in improving reception. We are satisfied that the present medium wave-length, as it is technically called, is generally satisfactory, and I think we were fairly lucky in getting that wave-length.  I understand that since we changed over to the present wave-length reception has been better than previous to the adoption of that wave-length. In that connection I might mention, in reply to the statement of Deputy Briscoe, that we are satisfied that the present medium wave-length that has been allotted to us will be quite satisfactory for the high-power station.  I believe we are also satisfied, if the policy should be to have a high-power station in addition to maintaining a station both in Dublin and Cork or a station in Dublin or Cork, that the wave-length will be satisfactory, and can be used to give satisfaction.  I cannot explain the technical reasons, but I am so advised.  Deputy Carney dealt with the question of poor transmission, the reasons for which I have already explained.  Deputy de Loughrey had a grievance because of the fact that traditional airs from Kilkenny were not broadcasted.  We have been broadcasting a great deal of traditional Irish music, and on the next occasion I shall take pains to see that the Kilkenny boys will not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>So far as this particular Vote is concerned, as <Col N="2197" /> regards attacks on policy, I shall wait to hear them developed.  There is nothing very remarkable or outstanding to which it is necessary to call attention since the Estimate last came before the House.  The staff provided in Sub-head A constitutes the headquarters staff of the Department. The salaries and expenses of the former headquarters staff of the Prisons Board and the headquarters staff of the District Courts are being transferred to this Vote. Taking these transfers into account, there is a net decrease of £1,610 in the Vote as compared with last year. Ministerial control over all the various services, including police, prisons, court officers, and so on, is exercised through this staff.  The District Court Branch, which is shown separately, controls the work of District Court clerks throughout the country and checks receipts and disposes of all fines paid in the District Court, the Circuit Court, and the High Court.  The Accounts Branch, which is also shown separately in the Estimate, is responsible for the payment of salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána, the prisons, the District and Circuit Court staff throughout the country, the Land Registry, the Registry of Deeds and the High Court of Justice. All accounts connected with the activities of the Department are dealt with by this branch.  The only staff provided for outside Dublin is the Immigration Officer at Cobh.  A fulltime officer is required there to carry out the provisions of the Aliens Restriction Act, and he is assisted by a part-time assistant, who is paid an inclusive salary of £100 per annum in addition to his salary as District Court clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head AA is devoted entirely to the film censorship.  The total cost of film censorship is not shown in this sub-head.  It will be observed from the footnote on page 107 that sums of £10 and £20 are included for this service in Sub-heads C and D, and that a sum of £530 is included in other Votes.  This service is, in fact, self-supporting.  It will be observed from the footnote on page 105 that <Col N="2198" /> the receipts from fees charged for film censorship are estimated to amount to £2,450.  These fees are collected by means of stamps and the cash proceeds of these stamps reach the Exchequer in the form of revenue.</P>

      <P>On the question of the two Votes, the difficulty of deciding what may be discussed on the Vote of the Office of a particular Minister, as distinct from a large service which the Minister controls, such as the Gárda Síochána in this case, is an old one.  The concern of the Chair is merely this: that when we have decided upon the amendment to Vote 31 we should not, on the amendment to Vote 32, or on Vote 32 itself, begin again a discussion which had been previously closed and decided.  If that can be established, that is the only concern the Chair has in the matter. With regard to Vote 31, which is now being discussed, and the amendment in the name of Deputy Ruttledge, I think it is quite clear that on that we should not have details of administration raised, but, as far as possible, only questions of general policy, because otherwise we would be continuing on the next Vote to discuss the same question again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.&rdquo;  The Minister, in introducing the Vote, pointed out that there is not much difference between this and last year's Estimate. That is obvious from the Estimate itself.  The original Estimate for 1928-29 was £28,859, and the transfers from the Prison Vote and from the District Court Vote brings it up to £40,479.  This year there is an estimate of £38,869, leaving a saving or a decrease, at any rate, of £1,610. It is quite evident from that, at any rate, that the axe has not fallen, and that no attempt has been made to reduce the Estimate.  Last year, when we were asked for an alternative and how we would secure economics, we suggested that committees might be set up of representatives from various parts of the House who would investigate and go into these <Col N="2199" /> matters.  That suggestion was put aside and we see the result in this Estimate.  We believe that economies can be effected in this Department, as in others, and that much more substantial savings could be shown in this Estimate than have been shown.  There was, I believe, during the year some re-arrangement of the Prisons Board.  One would have expected that that would have effected some substantial reduction, but that is not apparent on this Vote.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Estimate, as the Minister is not inclined to make some reduction and effect more economies, we must turn our attention to the attitude of the Minister and his Department in dealing with this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister asked for this Vote last year many matters have arisen which have been raised in the House that intimately affected his Department and that concerned very vitally many of the citizens of this country.  The attitude invariably taken up by the Minister and his Department is that certain members of this House or a certain Party in this House are to be treated with contumely, are not to be given any information or any particulars with regard to certain things that vitally affect the interests of the citizens of this State.  From time to time we have raised matters in the form of questions or on the adjournment where the citizens of this country had been attacked and assaulted and as we say illegally imprisoned, and we were very lucky if we got more than the House of Commons formula &ldquo;the answer is in the negative.&rdquo;  We have raised here, from time to time, certain acts committed by the Gárda in regard to individuals in the country.  One of the last cases mentioned here was one in which we tried to provide against previous answers of the Minister in which he always tries to scout the facts.  Whenever we made any suggestion whatever against that hallowed body the Gárda, he seemed to think that it was impossible that any member of any such body could ever run riot <Col N="2200" /> or act otherwise than as everybody would desire.  In the particular case raised in this House by Deputy Hogan by way of question, and afterwards by Deputy de Valera on the adjournment, affidavits, particulars of which were furnished to the Minister for Justice, disclosed that certain citizens had been brutally assaulted at night.  These particulars were furnished to the Minister and were discussed in this House, yet he would not give an inquiry. He had a pretty good reason for not giving an inquiry.  The reasons were that his Department, whether he was aware of it or not, were satisfied that any inquiry into this matter would show up pretty badly against individual members of the Gárda concerned.</P>
    <P>Several other cases have been raised and mentioned here where citizens have been assaulted and attacked and the Minister has persistently refused to have any inquiry or investigation into them.  The one answer we get from the Minister for Justice is: &ldquo;Why not take the case into the ordinary court of law.&rdquo;  The Minister has plenty of experience of the courts and he knows the difficulty that arises in regard to these matters.  He knows perfectly well many individuals are not in a position to take their case into the courts, especially if they know the individuals on the other side have the Department of Justice behind them to pay all their expenses and defend them.  That is the attitude taken up by the Department of Justice.  When there is a case made against a criminal member of the Gárda you have the Department standing up for him and paying his expenses.  Yet the Minister wants an humble individual in the country to fight not only an individual in the Gárda but the whole Department of Justice.  Does he think that is equitable, or that the matter should be dealt with in that way by the Department of Justice? If that were to be the general rule the Department should be known, not as a Department of Justice, but as a Department of Injustice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2201" /> We have challenged the Minister time after time, bringing forward charges here and cases to have them investigated.  He has refused and denied that investigation for the reason I say, that he knows perfectly well, or his Department does, that these matters could not stand the light of fair and impartial investigation. You had certain people assaulted and Guards decreed and fined for that.  Of course the Department stepped in, worked up appeals for them, provided the expenses from one court to another, so that they might eventually succeed in defeating justice by putting the unfortunate people bringing these charges against the Gárda in a position of not being able to stand up against such a big array of counsel and providing counsel themselves to conduct matters for them.  You have similar action when charges were made against them as individual members of the Gárda; when they are fined or decreed we do not even then hear of an investigation.  We know at any rate that these people are not suspended from the service of the Gárda while the stain of their conviction is hanging over them and while it has not been reversed by some higher court.  One would have expected that the attitude of any Department with any sense of justice would be, when a criminal in its ranks was convicted by its own court, and convicted by the juries which it is now planning to do away with, that in such circumstances, pending the completion of the proceedings at the last appeal, this criminal would be suspended from service at any rate.  That has not been done.</P>
    <P>So far as we know or have been able to ascertain, many arrests have been made lately where no warrants were produced.  In the last three or four months wholesale arrests without warrants have been resorted to. When we asked for particulars as to the numbers of persons in prison and the numbers of persons arrested in certain specified periods, the reply the Minister gave us was that the answer was in the negative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2202" /> From time to time we were told that it would not be in the public interest to disclose that information. When the Juries Bill was being introduced a few days ago when the Government was trying to make or bolster up a possible case for it, every information that could possibly be disclosed to the House, every little dovetailing of tit-bits of evidence that might connect certain citizens were used.  There was no question then of holding back information in the public interest.  In the course of time, it turns out, when the Minister says a thing is not in the public interest, that there was nothing that need be kept quiet or that could not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>It is a very simple matter to get up in this House and say it is not in the public interest to disclose it.  It is a very simple method of defence for the Minister to adopt but it is a method that I say is not based on the facts of the situation.  It is not a method that is even soundly based on the vague suspicions of the Minister. It is a method that is adopted for certain political purposes and all that has happened in this country within the last three months, from the beginning of the bye-election in North Dublin to another bye-election that is now on hands, all the tactics of the Minister's Department and the Minister for Justice has been directed for purely miserable political ends.  We had, during the last bye-election in Dublin, wild and vague statements made about sewer rats and that kind of thing and about the foul conspiracy on foot to overthrow the State.  That has been discussed on another matter, the Jury Bill, that has come up here.  I do not want to go into it in detail now.  Everything was resorted to. The tactics of the Department in introducing this Juries Bill, and the tactics that have been adopted with regard to the various organisations in this country and against certain individuals in this country are all directed, hand and word, purely for the purpose of creating a panic in the country so that the people will think that the strong people that <Col N="2203" /> they represented themselves so long to be, and to some extent successfully, will cajole the people into supporting certain deeds and will try to fool the people, when all ordinary honest methods of appeal fail, into adopting a certain attitude.</P>
    <P>If no other methods can succeed, resort to them.  No reason, except that it is not in the public interest to make disclosure, has been given for wholesale arrests.  We are told that there are very good grounds for the arrests.  Has the Minister ever come to this House and given particulars in regard to any single individual who was arrested during the last three or four months?  Has he given any particulars of the offence, so that the House could be satisfied that there is a charge well founded, or even suspiciously founded, on which these people could be imprisoned? The method of harassing was adopted and of trying to frighten the people.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Minister referring here, quite casually, to an extra emigration agent at Cobh.  That was part of the tactics, to try to drive a certain section of the people out of the country.  You may give employment to an extra emigration agent. It does not matter if you succeed at any rate in driving certain people out of the State.  There are certain organisations in this country which the Department is very careful to keep their eyes shut on.  There was an organisation in this State mentioned in whispers twelve months ago.  I refer to the British Fascisti. They are a very definite and strong organisation to-day.  The streets of Dublin are littered with their propaganda appealing to the people about their king.  Their meetings are held in private.  Their organisation is being strengthened and worked up, but there is no danger that their offices will be raided or any inquiry made as to the particular persons who constitute it.  You have the same policy with regard to the Baden Powell Scouts.  They are allowed to drill, march, and so on, whereas the Fianna organisation, which teaches history to the young boys and tries to give them a <Col N="2204" /> national culture, is being suppressed and its members harried and imprisoned by the Department of Justice. One can move freely around because they have certain ideals, shall I call it; the other, because they visualise a real Ireland, are to be harassed and persecuted.</P>

      <P>When we contrast the attitude with regard to those different organisations it is very clearly forced upon us what the policy of the Department of Justice is.  When we find the Minister in the position that he refuses to disclose the grounds for the action he has taken in regard to certain individuals in this House is this House to be satisfied that these suspicions are well grounded?  We heard plenty of wild statements during the North Dublin elections and I am quite sure we will have an overdose of them in the forthcoming by-election telling the people what desperate efforts were being made to uproot the State.  But to get the Department down to hard facts what exactly are their suspicions, why not charge the people they arrest?  Their Civic Guard force, which we hear the Minister praise as if they could grapple with the situation and place their hands on the criminal&mdash;according to the President's statement to an American newspaper the thing is practically finished&mdash;if they are able to deal with that situation why try to confuse this House into believing that there is a serious attempt being made to uproot the State, as they say, and bring the people to a realisation that unless they stand hard and fast by Cumann na nGaedheal we are going to have war, immediate and terrible, throughout the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the policy pursued so far within the last week or so as to arrest people for making speeches. The Department of Justice got a magnifying glass for something that was said and tried to exaggerate it into a charge.  Of course that may be necessary, other methods having failed.  Having been unable to force <Col N="2205" /> certain people by harassing them or aggravating them into doing something, they must fall back on arresting people for making certain speeches which the Ministry think are of a highly seditious character. Of course, that speech, if those people were not dealt with, would overthrow the State.  I am quite sure that will be stated later on. One of the last things that has been done in the country, so far as I know, is to send Civic Guards from one individual to another asking them to sign a statement that they are not going to do anything to overthrow the State.  A lot of the Civic Guards going to them tried to create the idea that there was something mysterious about it.  I know a number of individuals who have been called on by Civic Guards and have been told when they refused to sign those forms, not to say anything about it.  What is the mystery or secrecy behind this attitude, or did the Department of Justice give instructions for carrying out those visits?  Does the Department intend to prosecute that policy of calling on citizens to sign a form because some clerk in the office or perhaps the Minister or somebody else thinks the people of this country should be asked to state whether or not they want to overthrow this State?</P>
    <P>The only answer to it is, it is not an attempt that was seriously considered by the Ministry as being necessary, but it is, as I say, a very useful attempt to try and inculcate a feeling of distrust, a feeling that there is a danger of something going to happen, that they were the strong men of a few years ago and when all other methods of convincing the people have failed they will resort to those.  I have a certain sympathy with the Department of Justice, to this extent that the Department of Justice has become the sewer pipe for all the filthy methods that have been resorted to for political purposes.  It has to carry out certain things that are only intended for election purposes.</P>
    <P>I do seriously say that this is a Vote that should be referred back if the Minister's attitude is to continue, <Col N="2206" /> if his policy is to be a policy of carrying on wholesale raiding and arresting at all hours of the night, without warrant or without any authority, and if he is to adopt a policy in this House of refusing to answer any questions, of treating with contumely members of this House when they raise questions. The Minister knows if anybody makes an affidavit in which there is an untruth or an inaccuracy he has a method of dealing with that individual. He knows also perfectly well that if any of the Guards in any particular area from which these affidavits emanate knew that there was an untruth in them and could prove it, they would very quickly have these individuals charged with perjury.  He also knows very well that when any of these men have been found guilty of offences they have been sheltered by the Department and he knows the reason is that they are criminals. Why is there all this fear of investigation? Why is there all this fear of an investigation when the Minister would appoint his own officials to carry it out?  Does not the Minister know perfectly well that people in the same forces who would be likely to investigate it would put no difficulties in the way of these people?  Does the Minister think that this is calculated to inspire confidence in his Department?  Does he think that it is going to inspire confidence in his Department that when questions are raised here based on affidavits he will not pay any attention to them, that he will not even go on these affidavits and have an inquiry?  I think this Vote should be referred back on account of the policy the Department has shown itself responsible for during the past twelve months, the policy as represented by the Juries Bill, the wholesale raids and arrests without warrants and the assaults.  There is no explanation.  Even if the District Justices impose a fine, he would not even suspend the Guard while the Minister of his Department were fighting the case out in court until the unfortunate complainant was no longer able to bear the cost.  I move <Col N="2207" /> that the Vote be referred back for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge gave to the Minister for Justice a phrase which I hope he will not forget&mdash; hallowed body.  I hope that that will be the introduction to the two columns of panegyric which we are accustomed to receive as an answer to all inquiries.  At any rate he will have a peroration, and up to the present, as far as I know, we have had no other answer to the reasons, the documents, the responsible complaints, which have been put forward in relation to this Department.  We have heard nothing but pale imitations of Arthur James Balfour at his best and perorations to cover the absence of any argument to sustain the Minister's position.  I approach this question as one who wants peace in this country, who believes that peace in this country is the highest ideal, peace between the ordinary members of this country, that respect for the law, as it at present exists, until it can be changed, is the greatest immediate asset we can have, and the object towards which every man of every party ought to work.  It is because the action of the Ministry for Justice flies directly in the face of the building up of that respect for the law, that peace which will arise out of respect for the law, that I quarrel with the Minister for Justice. I have heard no word from the Minister for Justice, or from anybody on his behalf, and I have not seen it in any propaganda which has been issued for or by him, which would tend in any way to produce that condition of peace and accord in this country which of all departments it is the duty of the Minister for Justice to attempt to create.  We have had men convicted of crime&mdash;I believe they are exceptions&mdash;in the Guards.  I do not believe they represent the main body of the Guards. I believe that the majority of the Guards are decent young men who value a good job when they have got it, and who desire to keep it.  But there does seem to be here and there amongst them downright blackguards, <Col N="2208" /> and behind those blackguards there has been the organised defence of the Ministry of Justice. When men have been convicted in his own courts of assaults upon the civilian population, whose liberties they are supposed to guard and whose amenities they are supposed to take care of, and to whom they are supposed to show an example of respect for the law, and respect for the sancity of the person and of property; when these men have been convicted in the courts of these crimes the Minister for Justice has told us that they were perfectly good Civic Guards.</P>
      <P>A £40 valuation in one of his own courts for an assault by the Civic Guards upon a civilian is the standard of a perfectly good Civic Guard, according to the Minister for Justice. If the standard of the Civic Guard, for the Civic Guard, was the standard of the Minister for Justice, this place would be a hell.  If there were 6,000 Civic Guards in this country who accepted his standard as the standard of conduct which they should live up to, this place would not be fit to live in.  If it is fit to live in, it is because the instruments of the Minister for Justice will not sink to the level of the Minister for Justice.  If it is possible by any means of propaganda to excite unrest which can be turned into votes, that is the policy of the Minister for Justice.  If people can be roused, shaken up, into defiance of the law, so that the Government can reap the dividend of strong men in face of rebellion, that is the policy of the Minister for Justice. These men who dragged the body of a wounded comrade, a murdered comrade, on to every political platform, and bespattered every hoarding with his blood for Party purposes, these men who coined his wounds into votes, these men who are hungry for outrage that they may advertise it to their advantage, as the President advertised it in a speech which was written and appeared in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; two days before he delivered it in the Dublin bye-election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts of the matter <Col N="2212" /> were that with all this travesty&mdash; travesty of justice, yes&mdash;the Minister for Justice, through his Department, prosecuted some of these people whom he had taken into custody for breaking 57 windows in a building, State property under the control of the Minister, and he failed to get a conviction.  He failed to get any punishment.  He failed to get the Judge to say that that man had done anything which was illegal or wrong.  I repeat the statement that the court, under the Minister for Justice in relation to prisoners in the custody of the Minister for Justice, has held them entitled to destroy State property in the custody of the Minister for Justice, as the only means of protesting against the justice of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Now if that is so, if you have 6,000 Civic Guards under the authority of this man, and those of them who commit crimes&mdash;who are held to be guilty in open court after trial of committing crimes&mdash;are described in the face of those 6,000 Civic Guards as good public servants, do you think that the Minister for Justice, in that course of conduct, has contributed to the peace and the good order of this country, or has contributed to the respect for the law?  You have the Minister for Justice arresting dozens of people, arresting and re-arresting them and putting them into prison under conditions in which his own court say they are entitled to destroy public property to call attention to that, is the Minister for Justice entering upon a course which is going to put behind the law the people who ought to be behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sent to the Minister for Justice a series of statements in relation to some people in Cork.  Men were taken off buses and continually arrested time after time, without any charge and without any reason.  I asked the Minister to investigate that.  I thought that was a better way than possibly the controversial and polemical way of question and motions in this House.  He had a perfectly fair and open field in which to make his investigations. His answer was that he was perfectly <Col N="2213" /> satisfied from his inquiry that these people were engaged in criminal and seditious acts.  He was satisfied!  Only two of them were charged.  He charged two of them, and after they had been remanded three times, his own court refused information in relation to them.  They had to be released, and then the Minister, through his hallowed body, starts re-arresting them again.  It is no use not being guilty in this country. It is no use being tried and being found not guilty.  It is no use the Minister having such a rotten case that his own officials refuse information and release the men.  That is not sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well; I did not particularly want to use that.  The ordinary Justices of this country having tried the cases and having refused information and having refused to allow another remand at the request of the Civic Guards, the men, when released after a hearing, are re-arrested without any reason given. Is that putting the people behind the law?  Is that making a moderate-minded man like myself who does want respect for the law, who knows the ghastly cost to this country of lack of correspondence between the will of the people and the existing law; is that putting moderate-minded men who know those facts behind the law?  I am speaking as a man who has no personal grievance against any Civic Guard in relation to these cases. When I was dealing with them I personally received every courtesy, and <Col N="2214" /> there is no one here more prejudiced than I am in favour of making the Civic Guard a body behind which there will be the respect and support of the people.  What is my position?  What is the position of any ordinary man faced by the subterranean activities of the Minister for Justice such as that?  As I understand the policy of this Ministry as expressed in these Acts, it is to savage and bedevil the people into such a condition that they can let loose hell again and reap the Party price.</P>
      <P>This Minister for Justice, who wants respect for the law, who wants the people behind the law, who wants cheap enforcement services in this country because the people are behind the law, this Minister offers us a Bill which a Deputy upon those benches described as a prostitution of the jury, and for which the man who described it as the prostitution of the jury votes.  Is that the system? Is that the mentality which conceives a Jury Bill?  The heir, the direct heir of the mentality which conceived the Public Safety Bill?  Is that the mentality which is going to make for peace in this country?  It might make for peace in a country of worms, which would probably be an ideal country to respect the law under the administration of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is not in the public interest to give us any information.  It is not in the Minister's interest.  It is not in the interest of his Government.  It is not in the interest of what they stand for.  It is in the public interest that the light of day shall be let in on this Department, and that we should know who it is that is driving those blackguards within its ranks to defame what I believe to be on the whole a good body; to degrade the law, to make it impossible for honest and upright men, impossible for liberty-loving men to respect it or have any regard for it. It is in the public interest that the light of day should be let into the narrowest and lowest corners of that Department, and the mentality which now administers it to the destruction of the public peace in this State.</P>

      <Col N="2215" /> The Minister for Justice sits mum in this House when his successors in the Government of this State, when the obvious alternative to himself and his Ministry as a Government is accused by a Minister sitting beside him, distraught with passion I will admit, utterly incapable of forming a balanced judgment, a bold unbiddable child, but still a Minister.  This whole side of the Opposition, representing 500,000 voters in this country, is accused of being behind the conspiracy to upset law, and being behind the conspiracy to break down the jury system.  That Minister for Justice who wants peace in this country, who wants the people behind the law, sits quiet while that is being done.  Is that making for the public peace or for the stability and the cheapness of the administration of justice in this country? When that distraught fool gets out into the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Because the Minister for Justice is mum, because he is purely and simply a party man, prepared to use and exploit disorder which he creates and encourages, because he is prepared to wring the last drop of party profit out of any evil thing which his own mentality can construe into disorder in this country, because he has no respect himself for the law which it is his business to guard, then I say for that reason the Minister for Justice and the gang who run him are not entitled to the respect of this or any other body of citizens in this country.  It is not in the public interest that silence should be kept and that darkness should cover that.  We have got to get it out into the open and into the light that the Department of Justice in this House is a Department of organised injustice for party profit and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): I am anxious at this stage to take advantage of this Vote to raise again a matter which I raised by question and to which I spoke later on the adjournment motion of Deputy de Valera.  It has reference to the matter of the treatment, or rather the alleged ill-treatment, of prisoners by members of the Detective Division of the Gárda Síochána in County Clare.  To my mind there is <Col N="2217" /> nothing so mean or cowardly as the ill-treatment of prisoners who are helpless in the hands of their custodians. That is the reason why I speak with particular interest in this matter.  I want to see, when citizens are arrested, if there are specific charges against them and if they are criminally intentioned, that the law should not be taken into the hands of the Gárda Síochána or of anybody else, but that justice should be dispensed by those who have been appointed to dispense it.  At this stage let me say that so far as the uniformed Gárda Síochána are concerned.  I do not think that there is any public opinion of a serious nature that has anything to say in regard to the way in which they carry out their duties.  They are carrying out a difficult task with the least possible disturbance, and are causing the least possible amount of trouble to the average citizen, but I am anxious to find out why the Minister for Justice, in face of the affidavits and sworn statements submitted to him, still persists in refusing to hold an inquiry into the alleged misconduct of several members of the Detective Division of the Gárda Síochána in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The affidavits describe clearly certain incidents.  They state clearly certain dates.  They mention certain names, certain houses, certain hours and certain places.  There is nothing cloudy about these statements. They are made on oath before an accredited official appointed to take sworn statements.  There is nothing vague about them.  In the light of that, and in view of the fact that mention is made of names, of places, of members of the Detective Division, and so forth, I see no reason why the Minister should refuse to permit an inquiry to be held.  It is all very well for the Minister, as he has done on occasions, to shrug his shoulders and say that he made inquiries and that nothing is being done.  I am not prepared to believe that a number of citizens, a number of responsible people, who have some respect for the sanctity of an oath and for the sanctity of statements made on oath before a Commissioner <Col N="2218" /> for Oaths, have made these statements very lightly and that there is nothing in them.  One man in his affidavit says:&mdash;&ldquo;I was struck on the side of the head, rushed upon and knocked down. While I was on the ground I was kicked on the head and shoulders. On rising from the ground I was struck several blows by C.I.D. man &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;&mdash;I will not mention the name as I do not want to bring in names here where the matter is privileged &mdash;&ldquo;I was pressed back further.  I was knocked up against a fence.&rdquo; Here is another affidavit.  This man says:&mdash;&ldquo;While going to the haggard, without any words or warning whatever, I was set upon by So-and-so and savagely kicked on the back and legs.  I was practically kicked out of the haggard into the adjoining field.  Blows showered down upon me like rain.  I was felled to the ground several times with blows and kicks.  After some time I was asked by a member of the Detective Division what rank I occupied in a certain organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are statements of some of these people.  I have about six affidavits. These are, as I say, statements sworn on oath before a Commissioner for Oaths.  I am prepared to suggest that they are, at least, worth investigating to see whether they are false or true.  I heard Deputy Ruttledge, who knows something about legal procedure, say that if those statements could be proved to be perjury there is one way of dealing with them, and the Gárda Síochána in that district had a way of raising the matter.  So far as country districts are concerned, one naturally seeks to gauge public opinion by asking the opinion of public bodies in those districts.  One goes to them for a substantial indication of what the majority of the people in the district or county feel. When the Minister for Justice suggests, as he did on the occasion when this matter was raised before, that certain criminally-minded people had inspired the passing of certain resolutions by two public bodies in Co. Clare, I want to ask him definitely, and I am entitled to know, whether <Col N="2219" /> he suggests that these two bodies in the county are composed of criminally-minded people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to give way to Deputy Flinn.  If the Minister knows there are certain criminally-minded people who are exercising undue influence on the members of public bodies in Clare, I suggest to him that it is his duty to see that these people are arrested and charged with exercising that undue influence.  I do not know where the joke is or I do not know what Deputy Gorey said, but I suggest to the Minister that if there is undue influence exercised over public bodies in Clare and he knows it &mdash;because he cannot say the resolutions were inspired unless he knows the people who inspired them&mdash;in the interests of public bodies he ought to take the necessary steps to protect these bodies from being influenced by criminally-minded people.  He said they are not within the public bodies; therefore there must be a big and vast organisation to force these bodies to pass the resolutions which the Minister mentioned. The Minister shrugs his shoulders; he suggests that that is not the case.  I am not going to allow this to pass lightly.  I have the privilege to belong to one of the bodies referred to.  I have the privilege of being vice-chairman of the county council which the Minister says is influenced by criminally-minded people outside to pass resolutions. I am not going to take any <Col N="2220" /> statement from a Minister who is not prepared to substantiate that and prepared to safeguard that public body from undue interference by criminally-minded people. If there are criminally-minded people I suggest it is the duty of the Minister for Justice to protect the county council from people who are forcing them to do things that they do not want to do.  He says that there are no criminally-minded people within that body but that there are criminally-minded people outside forcing them to do certain things.  Why does he not protect that council from these criminally-minded people by arresting and charging them?</P>
      <P>It is charged against the premier body in the county that they are allowing themselves to be influenced by criminally-minded people.  I want to tell the Minister that I do not believe that either of these two bodies have been intimidated, cajoled, induced or in any way forced to pass the resolutions.  They have examined the facts as they came before them in public session.  They have examined them before the public Press. They have investigated them by every means at their disposal.  I suggest to the Minister that the resolutions are in consonance with the facts before them.  These two bodies have demanded an inquiry, and in spite of that demand the Minister proceeds to tell us that undue pressure has been brought to bear on the two bodies.  I suggest to him that if there is nothing to be hidden, his duty is to protect these bodies from being intimidated and to hold the inquiry asked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not at all surprising that no member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party other than the Minister for Justice is prepared to stand up and say a word in defence of the policy of the Department. After each speaker in the debate concluded there has been a long and painful pause, as we waited to see if one solitary voice would come from the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal in defence of the activities for which the Minister for Justice has been responsible, but we have <Col N="2221" /> waited in vain.  Apparently they are all as ashamed as they should be of the activities for which that Department has been responsible.  We on this side of the House are, of course, naturally in opposition to that policy because we desire peace in this country. We have consistently criticised the attitude which the Minister has adopted in relation to matters affecting the Civic Guard and his Department on that ground, and on that ground only.  It is because we want peace, it is because we want the road left clear for peaceful progress that we ask the Dáil to record its disapproval of the policy of the Minister by its votes.  The Minister for Justice is, I maintain, deliberately directing the machinery under his control for the purpose of provoking disorder in this part of Ireland, believing that disorder will be helpful to the political prospects of the Party to which he now belongs.</P>
      <P>If we approach the consideration of the Estimate as a member of Parliament in a normal State would approach the consideration of an Estimate for a normal Department of Justice, we would perhaps take a different line from that which we are now taking. The Department of Justice in every country, but more especially the Department of Justice in this country, has a function other than the control of the police forces, the control of the prisons or the administration of the various statutes which are given to it to administer.  That is the function of promoting and preserving respect for the law.  In this country, for historical reasons, there has not been given by the people that co-operation in the administration of the ordinary law which is essential for its successful administration.  That co-operation was not given because in the past the British Government utilised the machinery now controlled by the Department of Justice for political ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That co-operation is not now being given, as every Deputy knows, because the present Government have continued the British policy and are designedly utilising the <Col N="2222" /> machinery of the Department of Justice mainly for political ends.  It is not possible to expect the full degree of public co-operation in the administration of the law which is necessary for its proper administration unless every section of the community feels that political bias plays no part either in the management of the police force or the administration of the courts.  Every section in this country cannot feel confident that political bias plays no part either in the police force or in the courts.  Certainly that section for which we speak has not that confidence, and I would remind Deputies that it is a not inconsiderable section.  Two years ago half a million adult people recorded their votes for us, and you can take it, therefore, that half a million people in this country, which contains only something over one million adults, do not feel confident that political bias is not the main consideration in the control of the police force. These are not wild statements which can be challenged.  They can be substantiated, and I hope to substantiate them now.</P>
    <P>There have been, in fact, quite a number of incidents to indicate that members of the Government, and certain persons outside the Government and outside this House, regard the Department of Justice as a purely Cumann na nGaedheal concern. There have been incidents which clearly indicate that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party managers expect to receive, and do receive, the fullest possible co-operation from the Department of Justice in their political activities.  One such incident was referred to in this House not so long ago.  A certain document which was said to have been captured by the police in the course of a raid was published for the first time in the daily Press in the form of an advertisement in support of a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate in a by-election.  That document may or may not have been captured in a raid.  Certainly those who noted its fantastic language do not believe that it was captured in a raid, except it was a raid upon a <Col N="2223" /> lunatic asylum.  But a document alleged to have been captured in a raid was published in the Press by the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation before it had been officially communicated to the public.  Everyone who noted the fact came to one conclusion&mdash;the only conclusion possible&mdash;that the publicity agents of Cumann na nGaedheal were free to go into the headquarters of the Civic Guards, search the records there, and extract any document, which they believed it would be in their Party's interest to utilise.  They got the document and it was published, and the only justification offered in this House when the matter was raised was that given by the President, when he said that he took full responsibility for it.  What satisfaction is it to us that the President takes full responsibility for it?  We knew who was responsible.</P>
    <P>We knew that he and every other member of the Government were responsible for the position of affairs which existed by which that document could get into the hands of the agents of a political party.  That is not what we want to know.  We want to know by what machinery was it actually transferred from the files of the police to the files of the Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters.  We want the Minister to tell us if he authorised any of his subordinate officials to hand out that document to the Cumann na nGaedheal agent, and, if so, why?  We want him to tell us if it is a fact that Cumann na nGaedheal agents have a right to go into police offices for the purpose of examining documents and seeing the files.  We want him to tell us if, as a result of that matter having been raised in the Dáil, that practice has been stopped, or if it is still possible for the agents of one political party that supports the Government to secure copies of official documents before these documents are officially published.  It is, as I said, not sufficient for us to know merely that the President takes responsibility.  The whole Government must take responsibility for that looseness, and it is obviously a matter of looseness.  If <Col N="2224" /> you think it is possible to get from the 500,000 people for whom we speak any co-operation with a police force that is capable of being used in that manner for party purposes, then you are making a great mistake.  If, as has been proved, facilities could be given to Cumann na nGaedheal on that occasion, we want to know if it is a fact that facilities have also been given on other occasions, or is it not a fact.  Has it been the practice for Cumann na nGaedheal agents during a general election or a by-election to ask the police to provide them with propaganda material?  It has been freely alleged that it is the practice. Let us have a statement by the Minister upon the matter.  Let him either confirm or deny it&mdash;he must do one or the other.  If he thinks it is part of his duty to stimulate public confidence in the administration of his Department, he must come forward and lay all his cards upon the table and allow, as Deputy Flinn said, the light of day to shine into the darkest corner of his Department.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is only one incident, and the mere fact that a document in the archives of the police, which was not previously published, could be in some manner mysteriously transferred to the Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters does not, perhaps, by itself prove that political bias is the main consideration in the control of the police force.  But there are other incidents. Deputies will remember that during that same by-election a very definite line of policy was followed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I suggest to them that the party managers met around a table and decided in advance the cards they were going to play.  They said: (1) the President shall make a sensational speech in which he will allege there is a conspiracy against the State; (2) the police will immediately start raiding people in the city of Dublin in order to support the President's contention and pretend that the Government are taking the situation seriously; (3) this campaign of raids will be continued until the election is concluded and then stopped.  Of <Col N="2225" /> course, in deciding upon that line of policy they had to realise the difficulties, the first difficulty being that a person cannot be arrested and detained for longer than 24 hours without being charged, and, therefore, they devised the very ingenious scheme of arresting these persons and releasing them in less than 24 hours, but immediately re-arresting them again.  I suggest that that policy was decided by the Cumann na nGaedheal party managers.  It was certainly decided upon by somebody, else why did the President, at the opening of the by-election campaign, make that sensational statement about the conditions in this country which he has since denied, and why was it that immediately following that statement by the President this outburst of activity on the part of the police should occur?  I say that one was linked with the other; that the whole thing was stage-managed for the purpose of getting the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate elected to this House. That is what the people believe, and what the supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal believe.  Some of them, of course, congratulate themselves on being led by such astute leaders, but others are beginning to realise that these practices, however temporarily successful they may be, will ultimately bring the whole machinery of justice, law and police in this country into the contempt which some of us already believe it certainly deserves. If it has not brought it into contempt it is not the fault of the Minister for Justice.  I do not attribute to the present occupier of the Ministry of Justice responsibility for the whole of that plan.  I am quite certain he did not think it out.  I am quite sure it was thought out by more astute persons, but the Minister was a willing tool, and my criticism is that he deliberately and willingly, with malice aforethought, permitted the machinery which the Dáil gives him to be used in that manner.</P>
    <P>In many districts throughout the country, as I have had occasion to discover, members of the Civic Guard <Col N="2226" /> appear to be under the impression that their official attitude towards the Fianna Fáil Party should be one of hostility.  I have had numerous examples of that attitude.  Not merely have legitimate activities of the Fianna Fáil Party been unnecessarily interfered with by members of the Gárda but in some cases hostility has been openly expressed.  I am convinced these Guards would not adopt that attitude if they had not been encouraged to do so by their political authorities.  I have had many cases brought to my notice of committee meetings of Fianna Fáil in different parts of the country being interfered with by members of the Civic Guard in their district. The Guards seem to think that it is their duty to know everything that members of the Fianna Fáil Party do.  I want the Minister for Justice to tell us if any instructions are issued to the Gárda to report the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party to anybody.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my notice that certain officials of the organisation of which I am secretary have been questioned by Guards as to the number of branches in their district and the number of members in each branch.  Do these Guards act with authority or not?  I confess in certain districts where these activities are most obvious I have found some difficulty in getting exact details of what happened, because those who could give details did honestly appear to be terrorised at the prospect of giving information against the Gárda and having to live in the district over which the Gárda exercised authority.  That applies particularly to certain parts of the Co. Clare.  Not merely, however, have the Gárda shown that hostility to Fianna Fáil in certain districts which possibly they have been prompted to do by the Minister for Justice or those under him, for even in the administration of the ordinary law certain individuals amongst them have exercised a curious political bias.  I am constantly receiving complaints from individuals that they are often <Col N="2227" /> stopped and searched and questioned upon frivolous pretexts.  These individuals believe that the only reason they are interfered with in that manner is because the Guards know they are active members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>In the Co. Leitrim, where I spent the last week-end, quite a number of people approached me, and stated that since the by-election has been announced, they have been repeatedly stopped and searched by the Civic Guard, who gave it as an excuse that they believed these people were carrying poteen.  Many of these people were well-known and respectable citizens who could not honestly be suspected of that offence, but merely because the Guards are given the impression by the political heads of the State that their attitude to Fianna Fáil should be hostile, individual members of the Gárda, who are themselves not vindictive or anxious to pursue the vendetta which originated in the Civil War, are adopting that attitude.</P>
    <P>The history of the Civic Guard is known to us.  We all know how it was started.  It was only natural that it should have a definite bias in favour of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the present Government, but it is obviously in the national interest that that should be stopped, that the Guards should become a non-political force, and the only body that can make the Gárda become a non-political force is the present Government.  If they deliberately go out to discourage any attempt by the Civic Guards to associate themselves with Cumann na nGaedheal, they can do it.  In fact I think in the particular circumstances that exist here there is a very strong case for making the Ministry of Justice an extern Ministry, and taking the individual who holds that office out of the Executive Council and away from all responsibility for making political decisions.  A strong case exists because we cannot ignore the situation with which we are faced in consequence <Col N="2228" /> of the recent history of which we are all aware.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make reference to matters that have arisen in the past year in connection with the administration of the Ministry for Justice and the Civic Guards.  I notice the Minister for Agriculture opposite, and so I shall deal with certain statements made concerning the Fianna Fáil Party.  A certain lady has been arrested, and as I understand, charged with sedition for having, as alleged, made a statement to the effect that recent crimes in connection with jurymen in Dublin were committed by secret detectives of the Free State Government. On Sunday last the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;perhaps I should not take him very seriously&mdash;definitely implied that members of the Fianna Fáil Party were associated with the conspiracy that resulted in attacks upon jurymen.  If it is seditious to insinuate that persons in the employment of the Free State Government were associated with these crimes, is it not seditious to insinuate also, that members of this House were associated with these crimes.  Deputy Flinn has dealt with that matter, but I want to make further references to it.  If the Minister for Agriculture knows that there is any connection between members of this party and that conspiracy, why does not he place before the responsible authorities the evidence in his hands.  I am, as I have said, Secretary of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I am a not insignificant member of the party. I am Chairman of the Organising Committee; I know everything connected with the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If there is one individual responsible for maintaining that association with that conspiracy, I am the individual.  Will the Minister for Agriculture come down to brass tacks and definitely accuse me or any other member of this Party with being associated with that conspiracy.  If he has evidence to that effect, if he has in fact transferred that evidence to the Ministry of Justice, we want to know from the Minister for Justice why he has not acted upon it.</P>

      <P>The principal matter to which I wish to make reference is the attitude adopted by the Minister for Justice towards complaints relating to irregular activities by members of the Civic Guard.  Deputy Hogan referred to certain assaults which were committed in the County of Clare.  The persons who alleged that they were the victims of these assaults have sworn affidavits which were presented to the Minister for Justice.  Either what they say is true or it is not true.  If there is any reason to believe it is true, I assert it is the duty of the Minister for Justice to hold an inquiry.  If it is not true and if the Minister for Justice can prove that these statements are not true I suggest it is his duty to take proceedings against these individuals for perjury.  He cannot get out of that dilemma.  It must be one course or the other.  He is trying to shirk his duty, to keep those Guards out of the public courts, but after he has been challenged here and now, he has got to take some action to hold an inquiry into those charges or to bring those men forward as perjurers charged as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, those cases in Clare <Col N="2230" /> were not the only cases of assault attested on oath by the individuals concerned. The attitude of the Minister for Justice here has been such that although for a time we considered it our duty to bring every case of an assault we heard of forward in the House for discussion, we have lately changed our tactics.  The Minister for Justice has attempted to represent every such complaint against individual Guards of blackguardism or brutality as an attack upon the whole force.  We do not want to be put in the position of attacking the whole force, because we are not doing so, but the Minister for Justice, by his attitude in the House, and the Press by the manner in which they report the debates that take place here, are attempting to drive a wedge harder between the Civic Guard as a body and Fianna Fáil as a Party.  When we allege that individual members of the force have been guilty of acts of brutality, we are not attacking the force, but quite the reverse.  We hope to see that force made one in which all sections of the people will have confidence and respect.  The attitude of the Minister for Justice is quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions references were made here to cases of assaults.  The Minister for Justice appears to think that any charge against a member of the Civic Guard for assault must be dismissed with contempt, that it cannot possibly be true.  But he knows there have been assaults even within a very recent period.  I have been talking to individuals, men who are now cripples for life as a result of the treatment they received at the hands of the Civic Guard long after the Civil War period had concluded.  The Minister knows that that is so and that such cases have occurred.  Perhaps it was before the time when he was appointed to the post he now occupies, but does he think that there was a sudden change in the character of every member of the Civic Guard immediately he was appointed Minister for Justice.  If cases of assault happened before his appointment surely it is possible <Col N="2231" /> that they happened after and when we have, day after day, responsible Deputies coming into this House with sworn affidavits to the effect that such assaults have been committed, I say he is neglecting his duty when he does not think that he should investigate the truth or otherwise of those charges.  In view of the fact that there is that suspicion about the political bias of his Department he should be more than anxious to investigate every charge and even when he is satisfied in advance that evidence will not be forthcoming to support the charges I think it would be a good policy for him to see that such inquiries were held, and if as a result of those inquiries he proves those charges to be ill-founded he will have increased one hundred fold public confidence and respect for the force and public confidence and respect for himself. The activities of members of the C.I.D. in Dublin during the recent by-election period are cases in point.  The Minister for Justice recollects that here in this House he deliberately refused to give to members who asked questions any information concerning the activities of the police on that occasion.  The elected representatives of the people were denied information as to the number of persons who were challenged, the number of houses raided and the number of people arrested.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was not in the public interest that such information should be given, but he declined to state why it was not in the public interest that the information should be given.  Apparently the period of stress is over, the courts having decided that the Minister's policy at that time was illegal. Therefore the matter is ended.  Can he now tell us, or will he now tell us, why he considered it last month not in the public interests to tell us even the number of persons who were arrested by members of the C.I.D. and held without trial?  Can he tell us the number of persons who were illegally arrested during that period?  The Minister for Justice <Col N="2232" /> possibly does not know.  He has an explanation other than that which he offered.  He declined to give the information.  Had he got the information to give?  Am I correct in saying that the party managers of Cumann na nGaedheal merely told the police to go ahead, and the police went ahead without consulting the Minister for Justice? I strongly suspect that that is what has happened.  Members will also recollect that for a time when these cases of assault by members of the C.I.D. were brought forward in the House the Minister always stated: &ldquo;Why had not the persons aggrieved taken the matter into court?&rdquo;  That seems a perfectly plausible argument, but he knows that it is practically impossible for any person assaulted by a member of the Civic Guard to get justice unless he has unlimited funds at his disposal.</P>
    <P>There is one classic example.  On Christmas Eve, 1927, in the town of Newport, it was proved that members of the Civic Guard, under the influence of drink, one of them a superintendent, did commit assaults. The persons concerned took action in the District Court, and got decrees for damages against members of the Civic Guard.  The case is not concluded yet.  It has been appealed up and down, dragged from court to court, and the expenses of those men who were assaulted and who were found, by a Judge and jury, to have been assaulted already exceed a sum of three figures.  Do you think these men can continue indefinitely?</P>
    <P>This system of appealing from one court to another and of re-trials is going on because the expenses of the criminals who committed the assaults are paid by the State, and because counsel for them are appointed by the Attorney-General.  All the resources of the taxpayers of this country are thrown behind those who committed the assaults, and the unfortunate men who are assaulted cannot possibly get justice when all the machinery of the State is used to defend the criminals who assaulted them, and the criminals who committed assaults and who were convicted <Col N="2233" /> by judge and jury, are still prominent members of the Civic Guard forces; not even after their conviction were they interfered with.  Similarly, in other cases where action has been taken against members of the Civic Guard and convictions secured, appeals were ordered and financed by the State, and even while awaiting the result of the appeal the members of the Civic Guard concerned performed their ordinary duties. Men convicted by a judge and jury of a criminal assault were allowed to go round the country exercising authority over the lives of peaceful citizens.</P>

      <P>I presume every assault is a criminal assault.  I am not an authority on law, but I imagine if a Civic Guard in a drunken condition breaks into a man's house and assaults him, it does not become a different kind of assault merely because it was committed by a Civic Guard.  I am sure if I did the same thing I would be charged with criminal assault.  However, I am not a lawyer, and I hope never to be.</P>

      <P>I am very glad I have the Minister's assurance that that is so.  It is possible, of course, that there are legal definitions of these things, different from the commonsense definition.  Of course, I forgot that there is a kind of assault that is not criminal.  It is what the Minister for Justice calls a technical assault. When a Civic Guard beats a civilian it is not a criminal assault; it is a technical assault.  We have had a delicious explanation given already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote the verdict of the jury that assessed the damages against a member of the Civic Guard.  When a person is arrested for a political offence of any kind the Department of Justice <Col N="2234" /> appears to think that its duty is not to secure a fair trial for that person upon the evidence, but to secure his conviction at all costs.  If a man is arrested for having, say, seditious documents in the County Mayo, the State avail of every device that is open to them to get that man a trial in circumstances in which he will be at every possible disadvantage.  He is not tried before a jury of his fellow-countrymen.  They always bring the trial to Dublin, where the prisoner will be a stranger and will be unable to pick out those who are politically prejudiced against him upon the jury, empanelled by every legal trick which the skilled attorneys in the employment of the Government are able to avail of in order to deprive that man of a fair trial. I make that allegation quite seriously. I say that the mentality which has being operating the Department of Justice in that manner during the last two years is the same mentality which drafted the Juries Bill that was introduced here last week, because the one purpose of that Bill is to relieve the Department of Justice of the necessity of stooping to tricks in order to secure convictions.  The Bill will ensure the conviction of such prisoners by a majority vote of packed juries at secret trials.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, however, has not been so zealous in enforcing the law against its own friends.  Members of the general public who were assaulted by Civic Guards in the County Waterford took actions against these Guards in the courts and secured decrees for damages, but were these damages ever paid, or did the Department of Justice take any steps to ensure that the amounts would be paid?  Would it even inform the men concerned where the Civic Guards were stationed after the Courts had given their verdict?  Am I correct in saying that every possible difficulty was put in the way of the men who got the decrees of serving them upon the Guards and of securing information as to where the Guards were?</P>

      <P>We will give the Minister every opportunity of getting all the information he can from his Department.  I am quite sure that his answers when given to-morrow or next day will be in the negative.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some special reference to the detective division.  I want to get, for the benefit of the community in general, an assurance from the Minister that he is satisfied that the detective force is properly controlled.  I want him to assure us that he is satisfied that there is not a secret society of which members of the detective division are members. It has appeared from evidence which has been given in the public courts by members of the detective division that they have on occasion taken action against civilians without authority.  I live in a portion of this city which was never noted for its nationalist sympathies.  The people of that district were always of the timid, Conservative class.  I hope none of them will be offended if they hear that I made these remarks about them, but even amongst these people I find that there is a real fear of members of the detective division. They all feel that members of that force are not subject to proper control and that they take upon themselves the administration of justice in their attitude towards certain individuals.  Quite a number of people in that district have told me that they would just as soon meet a highwayman as a detective upon the roads after dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be good national policy to transfer out of the detective force every individual who took a prominent part in the civil war hostilities.  I am making that suggestion quite seriously.  I think if that action was taken a very long step towards the restoration of normal conditions would be made. Undoubtedly, a detective force is required. <Col N="2236" /> I am not denying that.  I am not asking the Government to abolish that force.  Any Deputy can understand that in the enforcement of the law against criminals a certain number of detectives will be needed at all times, but surely it should be possible to man that force without having to enrol persons whose very presence there arouses strong and bitter passions.  There are a number of members of that force who were associated with things that happened during that period and, in consequence of that fact, I believe a very large number of those who took the other side would not have any confidence in that body while these men remain members of it, nor would they feel that they would be discharging their duty by giving information concerning the criminal activities of these men.  I am not suggesting that the men should be dismissed or deprived of their employment.  I would not expect the present Government would do that, but they can be transferred to other services.  The plain-clothes armed detective division is not the place where they should be left.  If the Government took that step and recruited its detective division from men who had no association with the things that happened that time, they would be doing something which would be in the best national interest.</P>
    <P>I think that we should also get from the Government some definite assurance that they have no recourse to the agent provocateur.  There have been in recent years at least three cases to my own knowledge of crimes which were promoted by persons in the pay of the Government. There was one robbery in the Post Office.  There was one attempted rescue of a criminal from a prison and, one other crime that I cannot recollect at the moment.  In each of these cases it was clearly shown by the evidence given in court that the crime was planned and the arms supplied by an individual who was in the employment of the detective division.  There is, of course, the case of Harling, in relation to whom it was asserted that he had gone <Col N="2237" /> around amongst a certain number of young men in Dublin suggesting that the existing Republican organisation of which they were members was not extreme enough and that he was going to form a more extreme one; and that he endeavoured to induce these young men to join with him in the formation of that association. Harling was at that time in the pay of the Government.</P>
    <P>The fact that these things have happened, and that evidence in relation to them was given in a public court, has created in the minds of a large section of the people a suspicion that persons receiving State pay are not altogether unconnected with every sensational crime that occurs.  I do not myself believe that this is so, but there is in the minds of the people, whenever sensational crimes occur, a suspicion that these crimes might have been manufactured by some too zealous secret agent of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>If we could get some definite assurance from the Ministry that these secret agents are not employed, if we could see the Vote for Secret Service wiped off altogether out of the Estimates, if we felt that the Government were merely anxious to do their duty in the administration of the law, we would be able, I think, to promise on behalf of the people whom we represent the fullest possible co-operation, except in connection with these laws that were passed here for the purpose of maintaining the political status now existing.  But in relation to the ordinary criminal law that we all want to see obeyed, you can get that co-operation if you ask for it. But before asking for it you must come with all the facts before you. Do not come asking for it at one moment and then in the next refusing to give the information which can legitimately be asked for concerning the activities of your Department.</P>
    <P>We do not think that the Ministry of Justice is playing the game with the people.  We do not think that it is even attempting to foster that spirit amongst our people which will insure a general co-operation of all <Col N="2238" /> sections in the enforcement of the law.  We do not think that the Minister for Justice has real control of his Department, and that is a matter to which I want to refer now. Certain statements have been made by other members of the Cabinet in this House and during elections which would seem to indicate that these other members of the Cabinet exercise greater influence over the activities of the Department of Justice than the Minister for Justice himself.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party selected Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to become Minister for Justice, but I suspect that one reason why he was selected was because he was known to be a man who would give no trouble. If he was of a different character, if he was prepared to do his duty regardless of the consequences to himself or his Party he would certainly not have attempted to take public responsibility for a lot of the things that have occurred since he has been appointed.  It is, in fact, since his appointment, and only since his appointment, that a general lack of discipline and looseness of organisation amongst the Gárda has appeared. In the time of his predecessor there was a stronger hand in control.  It is since that period that we have got evidence that the wildest characters amongst the Guards have been encouraged and the best men kept down.  The attitude of the Minister for Justice has been such in this House as in effect to say to the members of the Gárda: &ldquo;If you are vigorous against the Republicans you can go out of your way to persecute them.  If you, in fact, occasionally commit technical assaults against them then you are the ideal Guard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The man who is reported to be friendly with his neighbours of all political classes, the man who merely does his duty in relation to the ordinary law and nothing more, is never mentioned even as being worthy of praise.  The men whom the Minister for Justice has taken upon himself to defend are men who are bringing that force into disgrace <Col N="2239" /> and preventing it from getting the respect and co-operation of the people.  We are very interested in this debate.  I hope that as a result of it there will be a clearer understanding between both parties in this House as to what our respective attitudes towards this question is.  I hope the Minister for Justice will believe us when we say that we are not against the Guards.</P>
    <P>We do not want to discredit the Guards, we want to see them become a force in which we can have confidence and for which the general public can have respect.  We are willing to do everything possible with him to make the Guards into such a force.  But we are going to expose every irregularity by the Guards that is brought to our notice, and we are going to ask the Government to see that such irregularities are suppressed.  We want to get a clear answer from the Government as to whether these irregularities are to be suppressed and an undertaking that they will be suppressed.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I asked the following question:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the amount of the present overdraft of the Leitrim County Council; also the amounts for the preceding four years; whether his Department has issued an order to the Leitrim County Council insisting on the collection of all arrears due, within a specified period; if he will state the period so specified, and if he has taken into consideration that undue pressure at this stage will result in extreme <Col N="2240" /> hardship on the greater number of the ratepayers affected, and in some cases of small farmers, in complete ruin.</P>
    <P>The reply I received appeared to be so unsatisfactory that I had no alternative but to raise this matter on the adjournment.  The first part of the reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As overdrafts fluctuate daily with receipts and payments, I cannot answer the first part of the question.  The present authorised overdraft limit in Leitrim is £25,000 and the authorised limits of overdrafts during the past four years have been as follows:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>I consider that is a very insidious reply on the part of the Minister. It puts the position of the Leitrim County Council in the worst possible light.  The actual overdraft for the year 1926 was £29,680 16s. 0d.; for the year 1927, £22,688 4s. 5d.; for the year 1928, £9,895, and for this year, to the 30th April, £4,064 16s. 3d.  I cannot understand why the Minister could not furnish the actual figures as asked for and as they should be submitted to the House unless it was for the purpose of making a case for the action he proposes to take later on.  The reply goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that rates levied for the service of a particular financial year are collectable within that year.  Leitrim has been the most backward county in the country in the collection of rates.  Collectors have been slack and dilatory with the result that nearly 40 per cent. of last year's rates remain outstanding.  The general matter has been under prolonged review and discussion with the County Council, and the County Council has now been directed to dismiss any collector who had not fully accounted for his warrant by the 30th June, 1929.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> As regards that part of the answer, I presume the Minister is right in saying that Leitrim is in the worst financial position, and is not as well off as any other county. I also presume the Minister must be aware that Leitrim is one of the poorest counties.  The Minister, apparently, does not understand the conditions relative to this whole problem or to the question of arrears of rates.  Otherwise he would not consider his present action feasible. We will have to go back to the period 1919-20 and 1920-21.  It is easy to visualise the conditions then existing.  It is easy to remember that at that period the grants given towards the relief of rates were withheld.  The rate then struck in consequence of the withholding of the grants represented an average rate of 14/- in Leitrim.  The rather chaotic conditions that prevailed during those years resulted in no effort being made to collect the high rate.  Prices were inflated, and farmers could then have met the demand without great inconvenience. The high rate was carried on to the period when deflation took place and when prices for stock had fallen.  The rate then became a burden on the farmers, and they were scarcely able to bear it.  That is the debt we are dealing with at the present moment.  That debt has been carried forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister's solution as contained in his reply will require explanation. We will go back to 31st March, 1923.  The overdraft then was £46,664 10s. 10d.; the amount of rates outstanding was £70,069 9s. 6d. We will go from 1923 to 1926.  During those three years the rates outstanding were reduced by approximately £8,000.  The actual amounts were £70,000 odd and £62,909 17s. 8d. During those three years the then Minister for Local Government considered that the Leitrim County Council were not discharging their duties efficiently and, just as the present Minister directs that things should be done in a methodical fashion, the Minister then directed that business should be similarly carried out.  By sealed order he <Col N="2242" /> dismissed the County Council and he sent a Commissioner down.  After almost three years the Commissioner ended his great career there by reducing the outstanding rates from £70,000 to £62,000.  The County Council came into office again and in the first year they reduced the outstanding rates by £10,000, the amounts being £62,000 and £52,000.  It took the Commissioner three years to make a reduction of £8,000.  In the following year the County Council reduced the outstanding rates from £52,000 to £39,000, a reduction of approximately £13,000.  For the last year the County Council again succeeded in reducing the outstanding rates from £39,000 to £24,000, representing a reduction of £15,000.</P>
    <P>In 1923 the overdraft was £46,664 10s. 10d., and on 30th April, 1929, the overdraft was £4,064 16s. 3d.  The rates outstanding on 31st March, 1923, amounted to £70,069 9s. 6d., and on 30th April, 1929, the amount was £24,809 18s. 8d.  If he is a business man, I am sure the Minister will agree that that is sound accounting. Will he say that there is not substantial headway being made during those years and, if it is a substantial amount, what is his idea in applying force after the experience we have had of the service of the Commissioner? The Minister's predecessor dismissed the County Council and the substitution of a Commissioner resulted in an infinitesimal reduction as compared with what has been accomplished by the County Council since control went back to them.</P>
    <P>I will refer the Minister to the other portion of his reply where he mentioned that Leitrim was the most backward county with regard to the collection of rates.  There is a very sinister motive behind that.  He insinuates there that the whole arrears are due to negligence on the part of rate collectors.  In face of the figures I have quoted I say that statement is unfounded.  We have in Leitrim a staff of officials, both in the County Council offices and as rate collectors, who are quite competent to deal with the business.  They are trained and have years of experience <Col N="2243" /> behind them.  They have the confidence of the County Council. The rate collectors meet with a good deal of hardship.  They are the officials who have their fingers on the pulse of the people, so to speak. Very often they take big risks in order to draw their mediocre allowances as collectors.  They have every incentive to force them to close their accounts.</P>
    <P>To insinuate that they are dilatory is most unfair, bearing in mind the services which these men have given and the confidence which the County Council have reposed in them.  If there are delays and difficulties in collecting arrears, it is because of economic conditions which existed when the first half of the arrears was due.  I assume that the Minister has had no experience of the conditions of living in County Leitrim, but, if he has, he made a statement in reply to my question yesterday that is not in accordance with the experience of people who are accustomed to state the truth.  He said: &ldquo;Full consideration has been given to the matter raised in the last part of the Deputy's question.  Rates represent but a relatively small proportion of a farmer's necessary outgoings.&rdquo; The Minister is either culpably negligent in regard to this matter or else he stated an untruth. If the Minister has not had experience of living in County Leitrim or of examining the conditions of living there, all he need have done was to apply to the Department of Agriculture and they could have given him the relative value of rates to farmers in that county.  The Department of Agriculture, through their inspectors, have carried out investigations to establish what is the ordinary value of a farmer's income on various sized farms.  The average sized farm in County Leitrim has a valuation of from £8 to £10.  The Department would have given the Minister figures which were prepared by their own inspectors showing that the small farmer there is a man whose income is between £30 and £40 a year, and upon which a whole family have to live.  The Minister <Col N="2244" /> said that rates represent but a relatively small proportion of a farmer's outgoings.  That would be a small part of the outgoings of a farmer whose income, inclusive of everything, is nearer to £30 than £40 a year?</P>
    <P>Take the average farmer with a valuation of £8 and with the rate last year 4/6 in the pound; we can realise that his rates represent about £1 16s.  That, on an income of £30, represents a substantial proportion. Again, the Minister said that he was satisfied that where rates were not duly collected hardship was caused to many hard-working persons who having paid their rates at the proper time were, in addition, burdened with the cost of interest on avoidable overdrafts due by the defaulters. If the threat of the Minister is carried out it will mean the dismissal of every rate collector in the county with the exception of three.  In extenuation of that, the Minister says that hardship is inflicted on farmers who have paid their rates up to date, but the Minister ignores the fact that the whole system on which Local Government administration is based is a system of co-operation.  Every scheme carried through this House is to a great extent dependent on co-operation. To-day we discussed, for instance, a Game Bill, and it was admitted on all sides that it would prove ineffective unless the farmers co-operated in working it.  The big scheme in connection with the creameries would have proved useless unless the farmers co-operated in that respect.  It is conceivable that somebody would suggest that because a farmer does not supply milk to a creamery that the creamery is the loser and that the farmer should be called on to supply whether he can or cannot?  It is just as illogical for the Minister to come along and say that men who are not able to pay the rates should pay them so that those who have paid them should not be at a loss.  What are the figures?  Up to 30th April the actual overdraft of the Leitrim County Council was £2,000.  The amount on which interest is paid is £2,000.  If we take that for a year, it represents an increase on the <Col N="2245" /> rates generally of less than ¼d. in the pound.  In order to relieve the loss on the rates represented by ¼d. in the pound the Minister says that the rates must be paid in order to equalise the whole scheme of things so that no undue burden is placed on any section of the people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were anxious to relieve the rates he would have found some means of dealing with the home help problem which became very acute in County Leitrim in the last four or five years.  He made no effort to help those who had suffered owing to the wet seasons, whose farms were lying derelict, and for whose assistance home help had to be given at an abnormal cost.  He is now very anxious that the rates should be collected, and when they are collected, assuming that he can collect the full amount of outstanding arrears, what would be the result? The county council would stand with a credit balance of £18,000.  That would be a splendid position.  The Minister could then point out that this country was in a sound financial condition, that one of the poorest counties in Ireland had a credit balance of £18,000.  That would help the Government to secure a loan on good terms, and they could say: &ldquo;We are not an impoverished country; we have succeeded in rounding the corner.  There is a balance of £18,000 to the credit of the Leitrim County Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, would not have taken into account that in doing that he would have created many derelict farms in County Leitrim.  If he investigates the matter he will find that I am not over-stating the case.  He would have a lot of derelict farms this year, because in County Leitrim, in many cases, farmers who have no stock of their own allow cattle in on their land for six months, but they do not get paid for the grazing until close to the expiration of six months.  If the Minister insists on the collection of rates it will mean that the cattle on these farms will have to be seized, so that the land will be of no value to the owners this year, and they in turn will have to seek home help.  If the <Col N="2246" /> Minister succeeds in carrying out his orders he will only succeed in making Leitrim a much poorer county than it is, and then he can claim that the county council has a credit balance of £18,000.  I suggest that the whole matter should be left in the hands of the county council, who have showed great ability in dealing with the question of the overdraft since it was left in their hands.  Any interference with them at this stage will prove disastrous.  The Minister should take into consideration the full circumstances of the case.  He should consult with the members of the county council, send an inspector to examine the conditions and to see whether an honest effort is not being made by all parties to face the problem.  He should leave well-enough alone, for if he persists in his present attitude he will create such conditions that will not be to the best interests of the ratepayers or the general advancement of the community.</P>

      <P>The general position of the rate collection in Leitrim for a number of years has caused me a considerable amount of concern.  On 31st March, 1928, 77.2 per cent. of the total Leitrim assessment was outstanding.  That was 32.4 per cent. higher than the next worst county in the country, which was Co. Limerick, where special circumstances arising out of a certain aspect of their financial position made the position very special.  In the following year, 31st March, 1929, 52 per cent. of the assessment in Leitrim was uncollected, which was 20.7 per cent. worse than the next worst county, which was again Co. Limerick, where special conditions existed.  Comparing the condition in these two years with Co. Mayo, which, I submit, is a county that from the economic and financial point of view can be compared with Leitrim, we find that on the 31st March, 1928, whereas 77.2 per cent. of the collection was outstanding in Leitrim, in Mayo only 4.1 per cent. was outstanding.  On the 31st March, 1929, when 52 per cent. was outstanding in Leitrim, in Mayo only 3.1 per cent. of the collection <Col N="2247" /> was outstanding.  I do not at all accept that any conditions existed in Leitrim to affect the financial position in the county, even from 1919 down, that might not also be said to have existed in Mayo.  In the attitude we are adopting towards the collection of rates in Leitrim, and the matter has been under consideration for a long time, I have taken into consideration everything that could be put before me by the officials in the Department of Agriculture who are most closely associated with the conditions there.  Anything that has been put before me by the Department of Agriculture shows no reason why Leitrim should be regarded differently from County Mayo in this particular matter, so that, speaking absolutely, Leitrim cannot be regarded in any way as a county in which the rates should not be paid and paid promptly.</P>
      <P>The county council reviews the administration of the county each year and decides, in order to carry on, to strike a certain rate.  They strike that rate.  As soon as that rate is struck the first moiety becomes legally payable, and the second moiety is legally payable on the 1st October in that year.  The position we find ourselves in to-day is that on the 31st March, 1929, £30,000 was outstanding in County Leitrim.  We find that on the 30th April not very much improvement had been made in that situation.</P>

      <P>Reductions naturally have taken place during the last two years.  I have been charged by the Deputy with attempting to mislead the House in quoting in a particular way the amount of the overdraft due by the Leitrim County Council.  I had no intention of misleading them in that way.  I would tell the Deputy that a farthing in the £ is not going to cover the amount of interest paid by the Leitrim County Council to the bank in the last twelve months. When I gave the limits, for which authority had been given to the <Col N="2248" /> county council in looking for an overdraft, I gave the limits for which the county council had applied to be allowed to go, because of their financial difficulties.  I speak without up-to-date information on the matter, because the particular papers are out with the inspector who is supervising this matter, and giving it very close attention. I would suggest to the Deputy that the amount paid in interest to the bank on overdrafts for the last year would have paid for the whole collection of the rates.  The arrears of the collection outstanding at the end of each financial year have been reduced gradually during the past few years, but this has to be borne in mind, too.  For the financial year ending March, 1926, the total assessment, I think, was about £63,000. That was to some extent an abnormal year.</P>
      <P>Let us take the subsequent years. For the year, March, 1927, the total assessment was £58,000; for the year ended March, 1928, the total assessment was £44,000, and for the year ended March, 1929, the total assessment was £40,000, so that the amount of rates the ratepayers in Leitrim were called upon to pay in the financial year just now ended, was 31 per cent. less than they were called upon to pay in the year ended March, 1927.  These two years show that there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of rates outstanding, but there has been a very considerable reduction also in the total amount of rates the people have been called upon to pay.  That is all very satisfactory, and the Leitrim County Council can take such credit as they desire in connection with it. But what cannot be allowed to continue is the state of affairs at which in 24 rate collecting areas in County Leitrim, we arrive at the 30th April, seven months after the date on which legally the rates should have been paid, to find that ten out of these twenty-four rate collectors have more than 30 per cent. of their warrant still outstanding, and that of these ten, five have more than 40 per cent. outstanding.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the rate collectors the Minister might state that some of the rate collectors, who are substantially in arrears, are in arrears because of the Minister's delay in sanctioning their appointment as rate collectors.</P>

      <P>That is not so, because in dealing with this particular matter, I am leaving out of consideration the four areas in which there have been recent appointments. In taking the delinquents, the ten people who have 30 per cent. outstanding have no connection with the four areas in which there have been new appointments.  When I say five have more than 40 per cent. outstanding at the end of the last month, I am still excluding these areas.</P>

      <P>In the short time at my disposal I want just briefly to say that the matter has been fully considered.  The matter has been considered by the county council itself, and as far as I know they fixed the 30th June as the date by which the warrants must be completely closed.  My position is this: <Col N="2250" /> In all the circumstances of the case, after very full and careful consideration, such rate collectors who on the 30th June, that is, nine months after the rates were legally due, have not completely closed their warrants must be dismissed, because the interests of the ratepayers and the people as a whole, and the whole tone in which local government administration has to be carried out, are prejudiced by the fact that the machinery set up to do the work is not doing it, when there is no reason in the world why it should not.  I want to say further, that in issuing the warrant for the current year statements were made at the county council meeting by some members, a limited number of them, who got a great amount of publicity and who seemed, from the public point of view, to colour the whole proceedings, that the council were not going to press the farmers to pay their rates.  The collectors have a particular responsibility for the collection of rates.  They have statutory powers at their disposal for doing so.  My attitude, and the attitude of the Department, is that the collectors who do not carry out the duties, for the performance of which they are given special powers by statute, cannot remain in the public service.</P>
