      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if there is any information in his Department to the effect that Mr. Joseph Quinn, Boherbee, Ballaghadereen, Co. Roscommon, handed £62 to the late Dr. Ferran in August 1920, being money collected by him for the Dáil Eireann Loan, 1919-20; and whether his Department has received an affidavit signed by responsible persons that Mr. Quinn did give this money to Dr. Ferran; whether he will further state if Mr. Quinn has on several occasions handed in the list of subscribers from whom he got the money; and why he has been ignored by the Minister's Department, and if he is aware that none of these subscribers have yet been repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Joseph Quinn, of Boherbee, furnished my Department with an affidavit made by himself to the effect that he collected subscriptions to the Dáil Loan from certain persons in the Boherbee area and that the amounts so collected were handed by him to Dr. Ferran of Foxford (now deceased) for transmission to the Dáil Finance Department.  He has also furnished on two occasions lists purporting to contain particulars of the subscriptions referred to in his affidavit, amounting in the aggregate to £61, but there are a number of discrepancies <Col N="403" /> between the names on those lists.</P>
      <P>There is no record in my Department of the receipt of an amount of £62 from the late Dr. Ferran.  A similar amount was, however, received from a gentleman in Foxford without any particulars, and I am having enquiries made with a view to ascertaining whether this amount belongs to the Boherbee subscribers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, Mr. Quinn was informed in a communication issued from my Department that the primary register did not contain any record of subscriptions by persons in the Boherbee area and that his application would be considered in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he has taken any steps to deal with the situation?  I believe this is one of the cases.  This gentleman is afraid his neighbours are getting restive and that they think he did not give the money at all and it is getting serious.  Two very prominent people in the district have filed affidavits that he handed in that money.  This is very serious for Mr. Quinn and for men like him.  I think it is time the Minister got a move on in the matter.</P>

      <P>At present four members of the preventive staff employed under the Revenue Commissioners on the Border have special permission to reside temporarily in Northern Ireland, for the reason that they have been unable to obtain suitable living accommodation in Saorstát territory near their stations.  Arrangements have already been made for one of these to transfer his residence to the Saorstát at an early date, and the remaining three have instructions that if suitable accommodation becomes available in the Saorstát at or near their stations, they will be expected to secure it.</P>

      <P>This question should have been addressed to me.  Denis Regan was awarded a pension as stated.  The award is in accordance with the terms of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and is based upon the final degree of disablement from which, on medical examination, Mr. Regan was found to be suffering.  I regret I have no power to re-open the case.</P>

Brincken, senior M.O. to the London County Council. on the outbreak of para-typhoid which occurred last July and August, wherein he suggested that the consumption of Irish cream was at least partially responsible for the outbreak; if the Minister has made any investigations into the matter, and whether he proposes to issue a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it came to my knowledge some time ago that there was presumptive evidence that cream distributed by a London firm, which receives part of its supplies from Irish creameries, was responsible for the outbreak dealt with in the report referred to, I had the matter investigated.  As a result of inquiries, it was ascertained that three Saorstát creameries supplied cream to the firm in question during, and immediately before and after, the probable period of infection, and that the same creameries on the same dates had supplied cream to Dublin and to fifteen English <Col N="410" /> centres outside London.  It was also found that there was no outbreak at any of the places to which the Irish cream was supplied, save London. This fact would seem to prove conclusively that the source of infection could not have been the cream as received from the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the report submitted to the London County Council indicates that the London distributors, before disposing of the Saorstát cream, subjected it to treatment, and, consequently, it is possible that the Irish cream became contaminated in London.</P>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, when the report referred to appeared in the Press, the Department of Agriculture issued a statement, which was printed in the Irish daily papers of the 8th and 9th instant, giving the facts of the case.  A similar statement was handed to the Press Association by the Saorstát Trade Commissioner in London and appeared in some English papers, including the &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The price of fishing rights, in the absence of agreement, is to be fixed by the Land Commission, regard being had to the fair value of the fishery rights to the Land Commission and to the owners. In reselling fishery rights the Land Commission must have regard to the interests of the State as well as to those of riparian owners, and will endeavour to sell the fishery rights to the best advantage.  The Land Commission cannot bind themselves beforehand to sell fishery rights to any particular persons, but the claims of riparian owners will always have the most favourable consideration possible from them.  The price of resale must depend on all the circumstances of each case, but must at least be sufficient to repay the purchase money originally advanced for the purchase of these rights.</P>

      <P>That not more than three hours be given to the Report Stage of the Juries (Protection) Bill, 1929, and that the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at the expiration of the aforesaid period of three hours by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively any Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion: Provided that after the expiration of the said period of three hours a Question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment save on an amendment set down by the Government.</P>

    <P>Deputies who have read the motion will see that it proposes to give six hours to the Committee Stage and three hours to the Report Stage of the Juries Bill, which is a short and simple one.  It contains only thirteen sections, of which eleven are operative.  The number of points of principle in the Bill is small also, perhaps not more than three or four, and the opinion of the Government is that it is a Bill which can be very well discussed in Committee in the course of one day's sitting.  If we had not had the great number of amendments which have been sent in, no motion of this sort would have been moved.  We would have been content to have two sittings of the House occupied by the Committee Stage, and we would have been prepared to allow a reasonable time to satisfy all claims for the Report Stage, but when the amendments were received the Government came to the conclusion that it was intended to occupy a great deal more time with the Committee Stage than could be afforded. If all the amendments were put to the House and voted on, I think it would require practically a week's sittings merely to take the divisions. It would certainly require more than two whole days' sittings to take the divisions on the Committee Stage.  Deputies will recognise that for the House to spend its time in that way would be merely to waste time.  There is a comparatively small number of amendments put down that could possibly be accepted by a House which was prepared to pass the Bill.  The House has shown itself prepared to pass the Bill by giving it a Second Reading, and the number of amendments therefore which need to be discussed at any length, because they are amendments which might reasonably be accepted by the <Col N="419" /> House, is small.  It will be easily possible for Deputies to discuss these amendments within the time which it is proposed to allot to them.</P>
    <P>If Deputies on the Opposition Benches who have put down amendments will either not move or formally move amendments which patently have not the slightest chance of being accepted, I do not think that Deputies from this side of the House will occupy time in discussing them.  It will be possible, therefore, to take up the time it is proposed to allot by this motion with the amendments which I might describe as serious, amendments which might conceivably be passed by the House in view of the fact that it has accepted the general principle of the Bill.  The amendments are put down, not so much in the hope of having them passed or of making the Bill more acceptable to those who oppose it, but in the hope of occupying time, and that, to my mind, is proved, if further proof were necessary, by the amendment to the motion set down by Deputy Aiken.  The only effect of that amendment, if it were passed and the amended motion then accepted by the House, would be that, having spent six hours to-morrow discussing the Bill, the House would be engaged in walking through the Lobbies all day on Friday, all day on Wednesday, and probably part of the day on Thursday next.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need argue against the amendment in view of the result which it clearly would have.  The adequate discussion of any measure depends not at all so much on the amount of time actually taken up as on the spirit in which the discussion takes place. If Deputies on all sides are content to put points which are reasonable and at sufficient length to have them understood, and to take up no more time than is absolutely necessary to have them understood, it is possible to have a really good Committee discussion on a much longer and more complicated Bill than this within six hours.  In spite of the fact that a good many amendments <Col N="420" /> have been put down, if Deputies take the matter in a reasonable way it will be possible to have a thoroughly good discussion of the details of this Bill within six hours.  The principles of the Bill have been already discussed at very considerable length on Second Reading, and in view of the time already spent, and in view of the fact that it is proposed to allot three hours for the Report Stage, I think that the six hours proposed for the Committee Stage would be quite sufficient.</P>

      <P>I mean to confine myself to discussing the implications of my amendment, which I now move, namely:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the provisos to the first and second paragraphs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite apparent from what he said that the Minister for Finance either does not know the procedure of the House or is deliberately misrepresenting it.  It is very well known that when there is a large number of amendments to sections of a Bill the Ceann Comhairle has power to reject any amendments which he thinks are simply delaying amendments, and also, if he wishes, he can put questions which will allow the House to indicate whether or not it wants the amendments altered. If we are not simply to be turned into a mill for passing Bills which the Government introduce without any consideration, we should keep to Standing Orders.  Standing Orders give the Ceann Comhairle full scope for dealing with amendments, and, if there is a large number of amendments, Standing Orders give him power to put a certain question and it can be decided by the House whether or not it wants to amend certain sections.  Whatever can be said for limiting the discussion, there can be absolutely nothing said for doing away with the right of private members to alter sections of a Bill or to make suggestions.  I do not know whether there are any amendments down by members other than those of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I am sure that a Bill of such a serious nature as this will draw amendments <Col N="421" /> from all parties and sections in the House.  It is therefore only right that they should have an opportunity of testing whether the House desires to have any particular section amended.  We can discuss later, on the motion, this question of limiting the discussion of such a Bill to six hours; but whether it is limited to six, twenty-six, or thirty-six hours the rights of private members should be protected by giving them an opportunity of amending sections.  I think, sir, that you should rule those provisos out of order.  I certainly think they are not in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I feel that the reasonable and sensible people are being apparently pushed out between the two big Parties.  That is the way it strikes me.  The number of amendments put down by the Fianna Fáil Party are, according to the Minister for Finance, put down, not because they are considered and reasonable amendments or amendments that have a chance of being discussed, but are put down simply for the purpose of obstruction.  That is his view.  The Minister makes the extraordinary statement that in the ordinary way we would have been allowed two days for the discussion of the Committee Stage of the Bill but now, as the Fianna Fáil Party have put down so many amendments, we will be only allowed six hours, and people like Deputy O'Hanlon and myself, who have put down what we regard as reasonable amendments, are going to be pushed out.  That is the way I see it.  This Party has eight amendments on the Paper.  We have to accept the view that the Second Reading of the Bill was passed by the House.  We believe that these amendments are such that they are reasonable, and if we had an opportunity of arguing them, I have such confidence in the Minister's good sense that I believe they would be accepted, but we are not going to get that chance.  I do not know whether any attempt was made at making arrangements between the two big Parties in the House&mdash;I call them big in numbers only, I am not referring to their common sense or anything of that kind&mdash;as to what amendments should be discussed.  I say the effect of this motion in any case possibly will be that the six hours will be taken up in discussing the first few amendments on the Paper.  Then there will be a kind of gallop through the next amendments, and then we will only have put from the Chair the Minister's amendments.  As I say, it is quite <Col N="423" /> possible that good and useful amendments, those that would be accepted after argument in the House, will be pushed out altogether.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance is not treating us fairly in the attitude he is taking up when he says that he is deliberately curtailing the time which would, in the ordinary way, be devoted to the measure because of the action of the Opposition. I do not think that action is justifiable on the part of the Minister. He should remember that there are other parties and other members of the House besides the Fianna Fáil members.  If he is so desperately anxious to score off the Fianna Fáil Party, and make things unpleasant for them because they are making things unpleasant for him, I think he should remember that there are other interests to be served and other people to be considered.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should not move his motion to-day, that he should let us see how we can get on and how far we can get.  He says himself that two days would ordinarily be devoted to the Bill.  If he finds it necessary to-morrow to do it, let him move the motion.  Then, we would know better where we would be.  In any case, it would give us a chance of dropping the unimportant amendments and getting on with the important ones.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take that course, and that he should not move his amendment to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to remark, we are not going to be any party to any arrangement such as that suggested by the Minister.  When this motion appeared on the Order Paper, we got an opportunity of <Col N="424" /> gauging the supreme insolence it represents and when we had an opportunity of hearing the equally insolent speech by the Minister for Finance in supporting the motion it became quite obvious to us that the Government have no respect whatever for the ordinary institutions of this State or for any machinery that may exist for the purpose of ensuring that this State will be provided with good laws.  They are concerned only with the welfare of their own party and the furtherance of their own ideas.  I do not know by what perverted system of arithmetic the Minister arrived at the magnanimous decision to inform us that if we had not got the large number of amendments which have been received to the Bill, a much longer time would have been allowed for its discussion in Committee. Because the number of amendments is greater than he anticipated, he is going to curtail the time for the discussion of these amendments.  By the exercise of his majority in the House he is going to try to deprive Deputies of the right to amend one of the most important measures that ever came before the House.  We were informed when this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Justice that it was to constitute one of the great gems in the crown of Cumann na nGaedheal, but now, according to the Minister for Finance, it is much less important than the Censorship of Publications Bill which certainly took longer than six hours in Committee, or the Cork City Management Bill which also took longer than six hours.  The setting up of machinery for the censorship of publications, according to the Minister, is a much more important matter and deserves more detailed consideration than a Bill to amend the whole jury system of the country.  We have been informed by the Minister for Finance that the majority of the amendments on the paper are not likely to pass the House.  By what right does he inform us that amendments appearing on the Order Paper are not likely to pass the <Col N="425" /> House and therefore must not be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments tabled here are all serious amendments in an attempt to improve this rotten Bill. We hope, although the grounds for the hope may be very slight, that we may be able to convince a few of the machined members of Cumann na nGaedheal to accept proposals to lessen the iniquitous effects which the Bill is bound to have.  The Minister informs us that they would have allowed reasonable time if fewer amendments had been proposed, and, as Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches would not fall in with their ideas as to what are proper amendments, they are not going to allow reasonable time for their discussion.  That is in effect what the Minister said.  They are going to use the jack-boot on this occasion.  They are going to try to shove it through by brute force because they are afraid to hear it criticised.  I do not want to use words which might not be in good taste, but if I imitated the Minister for Defence, I would say that they had not the guts to discuss the Bill. The Minister told us that these amendments were not put down in the hope of having them discussed. He evidently knows more about the Fianna Fáil Party than the Fianna Fáil Party themselves.  He knows what was operating in the mind of Deputy Ruttledge much better than what Deputy Ruttledge knows. These amendments were not put down for the purpose of having them passed! By what right did he say that?  If they were not put down for the purpose of having them passed, it would, I think, be the duty of the Ceann Comhairle not to accept them, but they were put down for the purpose of having them passed, and they were put down as serious amendments.  It is because they are serious amendments the Minister is determined that the House will not get an opportunity of discussing them or an opportunity of expressing any opinion on them.  The principle of the Bill was, of course, debated on the Second Reading.  The Minister <Col N="426" /> for Justice, in his introductory speech, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have examined the workings of the jury system very narrowly, and we have concluded that real improvements in the jury system can be effected, and for that purpose we have introduced this Bill, not as a temporary expedient but as a permanent measure.  We are altering the existing system so as to make it meet present-day requirements.</P>
    <P>Is that the Bill that was discussed on Second Reading, the Bill that is going to pass this House when the majority comes into operation?  I see an amendment on the Order Paper to alter its character fundamentally, to alter the Bill from being a permanent measure into a purely temporary measure.  This Bill was not discussed, I will admit, as a permanent measure at all.  It was discussed in relation to certain nonsensical statements made by the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Agriculture, and numerous back bench members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, nonsensical statements relating to a purely temporary situation, but it was not discussed as a permanent measure at all.  It was introduced as a permanent measure, but, as I say, it is not going to be a permanent measure at all.  This is the Bill that we are told was adequately discussed on the Second Reading.  If it was adequately discussed on the Second Reading, I would advise the Minister for Finance to look up the Official Debates. If he does, he will realise that it was discussed by many members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. They were jumping up all over the House in their anxiety to speak on it.  At least twice as many members from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party spoke on that Bill as there did from all the other parties in the House put together.</P>
    <P>We want to see this Bill properly discussed, because we believe that, if passed, it is going to do inestimable harm, not merely to the stability of the country but to the <Col N="427" /> proper operation of the jury system. We believe that we can put forward a reasonable case for the various amendments that appear on the Order Paper.  We want to get an opportunity of doing so.  We want to get an opportunity of endeavouring to throw some light on the dark ignorance of back-benchers in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party so that they may see the real harm they are endeavouring to do.  The Bill, I notice, was introduced as the Juries (Protection) Bill.  It has now become the Juries (Amendment) Bill. I do not know the exact significance of the change.</P>

      <P>As I said, this Bill is called the Juries (Protection) Bill.  The Minister for Justice did not describe it as such when introducing it.  He stated that it was a Bill to improve generally the administration of criminal justice in this <Col N="428" /> country.  &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; was the word he used.  It is not the word I would use, but that is perhaps beside the point, and I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would admit if that is in order.  The Bill must be considered by us in relation to the amendments which we know the Government propose to introduce, and which they undoubtedly will have passed.  The Minister for Justice is the puppet of the forces behind the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  He is prepared to come to heel, not when he is criticised by fifty-seven representatives in this House, but when he is criticised by the writer of the-leading article in that journal.  We argued here for two days against the making of this Bill a permanent measure.  The Minister ridiculed our arguments and treated them with scorn and contempt, but as soon as the whip was cracked by the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; he changed his tune.  The Minister himself is now coming forward to introduce an amendment which he ridiculed when it was suggested from these benches.</P>
      <P>It is this Bill, as a temporary measure, that I suggest we have now got to consider.  We have got to consider whether the changes which the Government propose to effect in the jury system are changes which should be made for a short period only.  If there is one institution in this country in which there should not be periodic changes, constant chopping, and constant alteration it is in the system of the courts.  If the Bill was introduced to deal with a certain situation which, as alleged, exists in this country, then it should be confined in its operations to dealing with that situation.  But the Bill was introduced as a permanent measure, and it proposed to effect changes in the jury system without any relation whatever to any situation now existing in the country, and it is still proposed to effect those changes despite the fact that the Bill is now to be a purely temporary piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, of course, adopt the view that any attempt to change a proposal introduced by the Government&mdash;by the <Col N="429" /> ten or eleven wise men who constitute it&mdash;is so iniquitous in itself that every device should be availed of in order to prevent its happening.  Possibly there is not in the whole of the sixty-four or sixty-five members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party one man with sense enough to see what the Government are proposing to do. I do not believe that.  I, apparently, hold a much higher opinion of the mentality of the general members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party than the members of the Executive Council do.  I believe that a number of them, at any rate, are reasonable men, and that after they have heard a reasonable case for every single amendment that we have on the Order Paper to this Bill, they might be induced to ignore the Party whip for one lucid moment and come into the Division Lobby along with us. The Minister for Finance spoke of the amendments altogether.  They were all, he told us, introduced merely for delaying purposes.  He did not go to the trouble of indicating a single one of the amendments which it could be shown was introduced to that end.</P>
    <P>We propose to delete certain sections of the Bill.  We do not approve of the Bill, and we want to make it as little harmful as we can. We believe that every single section of it could be deleted with advantage to the country.  We could make a separate case for the deletion of each section of it.  I do not want to discuss the Bill in detail now, but there are certain sections of it so obviously foolish and so obviously designed merely to stir up trouble in this country, that it is possible we may succeed in getting a majority in the House in favour of their deletion.  Members of the Executive Council, and the Minister for Finance, should not forget that they had at least one vote in favour of the Second Reading of the Bill from a Deputy who described it as a prostitution of the jury system. No doubt that Deputy will be delighted to hear that it is only going to be a temporary prostitution of the jury system, and therefore can reconcile his conscience with the <Col N="430" /> vote which he gave for the Bill on Second Reading.  Possibly there are other Deputies who also thought it to be the class of Bill the Deputy described, but who have, notwithstanding, voted for it, because of their ties to Cumann na nGaedheal and their obligations thereunder to the Executive Council.  It seems to me that a Bill of this kind dealing with one of the most important institutions of the State should not be steam-rolled through the Dáil. We think it is a very undesirable precedent to establish.  We think Deputies should oppose this motion if for no other reason than that it does establish a precedent.  As I have said, this Bill is probably one of the most important that is likely to be introduced into the Dáil in this session, and the Government propose to treat it as a minor measure.  They do not propose to allow the same time for discussion on the Committee Stage as they allowed for at least one half the Bills introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bills took weeks in Committee. The Cork City Management Bill was before the House for almost the entire period of three months. The Censorship of Publications Bill was up in Committee day after day, and a much larger number of amendments was introduced than in the case of this Bill, yet there was no attempt to closure discussion on these measures.  Does the Minister for Justice think the Censorship of Publications Bill a more important measure than this?  Does he think more danger would arise to the stability of this country if that Bill was obstructed than is likely to arise through this Bill if passed?  I stated on the Second Reading that my view of this Juries (Protection) Bill was that it was not introduced to protect jurors, but in pursuance of the Government's policy to stir up disorder, and to keep alive the hate and bitterness created by the civil war in 1922.  They are playing the one game all the time.  They realise that it is to their party advantage to keep the national forces divided.  They are playing on the one string, without policy, programme <Col N="431" /> or constructive ability. They have no hope of maintaining their position in the country, except they base it on the hate created here when the guns were opened on the Four Courts.  It is because the Bill is of that nature that I appeal to the Deputies of Cumann na nGaedheal, some of whom have, as I have said, a reasonable outlook, to vote against the proposal to closure discussion on this Bill.  If they are not afraid to stand over the votes they will give, they will vote against this motion.  We will give them adequate opportunity of making any case they have for every section of this Bill.  If they think their case is good enough they will not be afraid to make it.  It is because they know that no convincing argument can be produced against this Bill that they will vote for the closure, because they are afraid of criticism of the measure and afraid of public opinion.  They have seen that opposition to this Bill is not confined to supporters of Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.  They have seen, as I have said, a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; and that has brought them to a realisation of the danger of their position. They have seen such conservative journals as the &ldquo;Irish Statesman&rdquo; criticising and denouncing the Bill. It is because they have stepped on a wasps' nest that they are trying to push through this Bill in the dark, because they are afraid to push it through in the open.  There is a case to be made against this Bill that has nothing to do with any need that may exist for affording protection to jurors.  This Bill has an ulterior motive.</P>
    <P>It is a continuation of the campaign which opened at the by-election in the North City to misrepresent the position in this country, to stir up disorder and try and make conditions here something like what President Cosgrave described them to be, because they know people realise that conditions are not one-half as bad as they are trying to make them, or as bad as he wants them to be.  We have seen how <Col N="432" /> President Cosgrave telegraphed to America not to mind the scare-mongers. The only scare-mongers concerned in this matter are those sitting on the Government Benches. They started the scare and they pushed the scare.  When the North City election was over they tried to stop the scare.  There is another by-election now, and consequently the scare must be revived.  That is why this Bill was introduced.  I believe this Bill will be inoperative, that the sections in it which might claim to afford protection to jurymen will not be availed of, and that the Government do not want them to be availed of; but they are playing ducks and drakes with the legal system of the country for party purposes. They do not care one jot about the harm they do either to the machinery for the administration of the law or respect for the law amongst the people, provided they can snatch a few extra votes.</P>
    <P>Again I ask Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies to realise that, if this Bill goes through, and if as a result there is chaos in the judicial system, and there is more than chaos existing outside the courts, they will be responsible. They will have the opportunity, if the Committee Stage takes its normal course, to remove any of the points of danger they may see in the Bill or which may be pointed out to them.  If they vote for the motion they are depriving themselves of that right.  They are the elected representatives of the people, and not elected to sit here as dummies to vote whatever way the Cumann na nGaedheal Whips tell them to vote.  They were sent here to represent the interests of their constituents.  Do they think it is in the interests of their constituents that a Bill of this kind should go through without discussion and proper opportunity for examination of the measure?  If they do they are a poor type of representatives. Not merely is the Government proposing to prevent discussion on this measure but it is going further than it has ever gone before&mdash;it is going to stop amendment of this measure. Only amendments introduced by the Minister for Justice are to be put to <Col N="433" /> the House.  After six hours have elapsed the other Deputies are to be deprived of the rights guaranteed to them under the Constitution and the Standing Orders by a majority, a big, brutal, ignorant majority in this House.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Aiken to this motion is, I think it will be admitted by most reasonable people, a sensible amendment.  Even if you do not want amendment, even if you are afraid of criticism and argument, surely you are not afraid of giving members of your own Party the opportunity of voting on the various amendments on the Paper?  Is it because the Government cannot feel certain of the loyalty of their pledged members? Is it because they realise there is still some brains and common sense left in the back benchers of their Party?  That must be the only explanation, because otherwise they surely would not be afraid to have these amendments at least voted on, even if they are voted on without discussion.  That is all that Deputy Aiken's amendment asked for.  He says, in effect: &ldquo;Let us have the six hours' discussion, if that is all your majority is going to allow, but after that six hours' discussion is over, at least let the House have an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the amendments.&rdquo; The Government declined to give that opportunity.  Why?  There are only two explanations possible: either they fear that these amendments would be passed in consequence of some weakness in the loyalty of members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or else, as I said, they are so indifferent to the preservation of the rights of the elected Deputies of the people, so indifferent to the democratic institutions of which they boast from election platforms, that they are careless of the consequences of the motion, careless of the precedent that this establishes, so long as their Party purposes are served by it.  I <Col N="434" /> do not know if there is a third explanation&mdash;possibly there is, and the explanation is laziness.  Deputies may dislike sitting in this House in hot weather&mdash;they do not dislike it any more than I do; but I have a conscience.  Deputies perhaps would like to have explained to them what a conscience is.  I accepted the responsibility of representing the people of South Dublin City constituency, and whether it is pleasant or not to sit here in hot or cold weather, I intend, to the best of my ability, to carry out that undertaking. Deputies on the other side prefer to shirk responsibility, prefer to put through a motion such as this, and then spend a greater number of months of the summer on the golf links, or at the seaside, instead of in the House.  I hope for the sake of public decency, for the sake of the honour of members of the Dáil, that the motion will be defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if this motion is passed we are taking a long step in the way of the abolition of democratic institutions altogether.  I know that members of the Executive Council feel that they could manage the affairs of this country much better than they are doing at present if they were not subject to criticism in this House, if they were relieved of the necessity of having to explain measures, if they were established as commissioners, dictators, or despots of some kind, and given a free hand to do what they liked with national affairs.  This is the first step in that direction, a step which does not go the whole way towards the abolition of the Dáil, but does go a very considerable way towards the making of the Dáil a useless and ineffective body.  If motions of this kind are to be introduced whenever important measures come before the House, those of us who have some respect left for ourselves will have to consider very seriously whether we can continue to be members of the House. We came in here as the elected representatives of the people, and as nothing else.  We came in here to give the best there is in us in order to ensure that good laws will be enacted, and that institutions will be <Col N="435" /> established in this State for which it would be possible to have public respect. Do you think if this Bill goes through in this manner, in consequence of the passing of this motion, there is any decent-minded man in this country who will have any respect for the courts of law that will operate under it?  Of course he will not.  I know Deputies will stand up now and make play with that statement, but I tell you that there is nobody in this country with a normal outlook upon affairs who can have any respect for a court of law operating under a Bill passed in the manner which the Government proposes this Bill should be passed.</P>
    <P>Members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party maintain that they are trying to restore respect for law and order in this country.  They are trying to destroy respect for it, I maintain.  They are certainly going the best way about it, whether it is through sheer ignorance, or whether it is through lack of foresight. By the introduction of such Bills as this and by the making of such speeches as we listened to on the Second Reading of the Bill from the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Justice, you are engendering in the minds of the people the idea that political bias and not justice is going to operate in your courts. That idea is there in many minds already.  It will be there with very good reason if this Bill is passed in the manner which the Minister for Finance has proposed.  If the Government felt that there was any reasonable case to be made out for this Bill, we would have heard that case.  We did not hear it on the Second Reading.  We heard, as I said, nonsensical statements about a situation which is alleged to exist and Fianna Fail's complicity in that situation.  We heard the Minister for Justice telling the House that I and other Deputies were puppets of a murder gang.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling. I maintain that if there is one Bill to the consideration of which we should be prepared, if necessary, to give the whole session, it is this Bill, because the consequences of this Bill are likely to extend outside the courts of law altogether.  I do not believe it was introduced, as the Minister told us, to improve the administration of criminal justice in this country.  That was not the prime consideration that operated in the mind of the Executive Council.  It was not even the argument, as I said, which was placed before the Dáil in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill may have some minor good points in it, and if there are some minor good points, we want them preserved.  We attempt to preserve them in the amendments which we propose to move.  We believe if these amendments were accepted a Bill would go through this House which would be certainly much less harmful than the Bill as introduced, and a Bill which would not have the consequences which the original Bill would be likely to have.  I appeal to Deputies, especially those who are not pledged members of Cumann na nGaedheal, to realise that they have a duty to their constituents to see that this Bill gets a fair discussion and <Col N="437" /> consideration, and that everybody in the House who, like them, are elected representatives of the people, should get an opportunity of proposing any amendments to the Bill they think it requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister for Finance has endeavoured to put forward a very plausible reason for the need for a time limit on the discussion of this Bill, I ask the House to reject his proposal.  There is a very big principle at stake in this suggested time limit.  Irrespective of this Bill or any other Bill or subject which may be under discussion in the House, I am one of those who believe that it should be discussed in a businesslike way and that sufficient time should be given to discuss it in all its aspects.  The only reason the Minister has put forward for the adoption of this time limit is that a limit should be put upon the discussion in order, as he believes, to save time.  I would like to point out that according to the Standing Orders the Dáil is empowered to meet four days per week. For some considerable time past it has only met three days per week, and the reason that it has only met three days a week is because of the fact, I understand, that a handful of Government supporters, Independent and Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, have made it clear to the Government that they are not prepared to remain in attendance four days per week.  In other words, in order to carry along with a mechanical majority, the House is only meeting three days per week.  As far as that matter is concerned, did Deputies who come to this House elected by their constituents tell those constituents at election time that if they were elected they were not prepared to devote four days per week to the business to be transacted in the House.  The position is that, in order to suit the convenience of those particular Deputies, the House only meets three days in the week, and consequently we are asked to limit discussion with regard to certain subjects and certain Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time that we <Col N="438" /> were asked to put a time limit upon the discussion of subjects that came before the House.  Prior to the Christmas Recess I raised the question of unemployment.  At that particular time the House, at the suggestion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, agreed to give me only two and a-half hours for the discussion of that subject owing to the fact that at that time again the House was only meeting for two-and-a-half days per week.  I think we should reconsider, our position.  There might be some reason for the Minister putting forward this suggestion if the House was meeting three-and-a-half days or four days in the week; but in view of the fact that we are only meeting two-and-a-half days in the week, I think the House should reject this motion.  Whether on this Bill or on any other, Deputies should get sufficient time to put forward amendments, and to discuss them in Committee without any time limit or closure, such as has been suggested by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in the claim of a majority to misuse that majority, nor, I think, is there anything new to this House in the practice of the misuse of a majority by a majority.  What we are dealing with is a new machinery for carrying out a very old lack of principle, which is illustrated in the regular practice and conduct of the present Government.  The Minister for Agriculture has publicly laid down the principle that minorities in this House or in the country are entitled, and must accept, as long as this Government is in power, the very minimum exercise of right.  He has clearly and honestly&mdash;I always like to give those people credit for honesty even in evil&mdash;laid down the principle that minorities must suffer and not merely that but that they must be prepared to undergo the absolute maximum of suffering which the majority can impose upon them.  If any man doubts that amazing doctrine, if any man doubts that that doctrine has been enunciated in this House, I advise him to go back to the records of the House and to the speeches of the Minister <Col N="439" /> for Agriculture on the Constitution (Amendment) Bills and he will find that that is the real world as distinct from the normal world in which we live in this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has set out various reasons why he has introduced this particular motion and why he resisted the amendment which is in the name of Deputy Aiken and he has stated various other reasons why he will, in turn, resist the motion to reject this motion.  But the one man who has the honesty from the Government Benches to declare the real reason that is behind the Government's action&mdash;the driving force behind all their machinery&mdash;is the Minister for Agriculture, when he says &ldquo;Woe to the minority in this House which is in a minority of a single one, whatever may be the merits of the case, so long as we, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, possess one more.&rdquo;  It is said that Parliament can do anything.  This is a proof that there are no limits to the violence of the intention of this Government in relation to what this Parliament will do with the liberties of other people.  There is no logical difference&mdash;none at any rate that I can see&mdash;between making this provision six hours and making it six minutes. There is no reason why under this machinery a constitution amendment which would make this Dáil and its present membership and majority permanent, should not be put through without any discussion whatever, without any question in relation to that Bill being put to the House except whether the majority now in the House were prepared to make themselves the permanent governors of the State.</P>

      <P>All right.  If this House votes for this motion it is voting for this principle in relation to all future legislation&mdash;whatever Government may be in power, the principle in relation to a particular Bill which is before the House that the House shall not be allowed to express opinions by a vote in relation to any detail or to any amendment of the Bill other than the details and the amendments which the Minister in charge of the Bill desires.  We are not concerned at the moment with a mere incidental piece of the machinery of Government for the purpose of getting through a particular Bill.  We have brought out here for the first time, in the history of this House at any rate, the principle of selective suppression of discussion, and the principle of selective repression of amendments.  That is perfectly new to the House, and it is universal in its application.  This House must recognise that in any little incidental act of this kind which it does; in any little incidental action, however small, which it may take, it is setting a precedent which no further or future action of this House will ever be able to prevent being a precedent. To do a thing and say it is not going to be a precedent is simply fighting the air.  What is being done here now can and will be used by reckless people upon the Front Benches for similar purposes in relation to other Bills.  Every member of this House, in considering whether or not he will vote for this provision in relation to this measure, must envisage the whole possible range of legislation to which it may be applied, and say to himself that in relation to the whole of that future legislation he is prepared <Col N="441" /> to have it applied and to regard the application of it as good for this State and for this House. Frankly, I do not think that the House thinks anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard my friend, Deputy Lemass, say that he still has some illusions. I wish I had.  He has illusions that there are moments of sanity, moments of lucidity, moments of conscious regard, moments in which ordinary members of Cumann na nGaedheal do advert to the responsibility which they took upon themselves, moments in which it is possible for them to consider themselves bound to carry out these responsibilities. What evidence is there of that?  On what can Deputy Lemass found such an idea except on the goodness of his heart and the belief that, after all, even continual bad associations cannot have completely corrupted what originally was probably humanly good.  I, personally, have extremely little hope that it will be the ordinary backbencher of Cumann na nGaedheal and a revived and resurgent regard for his conscientious responsibility that will settle this matter.  I believe, without doubting, that another authority will settle this matter.  It is in order that that other authority may have the opportunity, by a public discussion here, by the examination among themselves of what has been said here, by the weighing up of arguments pro and con which will be delivered upon this thing, it is in the hope that that other authority, the electorate of this country, shall have an opportunity of having this measure examined before it fully, that they will have on the records of this House the opinion of every single Deputy whom they have sent here in relation to every detailed suggestion of change with regard to this Bill, it is because I believe that the higher and overriding authority has the right, and ought to have the opportunity, of forming a judgment upon that evidence that I oppose in the first place the provisos which are put into this measure and, when we have discussed that matter, the motion to which these provisos are <Col N="442" /> added.  Deputy O'Connell has raised the point that this House is not made up merely of the Government and their successors; that it includes representatives in Labour, in inverted commas, and real labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Independents in inverted commas, and some who show their independence upon occasion when safety in that independence has not been guaranteed to them by the previous knowledge that the Government and its successors were going to vote together.  Behind that plea there is a real matter.  According to this provision, assuming for the moment that the Minister for Finance has a prescience in this matter that he has not in finance; assuming for a moment that anybody in this House, for the purpose of interfering with the rights of the whole House, will adopt the procedure which the Minister for Finance accuses us of having adopted; assuming that any individual member did in his individual capacity&mdash;and he would be entitled to do it&mdash;what he alleges Deputy Ruttledge has done, the logical result would be that the capacity of this whole House, of the Government and the Opposition, to discuss any measure adequately, could and would be taken away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This procedure is two-edged.  If the Minister can take away from the Dáil, by the mere accusation of intention to obstruct, the power to discuss a measure, any member of this House can, by using precisely the same machinery which he accuses us of using, take away the power to discuss any measure.  The Minister's suggestion is that procedure of this kind is going to save time. He will find that he has made a mistake even in making such a suggestion. Under its Standing Orders this House has certain powers and <Col N="443" /> rights, and when a majority will publicly say to a minority: &ldquo;The smallest possible exercise of those rights, and only the smallest possible exercise of those rights, will be allowed to you,&rdquo; the answer of the minority will be that the largest possible exercise of those rights, large or small, will be taken by them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the previous experience of the Government has been that methods of this kind are going to have a time-saving effect. You are dealing here with a Bill which, on our contention, is going to interfere with the confidence of the people in the administration of justice. Is that the kind of Bill to add a procedure to which is going to interfere with the confidence of the people, even in the discussion of the measure?  If ever there was a Bill to which restrictive action of this kind should not be applied, it is this Bill, because it is in itself a restrictive Bill, because it is in itself a Bill to reduce publicity, and to apply to that a machinery whose whole purpose is to reduce publicity of discussion, and to prevent us having it on record in relation to every Deputy in this House what his opinion was in every detail.  Surely unless that is done in a spirit of pure recklessness no man would possibly have chosen this Bill for that purpose. What sort of respect will you get for the verdicts of juries under a Bill of this kind, introduced and passed in this manner! Which one of us, when we do come to a case of a man actually being condemned to death, will have any confidence in the justice of that verdict and the justice of that execution, having regard to the fact that you have a Star Chamber trying him, and a Star Chamber making arrangements for trying him?  I want respect for verdicts. I want the people to have confidence that verdicts are correctly given, because unless and until you have that you will not get, and you ought not to get, behind the verdicts of courts the sanction and the authority of the people.  Here you have a Bill which does produce a Star Chamber atmosphere in the court, <Col N="444" /> and you multiply that by the Star Chamber atmosphere in which you actually lay down the regulations for that court.  &ldquo;Criminal justice&rdquo; I think the Minister for Justice called it.  In this case justice will be the criminal.  We must look out to all the reactions of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass alluded to the fact that there might be good minor points in this Bill.  I believe there are.  At any rate, there is an opportunity for good minor points to be introduced into it.  There is an amendment down&mdash;I am not going to deal with the merits&mdash;which deals with the position which, at the moment, is embarrassing, and sometimes a bit absurd.  I am only going to deal with the fact that we may not get to it.  That is the case where men may refuse to recognise the court.  The procedure at present is, in my opinion, absurd.  It is elaborate; it is costly, and does not produce any result commensurate with the cost.  How do we know that we will get to the amendment, which says that in a case where recognition of the court is refused, a verdict of not guilty shall be automatically entered and the case shall proceed?  How can we guarantee that we shall get to that amendment at all?  I might go through the whole of the amendments. I could take Deputy O'Hanlon's and ask: What guarantee is there that it will ever be mentioned? There are some amendments from the Labour Party.  How are they going to be picked out as ones upon which even the decision of the House, apart from discussion of the House, is going to be obtained? Personally I see no machinery provided under these resolutions. There are alternative machineries. I am not advocating any of them. There is what is known as the closure by compartment and the kangaroo closure.  There are half a dozen devices of that kind which have been invented for the purpose of dealing with actual difficulties in relation to amendments of this kind. For instance, under certain provisions power is given to the occupant <Col N="445" /> of the Chair to pick out of the whole of the amendments the amendments which he regards as most significant.</P>
    <P>
      <b>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</b> took the Chair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is given in other cases power, as I say, of kangaroo closure, where the Chair is allowed to jump over perhaps ten amendments into another amendment, where selected amendments which have behind them particular bodies of opinion in the House, as distinct from amendments which might have a general body, are marked out so that if there were, say, half a dozen Labour amendments there would be an assurance that some of these which were regarded as most significant by the Labour Party would be discussed.  There is no such machinery here unless it is intended that the Minister for Justice is to go back and actually read the amendments by Deputy Ruttledge. That is conceivable.  It is just conceivable that he may for a moment tremble on to sanity in this matter, go back through the amendments of Deputy Ruttledge and pick out of those the forty or fifty which are of importance, see that they are properly discussed and individually put to the House.  But there is no provision whatever for him to go through and pick out any single one of these amendments.  If for instance, you could get somebody who was recklessly disregardful of the time of the House, somebody who was really obstructive and skilfully determined to use his powers under the rules and who would make a strictly relevant speech for six hours&mdash;I mean any individual member upon any bench who is capable of making a strictly relevant speech for six hours on the first amendment: it has been done, as you know &mdash;he could cut out the whole of the rest of the discussion for the whole of the House.  There is no provision whatever to deal with that.  Pigs in a poke are publicly-exposed and intimately-photographed things compared with the details of this Bill <Col N="446" /> as it will be approved of by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the decision has been taken by the House to upset the whole principle of the Bill as introduced, nobody does know which resolutions and amendments are of critical significance. The Bill, as introduced, pretended&mdash;it is simply that dishonest sort of pretence which, frankly, we do not get from the Minister for Agriculture; we get a different kind of dishonest attempt at pretence from him&mdash;that the Minister for Justice, with far-seeing wisdom, examining into the details of the administration of justice in the Free State, had been dissatisfied with these details in relation to criminal trial, and that he and his associates sat down in careful conclave, getting the whole of the information which could be got and the opinions of everyone whom it did, in fact, concern and that he had evolved this perfect piece of new legislation permanently to deal, as an ordinary condition, with the whole state of the criminal law, in relation to trial by jury in this State.  That was to cover every single sort of trial of criminals.  He was disturbed by the present state of the criminal law.  He calmly and consistently, as part of a scheme that was going to exist permanently, contrived this thing.  Because&mdash;I think it was alleged in the paper&mdash;Deputy Tierney made a speech or for some other reason, he has discovered that it is better frankly to acknowledge that it had none of those origins and none of those purposes, that it was intended to be a temporary device to deal with a temporary condition in relation to a narrowly-specified body of people.  Is that the Bill to which it was possible for us to draft amendments before that particular provision had been put into it by the Minister?  What is to be the position if the House spends the time in discussing that significant amendment? The condition in respect of the texture of a tennis shirt&mdash;something you are going to wear in the hot weather, something you wear <Col N="447" /> for momentary relief&mdash;is a very different thing from the house in which you are going to live.</P>
    <P>This Bill, now changed from a temporary to a permanent condition, bears as much relation in respect to its previous condition and its future condition as the tennis shirt bears to the house.  Yet we are told that we have agreed to buy a tennis shirt when, according to the Minister, we had been taking a lease of land for 999 years on which to build a whole system of criminal law.  The one thing might be part of the whole judicial system of the country.  It might concern this generation and five generations hence, because when you pass a thing permanently you are supposed, at least, to envisage it as permanent, and not to assume that the thing is merely for the moment.  How are we going to pick out, and what machinery is there provided to enable us to pick out, the amendments which will be significant in one case and insignificant in the other?  I might be prepared to drink a glass of whiskey.  It is quite a different thing to put the tap of the whiskey barrel in my mouth and keep it permanently pouring there. The one may be a tonic; the other produces the condition which we are perfectly familiar with in relation to the administration of justice.  Are we to regard this as a tonic, a medicine, a weapon or a food?  Are we to regard it as a ribbon to decorate the Minister for Justice or the permanent uniform of the Ministry of Justice?  If we are not even told that now, how can we frame or select out our amendments?  Of course, I suppose it will all be the same in a thousand years.  I believe this Bill is going to be as sterile, as useless, as incapable of operation for any useful purpose in this State as the Public Safety Bill, which the electorate killed in its birth.  I believe the position in relation to the Public Safety Bill has been reproduced in relation to this Bill.  They knew the Public Safety Bill, after they had passed it, and after the people had seen it, was bad.  They knew it was a disgrace; they knew it <Col N="448" /> was a calumny upon this country, but they had not the little miserable courage to destroy their own child.</P>
    <P>They know now that this thing is bad.  They know that it is purely and simply a conspiracy against the public peace.  They know that it will be used, if it is used at all, for the lowest possible exploitation of party authority over party opponents in the name, or misname, of justice.  They have already thrown away a thousand years' possession. They already know it is a thing that cannot, with any respect to the State, permanently exist in the State.  But they have not got the miserable little courage to get rid of the other eighteen months&mdash;or is it a year?  In that time they shall have to clear the Augean stable.  The Minister for Justice will be the only man in a position to treat the law with contempt.  I think that long before this Bill disappears&mdash;and I believe it will disappear before even its limited term&mdash;this Government will be satisfied that the name of this Bill also will be written upon the political tombstone under which they will lie in the contempt of every decent and honourable man. I think it was the Minister for Defence, in relation to a Bill as important as a Constitution (Amendment) Bill, asked that we should pause, that we should examine, that we should consider, that we should use the weapon of delay for the purpose of allowing misunderstanding, misrepresentation, heats and other things of that kind to disappear; that in relation to matters which struck, not at the machinery, but at the basic foundation of the State, delay was immensely valuable perse; that the knowledge that a thing was done pausefully, the knowledge that a thing was done with consideration, that every possible implication of an act had been considered and weighed before that act took place was valuable.  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings there sometimes cometh wisdom.  Why not apply that principle to this Bill before we upset a system of trial which has some hundreds of years of sanction behind it, a system of trial <Col N="449" /> which has been grossly and grievously mistreated, as we know, in this country in the past, but which, if not mistreated, but treated decently and kindly and with respect, has a great deal to be said for it? Why upset it in six hours?</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be unlimited time for discussion elsewhere.  In the really responsible hours, it may be some consolation to the House to know that when it passes from the survey of people who have merely gone through the electoral fire and goes into the hands of those who have been made pure and holy by a caucus, it will be properly considered and that possibly just as the amendments of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; are acceptable, because the independents might become independent, those amendments that come from that august body may be accepted even though they may not be allowed to be discussed in this House.  If that be so, if the experience of the House was that they could hand on, without any sense of responsibility or security, to our friends up above the duties which they themselves ought to perform, there would be a lot to be said for dividing out the work.  But has it been our experience that Bills of fundamental importance that call for all this assuagement of delay were delayed, that they were considered there in detail, that they were examined, that they were, for instance, changed from the permanency of the Public Safety Act in its first stage to its impermanency after a General Election&mdash;has that been our experience, or has our experience been that these gentlemen up above do what they have been told to do, that they take the precautions of passing around envelopes to see that nothing goes wrong in the procedure, that exactly as it comes from this House without the change of a word, a sentence or a comma, we can rely upon those good people to pass and send down to this House, with the maximum of celerity, any Bill which would have been passed by Arthur James Balfour, Greenwood, Spencer or a few others. <Col N="450" /> What guarantee have we, when we have let it pass out of our hands that hands more responsible, more loving of the public peace of this country, will fondle and nurse it?  Any?</P>
    <P>When this nursling passes from the keeping of the House it passes into the possession of a majority at least as reckless, at least as disregardful of individual right, at least as disregardful of public policy as the majority who tell us that the rights of the minority, and the rights they are to expect are the minimum rights.  Personally, I have no guarantee that the House could go against its own responsibility to carry out its own duties.  If the only legislation which the Deputies opposite are prepared to pass, if the only consideration which the Deputies opposite are prepared to give to these amendments is the legislation with their feet, well at any rate their heads will be counted during the process, and that will be to the good.  I have only dealt for a moment very rigorously and very strictly with the amendment itself. Afterwards it will be necessary for us to consider on somewhat broader lines the motion and its rejection. But nothing that has been said in the House, up to the present, nothing that a fairly fertile imagination on my part has been able to provide, has shown any reason whatever why this House should consent to have put in the main provisos which are put in here.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been put forward to suggest that this new machinery for sterilising the responsibility of legislators in relation to legislation should be allowed to be introduced. Nothing has been shown which enables me, at any rate, to find a means afterwards of preventing the successors of this Government misusing the like machinery for the same purpose.  I do hope there will come into the possession of it, in possession of the Government of this House, those who believe that the minority have something more than the barest allowance which the majority is unable to take from them.  If that is the principle, and <Col N="451" /> as long as those gentlemen opposite legislate in the country it is the principle, this proviso as added to this Bill is a great danger to security in the State, great danger to responsibility in legislation, and a radical blow to the use and value of this House as a legislative assembly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received two little pieces of personal information this afternoon.  One of them was from Deputy Lemass informing us that he had a conscience, a very sensitive conscience, and that following the dictates of that conscience, no matter how hot it was, he was willing to make any necessary number of speeches and go any number of times into the Division Lobby.  Deputy Flinn informed us that he had a very fertile imagination.  I think Deputy Flinn might have claimed a conscience just as much as Deputy Lemass, because if making an extremely long speech is performing your duty to your constituents then certainly Deputy Flinn performed that duty this afternoon.  But when he talks about his fertile imagination I am afraid it is not quite so easy to follow Deputy Flinn, because if his imagination is fertile in producing arguments he managed to keep those arguments, despite the length of his speech, entirely within his own breast.  For a more commonplace speech I think it would be very hard to hear anywhere delivered.  Deputy Flinn brought up arguments which always can be brought up against the closure.  These arguments, if applied to the full, would mean that a minority in a House like this, a minority in a legislative assembly could, if they wished, hold up the majority who are desirous of passing legislation for the country's good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every deliberative assembly there must, if the work of that assembly is to be properly carried out, be certain provisions for closuring unnecessary, and I might even go so far as to say, deliberately unnecessary <Col N="452" /> discussion, so that the work of the assembly may be carried on.  Deputy Flinn, in some of his examples, was rather unhappy.  For instance, he said that there was a very excellent amendment standing in the name of Deputy Ruttledge&mdash; that a plea of not guilty should be automatically given where persons refuse to recognise the court, and he was very sorry, moved to tears, by the possibility that that amendment could not come on for discussion until after six hours had elapsed. But that amendment means nothing. That is the existing common law. That is what exactly happens at the present moment.  Deputy Flinn also said that there were forty or fifty amendments of importance, admitting thereby that there were forty or fifty or more amendments of no importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What else could it mean?  He said forty or fifty amendments of importance.  As there are, roughly, one hundred amendments in Deputy Ruttledge's name, it appears that the balance, and those in Deputy Flinn's name, at any rate, are of no importance. So it seems to me, and I entirely agree with Deputy Flinn, except that he does not put the number quite high enough. Deputy Lemass mentioned in one part of his speech that I, in my opening statement, had used words to this effect, that I regarded this Bill not as a temporary expedient, but as a permanent measure, and that I looked upon this Bill as being rather an improvement of the jury system in this country.  I stated so then, and I adhere to that statement now.  I believe it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two cardinal principles of this Bill are (1) that there should be a majority verdict.  I believe that is a great improvement.  The other principle is that the jury panel should not be indiscriminately circulated, that the old practice in this country should be tightened up in order that in times like the times we are passing through, jurymen should not be intimidated and murdered, and also in ordinary times that persons of influence <Col N="453" /> and importance may not be able to get a jury panel and to go round to jurors and canvass jurors and so defeat the ends of justice.  I consider that these are two of the main principles in the Bill and are really improvements of the jury system in this country.</P>

      <P>I am merely explaining this point, and I will not go any further in that connection. The reason I make this Bill temporary is that I believe completely in the correctness of the arguments that I put forward and the stand I have taken up.

      <P>I will not say more so, but they are genuinely interested.  Deputy O'Connell, speaking on behalf of his Party, has expressed doubts as to whether this Bill would work.  I am willing to let him see it working for a couple of years.  At the end of a couple of years, when this Bill has been seen working, I believe it will have proved a complete success.  It can <Col N="454" /> then be entirely re-considered. Those are the motives and the only motives which are in my mind.  If there are persons who have a genuine desire for peace and order, if there are persons afraid that this may shake or damage the administration of the criminal law, I am perfectly willing that this Bill should be tempered.  I am quite ready to believe that when it has been seen working it will prove acceptable. When it actually has been seen in operation we will be then in a better position to consider it, not experimentally, but as a measure which we have actually seen in action.  In consequence we will be in a stronger and a much better position in which to make up our minds.  I venture to think that at the end of two years Deputy O'Connell, seeing how the measure will have operated, will come to the conclusion that the fears which I know he honestly holds at the moment were groundless and that those fears will have been dispelled.</P>

      <P>I am merely dealing with the point that was made the subject-matter of a good deal of the speeches of Deputy Lemass and Deputy Flinn.  If it is open to them to attack me upon it, surely it is open to me to explain my position.  Deputy Lemass said there was a reasonable case for amendment here, and he wanted to know why less time should be given to this Bill than to a less important Bill, the Censorship of Publications Bill.  The answer is perfectly obvious.  When the Censorship of Publications Bill was under discussion, the Deputies opposite discussed it in the spirit in which Deputies really should discuss a measure before the Dáil.  They discussed it with a genuine bona fide desire to improve the Bill.  No obstructive tactics were there.  There was not a single amendment put down by Deputies opposite or by any Party <Col N="455" /> in the House for the deliberate purpose of wrecking the Bill or the deliberate purpose of delaying it.</P>

      <P>I will, of course; that is what I am coming to. I am going to read to the House some of Deputy Ruttledge's amendments. Deputy Lemass declared that these are all serious amendments put forward with the hope of improving the Bill.  He also said that they wished to preserve the good points in the Bill.  He said there were some good points.  If you consider Deputy Ruttledge's amendments, and approve of them, you will delete the whole of Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.  You will delete every one of these sections.</P>

      <P>You will leave Sections 5, 11 (paragraphs (b) and (c)) and Section 12.  I do not know whether it is the deliberate intention of Deputy Ruttledge, but if his amendments are approved of, every bit of what Deputy Lemass says is good in the Bill must go except Section 5.  Possibly Section 5 may be affected, too.  It establishes the principle that a majority can bring in a verdict in criminal cases. Section 12 prevents loitering outside the court and paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 11, which deal with the printing or posting up of threats of violence against jurymen, are all left.  I say it is very doubtful if Deputy Ruttledge meant to leave anything at all except paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 11.</P>

Notwithstanding that, they say gravely that they have no desire to obstruct <Col N="456" /> the Bill, and they say, further, that any amendments they have brought forward are for the deliberate purpose of improving the Bill.

    <P>&ldquo;When calling over in pursuance of Section 46 or sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 47 of the Principal Act the names of the Jurors entered on a panel (whether original or supplemental) of jurors the registrar shall not call the name of any such juror whose attendance he has previously recorded under the foregoing paragraph of this section on that day unless he has reason to believe that such juror has since his attendance was so <Col N="457" /> recorded left the Court and not returned thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;unless he has reason to believe&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;unless the jury on evidence of the Registrar is of opinion.&rdquo;  That is perfectly meaningless. No jury has been sworn.</P>

      <P>Let us take amendment 40, which is to the effect that the jury and not the judge are to be the judges of what is to be contempt of court.  Is that an obstructionist amendment?  Now take amendment No. 47.  It is to delete all words in sub-section 4 (a) of Section 6 after the word &ldquo;sentence.&rdquo; line 44, to the end of the paragraph, line 53.  The sub-section would then read:</P>
      <P>When a person is sentenced under the foregoing sub-section of this section to suffer a term of imprisonment the judge shall at his discretion either (a) direct that such person shall suffer such imprisonment forthwith, in which case such person shall thereupon be removed in custody and imprisoned in accordance with such sentence.</P>
      <P>All sub-section (b) is to go out. Therefore the Deputy, in order to get an amendment, makes the suggestion that the trial should go on in the prisoner's absence.  Is that an obstructionist amendment?  Take amendment 55.  I wonder what misprint there is in this particular amendment which proposes to delete in sub-section (1), page 5, line 2, all words after the word &ldquo;had&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and substitute therefor the words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judge presiding at such trial may, on hearing such evidence as may be tendered before him, that it is necessary for the protection of witness and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the court during such trial, put to <Col N="459" /> the jury the question whether the Court should be cleared, and upon receiving an answer from the jury in the affirmative may order the court to be cleared.</P>
    <P>Here again there has been no jury sworn.  Sub-section 1 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever, at the trial of an accused person in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court and after such accused person has pleaded &lsquo;not guilty&rsquo; or a plea of &lsquo;not guilty&rsquo; has been entered for him and before any further proceedings are had ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no jury in existence at that stage.  No jury has been sworn, yet the question, according to the amendment, is to be left to the jury. If that is not a deliberately blocking amendment I do not know what is.  There is no room for a misprint there.</P>

      <P>There is no escape that way for Deputy MacEntee.  Take amendment 78, to delete sub-section (7) of Section 7. Deputy Ruttledge, of course, puts this forward with the sole desire, according to Deputy MacEntee, of improving the Bill.  That is the sub-section which preserves the existing powers of the judge to clear the court in certain cases, but Deputy Ruttledge wants that power taken away.  That is to say that when, for instance, a small child is giving evidence in an indecent case the judge shall not have the court cleared.  Is that an obstructionist amendment, or is it put forward by somebody on behalf of Deputy Ruttledge who never saw it?  I do not believe that that is the desire of Deputy Ruttledge or anyone else&mdash;<Col N="460" /> that the power which judges have to clear the court during indecent charges should be taken away.  Is that amendment inserted for the purpose of helping the Bill or has it simply been put there in order that there may be some amendment on the Paper?  There are others, but I will not go through the whole lot.</P>

      <P>Amendment 99 is one of the gems.  It proposes in Section 9, sub-section (3), to insert before the word &ldquo;statement,&rdquo; line 53, the word &ldquo;false.&rdquo; This is how the section runs:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall apply to or render unlawful the printing, publication, distribution or making by any person in the manner and to the extent directed by the Principal Act, as amended by this Act or otherwise by law, of any statements which it is his duty under the Principal Act as so amended or otherwise by law so to print, publish, distribute, or make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge wants to insert in that &ldquo;any false statement.&rdquo;  That is to say, a stenographer will be punished if he puts forward a correct account or a correct report for the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The stenographer will be punished according to Deputy Ruttledge's idea.  A stenographer sending forward a correct shorthand note of a trial will be punished, but if he sends forward a false note he will not be punished.  I say that I believe some of these amendments were never read by Deputy Ruttledge himself or he would not have produced them.  They prove conclusively that there is not on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party any genuine attempt to act as Deputies should act and that is to endeavour to improve and not to obstruct measures which have the approval of the House, not to attempt to interfere in a blind, senseless, stupid fashion with the passage of a Bill of this nature.  I have nothing more to say upon this motion.  The real question <Col N="461" /> before the House is: shall there be obstruction of legislation in this House or shall there not be obstruction? Shall a series of amendments be put forward, not with a genuine desire to improve a Bill, but put forward, some of them, solely in order that there may be something on the Paper, some of them against common sense, some of them which cannot even by any stretch of the imagination be considered to be the bona fide belief of the persons who put them forward?  Shall amendments of that nature be allowed to check the passage of legislation in this House? That is the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister for Justice has ceased to erupt and has become somnolent again, possibly it might be well if we reverted to the speech of the Minister who introduced the motion.  The real argument by which the Minister tried to justify the motion was that if there were not such a great number of amendments sent in, no motion would have been moved, and they would have been content to have as much as two sittings of the House occupied by the Committee Stage. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the system of trial by jury which has been evolved through an experience, I think, of something like eight centuries.  Many States envy England as being entitled to claim that it originated and brought to a state of perfection this system of trial by jury, whereby a man might be fairly assured that justice would be done as between him on the one hand and the Executive on the other and the Minister feels that a House composed largely of laymen can consider a Bill which he has introduced to amend that system of trial by jury, and can discuss it adequately inside the time occupied by two sittings of the House.  He suggests that a system of legal procedure which has occupied the united wisdom of mankind, one might say, for practically a period of eight centuries, is to be disposed of and radically amended by this House in a period of two sittings.  I think that is a claim to almost omniscient wisdom, a claim to have in this little State a legislature of supermen.  The <Col N="462" /> ridiculous length to which the Minister's prejudice has brought him, and the desire on the part of the President and the Executive Council to make capital out of some temporary, passing situation, the desire to shock, as it were, the consciences of the electors in a certain constituency, to make them feel that we are trembling once again on the abyss of revolution, have forced the Minister for Finance to make that extravagant statement&mdash; that inside two sittings of the House we could radically alter and amend a work which has taken the collective wisdom of mankind eight centuries to evolve.  I do not know whether I am entitled to labour that point any further.  I think it must be clear to the mind of everyone that that statement was so extravagant as to be ridiculous in its very nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister further argued that possibly they might not have introduced this motion to limit the time allowed for the Committee Stage of the Bill if it had not been for the number of amendments which have been put down by us, the amendments which the Minister for Justice endeavoured to show, with no sort of success I contend, were vexatious. I should like just for one moment to direct the attention of the House to some of the amendments put down.  I do not wish to discuss them but I merely direct the attention of the House to them specifically so that the House may be able to judge for itself whether there is any substance in the allegations made by the Minister for Justice.  I am not going to go through Section 1.  So far as Section 2 is concerned the first amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In every county and county borough to which this section is applied by an order made under this section, the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the under sheriff of the county registrar or any other officer of such county or county borough by Part 5 of the Principal Act as empanelling officer shall hereafter be discharged by the secretary of the county council in the case of <Col N="463" /> counties and by the town clerk or other principal clerk of the county borough in the case of county boroughs and save as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it is quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Section 2 and not Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to Section 2 afterwards.  I was afraid that some subsequent speaker in the Government Party might say, because I omitted to refer specifically to these amendments, that I was endeavouring to evade discussing the question as to whether they were or were not bona fide amendments, and not vexatious amendments, as has been alleged by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice. Now it is quite clear that the whole intention of that amendment &mdash;and in the circumstances it is a reasonable one&mdash;is to ensure that the empanelling officer will be an officer who is independent of the Executive, one who is not specifically a subofficer of the court and an employee of the Department of Justice.  I am not going to argue that amendment pro and con, but I do say that it is not of its very nature a vexatious amendment.  It is an amendment which, in good faith, is designed to improve this Bill and not to obstruct it.  Take again amendment 6, Section 2, which reads:</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows: &ldquo;All orders made under this section shall be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas, and shall not be valid unless approved of by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I contend that is simply to provide a safeguard and to guard against an abuse of the powers which it is proposed to confer on the Minister for Justice by Section 2 of the Bill.  At any rate, I cannot see that, on the face of it, it can be held to be a vexatious amendment. I come now to amendment 9 to Section 3.  I am passing over amendment 7 which stands in the name of Deputy Tomás O Conaill, <Col N="464" /> because I do not think the Minister alleged that any amendment the Deputy put down was a vexatious one.  The whole indictment has been lodged against the principal Opposition Party in this House whose particular duty it is to scrutinise with more than ordinary care proposals made for legislation. After all, it is the duty of the Opposition Party to criticise and, to obstruct if necessary, in order to ensure that due consideration will be given to every legislative proposal. When, therefore, we do take the trouble of going through a Bill section by section, and find in it any point that appears to us to be doubtful, we are quite within our rights, in dealing with it.  We are not only within our rights, but would be lacking in the proper discharge of our duty, if we omitted to put down a reasoned amendment designed to clarify a point or issue which was doubtful. For that reason, therefore, when a Bill of the far-reaching importance of this measure is introduced, and in the circumstances in which this Bill has been introduced, it is almost, I believe, impossible that only a small number of amendments should be put down.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to the House, and to the people of the country generally, that the full purpose of the Executive should be made explicit in the terms of the Bill itself, and that the House should not give to the Executive any powers of which the House itself is not fully aware.  Therefore, it is the duty of the Opposition, fulfilling an important function under the Constitution, whenever a point is not clear or is doubtful, to put down an amendment which will elicit from the Executive a full statement of the position in regard to the point at issue, and for that reason and for no other it necessarily follows that there must be, in the case of a Bill so important as this is, a considerable number of amendments appearing on the Order Paper.  It is for that reason that we put them down.  That, however, is by way of digression.</P>
    <P>To get back, I am passing over, as <Col N="465" /> I have said, amendment 7 which stands in the name of Deputy Tomás O Conaill because neither the Minister for Justice nor any member of the Executive Council has alleged, so far as I am aware, that the amendments standing in that Deputy's name are vexatious or obstructive in any way.  I come, therefore, to the amendment which proposes to delete sub-section (1) of Section 3.  This sub-section states:</P>
    <P>Section 50 of the Principal Act shall not apply to a panel of jurors prepared for a sittings of the Central Criminal Court nor to a panel of jurors prepared for a sittings of a Judge of the Circuit Court for the trial of criminal issues, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the empanelling officer and the summoning officer shall treat every such panel as a confidential official document.</P>
    <P>Now there is a big point of principle involved there as to whether the panel of jurors shall or shall not be a confidential official document to be withheld from the prisoner, his legal advisers and from the people of this State.  I contend that an amendment to delete that section and to discuss that issue in detail, cannot be held to be, and should not be alleged to be, a vexatious or an obstructive amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy explain the other two amendments to that sub-section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to explain Deputy O'Connell's, but I am proceeding to deal with amendment 9.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) the words &ldquo;save that every accused person, or his solicitor in the case of the trial of any such person, shall be entitled as of right to a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I wonder is that a vexatious amendment?  Does the Minister for Justice allege that that is a vexatious amendment: &ldquo;save that every accused person, or his solicitor in the <Col N="466" /> case of any such person, shall be entitled as of right to a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn?&rdquo; I presume that if the prisoner is not going to have a legal representative in court, or in the event of his desiring to be so represented, then this is to ensure and to safeguard to him the right to have a copy of the panel.  Is that a vexatious amendment?  The Minister for Justice is going to sleep again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would like the Minister to answer that question, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Does he allege, and does he as a lawyer contend, that it is vexatious to ask that the solicitor charged with the defence of a prisoner in a criminal trial should be entitled to have a copy of the jury panel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to answering the Deputy's question.  I never stated that every single amendment that was put down was vexatious.  I have never said that there might not be a difference of opinion about this Bill, but I do say that an overwhelmingly large number of the amendments put down are purely vexatious and are put down solely for the purpose of obtaining divisions when it is perfectly obvious that they are snowed under.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerably more &mdash;practically all the amendments to delete sections, for instance.  The very one that the Deputy has put forward now as a sensible amendment is, by another amendment, to be deleted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the amendments are not consequential. One might be there as an alternative to the principal amendment.  Is it contended that a Deputy who puts forward a principal amendment intended to include the whole substance <Col N="467" /> of his objections to any particular proposals in this Bill is not entitled, in the event of the rejection of the principal amendment by the House, to bring forward an alternative amendment?  Or does the Minister contend that an alternative amendment would be a vexatious amendment?  The Minister said that there was one amendment to which he did not object.  I have read out nine amendments, and is it alleged that the five amendments to which I have directed attention are vexatious and are put down simply to waste the time of the House?  I do not know what the Minister has to say in relation to amendment No. 10.  That amendment, strange to say, was the amendment to which the Minister, in the course of his strictures on Deputy Ruttledge for proposing to touch those sacred folios with his sacrilegious fingers, did not advert at all, because that amendment is to delete sub-section (2) of Section 3, which is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other enactment, no accused person shall be entitled as of right to a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That may be sound or it may not. I am not going to argue that point, but the extraordinary thing about it is that it goes further than Deputy Ruttledge's amendment to delete sub-section (1) of Section 3.  The saving grace of amendment No. 10, which proposes to delete sub-section (2) of Section 3&mdash;the amendment which I have just read&mdash;is that it stands in the name of the Leader of the Labour Party.  Nothing good can come out of Nazareth, and nothing good can come from the Fianna Fáil Benches, but anything that may fall from the Deputy who occupies the corner seat in the gangway are words of wisdom and will be hearkened to by the Minister for Justice in his desire to improve a Bill which he himself admits in one of his amendments, needs radical improvement.</P>

      <P>Amendment 11 is:</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every accused person shall be entitled as of right to apply to and may, if the judge is satisfied, obtain from any judge of the High Court or Supreme Court an order directed to the summoning officer to supply him or his solicitor with a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I put it to the Deputy, as he has asked the question: What is an obstructive amendment? This particular amendment deals with sub-sections (1) and (2). The principle is practically in the second sub-section (2).  Deputy Ruttledge puts in an amendment, a quite distinct and contrary amendment. He puts in an amendment to delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and to put in something that is contrary. I would like an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the attitude the president has taken, and the manner in which he is endeavouring to quibble on this point, that if he has any respect at all for the High Court or the Supreme Court he could not contend that amendment 11 is merely vexatious or obstructive.  There may possibly arise a case where, for the purpose of the defence, an innocent man charged with a crime might require to protect himself even against the Executive and have access to the panel.  I am perfectly certain the only purpose of this amendment is that should such case arise a prisoner in that position may go to the Supreme Court or the High Court and put his case there, and he may ask the Court to adjudicate in the matter and to decide, as experienced judges, as they must be if they are in the Supreme Court or the High Court, whether or not he should have access to the jury panel.  I do not <Col N="470" /> think it could be held that that amendment is vexatious or obstructive, notwithstanding the ardour of the Minister for justice in this matter.  We know he has been unfortunate hitherto in his legislative progeny.  Most of the Bills that have emanated from his Department since he became Minister for Justice have been rather badly maltreated in this House and elsewhere.  We remember what happened to the approved associations, the woebegone, ill-fated progeny of the Minister. Although he may have all the enthusiasm and the affection of a parent for this legislative innovation I think he should not assume that what emanates from his brain cannot be improved upon by the collective wisdom of the House.</P>
      <P>To get back to Section 3.  &ldquo;To add at the end of the section a new section as follows&rdquo;&mdash;admittedly this is an alternative amendment, more or less, to amendment No. 11.  Amendment 12 is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every accused person shall be entitled to apply to any judge of the High Court or Supreme Court for an order directed to the summoning officer to supply him or his solicitor with a copy of the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn, and shall be entitled to obtain such order unless good cause to the contrary is shown.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I do not think that that could be held to be a vexatious or obstructive amendment.  Does the Minister contend that it is a vexatious amendment, or an amendment without any substance in it?  Does he contend that it is an amendment which the general body of legal opinion in the country would reject as an amendment with no substance in it, or as a vexatious or obstructive amendment?  I should like to have the Minister's opinion on that matter. Possibly the Minister has not any opinions in the matter.  Possibly the Bill is not his at all.  Possibly it has <Col N="471" /> been presented to him more or less in the manner of a brief, as a case which he may argue impersonally without having any convictions on one side or the other.  If he has any convictions in regard to the Bill, I should like to know from him whether he regards amendment 12 as a vexatious or obstructive amendment. There is no answer from the Minister.  Apparently, the Minister has no convictions in the matter; the Minister, when he introduced the Bill, spoke entirely from his brief. Amendment 13 is to delete all words after the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 4, down to the word &ldquo;issues&rdquo; line 7, and substitute therefor the words which follow, so that the section will read as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the principal Act any two Judges of the High Court may on the application of the Attorney-General, and on being satisfied that sufficient cause exists for so doing by order direct that the following provisions shall apply to and have effect at any sittings of the Central Criminal Court, and any sittings of a Judge of the Circuit Court for the trial of Criminal issues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the principal provisions in the Bill, which this amendment proposes should not be put into operation until two Judges of the High Court are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for putting this section into operation is, first of all, the opportunity which paragraph (a) gives for a person to appear before the Registrar half an hour before the sitting of the court and to notify the Registrar that he proposes to be in attendance at the court during the trial.  The other proposals all relate to the exclusion of the public during the calling of the panel.  I should like to point out the importance of having the jury panel called over in public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he allege that it would not be well for the public security that, before these special provisions are put into operation, <Col N="474" /> two Judges of the High Court should publicly decide that there is sufficient cause for putting them into operation?  I am not going to argue the merits or demerits of the proposals. I am only arguing that the amendment which we have tabled to Section 4 is not a vexatious one.  I am not going to refer particularly to amendments 14, 15 or 16, but I wish to refer the Minister to amendment 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of paragraph (a) the words: &ldquo;and it shall be lawful for the solicitors and counsel representing any accused person whose trial it is intended shall take place on the said day of such sittings to be present, and to be afforded an opportunity of verifying the identity of such juror.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is clear to the House that an important principle is involved. It is that it shall be lawful for the solicitor and counsel for any accused person to be afforded an opportunity of verifying the identity of the jurors.  Anyone can see the force of that amendment and can realise the importance of it.  Yet the Minister for Justice stigmatises and brands it as vexatious and obstructive when quite obviously it is intended to ensure that the accused person in criminal cases where the issue is between him and the Executive, shall be assured of a fair trial and that the jury shall not be packed against him.  I suggest it is obviously a misuse of words to brand that amendment as vexatious and obstructive and that the Minister or the Government that proposes to do that are lost to all sense of responsibility and are not competent to administer justice in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 19 is: In paragraph (b) to delete in lines 28 and 29 the words unless he has reason to believe, and to substitute therefore the words &ldquo;unless the jury on evidence of the Registrar is of opinion.&rdquo;  The only purpose of that amendment is to ensure that the judge&mdash;there is a misprint in this amendment, as Deputy Ruttledge pointed out, where the word jury is used instead of <Col N="475" /> judge&mdash;that at any rate the registrar should put before the judge sufficient ground to justify him in withholding and not calling over the names of the jury.  Surely that is not a vexatious or obstructive amendment and ought to be discussed upon its merits.  I do not wish to go through all the other amendments, I do not wish to take up that attitude, but I think, so far as I have gone through them, I have shown that the great bulk of these amendments are designed to clarify the whole position in this matter and to have it clearly and explicitly stated in the Bill what are the intentions of the Ministry, what powers are conferred upon them, and to ensure that these powers once conferred upon them shall not be abused.  That is the only purpose for which an Opposition comes to this House.</P>
    <P>If the Government of this country and the whole legislative business of the country were to be carried on on the principles which the Minister for Justice expressed at any rate, there would be no purpose in having an Opposition.  Every amendment put down would, according to him, be vexatious.  The worse the legislative proposals introduced the more necessary it is to amend them and the greater the number of amendments that must be put down. When a Bill like this Bill touches the rights and liberties of the subject, then it is almost impossible that such a Bill should go through this House.  It would be impossible if this House conscientiously did its duty.  I know the Minister for Justice sneers at the idea of any Deputy having a conscience.  I am afraid the Minister judges the Opposition in this House by the company he himself keeps in it, and he judges the Independents in the House by the same low standard.</P>

      <P>Members of my party are not present in the House because they know these amendments are not vexatious or obstructive. It is the members of the Government Party that require to be convinced upon that issue.  I regret to say that for fear of being convinced they refuse to attend.  I want to make one or two remarks upon the speech of the Minister for Justice. He said that he held that this Bill would make a real improvement in the jury system, that he stated so on its Second Reading, and proposed to adhere to it.  The Minister must change his mind very often, because I think I remember him saying that this Bill was not intended to be a temporary measure, but to be a permanent measure.  Then he put down this amendment: &ldquo;This Act shall continue in force until the 31st day of December, 1931, and shall then expire.&rdquo;  He appears to have had second thoughts on the matter.  The very fact that the Minister himself has changed his mind when he put down an amendment and then reverted to the position which he <Col N="478" /> announced on the Second Reading of the Bill&mdash;that he thought that this would be a permanent improvement in the jury system&mdash;the fact that he has, on consideration and reconsideration, changed his mind twice, surely shows that this Bill ought to be carefully examined in Committee and that it ought to be given the full measure of time which its importance deserves.  For that reason we are asking the House to vote against the motion which stands in the name of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when speaking on the amendment, gave some reasons as to why the time of the House should be occupied only for six hours in dealing with this Bill.  He set out to show that the Bill was a short and simple one, that the sections in the Bill were quite simple and I think he did give the impression at any rate that it was of very little importance.  We are satisfied and I think the country is satisfied that <Col N="483" /> this Bill is one of the most important from the point of view of its reactionary tendencies that has been before this House and it is not because the Bill is simple that anyone can say here that for that reason any debate on it in committee should be closured after six hours.  It is one of those Bills that is thoroughly bad I would say from the start to the finish. It would appear to have been conceived in a panic; it was drafted in haste and is now endeavoured to be rushed through this House in a narrow-minded and very peculiar way. It is one of those measures that would always require, one would imagine, a full and fair discussion of all their merits and implications, a measure that as I said is reactionary, coercive and as we have stated, from time to time on the Bill itself, is intended not as a real or genuine effort to meet what is alleged to be a certain situation but for mean political ends.  It is a measure that is intended to provoke, as far as provocation can be brought about by an Executive, a certain feeling in the country that may result in a certain set of circumstances that may strengthen, in a way peculiar to the Executive Council's mind, their present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in moving that this debate in committee should be closured did not ground the motion on the fact that it is an urgent measure.  He did not ground that motion on the fact that it had to be passed quickly through this House as a certain set of circumstances in the country demanded it.  If he had stated that of course the answer was obvious.  He realised himself that the answer was obvious. It is a good many months since it was indicated that such a measure as this was contemplated by the Executive Council.  It was mentioned during an election here in North Dublin and was allowed to remain in cold storage until another by-election occurred in the country. It is rushed through here and the only reason is to create an atmosphere of panic in the country with a <Col N="484" /> view to certain results in the by-election pending.  It is being regarded apparently by the Executive Council as an absolutely normal measure, I mean a measure that it might be considered possible to enact in a normal country.  I think that anyone who considers it in all its implications must come to the conclusion that some people in the country that point at Russia, and other people who point at Mexico should at least think of the tactics of the Executive Council in the Free State, as indicated in this measure at any rate, before pointing their fingers at other places.  When people talk of penal laws and hold up other phases of the history of this country to odium they might think of this penal legislation which the Government are endeavouring to get on the statutes of this country.  It is endeavoured in this measure to do away with, once and for all, a method that was employed in this and other countries and has been regarded to some extent as constitutionally right in almost every civilised country, and to make it a crime for anybody to resort to passive resistance. It is trying to establish that when persons make a protest in the only way they sometimes can make a protest against reactionary Governments, against Governments that cannot have much regard for legal or moral rights, that that is going to be taken away from them under this measure.  If such a Bill as this was law in Palestine the Man on Calvary would be guilty of an offence.  If it had been law in this country the Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, would have been guilty of an offence.  It reminds one of Shylock when he said: &ldquo;The felony you teach me I will exact and it will go hard, but I better the instruction.&rdquo;  The Executive Council does not seem to realise that they are creating a weapon that can be turned by other Governments, perhaps in other times, just as they are trying to turn it now on certain political opponents.  They do not realise that they are creating in this country a weapon that can be used as a means and method to suppress <Col N="485" /> political opponents and inflict hardship and punishment on them for pursuing their political activities in a perfectly reasonable and constitutional way.</P>
    <P>The only way in which it could be excused&mdash;and no attempt was made by the Minister for Finance in that regard at any rate&mdash;would be for the Executive Council honestly to admit that it was an attempt to bolster up the tottering edifice of their Executive in the country.  If, as I said, there was an honest demand for this measure, and if the Executive Council believed that there was a conspiracy to overthrow the State and that that conspiracy was being hatched and continued to be hatched, is there anybody so gullible in the country, or does the Executive think there is anybody so gullible as to believe that they should have waited all those months without bringing forth this measure?  It is in order to have it through before an election comes off and to have a chance of trying to gull some people in the country that they try to rush the closure and use the guillotine to secure that the amendments tabled here will not receive the amount of consideration that one would imagine a Bill of this sort was entitled to. The Minister for Finance said that those amendments were intended to occupy time and nothing else. The Minister for Justice went on somewhat similar lines.  He told us and some of the Ministers told us that there were about 40 or 50 of these amendments purely obstructive. The Minister for Justice, after getting his own microscope and the microscope of the officials in his Department, to examine the various amendments that have been tabled here has made that wonderful contribution to the debate, that he has discovered six.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>One of them was, as the Minister knew, an obvious mistake.  The others, he said, are intended to be obstructive because certain functions are being performed by a judge that should be performed by a jury.  If the Minister were agreeable to receive them it is quite a simple matter to adjust those amendments in such a way that they would be in conformity with the intention.  The Minister for Finance made a peculiar statement when he said that only a small number of amendments could be accepted. What the Minister had in mind in stating that he could only accept a small number of amendments, I do not know.  All those amendments that we have tabled here for discussion by this House in Committee are first an effort in regard to the main portions of the Bill, at any rate, to have certain sections deleted.  We have not at any time denied that we regard this Bill as coercive and reactionary, a method that should not be adopted by this House.  We have pointed out in this House that no case was made for that measure, and no attempt was made to prove that a measure anything along these lines was ever necessary or desirable. We have not tried to veil in any way our views and our objective with regard to that.  The first objective we have in these amendments is to try to delete the reactionary provisions which this Bill contains.  If we fail in those we have subsequent amendments to try and make the best of a bad lot which this Bill is and which is quite evident to anybody who wants to examine it.  If we fail in deleting certain sections then we have subsequent amendments to try and improve other sections of the Bill as it stands.  But it certainly is beyond my imagination to visualise or to comprehend what exactly the Minister for Finance had in mind when he referred to a certain number of small amendments. He surely does not expect that minds in the Opposition must conform to the ideas in his cranium. He does not, I assume, try to impress on the House that amendments <Col N="487" /> must only be put in by the Opposition that will be entirely in accord with the views or ideas of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said that there was a very good reason for allowing the Censorship Bill to get that full discussion which it did receive in this House.  It was discussed in a certain spirit, the &ldquo;proper spirit&rdquo; were the words he used.  For that reason it could have been very fully discussed.  That, to my mind, is a very peculiar line of argument.  If we were to pursue a line of argument such as that to its logical conclusion it would probably amount to this, that the importance of the measure does not matter very much, that the only thing that matters is that you find the Opposition to be very nice boys and very agreeable, smiling across at the Government Benches.  It does not seem, according to that line of argument, to matter whether one measure is merely concerned with the books or papers that a person will read, while the other is concerned with the liberty of the subject, and attempts to try and secure in this country a return to martial law as far as the Executive Council can do that, with some little show at pretence at law, because that is what the present measure is.  The present measure is one that could not be justified in any country except as a measure tantamount to martial law.  It does not, in the view of the Executive, as expressed by the Minister for Justice, seem to matter what big issues are involved, whether it is the liberty of the subject or whether it is tearing asunder the law as understood in this country and applied for centuries, giving certain rights to people to open and fair trial &ldquo;by their peers,&rdquo; as it was called.  When all these rights are being taken away they are nothing like as important as preventing a few people in the country, whose minds may have got steeped in a certain sort of atmosphere, form reading certain books. It is in keeping with what one would expect from the cavalier fashion in which this measure has been dealt <Col N="488" /> with by the Executive.  The Executive pretend, at any rate, that they regard it as a normal measure for dealing with the situation which they tried to create in their own minds. They tried to create an impression abroad that an abnormal situation exists.</P>
    <P>But the abnormal situation, as I have already said, is a situation that existed in this country, or was alleged to have existed in this country, a good many months ago. The Minister for Justice referred to these amendments, I think, as blind, senseless and stupid.  I suppose they do not exactly agree with the views the Minister for Justice has.  There is always a very nice way of getting away with a thing by using a few big, strong words such as those and disposing of it by that kind of argument. If the Minister wants to reason it out or to argue it out, there is a certain line for him to pursue. But it is not merely by shouting out blind, senseless and stupid that he is going to create any impression outside his own followers in this House. He complained that with the exception of two sections all this Bill is proposed to be deleted.  Yes; all except two sections of this Bill are proposed to be deleted for the simple reason that they contain reactionary provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that when the majority verdict comes along.  This measure is not, I say, a protective measure.  It is purely an election measure.  It is not a measure that is honestly intended to safeguard the lives of the citizens in this country, but it is intended as a cheap, vile and filthy method of trying to secure certain political advantages. It is nothing else.  It is <Col N="489" /> an effort to try and create a panic in the country; it is an effort to try to create a certain feeling of uneasiness in the country so that what are called the strong men in the country might be given another lease or term of office.  Men were murdered in this country and there was no rush to pass a Juries Bill or anything like that.  Men were murdered by what were admitted to be the officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am only making a point to show that there is no necessity for rushing this measure. It is not intended to protect anybody, and the Executive Council is not sincere when they say they want to get this measure through because an abnormal situation exists in the country.  However, I do not want to pursue that.  Those amendments are amendments which might take some little time or which might not.  If the Executive Council were prepared to consider them or if they were dealt with in the proper way we think they might be disposed of very quickly. Nobody can say whether they might be disposed of in six hours.  I do not know.  They might not be disposed of in two days.</P>

      <P>It all depends on the number of Deputies who may desire to speak on those particular amendments, but by no argument that has been disclosed by the Executive Council and through no statement that has been made here can anyone say that the closure of the debate on those amendments is justified.  No argument has been put up as to what the urgency of the matter is.  Nobody has pretended that there is any matter of urgency or any reason why this Bill should be rushed through.  As I <Col N="490" /> have said, why should there be days given to the Censorship Bill while a measure which is more far-reaching than any other measure which has come before this House, since we came here at any rate, is being rushed through?  This is a measure of such magnitude that one would expect that Deputies here would be afforded some latitude when discussing the amendments.  One would suppose that a Bill of the importance of this would get very much more consideration than a minor measure.  I do not want to go into those amendments in detail.  As I said, the Minister examined them very closely.  He mentioned something about office boys.  Well, I suppose his office boys have been pretty busy during the last week trying to discover some weakness in these amendments.</P>

      <P>These are mainly the reasons why I am asking that the House should not adopt the proposal of the closure on this motion. It is unreasonable that it should be done, but it is in keeping with the reactionary policy of the Executive. It is following the same lines as might have been adopted on the Public Safety Act, and so on.  It is an attempt to try to closure the debate that should proceed along reasonable and arguable lines.  No case has been attempted to be made by either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance to show that the discussion on these amendments should be confined to six hours.  What may happen with regard <Col N="491" /> to these amendments is this: Some amendments which may be more important than others may be farther down on the Order Paper, and those amendments may not be reached.  That will mean that this Bill will pass in a form that will be objectionable even to many supporters on the Government side.  It will be objectionable to them that the Bill will have to pass in that form.  If ample time were allowed on Committee, the debate on the Bill could be taken up from time to time as might suit the Government side of the House.  It might be taken up from time to time, there being no urgency about it.  We have heard a lot on this question of what happened four or five months ago. Nothing happened since, and the Government realise, and know very well, that the country has found out the game that is behind the Government in bringing in this Bill.  The Government has realised now that those tactics of theirs have failed. It might have been a clever move or ruse to mislead the country, but probably they realise now themselves that it has not succeeded.  The attempt to deceive and fool certain people in the country has failed and, having failed, one would imagine that the Government should not be so anxious to rush it through now. There is no necessity for it.  It probably will not secure as many votes in the Sligo-Leitrim election as the Government hope.  They have realised by now that it was probably a foolish blunder on the part of their election agents to bring in this Bill in the hope of influencing votes in the Sligo-Leitrim election. The Government have realised that now and so should not be afraid to allow the amendments that are down to this Bill to get fair and ample discussion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long in speaking on this particular motion, but there are a few things that strike an ordinary observer very much, and I would like to mention them.  It took some generations to arrive at the present <Col N="492" /> position as regards juries.  We find that the Executive Council, by introducing this Bill, are endeavouring to change that law completely and as quickly as they possibly can, and they have not the slightest remorse in doing so.  One would not have the slightest objection to that occurring if one knew they were legislators of vast experience, or even if they had not the experience, if one knew that the necessity for the change was there.  I fail to see any necessity for a change in the jury system.  Even if there were some necessity I fail to see why there should be so much hurry, or why there should be this fear or dread of something happening the Bill.  It may be that there are some amendments which would, to a certain extent, improve the Bill.  It may be, on the other hand, that the object is to have the Bill so utterly bad that it will not last any time.  I do not know how it originated.  I read the newspapers, and really I cannot see that there was any necessity for this measure. I could not see from any newspaper reports that there was any necessity whatsoever for such a Bill as this.  I dare say it arose through laxity in the law.  Some sort of flag incident occurred.  There does not seem to be any law to prevent that.  If there had been a law I dare say the person who was prosecuted in this instance would not have been prosecuted; the other individual would have been.  I take it that is the rule in other countries, and it is a sensible rule. A good deal of the time of the House has been utilised in discussing the Second Reading of this Bill, but now when the most vital and important time arrives not one party but parties in this House are practically prevented from discussing amendments that they consider would be suitable to the Bill and would improve it.  I think that attitude is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I feel most in connection with this question is the effect that it has in outside countries.  There are a good many capitalists the world over who believe there are resources in this country capable of development.  Their only guide to <Col N="493" /> the security of this State is the number of laws we pass and the decorum, the method and the system by which we pass them.  That has a great effect on these capitalists because they believe that if they came here and invested money in our industries that money would probably be administered and legal machinery would control it in much the same way as the people in this country are controlled by such laws as we are attempting to pass now.  We seem to have forgotten, or we do not seem to have thought of, what effect this will have on the future.  There is nothing that we do here that will not have its effect on the actions of future generations.  When future generations read that such an important change in fundamental law had been made here in such a short time, that such important precautions were taken so that that law would go through this House within a limited time, that a huge number of amendments were tabled and that those amendments were prevented from being discussed by such an attitude as we are debating now, I do not think the people of future generations will thank us for the manner in which this law is being forced through.</P>
    <P>The jury system is a very old system. It took generations to work it up to the present pitch.  If we are to change it at all we should do so very deliberately.  We should take our time over the making of such changes.  If we did deliberate carefully it would to a certain extent reassure the people.  I am not a lawyer but as far as I know this Bill seriously affects any advantages prisoners may have with juries.  All these prisoners are not political prisoners and, in the circumstances, I think that very serious consideration should be given to this matter. I know the Bill will pass; there is no question at all about that.  Every precaution has been taken so that it will pass.</P>
    <P>I honestly and sincerely make the statement that I doubt very much if it is a sensible or a statesmanlike thing to attempt.  I admit that behind the whole thing there is a certain <Col N="494" /> amount of political outlook. There are certain political advantages which might be gained, but I do not believe that at the present time that fly will catch any fish. The Irish people are quite sensible enough to understand the drift of all this sort of thing.  I would not object to this measure if there were a necessity for it, but so far as I can see there is not the slightest necessity for it.  It simply means that the juries did their duty according to their lights, but these lights were not in agreement with the present Government.  Honestly, I believe that that is why the Bill was introduced&mdash;in order that they may have a certain amount of control over the jury.  It would have been better if that were said straight away.  I daresay the country will take it as such and future generations will read that aspect into it.  Maybe the reason the Minister introduced this motion was to avoid discussion and to give the matter as little ventilation as possible.  Those are some of the reasons for my opposition to this motion.</P>

      <P>If this Dáil were an organism, if this collection of 152 Deputies were an independent organism with the gift of speech.  I could imagine that organism saying: &ldquo;This is the worst day I have ever experienced.  This is the day that has lowered my dignity and done more harm to my existence than any other day since I was born.&rdquo;  It was bad enough that such a motion should be introduced, but that it should be introduced in such a fashion as the Minister for Finance introduced it&mdash;in such a dictatorial manner as would give one the impression that he was a person of no responsibility in this House, using such phrases as &ldquo;more time than could be afforded,&rdquo;&ldquo;the House has shown that it is prepared to pass the Bill,&rdquo;&ldquo;if Deputies will only formally move their amendments&rdquo;&mdash;that it should be introduced in that fashion is, to my mind, a very serious departure which shows a terrible recklessness on the part of the Executive Council, and bodes nothing but ill <Col N="495" /> for the constitutional future of the country.  A great deal of talk has been made about the amendments being obstructive.  The Minister for Finance said if they were serious amendments he would not introduce this, but a different motion.</P>
      <P>Who on earth told him that they were not serious amendments?  By what right does he claim to judge, even before we come to the Committee Stage, that any amendment on the Order Paper is not serious?  Why does he climb on a pedestal in that way?  I am not certain that in the circumstances surrounding this Bill a case cannot be made for purely obstructive amendments.  It is a very serious matter when a Bill such as this passes through the House, when it passes Second Reading in an atmosphere of political party rancour and high feeling, and when speeches were made from the front Government Bench in support of the measure appealing merely to old hostilities. When we realise those facts and also that a great number of those who voted for the measure never read a line of it, a case for purely obstructive amendments&mdash;I do not grant that they are such&mdash;seems to me to be very strong.  The obstructive amendment, at least, calls attention to what is in the Bill.  When one examines an amendment one has to read the clause to which that obstructive amendment applies at least.  And when a measure such as this is being discussed which will affect many innocent as well as guilty people and which will apply, as one speaker said, not merely to political offences but to all sorts of offences against the law, it is all important that every line in such a Bill should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If Deputies will not move or only formally move their amendments.&rdquo; I think that that is about as audacious a statement as was ever made by any member in this House. One must not attempt to say what is in one's mind.  He says that it is something you must read your own meaning into.  You can interpret it as <Col N="496" /> you like and can discover what result it will have, if it so pleases you, but you must not be so unreasonable as to take up our time by discussing it.  That is an extraordinary position for an Executive Council to take up, especially a Council which talks about a sovereign assembly and about its laws being obeyed by every citizen.  It looks as if they have given up that plea.  They must know that there is serious alarm outside this House with regard to this Bill. They must know that there are many people who have no affiliations with us who are greatly perturbed about it.  Such people would like to see it thoroughly examined, line for line and word for word, before it gets the approval of the Dáil.  Yet the second most important Minister in the House commits himself to remarks like those.  What will be the effect, I wonder, of the passing of such legislation?  I do not think that the Executive Council in their saner moments can look forward to suppressing the people whom they are after in this Bill because, although it is intended to apply to all classes, it is obvious that they have in their minds a small section with definite political views, but they cannot look forward to continuing the chase after those people indefinitely.  They must look forward to being reconciled to them some day.  I imagine, at least, that statesmen would prefer reconciliation to a situation in which more and more coercion would be needed and more and more Bills of this kind required.</P>
    <P>Are they going to win the respect of such people by a measure of this kind which is passed in this way? The measure itself is bad enough, but when the people who are opposed, not merely to the Government but to this Dáil, read that it is being passed in this fashion and treated with such levity by those responsible for it, when it is being passed purely as a political measure to create a certain atmosphere in the country, I wonder will their respect for this law and for the other laws for which the Dáil is responsible, their respect even for the Dáil as an institution, be increased.  I hardly <Col N="497" /> think it will.  Six hours are allotted to the entire Committee Stage of this Bill.  To my mind, the proposal to change the law with regard to verdicts in criminal cases and to replace the necessity for unanimous verdicts by majority verdicts should in itself occupy the six hours.  Assuredly it is a very important change.  The fact that such a provision prevails in other countries is not necessarily a reason why it is most suitable here, and, further, it is one of the first things with which every citizen of the country becomes familiar.  It is one of the first lessons in citizenship that every man learns, namely, that if he is charged with a crime there has to be unanimous opinion of twelve people against him to convict him.  Assuredly to change a thing that is fundamental in the consciousness of every person in the State should in itself be a reason for giving this proposal very great consideration and, if possible, for endeavouring to get rid of Party atmosphere in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that there would be much use in appealing to the small number of Deputies present to reconsider their position with regard to this Bill.  Most of them regard it as a political measure.  One Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy was heard to say that he would make it ten times as drastic in order to get at these ruffians.  I wonder whether the Minister for Finance is satisfied to get a measure of this kind through this House with such mentality at its back?  Presumably the Government Party are satisfied that they themselves can make no mistake, but, if they take the Bill seriously and regard its discussion in this House as a necessary thing, I say that they should be on their guard against allowing such an atmosphere as that to arise in regard to any serious legislation which they propose.  At any rate, it would be well to remember that within the next two years there will be many important trials under this Bill.  If we let it through with some important defect and if it leads to an innocent man being found guilty of a serious offence, or <Col N="498" /> to a guilty man being found innocent, I wonder will it be much consolation to the Minister for Finance to remember that he treated the proposal to examine the Bill carefully and to consider the amendments to it carefully with contempt and that he took advantage of Party feeling to get such a measure through the Dáil practically unexamined and unrevised?</P>
    <P>To my mind, there is nothing more important for a young State than to be careful of its legislation.  There was a book recently published by a distinguished judge in the Saorstát examining the tendencies of Saorstát legislation.  I think he comes to the conclusion or, at least, indicates that there is a great tendency towards bureaucracy, that State control is a feature of all the legislation passed through the House.  I think if he adds a new chapter after this Bill has gone through and, particularly, if he takes account of the way it is passed, he will find that the State is omnipotent.  He will be able to say that there is no longer any doubt about that being the tendency, that the State, meaning the Executive Council, is now everything and that the common people count for nothing.  The Minister for Justice in making a case also placed himself on a pedestal.  He asked: &ldquo;Why discuss questions like majority verdicts?&rdquo;&ldquo;That is a great improvement,&rdquo; he says.  He has already made up his mind that we are to accept his opinion that that is a great improvement in the measure.  He said that when the Censorship of Publications Bill was before the House it was discussed by Deputies on these benches in a sensible way.  Apparently we are not going to discuss this measure, a much more important measure than the Censorship of Publications Bill, in a reasonable way and he is not going to give us a chance of discussing it.  The logic is the most amazing I have ever heard and the proposal is the most amazing proposal.  It is a very dangerous proposal and it is one, in my opinion, the Dáil will always regret having acceded to.</P>

      <P>To say that I am surprised at this motion would be an exaggeration on my part, because it was only what I expected.  In a measure like this, which is of the utmost importance to the country, we generally find that when Ministers do not want disclosures made, they adopt what is generally called the guillotine in order to behead any arguments made by the Opposition. To say that this Bill is an important measure is no exaggeration whatever. We had star chamber methods before.  We had all sorts of secret ways and means for devising and divulging information to be used against certain people.</P>
      <P>We had the same method as they had during the French Revolution, the old method of lettres-de-cachet, and men went to the gallows because somebody spy-holed, as they did in Ballykinlar, to identify somebody as having committed or being about to commit some act which was against the so-called State at that particular time.  Why all the hurry about this closure?  Why all the hurry about passing this particular measure? Why all the cooing from the dovecots of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party about the preservation of peace?  Is it that the people on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches have suddenly discovered that peace at any price is the most wonderful thing in the world?  It cannot be that those people were always men of peace.  Undoubtedly, the Punchinello of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party may always have been a man of peace, because I personally never knew him to be anything else.  I knew him in Ballykinlar with his Bohemian flowing bow and his cherubic glowing face, a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.  The rest of them have now discovered that they now should be men of peace, but it is only in recent years that they have become men of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so very long ago that I remember being asked to come down here from the extreme North to take part in what was to be a coup d'etat in the Free State&mdash;in other words, another rebellion in the Free State Army.  I personally was asked to take part in that rebellion in the <Col N="500" /> Free State Army, and to take charge of the north-west of the country. There are some people on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who participated, and there were colonels in the Free State Army whom I interviewed in connection with it, and who were responsible.  Where then are the men of peace?  At the same time there was a parallel organisation going on within the Free State Army.  There was a Minister on the Front Bench and a prominent Cumann na nGaedheal T.D. in this House responsible for the organisation or the reorganisation of the I.R.B.  Are they men of peace?  Since when did they believe in the Free State or the Treaty, or peace, or this particular Bill?  They are not here now.  I wish they were here, because I do not like to be talking behind their backs. They tried to organise the I.R.B., with the consequence that some of them had to leave the Army.  There are your men of peace.  There are your men who will go automatically, when the bell is rung, into the Division Lobby to protect jurors, to protect the public, to preserve the public peace.  Men of peace!  I ask you why all the hurry?  Why the closure on this particular debate?  Is there any necessity for it?  Do these men tell me at this stage that they are genuinely men of peace, that they never believed in Republicanism, that they want to preserve the Free State, that they want to preserve public peace?  Nonsense!  Again a Minister of that Front Bench, in my own hearing, made a promise, a solemn promise, that the Treaty which he at present upholds was only going to last six months, that there would be another round with England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was at the time, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, when I was so green or innocent that I was not able to differentiate between Ananias and George Washington.  There were certain people I believed.  Certain of them are on the Front Bench as Ministers to-day, and I believed them, God help me, and many more like me. These are the men of peace.  In an hour or in two hours they must have this particular Bill passed or the country will go into desolation straight away.  Why all the hurry? If they had got their way when they were reorganising the I.R.B., did they want to fight or were they merely going to play ring-a-roses? That is what I want to find out from him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Once upon a time members, some of whom I see smiling on the Government Benches, were in jail for their country.  The common practice there was to whiten the window and to put a little spy hole in it.  Certain people came along and looked through the spy hole and identified certain men who, when they were identified, were taken out and put to death.  I thought, at least, I should have got over these things&mdash;I should be getting too old for it now&mdash;but I was <Col N="502" /> under the impression that those men on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who had been through all that kind of thing would have been wiser than to introduce a measure like this which is in the nature of a star chamber method of finding out people who might have been guilty of one certain so-called crime, that is, love of country.  But the I.R.A., as those on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who were in the I.R.A. know, never condoned crime in any shape or form.  Those on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches and on the Fianna Fáil Benches who formerly belonged to the old I.R.A. know that it never condoned crime in any shape or form.  The biggest part of our duties sometimes was made up of punishing those who were guilty of crime.  We do not want any sort of disturbance used by responsible members of the Government in order to blacken their political opponents.  That, however, is exactly what is happening, and that is what this particular Bill is designed for, just as was the speech delivered by the President some time ago in the Rotunda, a speech that he had to swallow piecemeal. He will have to swallow this Bill too, for it is only designed for the purpose of blackening his political opponents.  It is not going to succeed any more than his speech succeeded when he made it on the eve of the election here in Dublin. This Bill is introduced, and they want to pass it on the eve of another election.  I hope that the people of this House will have enough sense to see&mdash;I am afraid it is a forlorn hope &mdash;that this Bill was only designed for the purpose of creating political propaganda for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and the reason the Government do not want discussion on it is because they cannot stand over it.  They want to curtail arguments against the Bill as much as possible, and hence they want to introduce the guillotine in order to prevent people from discussing the Bill as it should be discussed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us is, to my mind, a most important one.  The essential part of it is that no more than six hours be given to the Committee Stage of the Juries (Protection) Bill.  If the subject-matter under discussion was something relating to small matters that are dealt with in this House from time to time, matters relating to local <Col N="505" /> affairs and local authorities, matters of no great national importance, if there was any evidence in the House which could convince anybody that efforts were being made to prolong discussion beyond natural limits it might be understood, but that a motion of the kind now before us in the name of the Minister for Finance should be put down for discussion, a motion cutting out discussion to the extent of giving us only six hours for the Committee Stage of as important a piece of legislation as was ever brought before this Assembly, I think outHerods Herod.  The Minister for Finance in my recollection has been responsible for many extreme things in his time.  He has much to answer for in that direction.  I am not going into that now.  I have gone into it before, and, perhaps, will again; but I want to say that nothing he has ever done of a revolutionary kind that has had an influence on public affairs in this country is likely to have a more baneful influence than the proposition that he has introduced to-day.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time he has introduced propositions of the kind. He seems to be the instrument always selected by the Executive to introduce motions of this kind.  I suppose he is willing to do it, willing to allow his name to stand as being the chief wielder of the guillotine&mdash; a practiced hand, I suppose.  He has used it in many directions, but to use the guillotine as he is doing, and as he proposes this House should do, in a matter of such grave national importance as is under discussion in connection with this Juries (Protection) Bill is something that I, as one member here, think that even he ought to think twice about.  This Juries (Protection) Bill goes to the very foundation of the administration of justice in this country.  The very roots of justice are attacked in that important Bill. People in this House and outside of it, and articles in newspapers, have scoffed at members on this side of the House for their championship of the jury system which we inherited <Col N="506" /> in this country.  It has been evolved after centuries of struggle.  We were laughed at for standing up in this House as the champions of that system.  I do not see any reason for scoffing or laúghing so far as our championship of that system is concerned. Has anybody, even those who have scoffed, pointed to any act of ours as a Party, or to any act of organised Republicans in this House or outside it, that has attacked that system, and has attacked it as an instrument for the defence of the rights and liberties common to all the people?  I know it will be said that jurymen were attacked.  I know that will be said, but that crime that was committed might as well be used as an argument against the Minister for bringing in this Bill as used against us.</P>
    <P>Any other Party in the House might in the same way be scoffed at because a Bill of this kind is introduced.  Certain things were done in the name of republicanism in this country in the last ten or twelve years for which many of us on both sides of the House had responsibility to a greater or less degree.  Many things were done that, perhaps, in the light of after events, in their cooler judgment in later years, some regret having had to do, or having had authorised in days gone by, but I do not know that anything was done in the last ten years by any responsible organised Republican body that attacked the fundamentals of the rights of citizens and the guardianship of the liberties of the citizens, as the jury system is looked upon to be.  No attempt has been made by any body of organised Republicans, or unorganised, to attack the rights and liberties of the people as they are attempted to be attacked by this Bill.  Therefore, I say that being of such an important nature, being so fundamental to the whole institution of justice, the whole Constitution of this newly-constituted State, it is outrageous that a Bill dealing with such an important instrument of justice as the jury system should be brought in here and that we should be told that we are <Col N="507" /> only to be allowed to discuss it in Committee for six hours.  That is something that any Minister would be sent into oblivion for proposing if there was a real, proper sense of citizenship in the country.  We note that the article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; said that a proposition of this kind, if made in what the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; calls the Mother of Parliaments, would be laughed out of existence. That evidently had some effect, because a day or two later the Minister for Justice himself put down an amendment proposing to make the Bill operative for only two years, after he had on more than one occasion and with great vigour protested in the House, when questioned on that very matter, that the intention of the Government was to make this a permanent alteration in the jury system.  I am glad the Minister had the good grace to run away, no matter who encouraged him to do so &mdash;&ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; or anybody else. It is certainly coming to a queer pass in this country when the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; that has not stood for the rights and liberties of the Irish people, whatever else it may have stood for, is the only impartial and influential organ in the daily Press that attempted to make any kind of protest against the outrageous proposition in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I intended to speak to the motion and I am attempting to emphasise the importance of the Bill for the sake of showing how unthinkable it ought to be that a proposition should be made that a Bill of that nature should be allowed only six hours in Committee.  In all <Col N="508" /> sincerity I say there is not a clause in this Bill, and there are ten or eleven effective clauses, to which there could not be five or six amendments at least from one Party in this House without talking at all of the others.  Outside the amendments which come from the Opposition and the Labour Party the amendments of the Minister for Justice himself are themselves most important; some of them are important amendments in principle, and these alone ought to take more than five or six hours for discussion.  I do not know that the Minister for Finance is really sincere in wanting to obviate discussion of what he calls vexatious amendments, or whether his desire is that all discussion on the Bill should be cut out.  Six hours certainly leaves very small opportunity of doing anything with the Bill, improving it or disimproving it.  I do not suppose, once he has made his motion, that any words of ours, or any protest from us, are likely to influence him in the direction of withdrawing or permitting an adequate time for the discussion of this important measure. I have not much more to add to the discussion, but I would not like that a resolution of that kind, relating, as it does, to such very important and fundamental matters, should be passed here without, at least, adding my protest for what it is worth to the protests that have been made against what I cannot otherwise describe than as an outrageous proposal.</P>

    <P>(1)  In every county and county borough to which the section is applied by an order made under this section the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the under-sheriff of such county or county borough by Part V. of the Principal Act, whether as empanelling officer summoning officer, or otherwise, shall as from the date of such order become and be transferred to and conferred or imposed on the several and respective officers on whom such powers and duties would respectively be conferred or imposed by the said Part V of the Principal Act if the office of such under-sheriff <Col N="513" /> were vacant, and accordingly the said Part V of the Principal Act and in particular the expressions &ldquo;the empanelling officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;the summoning officer&rdquo; where they respectively occur therein shall as on and from the date of any such order be construed and have effect in respect of the county or county borough to which such order relates as if the office of under-sheriff in such county or county borough had first become vacant within the meaning of the said Part V of the Principal Act on the date of such order.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for Justice may, whenever he thinks fit, by order made under this section, apply this section to any county or county borough in which the office of under-sheriff exists and is not vacant at the date of such order.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 24, to insert before the word &ldquo;In&rdquo; the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In every county and county borough to which this section is applied by an order made under this section the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the under-sheriff or the county registrar or any other officer of such county or county borough by Part 5 of the Principal Act as empanelling officer, shall hereafter be discharged by the secretary of the county council in the case of counties, and by the town clerk, or other principal clerk of the county borough, in the case of county boroughs and save as aforesaid&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Amendment 1 is in order.  Amendments 3 and 5 are consequential upon amendment 1.  I would not be prepared to accept amendment 2 or amendment 4. that is, to delete sub-section (1) and to delete sub-section (2), because I think a decision upon the deletion of <Col N="514" /> the two sub-sections can be got by voting against the question that the section stand part of the Bill.  To delete sub-section (1) would not be in order because it would have the same result as defeating the section. Those who are against sub-section (1) could get the same result by voting against the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which I could not possibly accept and which I would ask the House to reject.  As the law stands at present, the empanelling is done in certain counties by the sheriff, but, as I explained on the Second Reading, wherever the office of sheriff has become vacant in recent years, under the Juries Act, 1927, the function of sub-sheriff or sheriff is discharged by the county registrar. All that this Bill says is that the county registrar should take up in certain cases the duties which would devolve upon him in any event if the office of sheriff became vacant, even though the office of sheriff has not become vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it is merely accelerating what was thought to be right in 1927, before any question of the introduction of a Bill precisely of the nature of this Bill was in contemplation.  What are the advantages which are proposed to be derived from having the work that is now being done by the sheriff in all counties except four done by the county registrar, not only in the four counties where it is now being done by him but also in other counties where it may appear to be advisable?  What is the object of having it done by the secretary of the county council or by a town clerk?  It is, so to speak, a mechanical duty.  The lists are there; there is no picking, no selecting, no duties of any kind.  Is it suggested that the county registrars are so <Col N="515" /> completely dishonest that they cannot be trusted to carry out this purely mechanical duty honestly? That is what the amendment means, and nothing else.  They are the proper persons to do it, and I cannot see any reason why they should not do it, except one, and that is <Col N="516" /> that this amendment was put forward so that, by having the work done in the county council offices, entire publicity would be given to the jury panel.  It is with the object of giving publicity to the jury panel that this amendment was put forward. I can see no other reason for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to the two Deputies who are interested in this Bill and who have brought it forward, and to the House in general. It is, that the motion which is now before the House should not be proceeded with; that the Bill should not be proceeded with in its present form to-night but that an opportunity should be given to have a further examination of certain details which have come to light since the Bill made its first appearance.  This Bill is to a certain extent founded upon the Report of a Departmental Committee set up to consider the question of workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, I indicated that I had in my Department legislation almost ready to carry out most of the recommendations of the Special Committee. For that reason, I said that I was not merely not going to have any opposition offered to the passage of this Bill, this preliminary measure, but that the Bill was going to be favoured by me.  The Report of the Departmental Committee, notably in paragraph 3, stated that some of the results had to be regarded as definitely provisional because at the time certain statistics were not available.  These were statistics which were considered necessary for the proper <Col N="523" /> understanding of this question and for a proper decision upon it.  In paragraph 3 the Committee say: &ldquo;Matters such as the total cost of compensation; the numbers of employers concerned; the persons receiving payment; the effect of the waiting period on the cost, and other subjects for the proper appreciation of which statistics are essential have consequently been dealt with only on a provisional basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was sent to a Special Committee, or rather since it was reported there has appeared a pamphlet compiled by my Department entitled &ldquo;Statistics of Workmen's Compensation, 1927.&rdquo;  It contains a certain amount of matter which the Committee had not before them and about the absence of which they complained previously.  There are certain figures in this pamphlet which are startling enough and require further examination, so that one can get not merely a provisional but a final decision on the total cost of compensation.  In the statistical return on page 10, dealing with the total compensation paid in Saorstát Eireann, a final figure is shown as to the charge per person employed here and in Great Britain; it comes to 21/5 as the charge per person employed here for compensation whereas the figure in Great Britain is 17/1.</P>
    <P>A more startling figure is shown in page 11, where it states that the average compensation per case paid in the Free State in 1927 was almost £21, whereas in the case of Great Britain it was £13 1s.  In page 13 there is the final item, which I would like to have the Committee consider.  I take two special types of work.  There is constructional work and building; and harbour docks, wharves and quays.  An earlier item will show that constructional work and building covers by far the bigger section of workmen that falls within the terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Now, the number of cases per 1,000 employees of the non-fatal type in 1927 in the Free State was 138.4, whereas in Great Britain it was 68.2.  In the second <Col N="524" /> section the total number of non-fatal cases was, in the Free State, 132.6 and in Great Britain simply 86.</P>
    <P>Now, these figures in themselves require further consideration.  I think I already intimated that this Bill has been founded upon the Report of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, and it is therein disclosed that the result is only provisional, because at the time certain statistical information was not available. That statistical information is in some parts now ready, and it is only right that the Committee should have this Bill referred again to them for examination.  There is one explanation that stands out about all these figures&mdash;the big disparity between the Free State and Great Britain&mdash;and that is the question of the Shannon Scheme, where undoubtedly there has been either malingering to an excessive degree &mdash;which is my own opinion&mdash;or else a very big number of cases of the non-fatal type occurring.  That operates both to raise the number of accidents and therefore to raise the number of cases per 1,000 employees and also to raise the average cost.  Because taking the one year, 1927, the amount of compensation paid during that year arising out of the Shannon Scheme accidents came to £15,000.  There were 1,249 people concerned.  Seven of these cases were fatal and the compensation paid amounted to £1,000.  The rest, disablement cases carried forward from the previous year, or in which the first payment was made in 1927, amounted to something like £14,000 compensation being paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fatal cases in 1927 were seven and £1,000 was the compensation paid.  The average for constructional and building accident cases for 1927 was 52/6 per person; for the Shannon Scheme workers alone the average was 83/10 per person employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear the impact of the Shannon Scheme is a thing that has to be taken by itself.  Nevertheless, <Col N="525" /> subtracting these figures and admitting there have been a big number of accidents either in connection with the scheme or a very big amount of malingering or something that lies between these&mdash;slight accidents being passed as serious and compensation being raised, that being easy enough in the absence of any proper medical inspector, inasmuch as the German insurance firm was bearing the burden of the insurance in this case&mdash;there is still a sufficient case to request the Dáil not to proceed with the Bill, or to increase the amount of compensation which it would give.  I do not know what time it will take to have that Committee called together. Unfortunately, one death occurred amongst the personnel of the old Committee.  That gentleman was more or less nominated by a particular insurance company and another nominee can be got quite soon.  The rest of the Committee are here and can be called on short notice.</P>
    <P>I propose, with the leave of the House, and with the leave of the proposer and seconder, to call the Committee immediately, to place before the Committee any statistical matter that I have, and to send before them any people who may be considered fit to give evidence on the tabulated information.  Thereafter I will come before the Dáil with the amended report, or the report as it originally existed, stood over by the Committee.  It should be possible to have this done in sufficient time to enable the Bill to run its full course before this session ends.  I cannot promise that absolutely, because it will depend upon the attitude of the Committee towards the new information.  A lot will depend also on whether they consider it up to them to give something more than mere approval of the particular rates set out in this new information, or whether they might want to go more deeply into evidence and other statistical information that I could give them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Dáil.  Statements have been <Col N="526" /> made with regard to agreements reached with insurance companies that rates would not be raised on account of the passage either of this Bill or the larger measure which would have to be founded on the main report.  Conflicting statements have been made to me about it.  I am told it is quite easy for insurance companies to say rates will not be raised in consequence of the Bill being passed, for the simple reason that rates have been raised in anticipation of the passing of the Bill. If that is so, I have been given statistics informing me that whereas the rates in Northern Ireland and Great Britain are somewhere about ten per cent. of an increase on 1914 rates, in the Saorstát there is, at present, over 33 per cent. of an increase on the 1914 rates.  It is quite clear there is an appreciable extra burden borne by industry here not borne by the two competing countries. That situation with regard to insurance premiums, and the extra amount that may be required to meet the increase would have to be further inquired into, and I propose to ask the Departmental Committee to get that matter further looked into.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made about the raising of insurance rates, and these alone would constitute a prima facie case for having this matter referred back.  I promise to expedite the meeting of the Committee and their deliberations.  I will see about getting a judgment reached speedily. I do not know the form this should necessarily take.  I suppose the best way would be to request the discharge of the Bill from the Order Paper to-day, and have it set down for consideration in a month or six weeks.  It could be brought forward when the Committee's Report comes.  That is the type of suggestion I would like to make to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated, the Bill was an attempt to give legislative effect as early as possible to the main recommendations of the Departmental Committee which reported on the question of workmen's <Col N="527" /> compensation in 1926.  Some of these recommendations were passed, undoubtedly, on imperfect knowledge. They were provisional, and I think it is reasonable that an opportunity should be given to have the figures finally examined by the Committee. I should like to have a definite basis for recommendation, rather than a provisional basis.  In those circumstances I am agreeable to the proposal that this matter should be adjourned for a month or six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the new statistics that have been furnished by his Department, I agree with him it would be wise that this matter should be sent back to the Committee for further consideration.  It is a pity that the statistics now furnished were not in the hands of the Committee at an earlier stage.  This matter has gone a very considerable length and a good deal of time has been devoted to it by members of the House and others.  It is unfortunate that important statistical information of that kind only comes at such a late hour.  Whether the Department of Statistics was or was not responsible I do not know.  In my opinion, it is strange that certain important information was not available at an earlier stage.  However, now that it has come to hand, it certainly would be unwise for any Committee dealing with the matter to ignore the information that has been got.</P>
      <P>I could not attempt to follow or discuss at this moment the figures read out by the Minister.  One would have to get time to look over those figures and to examine them carefully before discussing the important matters raised in them.  It does seem strange, at first sight, that the average payment should be so much higher here than in the Northern Counties or in Great Britain.  But then possibly the scarcity of population here may have something to do with that, and probably the greater part of the explanation will be found there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> The Minister has referred to the number of cases that have occurred in connection with the Shannon scheme.  As to fatal cases, we all know that there have been a big number, too great a number in my opinion.  Not knowing anything about the internal working of the scheme or the engineering arrangements, but as an ordinary citizen who observes very frequently the number of fatal accidents that occur in connection with the Shannon Scheme, it would seem to me that there is very little thought given to human life. Something more ought to be done and something more could be done to prevent the enormous number of fatal accidents there.  Since the inauguration of that scheme a big number of fatal accidents have occurred.  Somebody said to me recently when discussing this matter that perhaps our workmen here were not as used to dealing with the highly technical matters that they are up against in the Shannon scheme as the workmen in other countries would be.  I said to the friend who offered that explanation that it was not sufficient justification for what appeared on the surface to be a want of proper care with a view to preventing fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>I repeat that a very large number of fatal accidents have occurred directly from the scheme.  I am not talking now of accidents that have occurred outside the Shannon scheme area proper.  Some of those accidents were due to the negligence of the persons concerned.  But on the scheme proper there have been very many more accidents than there might have been had proper precautions been taken.  I do not know anything about the evidence on which the Minister claims that there has been great malingering.  If there is any foundation for that, the blame should certainly lie, I take it, to a large extent, on the directors.  Usually with huge undertakings of that kind the directors would employ medical men of their own who would see that there would not be malingering and whose duty it would be to examine the cases of the men who were reported sick.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> I know that doctors sometimes are soft-hearted, and if a doctor was in the pay of a contractor I think he would be there to earn his money, and, if he did not earn it, he would not be kept.  Before saying anything further I will wait to see what evidence the Minister has.  I think, however, that a reflection has been cast on our workmen and that we should not allow it to go unchallenged. We are satisfied that the best method would be to adopt the suggestion of the Minister to refer the matter back to the Committee for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this Bill being referred back.  While I appreciate in every way the efforts of Deputy Rice to bring in a Bill and to get a speedy decision on this question, I am inclined to think that it would be better to get a more comprehensive Bill from the Minister and to put it into operation on the basis of the Report of the Committee.  The Minister has promised to call his Committee together as soon as possible, but I regret very much that, while he has promised to call the Committee together to investigate the new statistics that have come to his notice, he did not wait for the findings of the Committee rather than prejudice them, as he did, by his statement.  I desire to protest strongly against the attitude which the Minister took up in referring to these statistics.  He proceeded to draw conclusions from them.  I do not know what measure of examination he has given to them. I do not know if he has considered them closely, but he immediately drew conclusions from them.  He states that it is his opinion that there has been a considerable amount of malingering.  I suggest that it was not proper for him to express an opinion on these figures unless he examined them fully and was prepared to stand over them and explain them.  It was not right that a charge of that kind should be made in the terms of the Minister's statement. He states that there has been a considerable amount of malingering in connection with the Shannon <Col N="530" /> scheme and that, of course, that was because there is a German insurance company involved.  That is a slur not alone on our people engaged on the Shannon scheme, but on the nation as a whole&mdash;that we are that class of people that will take advantage of the fact that it is a foreign insurance company that is going to pay and that there would not be so much malingering if it was an Irish company.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister for External Affairs should be the Minister to make a charge of that kind.  I desire to enter a most emphatic protest against it.  We will wait for the Committee's report to hear what conclusions are to be drawn from these figures.  I could, for instance, say at the beginning, if I saw that there were 134 non-fatal accidents in the Saorstát as against 68 in Great Britain, that that of necessity must be due to want of care on the part of the contractor.  I am not saying that, because I do not know that it is the case.  I do not want to draw any conclusion from these figures, but that is a conclusion which I might draw from them superficially, as the Minister appears to have done.  I think it is altogether improper for the Minister to prejudice the possible findings of the Committee by stating that it is his opinion that there has been malingering, especially in connection with the Shannon scheme, because a foreign insurance company is involved. That is not worthy of any Minister, especially a Minister whose duty it should be to uphold the honour of the nation amongst other nations.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Deputy O'Connell has said, I desire to ask a question.  I should be glad to know if Deputy O'Connell, as the Leader of the Labour Party, wants the House to take his suggestion seriously that it would be better to leave the Bill stand.  Does he suggest that I should withdraw it and wait for a more comprehensive Bill from the Minister because, if he does, I am prepared to agree?</P>

      <P>If that is so, it is a charge with which industry in this country should not be burdened. When the Minister asks the Committee to revise the report and to consider the information which is now contained in the Departmental leaflet, I would ask him to get the Committee to consider the facts which were set out when the Workmen's Compensation Bill was going through the British House of Commons in, I think, 1925.  It was stated at that time that out of every three pounds subscribed to the insurance companies they only paid back one pound in benefit to disabled workers.  The Under-Secretary who was in charge of the Bill said that they would look into that matter. If insurance companies can make two pounds' profit out of every three pounds subscribed there must be something wrong.  If that is so in Great Britain it must be much more so in this country, and I would like the Committee to take into consideration the excessive charges of insurance companies, because that is a burden which we should not be called upon to bear.  If we have to bear it I do not see why the benefits <Col N="532" /> to disabled workers should be reduced. In speaking about malingering before, I stated that we did not stand for malingering but that there are cases which might look like malingering and that when a man gets back almost to normal health he is often not able to work. In such cases there should be leniency shown, as you would not call it malingering if it took a man a week or two longer to recuperate fully.  In the case of a man who becomes disabled as a result, for instance, of building operations, it is hard to get him back to his full strength, and if you put him back before he is fully recovered the employers do not want him as they always want their pound of flesh in regard to any man they employ.  As I say, I would like the Minister to ask the Committee to consider whether the insurance companies are charging excessive rates.</P>

      <P>When the Minister suggested that the cause of the rates being higher in the Free State than in other places was, in his opinion, malingering to a certain extent, I came to the conclusion that the Minister was giving his opinion based on information which he might, or should, have in his Department and that there was some evidence at least entitling him to make that statement.  I am not prepared to believe that the Minister would make that suggestion of his own free will.  I take a serious view of his statement, and I do not think that to ask him to withdraw it would lessen the importance of the point to which I wish to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Committee, in considering this, are to take into consideration the serious indication from the Minister or his Department to the effect that these figures in the Free State would be higher than elsewhere because of the fact that there had been malingering, it may to a certain extent interfere with the final fixing of rates by the Committee.  It would be senseless to suggest that these cases which have already occurred ought to be reviewed, because we <Col N="533" /> know that most of the cases would be out of the hands of the inspector. I would like to hear from the Minister rather more than a suggestion that there has been malingering, that the Committee will consider all the facts and figures, and that there is going to be no discounting, without positive proof, to bring about any reduction in the rates agreed upon for this country arising out of any suggestion that there has been malingering unless it can be proved.  The Minister suggested that the malingering might be accentuated owing to the fact that the contractors gave the insurance to a German insurance firm and that that company might not be able to examine cases as well as a local company. I would like to refute that, because any insurance company of any consequence or standing, particularly one such as is connected with the Shannon scheme, would have an assessor available at all times, more especially where there would be such a large amount of insurance work as exists on the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not stated whether all the figures referred to non-fatal cases amongst Irish workers on the Shannon scheme or whether they embodied cases of German workers.  It might not make much difference, but it would be very easy for the Committee to arrive at their conclusion from two sets of figures&mdash;one concerning employees as a whole, having no connection with the Shannon scheme, and another in connection with the Shannon scheme.  After all, the Shannon scheme, judging by the amount paid to the contractors, must be nearing completion from the civil engineering point of view, and it would be very easy for the Department to come to a conclusion based on some figures concerning individuals engaged on domestic work having no connection with the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a matter which I raised here before and to ask the Minister whether there is any possibility of having a <Col N="534" /> convention arrived at between this country and England in regard to insurance matters.  As I pointed out before, this is a very serious matter for this country, especially for western counties, from which a large number of migratory labourers travel each year to England.  When these people get hurt they are faced with the position that the insurance companies will not pay any attention to their claims unless they go over to England.  The Minister is aware that that is a source of great hardship to very many people in poor circumstances in this country. Such a convention does exist between France and England and between England and other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a misunderstanding in regard to my statement about malingering due to the fact that there is a foreign company concerned.  I am not suggesting, although I do not think there is any great scandal in suggesting, that people in this country would possibly be more disposed to draw money from a foreign company than from a native firm.  I never made the suggestion that that was the reason.  My suggestion was that because the foreign firm had not inspectors on the spot it is easier for cases to be registered.  Malingering is undoubtedly there.  I say again that the reason for it is not because people are keen on drawing from a foreign company, but foreign companies are easier marks because they have not inspectors on the spot. One of the reasons why that statement <Col N="535" /> can be made is this.  As far as fatal accidents are concerned, I claim that the proportion is much smaller than on any other scheme of similar size in any other country despite what Deputy O'Kelly said. Most of the fatal accidents on the Shannon scheme have occurred, not in connection with the scheme itself directly, but in connection with such work as unloading materials from ships carrying Shannon material, amongst men working for the contractors. There have been one or two accidents arising out of some of the machines which transport earth closing on people, and there have been one or two caused by a train overturning.  I think there were three fatal cases arising out of that. There were two cases of electrocution, but the majority of the cases have not directly arisen out of the scheme.  I should say that the percentage of mortality amongst German workers is greater than the percentage of mortality amongst Irish workers.  I could give reasons but I do not know that I need go further to support my statements with regard to malingering.  The report of the Statistical Department implies, and I think it is the natural thing, that the lower the wage in any occupation the greater the temptation to malingering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  One of the reasons it happens is that the insurance company had not an assessor on <Col N="536" /> the spot.  To get back to the point I was discussing, the nearer the compensation gets to wage earned the greater the temptation is.  In agricultural occupations there is much more malingering than in industrial occupations.  On the Shannon scheme there was undoubtedly that temptation. Also, I would say this, that whereas the percentage of fatal accidents on the scheme is much lower than in any scheme of similar size in any country, the number of non-fatal cases is far and away ahead of anything that has happened in any other country.  Again, in very few of the fatal cases that came before a jury has there been any condemnation of the contractors.  There was, I think, in one case.  I doubt if the contractors can be blamed, as very few accidents occurred on the scheme.  The statistics were prepared in a very elaborate fashion. When one considers that I have been pressed to exclude many matters from the statistics in order to get out the census of production one gets an explanation as to why this appears somewhat late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. White Dr. White">
      <NameTxt>Dr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The object of the present Bill is to remedy an oversight in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 in omitting to specifically include county borough councils equally with county councils in its definition.  Though this is a very small Bill, still it is of immense importance and urgency to the City of Waterford, and possibly, too, there may be other Irish cities to <Col N="537" /> which this Act in the future may apply.  I know that the Government were very anxious to do something about the matter that I will discuss later on in the Bill, but owing to very pressing work unhappily they were not able to go ahead as speedily as I would have wished.  My colleague, Deputy O'Connell, and I have taken the bull by the horns, as it were, and have introduced this Bill.  Now, apparently in drafting the 1925 Act, it did not occur to the draftsman that a drainage scheme could have any application to a county borough, and that if, in an exceptional case, it did so apply, the definition in the 1925 Act would be comprehensive enough to embrace a county borough.  By Section 1 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, all expressions to which special meanings are assigned by the Local Government Act of 1898 have the special meanings so assigned to them respectively. I am not going to weary Deputies with the 1898 Act, as they can take it for granted that when I quote any Act here it is a fact.  The Local Government Act of 1898, in Section 21, sub-sections (1) and (2), sets out that each county borough, that is, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Cork, shall be an administrative county in itself, and be called a county borough, whatever borough it is, and that it shall have the powers and duties of a county-council under the Local Government Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, everyone connected with the administration of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, assumed that the county boroughs were embraced in the provisions of that Act, and a joint scheme was promoted between the County Council of Waterford and the Corporation of Waterford for the purpose of draining the Kilbarry marshes.  I might add that these Kilbarry marshes are partly within the precincts of the City of Waterford, but the greater part of them are outside the city boundaries.  The necessary petition was filed and the ordinary procedure was gone through.  The Board of Works, a very excellent body, speedily sent <Col N="538" /> down their staff who took levels and surveyed the area to be drained. When the officials in the Board of Works had progressed a very considerable distance with their work, it was discovered at headquarters that it was doubtful if a borough council came within the strict interpretation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, and the work had to stop. It was pointed out that, by Section 3 of the 1925 Act, every council to which &ldquo;a petition is presented by the landholders in the area requiring drainage under the Act shall refer such petitions to the county surveyor for his report on the general merits of the proposals contained in the petition.&rdquo;  From this it was argued that, as there was no corresponding or alternative reference to a borough surveyor in any part of the Act, the Act as worded could not be made to apply to a borough council unless and until amended.  Well, after much discussion and correspondence the point was submitted to the Attorney-General who decided that the Act, as worded, could not be applied to corporations or to borough councils. This decision necessitated the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The area that is proposed to be drained by this amending Bill comprises about 350 acres.  About fifty acres lie within the borough boundary of the City of Waterford and three hundred acres in the county. The key position in this Arterial Drainage Amending Bill scheme lies in the fact that the lands which would be best suited for the erection of a tidal flood gate lie within the corporation bounds.  Therefore, without the co-operation of the County Council and the Corporation the work could not go on.  Apart altogether from the benefits which this scheme would confer on the landholders within the drainage area, the carrying out of the work will incidentally remedy or minimise the frequent floodings of two main roads.  One of these main roads goes to the populous and popular seaside resort at Tramore, seven miles from Waterford City. <Col N="539" /> The other goes to Cork, and whenever you have bad weather, especially in the winter time, these two trunk roads are flooded and you cannot travel on them, and of course that is a serious handicap to Waterford City.  Furthermore, the county surveyor, Mr. Bowen, assured me there are only about four feet of a crust forming the surface of the road and under that you have mud.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many members of the Dáil have been down to Tramore. If they have been they will have noticed that we have plying to Tramore one of the finest and most up-to-date services of motor buses to be found anywhere in Ireland. Some of these buses are very heavy, and it is quite possible if the weather continues inclement that they may go through the surface of the road. That, of course, would be a very serious thing, and might entail possibly a loss of life.  That is one of the chief reasons why Deputy O'Connell and myself are very anxious that this Bill should become law as speedily as possible.  I might also add that it is not desirable to have a huge bog, such as Kilbarry, in the precincts of the fifth largest city in Ireland.  That bog, just like any other bog in Ireland, or in any country in the world, is composed of a lot of decaying vegetable matter. There is no doubt whatever that the proximity of this marsh is not conducive to the good health of the citizens of Waterford.  The drainage of Kilbarry, apart altogether from doing a service to the road, would also be doing a service to the health of the people of Waterford, and, in addition, will give much-needed employment.  As everybody knows, as far as works of reclamation or drainage are concerned, the summer is the best and, in fact, the only, time for the successful carrying out of these works.  That, again, is one of the chief reasons why my sparring partner and myself are so anxious to have this Bill become law at an early date.  The various medical officers&mdash;I do not say this off my own bat&mdash;from time to time have <Col N="540" /> advised the drainage of the Kilbarry marshes.</P>
    <P>I might say, and of course it might not have been any great loss to the city, that some forty years ago the English would not make Waterford their headquarters because of the fact that the death rate in Waterford then was very high, and I believe it is unduly high at present. I merely mention these facts to try and bring vividly before the minds of the members of the Dáil the importance of this scheme.  As I have said, I hope the scheme will also apply to other Irish cities.  We are not a bit jealous in Waterford.  There may be some areas in other cities circumstanced in the same way as we are.  I do not think there is anything controversial in this Bill.  I trust I have not wearied the Dáil by being too long.  What I did say I tried to condense in tabloid from as well as I could.  I trust that this Bill will meet with the unanimous support of the various Parties in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to add to what Deputy White has said in connection with this Bill. Both Deputy White and myself are very much interested in it, inasmuch as it affects Waterford city and county.  Deputy White has pointed out the difficulties the County Council experienced some years ago in connection with the drainage of the Kilbarry marshes.  The County Council found it impossible to cooperate with the Corporation of Waterford owing to a defect in the Drainage Act.  If the Bill succeeds in remedying that it would be very welcome as the drainage of the Kilbarry marshes is badly needed, not alone from the point of view of saving the roads in the vicinity, but it will certainly improve the health of the city, and it will undoubtedly do for Waterford city and county what is very much desired.</P>

      <P>I understand that efforts have been made before to bring about co-operation.  Of course, I know there was a flaw in the law, but I take it from what I have heard from more than one source, that the County Council, or some influential members of it, were rather glad that that flaw was found and that they had not to bear their share of the burden in carrying out that drainage scheme in co-operation with the Borough Council of Waterford.  I would be glad, and so would anybody interested, and we all probably are, in the public health of the country to see a scheme of that kind carried through.  If, as Deputy White has told us, the Kilbarry marshes do injuriously affect the health of the area, and the city of Waterford in particular, one would like to see a scheme of that kind put through, but when it comes to a question of bearing the cost of the scheme I would like to see the County Council fairly well tied up in advance, so that they would back up whatever scheme was put forward to them by the engineers of both bodies.  I do not know if very much use will be made of the powers sought for.  I am not satisfied that use will be made of them by the the County Council of Waterford, or that the Borough Council will avail of them, and, therefore, I do not think the powers such as will be <Col N="542" /> granted under this Bill will be of any great value to them, but if they are of any value, even in the one case cited here, they should be given, especially if there is any promise that the powers will be put into operation.</P>

Can a Bill of this kind, if it involves expenditure of money, be brought forward by a private member and come to completion in a private member's hands?

Whether the bringing forward of that Money Resolution will prevent the Bill going to a committee or not, I do not know, but I do not think it will.

      <P>It raises a question of confiscation and plantation and troublous days, in which were rooted many of the problems which confront us to-day.  At the time of the Cromwellian wars they were troubled in England as to how they were to pay the soldiers, and a plan was thought of that there should be adventurers or undertakers to put down or stake certain sums of money, for which they would be recouped by confiscated land in Ireland, if the reconquest of Ireland at the time was successful.  One of those who adventured such sums was a London merchant named Erasmus Smith, who, I think, adventured about £300, for which he was granted 666 acres of rich land in Munster.  He was a very extensive farmer, as we shall see.  By 1684 his estate had expanded and extended to 47,000 acres.  After the Cromwellian war, 1,000,000 acres of Irish land were allotted to those adventurers and undertakers, and one and a half million acres to the Cromwellian soldiers, because many of them were not paid in cash, but in debentures.  Apparently, these soldiers did not like the look of things in large sections of Tipperary, Cork and other counties, and they sold or handed over their debentures very cheaply to some adventurers, and one who got hold of sheaves of debentures was Erasmus Smith, so that in a few years he had over 40,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He founded certain schemes of education for the tenants on his estate with conditions attached to them, and in a few years he enlarged the amount of land he devoted to the purposes of education.  The instruments of the foundation were three. The first was the Indenture dated December 1, 1657; the Letters Patent dated November 3rd, 1667, and the <Col N="545" /> Charter dated 26th March, 1669.  He is referred to in most of the subsequent documents as &ldquo;the pious founder.&rdquo;  The Indenture states: &ldquo;This Indenture witnesseth that the said Erasmus Smith, for the great and ardent desire which he hath that the poor children inhabiting these presents, is expressed, should be brought up in the fear of God and good literature ...doth bargain and sell unto the said Henry Jones and seventeen other trustees the 2,876a. 3r.&rdquo;  That Indenture does not exclude Christians, nor indeed members of the Jewish persuasion, and that passage gives ex professo his own private religious intention in founding his endowment, as distinct from the religious intentions of the Governments under which he lived.  It is maintained in law that anything that Erasmus Smith was compelled to do by the laws of his day is not evidence of his intention.  Three schools were founded under this endowment for the education of the tenants of the estates and certain others living within a few miles of the estates. The estates, I believe, are in ten counties and the income was at one time £10,000 a year.  It is now somewhere about £7,000 a year.  There has been much litigation and inquiry as to the administration of the trust and the purpose for which Erasmus Smith intended the money to be devoted or the purpose for which he made the endowment.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions were laid down at the outset as regards religious instruction, and these were changed when Charles II. came and the question of forfeitures was re-opened and Erasmus Smith gave still more land for education.  Whether it was charity or foresight that inspired him to enlarge the grant and give more endowments I do not know.  He first seemed to be a Nonconformist, then an Episcopalian and at times an anti-Episcopalian, but I do not think that these things affected his endowment. The final schemes set aside 13,000 acres and as far as can be ascertained the present income is about £7,000.</P>
    <P>There are many points on which the Trust has been evaded.  I need not go into them all.  Perhaps the <Col N="546" /> most glaring breaches of the Trust were the founding of about 146 English schools all over the country&mdash;I believe the majority of them in Ulster, in which there were no confiscated estates or any Erasmus Smith estates.  That involves an expenditure of something like £300,000. The High School in Harcourt Street not on the Erasmus Smith Estate has got between £40,000 and £50,000 as far as can be ascertained.  Over £100,000 was given, in one way or another, for the education of about 20 boys at the Blue Coat Hospital, Dublin.  These were all breaches of the Trust.  The Commissioners of 1858 who went into the educational endowments repeatedly asked the Erasmus Smith Governors for the rules governing the endowment, but they did not get them until the inquiry was ended.  I do not know why they could not get the rules, but they were published in the Report afterwards&mdash;they did not come before the inquiry.</P>
    <P>In 1895, a representative deputation, headed by Mr. T.M. Healy, waited on the then Chief Secretary, Mr. Morley, representing Catholic tenants on the estate of Erasmus Smith, in Louth, Tipperary, Clare, Westmeath, Leix and Offaly, Limerick, Galway, and Sligo.  Under the Endowment Act of 1885, two judges were appointed to act with certain other commissioners, the judges being Lord Justice Fitzgibbon and Mr. Justice O'Brien.  The judges disagreed, but both said there should be a change, and though Lord Justice Fitzgibbon was of opinion that the Erasmus Smith Endowment was for Protestant schools, he still said that £2,000 annually should be given for the education of Catholics. It is difficult, of course, to prove what Erasmus Smith's intentions were in that respect.  Certain people based opinions on a letter he wrote in 1682, thirteen years after the endowment.  Of course, you cannot refer back an opinion expressed in 1682 to 1660. That is not law.  Apart from that, it seems that he did in that respect whatever he was forced to do by the Government or laws of the day, and that is not legal.  In many ways. <Col N="547" /> too, that clause, if it were law, has been evaded.  For instance, in accepting the Intermediate grant, which necessitated a conscience clause, the Education Endowments Act commands that free education be given to all the tenants' children on all the Erasmus Smith Estates in Ireland and to twenty other children from the neighbourhood of an Erasmus Smith School.  The settlement concerns some 10,000 children.  Mr. John Morley said that &ldquo;the pious founder had gone to the wall&rdquo; and &ldquo;some way must be found by the Executive Government to do this act of justice to persons from whom it it is too long withheld&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the children of the Catholic tenants of these estates.  Schools were founded with that money which it was never the intention of Erasmus Smith should be founded&mdash;for instance, in Ennis and Nenagh. Mr. Morley said: &ldquo;It was quite impossible that the question can remain where it is.&rdquo; Father Humphrey took the matter to the courts, where he was beaten on a technical point.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the whole history of it. At any rate, the main intention of the founder is not being carried out. Moneys to the extent of £400,000, I would say, have been expended on purposes upon which he never intended that they should be expended. The Charter is admittedly impossible to fulfil, and a commission should be set up to enquire into the whole matter.  It is doubtful, indeed, if the endowments were ever of private origin, because Erasmus Smith was never actively in possession of these estates.  They seem to me more like a Royal grant.  There are conflicting arguments and many legal points to be settled.  A plan for administration was drawn up at one time that would admit of the education of Catholic children, although drawn up by the President of Magee College, who was a non-Catholic.  It is quite obvious that the matter requires investigation, so that there should be some finality.  Two Chief Secretaries for Ireland, non-Catholics, <Col N="548" /> were in favour of the matter being enquired into and of having the injustice of centuries, as the late Lord Morley said, rectified.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion.  In doing so I hope that it will have the general support of every Party.  Erasmus Smith was an alderman from London who obtained grants of land in Ireland during the years 1666 and 1684, amounting to over 46,000 acres, 2,600 acres being in County Tipperary, which I have the honour to represent, and 4,900 acres in County Limerick.  In the three wills which he made, he directed that his schools endowment should be used for the free education of all the children on his estates, and of twenty other poor children who resided within two miles of his schools in Tipperary, Galway and Drogheda.  The endowments were, roughly, worth £10,000, up to the passing of the Land Act of 1903, and are now roughly worth about £7,000. He did not specify that the money was to be devoted to the education of Protestant children on his estates. He said that it should be devoted to the education of all the children on his estates, and twenty other poor children in the neighbourhood who resided within two miles of the grammar schools at Tipperary, Galway and Drogheda.  The endowments have been diverted from the use for which they were intended, with the result that to-day, instead of being devoted to educating the children on the estates, and other poor children, they are spent on the education of strangers.  Trinity College got very large sums out of the endowments, although they were only entitled to a very small portion according to the original wills of Erasmus Smith, and that only to complete the education of the children of his tenants or those who went to the three grammar schools.  In 1720 Trinity College received £947 to erect buildings.  There is nothing in the original documents to show that Trinity College was entitled to one penny of the endowments for <Col N="549" /> that purpose.  In 1728 Trinity College received the sum of £580 to rebuild premises; in 1775 Trinity College received £2,500 to build an examination hall, and in 1802 a sum of £9,600 to purchase a library.  The Trustees who have been spending the endowments for the past hundred years or more have evidently endowed Trinity College, and the money has been diverted from the education of children on the estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fahy has stated, this matter has been before the courts on a number of occasions.  Two judges who were appointed to allocate the endowments differed, Lord Justice Fitzgibbon holding one view and Mr. Justice O'Brien another.  In order to try and arrive at some conclusion a deputation waited on Mr. Morley, who was then Chief Secretary for Ireland.  The case was put before him by the late Governor-General, Mr. Healy, who was then a member of Parliament.  Mr. Morley, in his reply, admitted that he had studied the subject very closely, and also the two judgements given by the learned Judges.  He went on to say: &ldquo;It does seem to me that it is quite impossible, after such a dictum as that of Mr. Justice O'Brien, that the question can remain where it is.  Mr. Healy knows very well the difficulty attending the bringing in of Bills and that although a Minister may promise to bring in a Bill it may be out of his power to redeem the promise. Therefore I do not promise immediately this session to bring in a Bill, but I will make this admission to you, that the subject is one that cannot remain where it is, but, in my judgement, no time ought to be lost&mdash;whether that time be short or long&mdash;by any Executive Government with a sense of what is due to equality in this matter.  And having in my mind the construction that has been put on the intentions of the pious founder over the whole surface of England, whoever sits in this chair will be bound, as I feel bound at the earliest possible moment, to bring forward some proposal which will cause a re-hearing and a reconsideration of the scheme.  Some way <Col N="550" /> must be found by the Executive Government to do this act of justice to persons from whom it is too long withheld.  I will give my best attention to this matter, with a view to taking practical steps upon the views I have stated.&rdquo;  Unfortunately Mr. Morley and his Government did not remain much longer in power, with the result that the matter is still in the same position as it was at that time.  No further action has been taken since.  I would appeal to Deputies of all shades of opinion to see that justice shall be done to the children of those for whom this money was intended by the pious founder.  In appealing to the House I think we ought to get general support for that.  This should not be made a Party question.  We come here to claim justice for the sons and daughters of the tenants on the estates of Erasmus Smith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told, I believe, that the Shannon scheme, a great marvel of engineering, will be a boon and a blessing to a great many people in this country, but there is at least one man who has reason to regret that the Shannon scheme was ever started, and that is the principal teacher of Parteen Boys' School.  This teacher was engaged there from 1914 until 1927. He enjoyed a free residence as part of his emoluments, with a garden attached, situated amid the sylvan surroundings of Parteen, but the result of the Shannon scheme has been that his school and his residence have disappeared, and he has been forced to take rooms in Limerick for his wife and family at a rent of £52 a year.  Although during the previous thirteen years he could go from his residence to his school without even going out in the open air, he has now to travel a distance of three miles from and to <Col N="551" /> Limerick every morning and evening. Anybody who has travelled over that road will know what that means.  He has continually to dodge Shannon lorries on the way, and he is a man who is not very strong physically.  As I say, all this has come as a result of the Shannon scheme operations.  This school and residence happened to occupy a position right in the centre of the Shannon scheme operations, and it was necessary to demolish them in the course of the work.  That was done; the manager was notified by wire to close the school, and the teacher had to make whatever arrangements he could to get other accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember discussing this matter informally in June, 1927, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I certainly got the impression then that this teacher would not be neglected in the manner in which I hold he has been neglected.  That was the impression I got, and that was the impression I conveyed to the teacher concerned &mdash;that although the Minister was not then in a position to say, as certain legislation had not been passed, what exactly could be done, he felt quite certain that between himself and the Minister for Education a way would be found whereby this teacher would not suffer.  One of the Minister's officials went down and saw the teacher and an arrangewent was come to in the matter of compensation by which he was to be given 25/- a week for rent and 10/- a week for expenses.  The teacher agreed to accept that compensation, and here is where the difficulty comes in: It was understood that that would be paid for eighteen months and that by the end of that time a new school and residence would have been erected.  That was giving reasonable time for the work to be done.  Now two years have gone by, and not even a site has been obtained for a residence or for a school, and, worst of all, it was agreed afterwards that a lump sum of £100 would be given instead of <Col N="552" /> the £127 10s. which the compensation would have come to if it had been paid every week, but this money was not paid because it was sought to attach the condition to it that it would be accepted in full and complete satisfaction for all claims that the teacher had.</P>
    <P>No school was involved in the Shannon scheme works except this. This teacher's residence has been taken away from him.  It cannot be denied that he had a free residence there.  He also had vegetables free, but now he has to purchase them in the City of Limerick, pay this high rent, and travel three miles to and from his school.  The parliamentary Secretary says that he was advised that the free residence enjoyed by the teachers was in no way part of their emoluments.  I asked him who gave that advice, but he was not in a position to say.</P>

      <P>Yes, as a supplementary question.  In any case, the fact that he had a free residence there and that as a result of the Shannon scheme operations he has no longer a free residence is not disputed.  He is paying £52 a year rent for rooms in the City of Limerick.  That is what the Shannon scheme has brought to him.  I do not want to go into nice legal points or into the technicalities of the position, but it seems to me a very peculiar thing that, in connection with a scheme which is costing the country £5,000,000, reasonable compensation cannot be given to this teacher for the hardship that has been inflicted on him.  It seems to be a case of shifting responsibility from one Department to another.  When the Minister for Education is asked why the school and residence has not been erected, he tries to shift it on to the local people and says that the provision of a new residence is a matter for the local parties.</P>

      <P>At the time that the residence was taken over from the teacher he was not told that, and he was certainly given to understand, and did understand, that a new structure would be erected inside a reasonable time, and the reasonable time mentioned was eighteen months.  I do not want to argue on the technicalities or as to what is the exact legal position.  I feel perfectly satisfied that a way could be found by which a new residence and school could be provided if the Minister for Education or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or both together, were really serious and were anxious to see that the hardship that has undoubtedly been inflicted was removed.  It is now two years since this school was destroyed.  Teaching has to be carried on in a temporary wooden structure.  Of course, the Minister says that it is perfectly sound, perfectly sanitary, and perfectly suitable in every way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connell Mr. T. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that so far as that is concerned, of course, there is no hurry about it.  I put it to the Minister for Education, as the man who has the interests of those who are employed under his Department at heart: is he perfectly satisfied that the teacher has been fairly treated?  I feel quite certain that he could not answer that question in the affirmative.  I would also like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say whether or not he considers that it is fair to take away this man's residence from him and to offer him £100 in complete satisfaction of his claims for the disturbance which has been created and for the loss which has been inflicted on him. I feel that the very least that ought to be done would be to continue to pay what was originally agreed upon &mdash;that is 25/- per week and 10/- per <Col N="554" /> week expenses&mdash;until such time as a new residence is erected to replace the residence which was destroyed. That is not an unreasonable amount. A couple of hundred pounds one way or the other is infinitesimal in comparison with the cost of the Shannon scheme, and I think as this is the only one case of a school that is involved that a way ought to be found.  As I said, I am perfectly satisfied a way can be found by which new schools and a residence can be erected to take the place of those which were destroyed.  I think it is not an unreasonable demand &mdash;that payment of the rate originally fixed should be continued until such time as that is done.  There can be no controversy I think as to the position or as to what has actually happened. The man's house has been taken away from him, he has been put to very great expense and inconvenience and no steps are being taken yet to re-erect the school or residence.  I feel if the Minister for Education or the Minister for Industry and Commerce were serious about it a remedy could be found, and I think it will be the opinion of everybody who has listened to the facts that it is only right and just that a remedy ought to be found for the hardship inflicted on the teacher concerned.  I do not want to delay over this.  Both the Ministers know the facts fully but I want them to say what exactly they propose to do either in the matter of erecting a school and residence or in the matter of compensation to the teacher until such time as the residence is erected.</P>

      <P>I have only one or two words to say on this particular matter.  The facts, so far as the joint school and residence are concerned, are as Deputy O'Connell has stated.  But there is this to be borne in mind&mdash;and this is the only aspect of the case that, for the moment, I am interested in&mdash;that the building in question, I think the Deputy himself will recognise it, was practically one hundred years old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so. It had probably a lifetime of ten or fifteen years more.  The walls were bulging in some places and the windows were bad.  That was the report of the school as we got it from the people who had inspected the school.  The local people would, undoubtedly in a short time, be up against the proposition of supplying a new school and of supplying the necessary one-third.  In that case I suggest it would be quite reasonable. If they took the award into account, making the reasonable local contribution which they would be called upon to make, in a short time the question of a residence could be easily settled.  By providing a local one-third and our giving two-thirds a teacher's residence could be provided. That is the only way we can see of solving that particular aspect of the question.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell makes a plea to me that this is only one case, that there is only a matter of a few hundred pounds involved, that I should be lenient and that the amount is nothing in comparison with the millions spent.  Deputy O'Connell should know that we have lost very heavily on the Shannon scheme on moneys paid by way of compensation for land acquired.  We would lose more heavily if I gave in to every demand that was put up, even though it were only £100 or £50.  It is by taking care of the odd fifty pounds that we have saved millions on that scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We prevented other millions from being spent.  I do not want to be as delicate as the Minister for Education on this point. The condition of the schools, as reported to us, was that they were poor indeed.  They were within three years of being a hundred years old. The front wall was badly bulged, the roof was dilapidated and sagged, the woodwork was old and in some places perfectly rotten.  The teacher's residence that we heard so much about was of the most meagre type and consisted of three rooms, two downstairs, twelve foot square, and one upstairs room.  There never was an agreement to pay 25/- a week and something else, but the valuer in estimating compensation to be given to these people said he would take some figure like that and said definitely to the two teachers concerned that the new school ought to be there in about eighteen months.  If it was there earlier he would have gained.  If it was there later he would have lost. It was his gamble.  The £100 was put up as the best thing we could have done.  We never could have agreed, I put it to Deputy O'Connell, to pay compensation to some person for a period over which we had no control.  It is not a matter for us <Col N="557" /> whether the school, when rebuilt, should have a teacher's residence. The manager is not compelled to build a teacher's residence.  He could take the money we have offered for compensation.  He may build a schoolhouse and may leave out the teacher's residence altogether.</P>
      <P>It never entered into our calculation that we would have to pay something over a period of years. It might amount to payment for life to the teacher if the school was never put up.  The Minister for Education said it would have to be taken into consideration that the schools would have to be rebuilt.  It is known that not many years ago investigations were conducted by the then manager with a view to having a new school.  That was about 1918.</P>

      <P>All this amounts to is that the teacher may have been induced to take the position owing to the fact that the residence was given to him.  Supposing there was no Shannon scheme and that the schoolhouse was destroyed by fire, I wonder would the manager be compelled <Col N="558" /> to rebuild a school with a teacher's residence attached.  Would the teacher's agreement entitle him to get a residence out of the manager? I do not think that could be held.  At any rate, I may pass over that.  I think as regards the report of the valuer&mdash;the valuer on whose reports I have settled pretty nearly all the cases in connection with the acquisition of land for the Shannon Scheme&mdash;if I varied it in this I would have to vary it in the others. The valuer had got to take into consideration all the items that merit valuation in this particular case. I do not propose to vary it.  I am in this peculiar position.  There are two teachers concerned.  £100 was offered to each.  The lady teacher took the £100 and has got away with it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy means that her husband is employed on the Shannon scheme and has a pension, I admit it.  The offer to Mr. Kelly is no longer open.  I have since been advised that the payment I made to the lady teacher was illegal. At present I am advised that I can make no payment to this man.  With regard to the residence, I am told that he has, in fact, no claim to compensation which I could legally meet.  Therefore, I am afraid that the offer to Mr. Kelly is now to be regarded as withdrawn.</P>
