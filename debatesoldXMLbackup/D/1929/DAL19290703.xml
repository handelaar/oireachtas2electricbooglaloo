    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the prospective insolvency of the Irish National Teachers' Pension Fund was taken into consideration when arriving at the Ultimate Financial Settlement with Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of the apportionment of Statutory or Departmental Funds following the establishment of Saorstát Eireann was laid down by Article 12 of the Transfer of Functions Order, 1922, and was accepted and acted on both by the British Government and the Government of Saorstát Eireann prior to the negotiations which led to the Ultimate Financial Settlement. Accordingly the question of the solvency or otherwise of the Irish National Teachers' Pension Fund did not arise in connection with that Settlement, and was not taken into consideration when its terms were agreed on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state what ratios were adopted in apportioning (a) the Teachers' Contribution Account, and (b) the Endowment Account between Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland when the Irish Teachers' Pension Fund was divided; what was the date of that apportionment; what was the total value of the fund at that that date; how many of the pensioners then chargeable to the fund were resident respectively in Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland, and how many teachers, contributors to the fund, were resident in Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland, respectively; what was the total amount paid during (a) the year of apportionment, and (b) the year preceding that, out of the fund by way of pensions to residents in Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratios adopted in apportioning (a) the Teachers' Contribution Account, and (b) the Endowment Account between Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland when the Irish Teachers' Pensions Fund was divided were 68.2 per cent. to Saorstát Eireann and 31.8 per cent. to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The apportionment took effect as from 1st February, 1922.  At the date of apportionment the fund consisted of securities of the nominal <Col N="3" /> value of £1,987,799 14s. 4d. and £8,660 11s. 9d. cash.  An additional asset of the fund at the date of apportionment was the annual charge of £39,000 on the Church Temporalities Fund in favour of the Pensions Fund.  1,959 of the pensioners then chargeable to the fund were resident in Saorstát Eireann and 714 were resident in Northern Ireland.  9,161 teachers resident in Saorstát Eireann and 3,926 teachers resident in Northern Ireland were contributors to the fund at that date.  It would not be possible to give the information asked for in the last part of the question without going to a great deal of trouble and research.  It may, however, be stated that the total amount of pensions paid from the fund to residents in Saorstát Eireann in the twelve months ended 31st January, 1923, was £98,270, and that the pensions payable as at 1st February, 1922, in respect of residents in Northern Ireland amounted to £41,103.  The total of all pensions paid from the fund in the twelve months ended 31st January, 1922, amounted to £142,282.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, when the Irish Teachers' Pension Fund was taken over from the British Government, any investigation, actuarial or otherwise, was made into the position of the Fund, and, if so, what results were disclosed and what consideration was given to such results when the Fund was being taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Saorstát share of the Irish Teachers' Pensions Fund was taken over from the British Government no actuarial investigation was made into the position of the Fund.  The necessary investigation was made to secure a proper apportionment of the assets of the Fund between the Government of the Saorstát and the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Earnán Altún</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (1) whether he can hold out any prospect of immediate employment to the teachers of the Elementary Evening Schools which have been dissolved recently, and (2) whether it is proposed to make any reimbursement for the expenses incurred in equipping and maintaining these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy, in connection with the first part of his inquiry, to my reply to Deputy Good on the 27th February last, in which I explained that those of the teachers who were employed in evening schools and who possess the recognised teaching qualifications should have little difficulty in procuring suitable employment, but that, as teachers are appointed by the managers in the case of primary and secondary schools, and by the local committees in the case of technical schools, I am not in a position to give any promise to find employment for those or any other teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, these evening schools were voluntary in character and were recognised, subject to official regulations, on the applications of managers of national schools, committees (including committees of technical schools) or other persons. It was an essential condition for their recognition that they should be conducted in suitable premises with <Col N="5" /> adequate equipment.  Under the regulations, the managers or committees employed the teachers and arranged the amount of their remuneration. The State payments, which included grants on the basis of the efficiency of the instruction and a quota of the cost of heating, lighting and requisites (such as books and stationery), were intended to cover a proportion of the expenditure on the equipment and maintenance of the schools, in addition to the remuneration of the teachers.</P>
    <P>No further reimbursement for expenses incurred in equipping and maintaining these schools is, in the circumstances, admissible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has laid down, or is now prepared to lay down, for guidance of local authorities making contracts, any general rule as to percentage of preference such local authorities may allow to Saorstát contractors as against contractors residing, or having their factories or places of business outside the Saorstát, so that the members of such local authorities shall not afterwards be liable to surcharge by the Auditor for giving a preference to Saorstát manufacturers or contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it feasible to make a general rule as to the extent of preference which local authorities may allow to Saorstát contractors and manufacturers as against others.  Every reasonable encouragement is given to local authorities to support Irish manufacture and Irish firms.  On each page of the 137 pages devoted to prices and specifications in the current issue of the List of Official Contractors to local authorities, the words &ldquo;Support Irish Manufacture&rdquo; is printed in large lettering. There is no obligation on a local authority to accept the lowest tender for any commodity or work where good reasons exist for an alternative <Col N="6" /> course and no case has come under my notice of any surcharge of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say on how many occasions his Department has written to local authorities asking for explanations as to why they did not accept the lowest tender?</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state the number and estimated value of any contracts for building, road making or repairing and other similar purposes placed by local authorities of the Saorstát, during the last twelve months, with (a) contractors whose headquarters or principal offices are situated in Northern Ireland, and (b) contractors whose headquarters or principal offices are situated in England.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware, the only case, as regards housing, coming within the terms of the Deputy's question is the tender of the Housing Corporation of Great Britain to the Dublin City Commissioners for the erection of 179 houses at Donnycarney for £67,086. As regards roads, the following are the particulars asked for, as far as can be ascertained at the moment: (a) Northern Ireland&mdash;Number of contracts, 3; value, £11,927; (b) England &mdash; No. of contracts, none; value, none.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Seán Brady Seán Brady">
      <NameTxt>Seán Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in the forms of contract approved <Col N="7" /> by his Department for use by local authorities, clauses are included stating that Irish materials must be used or that a specified preference must be given to Irish materials when contracts are being made by local authorities of the Saorstát for the building of houses, the making or repairing of roads, the carrying out of schemes of drainage, sewage disposal, or water supply, or other such schemes of improvement, and if no such clause or clauses are now included in such approved forms of contract, whether he will consider the advisability of having such clause or clauses inserted in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Such clauses are not and could not be included generally in contracts because</P>
      <P>(a)  materials are in some cases not produced in An Saorstát, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the extent of preference to be allowed must be a matter to be decided by the local authority in the presence of all the facts of the transactions under consideration.</P>
      <P>There are no approved forms of contract.  An outline housing specification is, however, in use for the guidance of both private persons and local authorities.  It provides that all materials, where possible and practicable, are to be of Irish manufacture or origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Seán Brady Seán Brady">
      <NameTxt>Seán Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has laid down any general rule for the guidance of local authorities who make contracts with outside contractors for the building of houses or the making or repairing of roads, as to the insertion of a clause or clauses in such forms of contract making it imperative on such outside contractors to employ a certain percentage of Saorstát labour on the carrying out of such contracts, and if he has laid down any such rule, if he will state its nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as housing contracts are concerned the matter raised by the Deputy is usually covered by a clause in all <Col N="8" /> large contracts of local authorities requiring the employment of local labour.</P>
      <P>As regards road contracts, clause 11 of the &ldquo;General Conditions of Contract&rdquo; stipulates that the contractor shall employ local labour to the extent of not less than 80 per cent. of the men employed.</P>

      <P>The valuations are revised from time to time on the application of the local fishery authority and of my Department, by whom the lists are reviewed annually.  The valuations are made by the Valuation Office, which deals with the valuation of property generally, and there is no reason for believing that there is any inequality between the valuations of fisheries and of other properties.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question on this subject on the 6th March, I stated that a report on the proceedings of the last Assembly, which was then in course of preparation, would be placed in the Library for the information of Deputies. Twelve copies of the Report were subsequently placed in the Library. The Oireachtas Library is kept supplied by the Department of <Col N="13" /> External Affairs with a very large number of publications covering the entire scope of the League's work. Of these publications, seven are issued monthly, one quarterly, and a considerable number appear at irregular intervals.  Those who keep in touch with the League's work should accordingly expect to find our Report in the Library, but if there is a real desire that formal notification should be given on the Agenda Paper when Reports on the League are placed at the disposal of Deputies, I shall consider the most suitable time and best procedure for effecting this.</P>

A Bill such as that, while it may look quite simple on its face, may have implications which it may be necessary for the Minister to explain.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil sit later than 11 p.m., and that the Order for Adjournment be taken not later than 8 a.m. to-morrow.&rdquo; It will be observed that quite a number of Estimates have still to get consideration from the Dáil, and it is usual to allow some time to the Seanad to consider the Appropriation Bill.  There was, I think, an understanding that the Estimates would have been disposed of on the 20th June.  Although the understanding which had been arrived at, that each Thursday should be allotted to Estimates, was not strictly adhered to, to date the time allotted was practically the same as would have been given had the date allotted for Estimates been as arranged at that time.  I think it will be generally agreed that the financial business, so far as the Estimates are concerned, should be concluded in time to allow due and proper consideration of the Appropriation Bill by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to that proposal.  I think that a sitting overnight simply means that the work will be only half done. The rush of business at this particular time is due largely to the Government's introducing a number of Bills at the last moment.  Some of these Bills require careful consideration, and we think that any effort to rush them through the House is against the public interest. As for the Estimates, we think that it is right that we should get reasonable time for their consideration. The proposal that we should sit all night simply means that the Estimates will not get that consideration, so we are going to vote against that proposal.</P>

      <P>I must say on behalf of the Labour Party that we object to an all-night sitting also.  I, as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, consider that that Committee should have been called together before the President moved a motion of this kind.  I believe, if that Committee had been <Col N="17" /> called together, a certain amount of accommodation would have been afforded.  Even at this stage, I submit that might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the Executive Council have been given every consideration during the present Session to get Government business done.  I think that I am correct in saying that since the Budget was introduced by far the greater portion of Private Deputies' time was given over to Government business, and no objection to that was taken by us. We are strongly opposed to sitting all night, irrespective of what the state of the Order Paper may be, because it is quite obvious that proposals for legislation cannot get proper consideration from Deputies who are sitting fifteen hours at a stretch. As I mentioned already, a large number of Deputies have been in Session since 11 o'clock this morning on various public committees, and to think that they will be able to give the Bills and the Estimates that will come before them proper consideration, having been at that work for twenty hours is, to my mind, a very mistaken idea.  I have no doubt that this proposal is put forward largely because the Government believe that this Dáil is not capable of improving any of the propositions which they bring before them, whether these proposals relate to Bills or to Estimates.  It is, in addition, an attempt to prevent a proper examination of the administration of the various Departments by the Government during the year. I say it is a form of blackmail.  It means delivering an ultimatum to Dáil to the effect that if we do not permit this encroachment on the time of the Dáil, the Government will submit the members to a certain amount of physical inconvenience. The Government appear to think that quick legislation is better than good legislation.  On that matter, we strongly disagree with them. The various Estimates on the Order Paper deserve the proper consideration of the Deputies, if these Deputies are to carry out their duties as public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> A number of new Bills were introduced last week, including the Agricultural Credit Bill, the Land Bill, and the Electricity (Finance) Bill, all of which are designed to remedy defects in Acts introduced by the Government and rushed through this House in this manner. Afterwards it was found that they were unworkable.  It has been found necessary in other cases to remedy similar defects due to lack of foresight on the part of the Government. It is a decidedly bad practice to introduce into the House at the end of a long session important Bills of this nature.  Deputies should be given an opportunity of considering them over the Recess, during which they will have an opportunity of getting all the information they want in relation to the Bills.  Then, when we resume, Deputies will be able to discuss all measures in a proper frame of mind.  A certain system of Government has been framed here&mdash;it has been embodied in sections of the Constitution&mdash;which implies public discussion by the elected representatives of the people on every proposal for legislation.  It is not supposed to be government by a dictator or by decree.  Every day we are getting fresh evidence that the Government appear to consider themselves hampered by these democratic sections of the Constitution, and they appear to be anxious to get back to a position in which their word will carry without any further question.  I submit they have not the moral courage to come here with proposals to amend the Constitution and they are just trying to evade its obligations by trickery.</P>
    <P>I see it suggested in the Press that the Dáil should adjourn on 11th July. Why I do not know, except that prominent members of the Government Party may be anxious to attend celebrations usually held on 12th July.  It is unusual, in any case, to adjourn in the middle of the week. The proposal to adjourn on 11th July implies that the members of the Government Party are anxious to be off on that particular Friday.  Even if adequate time were to be afforded to the Dáil to consider all the matters <Col N="19" /> on the Order Paper.  I would remind the Government that a very large number of Bills necessary for the proper government of this country have been promised but have not yet been introduced.  We were promised a Town Tenants Bill, a Dublin City Management Bill, a Merchandise Marks Bill, a Minerals Bill, and a Fisheries Bill, together with a number of other Bills.  Not one of these has appeared.  Apparently a number of them exist only in the imaginations of Ministers for election purposes and they are not likely to appear.  If the Dáil is to do its work properly it is not the convenience of members or a desire for holidays that should be taken into consideration, but rather the legislative needs of the country.  The legislative needs of the country do not permit of an adjournment as early as 11th July.  Neither does the idea of proper government require that we should sit all night, most of us probably half asleep, to consider important proposals.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Dáil will assert its independence of the Executive Council in this particular matter, and reject the proposal that has been made by the President.  If it is necessary, we can meet on Tuesdays, or we can meet for an extra week. In fact, we can meet on Mondays and Saturdays as well.  The length of each day's sitting is sufficient to enable Deputies to follow the proceedings with some degree of intelligence. A meeting lasting over fifteen hours would make that physically impossible.  Eminent scientists have estimated that the average man can do only four hours constructive work a day.  I do not allege that members of the Dáil are average men, or that they do constructive work, but I submit that it is not physically possible for any member, even the supermen of the Executive Council, to do fifteen hours' work a day.</P>

I see in this all-night proposal a scheme to bludgeon out the opposition.  I have a decided objection to being bludgeoned by anybody.  I wish to point out also that there are a lot of Estimates here which, if taken at two or three o'clock in the morning, will not receive the amount of discussion necessary for their proper consideration, particularly when we consider the usual condition of the Assembly at that hour.  I would urge, for the sake of the dignity of the proceedings, that this proposal should be reconsidered.  I am afraid the condition of the members of the Dáil at three o'clock in the morning will not be very dignified for anybody to look at.</P>

    <P>That, for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to authorise an increase in the capital of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, and to authorise the making of divers <Col N="24" /> alterations in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the said Corporation, to make further and better provision for the issue of Certificates of Charge by the said Corporation, to extend the provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1928, to unregistered land, to make provision for divers other matters relating to or connected with the said Corporation, and for those and other purposes to amend the Agricultural Credit Acts, 1927 and 1928, it is expedient to authorise the charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of&mdash;</P>

    <P>The new shares to the extent of 200,000 will be taken up by the banks.  They have already agreed to do so, so that the maximum number which the Minister for Finance will be called on to take will be 300,000.  It might be somewhat less.  Consequently the maximum amount of money required for the new share capital will be £150,000. There is provision in the Bill for the payment of £5,000.  It is estimated that the interest foregone as a result of the division of the shares into A and B will be about £45,000.  That will be the principal expenditure under it, but, as a matter of fact, if the capital were not increased, the remaining 10/- per share would be called, and, consequently, the <Col N="25" /> amount of money equal to the £150,000 now required would be necessary under existing legislation.</P>

      <P>I thought that I explained that on Second Reading. The real object of the division is to get rid of the present arrangement whereby the Minister for Finance is paid dividends on the shares held by him, and the money for paying those dividends has to be advanced from the Exchequer.  Under this arrangement no dividends will be payable on the B shares, and the position will be, with the special arrangements about the B shares, that, after a year or a year and a half, there will be sufficient earnings to pay dividends on A shares. The B shares will remain without interest until there are profits earned.  We will get to the position whereby no dividends will be paid except out of profits.  At present dividends are being paid although there are no profits to pay them.  It is intended to get rid of the position in which the Exchequer advances moneys which are paid back to it in dividends, and also to get rid of the false position shown on the balance sheet as a result.</P>

I believe under the principal Act, the banks had three directors, the Government three and the shareholders one.

      <P>Yes.  The Minister for Finance has a majority of the shares. As a matter of fact, we could have them all as shareholders and directors, but it was agreed that as the banks were the other principal shareholders, the people they wanted should be elected to the number of three.</P>

      <P>I would like some explanation of the words in brackets in sub-section 1 (e): &ldquo;Unless the Minister authorises such series to be issued without any guarantee by him.&rdquo;  I take it that that enables the Corporation to issue certificates of charge without a guarantee which they had not power under the principal Act to issue.  If I am right in that I think it is a very important provision to be slipped in, in brackets as it were.  Perhaps the Minister would explain if it gives him that power.</P>

If the Minister has to pay certain money, I presume there will be some place where the question of payment can be raised, but if it is a statutory payment, it is not part of the Minister's policy, and you cannot raise on the Minister's salary why he is making certain payments which he is compelled by statute to make.</P>

      <P>I will have to consider this carefully.  I am not going to answer the Deputy's question specifically with regard to this particular question on the Bill except to say that where the Minister, by a particular Act of the Oireachtas as distinct altogether from the Appropriation Act, is compelled to make a certain payment, he cannot be challenged on his Estimate, that he ought to change the policy, because manifestly only the Oireachtas can change policy which is embodied in statutes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should it?  The Local Registration of Title Act, 1891, has simplified proceedings in respect of the title to land, and the cost of registering a caution is very small indeed.  The greater part of it is solicitor's costs, and I see no particular reason why a slight cost of this sort should not be paid.  People could make as good a case in connection with other matters, and if you did it in this case you would have to do it in a hundred others, and upset the whole machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be lawful for the Corportion so to alter its memorandum <Col N="41" /> and articles of association that the Corporation shall be entitled and authorised to lend or advance money (in addition to the persons and for the purposes mentioned in Section 12 of the Principal Act) to any person, other than a co-operative society, for the purpose of paying off a loan or other liability which was originally made or incurred, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to or by him or any other other person wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could under the said Section 12 be made to him by the Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the end of the Section the following words&mdash;&ldquo;or for any other purpose or purposes including personal and family maintenance where in the opinion of the directors the making or incurring of the loan or liability was calculated to facilitate the farmer in effecting economies or avoiding losses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Reading debate I raised this point about the power the Corporation have of lending money.  It was pointed out that there are certain purposes for which the Corporation feel they have not power to lend money&mdash;for instance, for household expenses.  If a person, for instance, runs up a bill for groceries, provisions or other household expenses he is not entitled to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to pay those bills.  Or if a person incurs a bill for the education of his children, or the apprenticeship of his children to a trade, he is not entitled to get a loan from the Agricultural Corporation to pay off that debt. On the other hand, if he has a well-stocked farm he is entitled to take out two or three cattle and to sell them and pay these bills, and then to approach the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan of money to buy cattle instead of those he has sold.  It is to cover that position that I suggested this amendment, because I believe that if a farmer <Col N="42" /> wants to effect economics and wishes to avoid loss he cannot possibly sell the stock which he has to sell to pay his debts, and then, again, go to the next fair and buy stock for the money he gets from the Corporation.  This particular stock that he has to sell may not be marketable, at best market value, or it may not be the best time to sell.  The farmer may have incurred a loss by selling that stock at that particular time.  Where it is so easy to evade the principal Act, where it tries to tie the farmer down to the use of money for farm purposes only&mdash;where it is easy to evade that in reference to the particular case I mentioned, I think it would be very much easier for the Corporation to work if it had a discretion.  And this amendment gives power where, in the opinion of the directors the making or incurring of the loan is advisable.  It sometimes happens that a person can go for a loan to the Corporation to pay a certain debt, which may include a debt that is mixed, some of which was incurred for provisions, clothes, and so on, for household purposes, and part of which was incurred for feeding stuffs, or some agricultural purpose.  The Corporation have to go to the trouble of getting the original invoices and dividing them up.  Then, if a certain amount is paid off the bill they have to go into a sum in proportion to see what remains of the debt incurred for farm purposes and for household purposes. Having gone into that matter they are at liberty to make a loan to pay off that part of the debt that was incurred for farm purposes.  I think this amendment, if accepted, would enable the Corporation to give loans much more quickly and without such a great amount of inquiry.  It is not a question, as I mentioned before, of interfering in any way with the security, because the same security will be there in any case.  The Corporation will be just as secure in making a loan if this amendment is inserted in the Bill as they would be if it were not <Col N="43" /> inserted.  It is not a question of security at all, but is a question of giving the Corporation wider power.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 1 (a) :&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act or in the memorandum of association or the articles of association of the Corporation, the Corporation shall be deemed always to have been before the passing of this Act empowered to lend or advance money to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of paying off a loan or other liability which was originally made or incurred whether before or after the passing of the Principal Act to or by such person or any other person wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could be made by the Corporation under Section 12 of the Principal Act, and no loan or advance of moneys so made by the Corporation before the passing of this Act shall be held or deemed to be or ever to have been invalid or irrecoverable on the ground that the making thereof was in excess of the powers of the Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is really to save the Corporation in case the doubt which exists should prove to be well founded from being met with a refusal to repay money borrowed.  Section 23 makes it clear that the Corporation is entitled to lend money for the purposes of paying off a loan or other liability which was originally incurred for the purposes for which the loan might be <Col N="44" /> made under any of these Acts.  Certain doubts have arisen.  The Corporation made certain loans, and were advised that they were entitled to make these loans.  Later on they were advised that there was a possibility that the courts might hold they were not entitled to make the loans. Section 23 was inserted for the purpose of absolutely making it clear that in future they are entitled to make the loans.  This amendment is for the purpose of preventing anybody who may read in the newspapers about the insertion of this section claiming that the loan he had got was made outside the power of the Corporation, and therefore was not bound to repay it, and it is to make sure that the Corporation will be able to recover loans made, even if by any chance it should be proved that they were made outside the terms of the memorandum.</P>

    <P>Where land or a tenancy in land is put up for sale by the Irish Land Commission under any statutory power in that behalf vested in them and such land or tenancy is subject to a charge in favour of the Corporation which is a permanent improvement charge within the meaning of the Amending Act of 1928 or of this Act, such land or tenancy shall be sold subject to such charge in addition to any other charge, incumbrance, or liability subject to which such land or tenancy is required by law to be sold.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to save the Corporation from possible loss.  It is easy to see that there will be cases where if the land cannot be sold with any debt belonging to the Corporation upon it, other than debts in respect of <Col N="45" /> permanent improvements, the realisation may mean that there will not be money enough to pay the Corporation what is owing to it. There does not seem to be any strong reason why a farm should not be sold with a debt in respect of non-permanent improvement charges.  If there be no strong reason against this amendment, I think it would facilitate the Corporation in getting recovery of sums due.  At all events, the real purpose of putting down the amendment is to find out why the Minister is making this distinction as between the two things.  One can at once see that a person who purchases a farm which has been charged with a permanent improvement has got full value for his money, so to speak.  On the other hand, if he has got a farm with a charge in respect of improvements that were not permanent, it will naturally lower the price that will be given for the farm, and at the same time it might enable the Corporation to get in money that would be due to it.  I do not intend to press the amendment if there is strong opposition to it, but I would like to have the Minister's view upon the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to justify the section itself even as it stands.  There is this, of course, to be said in its favour: it is simply placing the loan made by the Agricultural Corporation in the same position as a loan formerly made by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then when it comes to the question of a sale it is justifiable because there is value there for it.  If it were possible under Deputy Moore's amendment for a farmer to borrow £500 for any purpose and he lost the money and that £500 was charged on the land, the real effect of it would be that it would be impossible to sell the land; it would be very difficult for the Land Commission to sell&mdash;I think it would be utterly impossible &mdash;if some money for which there was no value remaining on the land was to be charged against it.  It is for that reason, and also for the other <Col N="46" /> reason of not going beyond merely putting the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the position of the Board of Works, that the section is as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Minister understands that the Corporation will give only half the value of a farm on loan, or less than half.  If there is sale for the farm it ought to sell with the debt attached to it.  The Land Commission is paid and the Agricultural Credit Corporation is paid, and after all they have a better right to get money out of it than the man selling it.  Selling under present circumstances, if Deputy Moore's amendment is not accepted, the original owner of the farm may get a certain amount out of it as soon as the Land Commission is paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.&rdquo;  I put down that amendment by way of censure on the Government, of which the President is the head, because the Government has not, in our opinion, during the year that has passed or for the coming year, made adequate provision to meet the great social evil of unemployment which is, <Col N="48" /> unhappily, still with us.  We are not in a position to say definitely what the extent of that evil is.  On several occasions we have endeavoured to obtain statistics from the Government Departments&mdash;to get definite figures about unemployment.  We believe that these figures are available, but they have not been presented to us or to the public generally.  They have been promised for quite a long time, but we are still without them.  We can only judge by the figures from the unemployment exchanges.  These figures do not represent the number of people unemployed even in the skilled trades, because we know that the people who sign the unemployment register are only those who are entitled to unemployment benefit. That is a very small proportion of the number of people unemployed. We have our own observations to help us.  Any of us who go about the country, and who are especially acquainted with the conditions in Dublin, knows very well that there are very great numbers of people unemployed.  The same applies to a very large extent to provincial towns.</P>
      <P>We have had a rather remarkable statement which confirms my assertion that there are large numbers of unemployed in Dublin.  That statement is borne out by the authoritative declaration made some weeks ago in the course of a discussion which took place between the Dublin County Council and the Commissioners with regard to the proposed alteration of the law in connection with outdoor relief.  It has been stated that there are in Dublin no less than 5,000 families who would be entitled to obtain outdoor relief if the law in Dublin were the same as in other parts of the country. There are 5,000 families, the breadwinners of whom are able and willing to work, but they are not in the position to obtain work.  They are fit subjects because of that for outdoor relief.  I think that statement would be sufficient for us to say that this is a problem of such an extent that it ought to be one of the problems to engage the most serious consideration of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> We have the present number of unemployed, and we know that the Shannon Scheme will be completed inside the next few months&mdash;within the present financial year, at any rate.  It is expected that that will involve the throwing out of employment of a very considerable number of unskilled workers.  We have heard nothing from the Government, no indication whatever, of any steps being taken by them to meet the increased unemployment which will result from the completion of the Shannon Scheme.  No adequate measures, in our opinion, have been taken, and we have heard of no plans and no proposals from the Government to deal with this question, which, as I say, is a question which affects our whole social and economic life.  Of course, we have the statement on record from the spokesman of the Government that it is no part of the duty of the Government to provide employment for the people. I trust that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have his attention called to the very important pronouncement regarding that particular question which was made no later than last week by a very distinguished theologian, speaking at the Maynooth Union.  He referred to the pernicious doctrine which was being preached to the effect that the State had nothing to do with unemployment, and stated definitely that &ldquo;it was not only the duty of the State, but the interest of the State, to deal with unemployment, for indigence and unemployment in creased not only the number of the sick, but the number of the malcontents and the criminals, who are a blot on and a source of danger to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it can be stated that it is as much part of the work of the Government to deal with the social evils created by unemployment as it would be their duty to deal with social evils which might arise from any other cause.  If there was a danger of an epidemic of a serious, contagious disease, the State would not deny that it was its duty to take measures to protect the people from an evil of that kind.  They might as <Col N="50" /> well deny their obligation in that case as deny their obligation to deal with what is undoubtedly and admittedly a grave social evil.  We have three classes of people to consider in this matter.  We have what might be regarded as the normally employed people, mainly skilled people, who suffer from occasional unemployment, due to trade depression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or unemployment, due to movement of trade or the completion of works here and there.  That is the position that is met by our unemployment insurance. It is intended to be met by unemployment insurance.  We have, in addition, what might be termed the normally unemployed, and those constitute a very large number, indeed.  We have many other people who get casual employment &mdash;short periods of employment on the roads or something of that kind &mdash;but who normally are unemployed. These are mainly unskilled people.  It is for these we say that the Government have not made the efforts that we think ought to have been made, and could be made.  You have, in addition, a great number of people who might be described as being normally under-employed. Among these, I would class many of our small farmers, especially the uneconomic landholders and their sons.  To these, I would add the fishermen and people of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention has already been drawn on several occasions here to the fact that when the Government set out on what they call &ldquo;a policy of economy,&rdquo; they effect economies by cutting down certain Estimates which provide money which normally would give employment. We have had various instances of that.  We have an instance this year; there were very considerable reductions in the land improvement schemes on the Land Commission Vote.  In fact, it always seems to us that whenever the Government set out on a campaign of economy of <Col N="51" /> that particular type, the economy is effected by cutting down sums intended mainly to provide employment. That is not &ldquo;economy&rdquo; that can have any other than the opposite effect to that which, apparently, the Government intends. Surely, that is not economy.  Moneys are saved nationally, or apparently saved nationally, at the expense of the ratepayers; that is really what happens.  If the money is not available for distribution for useful work, then the local authorities and the ratepayers must come to the relief of the unemployed, because we have these men with us, and they must be supported.  They must live, and they are a burden on the community.  The community must support them.</P>
    <P>It will not be sufficient for the Government to say, and certainly they are not doing their duty when they say: &ldquo;We will not provide this money; we will not provide any further money which, under this head, in the past gave employment. We will leave that to the local authorities.&rdquo;  That has been, as far as we can gather, the attitude taken by the Ministry on several occasions here.</P>
    <P>What has been done by the Government in this matter?  We have heard repeatedly trotted out here all the steps the Government have taken to increase industry, to revive trade, and, thereby, to create employment.  I submit to the Government, without detracting in any way from what they have done in that particular connection, that these things in themselves are not sufficient to deal in an adequate way with this problem.  They are too slow.  Men must live while the Government schemes are being developed.  We have heard in previous years of the fine things that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts were to do.</P>
    <P>I wonder could we get an estimate from any Minister of the actual number of people who have been employed as a result of the Trade Loans Facilities Act?  I think we <Col N="52" /> heard a statement here a few weeks ago to the effect that people had not made the use of that Act which they might have made, or which it was thought by the Government they would have made.  If that is so, it is practically what some of us prophesied when that Act was going through, that it would not be able to do all the things expected of it, in the way of creating employment, by the Government at that time.  About eighteen months ago, as a result of pressure from this House, the Government set up a committee to look into the question of unemployment.  That committee made certain recommendations. What has been the result?  I would like, especially as the President is here, to know what has become of the special sub-committee set up for the purpose of dealing with the question of housing?  Certain recommendations were made in regard to matters of housing.  The committee was confined to Dublin people under the chairmanship of a Deputy of this House.  Although reference was made on many occasions to that committee, we do not know exactly what it has done, or what it proposes to do.  The question which I want to ask the President is: has he thrown off his own responsibility, has the Government shifted its responsibility in this matter on to that committee?  Is that the position? If the committee chooses for one reason or another&mdash;I am not saying who is responsible&mdash;not to make a report, and to do nothing, does the President propose to sit down and say: &ldquo;I can do no more&rdquo;?  Is that the attitude of the Government in regard to that matter?</P>
    <P>We were promised early in this session that a very comprehensive housing scheme would be introduced some time during the year.  The only proposal we have is the extension, if it can be called an extension, of the present Act and of the grants available.  Is that the last word of the Ministry on the matter of housing?  A few days ago I was looking over the Report of the <Col N="53" /> Gaeltacht Commission.  I was looking at several recommendations which have been made.  The Minister for Local Government was Chairman of the Commission, and, in the statement issued by the Government afterwards, observations were made in regard to those recommendations. In Recommendation 55, for instance, it was stated that a special system of loans and grants would be introduced for the improvement of houses in the Gaeltacht. In Recommendation 59, in regard to the question of State grants for the encouragement of land reclamation, it was stated that the Government were prepared to give effect to the recommendation and would have the matter explored with a view to the preparation of a suitable scheme.  They are, however, still on that voyage of exploration, and we have had nothing tangible as a result of it.</P>
    <P>In connection with recommendations for a comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage for the Gaeltacht we have it stated that one large scheme, which is outside the Act of 1925, for the improvement of Lough Corrib and the River Corrib was being examined.  I expect that Deputy Fahy could tell us whether it has passed the stage of examination. So far as I know it has not, and the people in that area may still look forward to employment when its examination is complete.  The same may be said in regard to other recommendations of that Committee. We have still to see their fruition. We have nothing but Government promises to depend on, and a comparison with the broken reed would be too good in that connection.  Here we have this problem.  We have work to be done.  No one will deny that.  There are many schemes of national development.  They need not be enumerated as they are well known.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would not call them economic because they would not return five or ten per cent. on the money invested, but they are works of national importance which would add to the national well-being. As I say, the work is <Col N="54" /> there to be done.  The men are available to do it.  The Minister for Finance will not deny that it would be possible to obtain money to spend on such work.  You have those three factors present. What more is required except organisation and, perhaps, imagination and a little courage on the part of the Ministry to attack this problem in the way that it ought to be attacked?  It has never been made the dominant issue that it should have been made, and no genuine attempt has been made to tackle it in the way that it ought to have been tackled.</P>
    <P>We have now, at least, examples of the steps that have been taken in a neighbouring country to deal with this problem.  Not alone, however, has no special Minister been appointed here, but the Government have not set up a special committee of the Ministry to handle the problem in the way it ought to be handled.  We have those schemes to which I have referred, and I have no doubt that the Minister will sing out the litany again of all the various things they are doing.  The fact, however, is that we have the problem of unemployment with us, and that is the test.  Has there been a steady diminution in the number of unemployed people in the country?  Take the City of Dublin, for instance.  I have quoted figures which show that in Dublin, in any case, the problem is such that it should not be allowed by any responsible Government to continue.  The Minister for Local Government, whenever this problem is raised, has always the one remedy &mdash;namely, the local authorities are empowered to deal with any man in a state of distress owing to unemployment. As I have said, I do not desire in any way to detract from the schemes which the Government have endeavoured, in a small and piece-meal way, to set on foot with the ultimate object of creating industry and providing employment. but I say that that is not sufficient, as, in the meantime, those who are unemployed must live.  Whether is it better that we should simply throw these people on to home <Col N="55" /> assistance or that we should provide employment for them which might not be fully economic, in the sense which the Minister for Finance would say is economic. I have no hesitation at all in saying that it would be a much better economic proposition for the country as a whole that such works should be provided, and that money should be specially provided for such work.  That is why we have here repeatedly urged that money should be provided by way of special schemes, whether relief schemes or any other schemes, to give employment to men who are able and willing to work, but who are not in a position to find work, to give employment to such people until such time as they will be absorbed into other industries as a result of the Government's measures for the development of industry and for increasing trade.</P>
    <P>The Government have deliberately taken up the attitude that they will not provide sums of that kind.  Not only that, but they have gone further.  They have reduced very considerably indeed the money which was available in the ordinary Estimates for employment, especially for the employment of unskilled men, who are the people normally unemployed. I do not wish to dwell on this matter in any great detail.  I just want to deal with the question in a very general way, and to say that it is our belief that is the duty of any Government in power to make special provision so that people will be normally employed.  It is because there is no doubt in our minds that the present Ministry have failed lamentably in their duty in that respect that I am moving to have this Vote referred back for re-consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to support the amendment to refer back the Estimate.  We intend voting against the Estimate as a whole, because in our opinion scarcely any of the things that one would expect an Executive that had any regard <Col N="56" /> for national interests to do have been done.  In the first place, let us look at the Estimate itself.  We have an increase in the Estimate for the Department of the President of the Executive Council.  In our opinion, there is no reason for this increase at all.  Some of us, at any rate, expected to see the Vote for this Department diminishing year by year to a much smaller standard than at present.  The work of the Government is now thoroughly departmentalised. If all the branches of Government are departmentalised, as they are, why should we have to spend a sum, which is pretty well standardised at about £13,000 per year, on a central Department? After all, a great deal of the work of the office of that Department merely consists of sending along matters that come to them for attention by the proper Department. We think, accordingly, that a staff of these dimensions is quite unnecessary.  Instead of a diminution we have an increase.  The estimated expenditure on the Vote itself is increased by £668, and the expenditure on other votes in connection with it by £97.  Instead of the decrease one would naturally expect, we have a total increase this year of £765.  That is typical of the extravagant way in which all the Departments are run as far as we can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount estimated for this year for Central Fund Charges and Supply Services after deducting possible amounts for over-estimation, is £25,000,000.  That is becoming practically a standard figure.  It is pretty well stabilised now.  If we look at the figure for last year and compare it with that for this year, we will see that it is pretty well stabilised at £25,000,000.  If we remember that the total net product of our industry is only £20,000,000&mdash; that is the estimate given by the Department of Industry and Commerce of the new portable goods manufactured here&mdash;we see the extravagant way in which we are living. The Census returns give us £24,100,000 odd.  If we deduct from that the products of industry which cannot be classed as portable goods, <Col N="57" /> we come to the amount given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;£20,000,000&mdash;so that we are spending on Government one and a quarter times as much money as represents the total net products of our industry in portable goods.  I think no body of representatives who are interested in the well-being of the country can be content with that.  When we make an examination to see how that money is spent, we have, of course, to go back to the items we have so frequently brought to the attention of the Executive, items like the Civic Guards, which are still at the standard of over £1,500,000; the Army roughly £1,500,000, and pensions running up to £2,350,000.</P>
    <P>I have had an attempt made to extract from the Estimates the salaries over £1,000 a year.  It is very difficult to do it thoroughly, or to do it exactly, on account of the way the figures are presented in the Estimate.  I have estimated that 246 individuals receive in the way of salaries from the State, a total sum of £324,945.  That is an average of £1,321 each.  When we know that there are people starving here in Dublin, and that this country is paying 246 persons an average of £1,321, we get another picture of the type of administration and the costliness of the administration which we have. It is in order to call attention to that fact and to the general administration that we propose in the first instance to vote against granting this money.  It is not with respect to administration alone that we are dissatisfied. If you take any one of the big problems that the Executive should have tackled, we find that in every one of them it has a record of absolute futility.  Deputy O'Connell has mentioned the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>He has pointed out that recently it was shown that there would be about 5,000 families here in Dublin that, if the statutory conditions were the same, would be entitled to outdoor relief, and everybody who knows at all the conditions of the city knows that there are numbers <Col N="58" /> of families starving at present.  We see no effort whatever made by the Executive to deal with the problem of unemployment.  Some years ago I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce disclaimed on the part of the State any responsibility for relieving unemployment.</P>

      <P>The quotation will not affect the fact that the Minister disclaimed responsibility for finding work for the unemployed as part of the duty of the State.  When that statement was made we pointed out that it was the duty of any civilised State under present conditions to see that employment was available and opportunities for work available for those willing to work.  It was one of the primary duties of the State, and last year I pointed out that the present Primate of Ireland supported that view and said it was definitely part of the obligations of a modern State to see that the citizens were given an opportunity of getting work or else were given the necessary means to live.  A couple of days ago from a responsible authority also you have a similar statement made. Deputy O'Connell this evening drew our attention to it, and we want to know whether the Government still keep to the attitude which was indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some years ago or whether they are going to accept definitely the responsibility which should be theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of telling us what exactly is their policy, because even though he may now say he did not make that statement, so far as we can judge the actions of the Executive are in consonance with that statement, because if they took seriously the responsibility of getting employment, or giving to people out of work, work equivalent to the work they had been doing, then we would not have the conditions we have at present.  If they took seriously that responsibility, they would not treat as they have treated suggestions by which employment could be given in this country. Suggestions have been made by members on this side of the House which have indicated the direction in which employment could be given to 100,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have still the same thing going on in the way of imports into this country of unnecessary articles. If you look at the last returns and see the position, in Class II., under the heading of food, drink and tobacco, we import into this country £23,020,000 worth of goods.  Remember we are an agricultural country, and this is under the heading of food, drink and tobacco, whereas our exports under the same head amount to £21,173,000. Is it not obvious to anybody that there is something fundamentally wrong with that?  Side by side with this unemployment we have emigration from this country at the rate of 500 persons a week.  Between the years 1924 and 1928 we have had the total number of 131,137 young people emigrating out of this country, and that is only to countries outside of Europe and not within the Mediterranean Sea, so that altogether our total emigration is much higher than that.  The figure for countries out of Europe last year was 24,691. That is roughly an average of 500 a week.  The fact that the Government has failed to deal with unemployment and with the emigration <Col N="60" /> problem is quite sufficient to condemn them.</P>
    <P>Then, with regard to housing, something like 40,000 are needed. We pointed out here that the best way to deal with that was by giving to the local authority loans on long terms, and thus give them an opportunity of going on with their schemes.  That was pooh-poohed here.  We had the President and the Minister for Local Government, when that suggestion was made, saying that people with any sense of responsibility would not make suggestions of that kind.</P>

      <P>I saw them beforehand and verified them.  In any case, it is not so much that they pretended, in a time of election, to deal with this problem, but the fact that they have absolutely failed to deal with it in the past is our ground for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, we come along to the question of the treatment of agriculture. They brought in an Agricultural Credit Bill after it had been heralded for a long time as something which was going completely to change the position of the farmer and put him on his feet.  We know the result of that.  When it was brought in it was meant to deal with a different question altogether, practically the question of financing agriculture in normal times, and <Col N="61" /> there was no effort whatever made to deal with the farmers who, as a result of the depression immediately following the war and the changed conditions, were in the position that some of the very best of them were unable to carry on.  Their farms were unstocked, and generally the capital which was necessary to enable them to get on with their work was not available.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of putting them on something like equal terms with those with whom they would be competing in the North of Ireland and Britain, the question of derating.  We are told, of course, that that cannot be thought of, simply because the Executive persists in doing a thing they should not do, and doing a thing that there is no legal obligation on them to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

He spent a considerable time in dealing with the question of derating and in explaining why it was not possible for the Government to derate.

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that if I am ruled out on this particular point, it practically means that I am going to be ruled out on everything.  I took unemployment as dealing with a certain section of the community. In taking housing, I am dealing with a section of the community.  We have 78,000 people, an increase of 5,000 in two or three years, without suitable houses.  I intended naturally to go on to consider other sections of the community whose position is largely influenced by the policy of the Government.  I was taking the farming community and asking what was the policy of the Government with regard to the farmers. I had asked what was the policy of the Government with respect to the whole question of our trade.  I find it very difficult to criticise the Government policy if I cannot proceed in a natural way to look at the sections of the community who are affected.  In saying that, I do not wish, in any way, to disobey the ruling of the Chair.  I am simply pointing out a natural difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there is the question of land distribution.  It has been estimated that at the rate at which land has been distributed under the 1923 Act, it would take something like 63 years to complete land purchase in this country.  I am dealing with the Executive Council, and looking at <Col N="65" /> the different Departments in their work.  If we look at the Department of Fisheries, we find that the returns are diminishing yearly.  We want to know, for example, what the Minister for Fisheries is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not that arise more properly on the Vote for the Department of Fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Executive Council have common responsibility ultimately for the policy which is carried out by any member of the Executive Council.  In other words, when dealing with the Department of Fisheries, we have, in the first place, to deal with the Minister who is responsible, but we have also to deal with the Executive Council, for whom this Vote is, because they have common responsibility for all these Departments. It is the duty of the President of the Executive Council, if one of these Departments is not functioning as it ought to function, to take action with respect to the matter.</P>
      <P>Fisheries and Lands have been put into one Department.  There is a Parliamentary Secretary.  I would like in passing to say that, in our opinion, most of these Parliamentary Secretaries are unnecessary. Now that the work has been departmentalised, the Ministers should do their own work directly.  There may be some excuse made for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. But take other Departments, particularly the Department of Fisheries. Fisheries are particularly important as they have close reference to the economic life of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke of the Gaeltacht and of the attitude of the Government towards the Gaeltacht.  Have I not the right to speak of a particular Department which has close relation to the Gaeltacht? One of the reasons why some of us here take a particular interest in that Department is because <Col N="66" /> its work naturally impinges upon the Gaeltacht.  If it is an efficient Department it will help the Gaeltacht.  If it is inefficient, as it is, it is damaging to the Gaeltacht.</P>

I am anxious to talk definitely to the point about things which can be definitely argued, but not about things which are vague or general. Let me now turn to the general financial conduct of the Ministry in their relations, for instance, with Great Britain.  We have the thing exemplified in the condition of the Teachers' Pension Fund, where they took over a fund which was bankrupt, and we have to make good the deficiency&mdash;either the State has to do it or else the individual teachers will have to do it.  That is typical of the way in which the present Ministry have conducted the business of the Government.</P>

      <P>The want of policy on the part of the Executive Council to conduct the financial business of the country properly when they are dealing with England and elsewhere. Surely, when we see the coinage question coming up this year and the deficiency in the Teachers' Pension Fund also coming up, we have a very good reason for bringing it up now and indicating why, in our opnion, the present Executive Council are not fit to continue in their present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government, as far as we can see, has been simply to run away on every occasion from the responsibilities which they undertook&mdash;the responsibilities which any body of men in the Executive Council should undertake.  We had the Minister for External Affairs some time ago challenging us to deal with the question of status.  I suppose that will also be regarded as not germane to this debate.  Surely, when we are voting the salary of the President of the Executive Council, who ought, in general, to have a directing influence on policy as a <Col N="68" /> whole, we ought to be allowed to comment upon the attitude which the Executive Council take in large public matters.  Take this question of status.  I should like to read what the Minister said.  It was a carefully-prepared statement which he read.</P>

      <P>It seems as if the Deputy was trying to lay down an absolutely new procedure altogether on this question of dealing with Estimates.  The question of External Affairs was dealt with under the appropriate Vote. The matter was put before the House and a decision come to, and, under the Standing Orders, it cannot be reopened. The Deputy's contention apparently is that the Votes should be discussed separately, as they are at present, and that then, on this particular Vote, there should be a rehash of all that was said on the other Votes.  That cannot be allowed.</P>

We will not come to anything like universal agreement as to what the &ldquo;certain limits&rdquo; are.  I admit there is a difficulty; that it is better for us to say straight off that we cannot deal with the policy of the Executive Council on this particular Vote.  I thought there was agreement that on this Vote the whole question of Executive <Col N="69" /> policy should come up for discussion. I have been dealing up to the present with the policy of the Government with respect to internal affairs.  I came on to the question of external affairs in the financial relations between this country and Great Britain.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary, at any rate, that we are not allowed to deal with it on this Vote for the President of the Executive Council, whose Department ought to be primarily responsible for dealing with external affairs.  Perhaps it will satisfy the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I say that there has not been a single noble national ideal put before the representatives of the people by the Government.  There has not been, as Pádraic Pearse said, a way of wisdom or a counsel of courage put up to us.  In every one of our main problems they have failed.  Their attitude towards former comrades has been simply that of brute force, as evidenced by the Juries Bill and Coercion Act.  Their attitude towards the foreigner has been one of surrender <Col N="70" /> all along the line.  The list of surrenders is getting longer day by day&mdash;is being added to day by day&mdash;and our contention is that an Executive whose record is of that type ought not to be voted the money asked for here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of this Party decided to put down the amendment which has been moved by Deputy O'Connell for the purpose of giving the President, who is head of the Executive Council, an opportunity of defending his policy in regard to the general question of unemployment. So far as we are aware, the only indication of the Government's policy up to the present has been expressed in a statement made in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 30th October, 1924.  I hope he will come in to correct, wherever he can, the official record of that particular statement, or qualify it if he cannot correct it.  On page 551 of the Official Report of the 30th October, 1924, the Minister is given as stating:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not any function of this Dáil to provide work, and the sooner that is realised the better. I do not refer to the point referred to by later speakers; that in critical moments, where there is an abnormally large unemployment problem, there should be immediate approach made to it by the Government.  That is actually taking place, and there will be some approach to it, but the Government or this Dáil should not be held responsible for the provision of work in the country.  It is not its business.</P>
      <P>Mr. Morrissey: Does the Minister say it is not the business of this Dáil to see that people do not die of hunger in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: That is a totally different thing.  The Government has, in so far as the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned, seen that hunger will be stopped.  I do not say it goes far enough.  They have started certain relief schemes to keep off hunger from other people in the country.  To state broadly and definitely that this <Col N="71" /> Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country is giving this Dáil functions which it has no right to take upon itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that, as far as we know up to the present, is the policy of the Government, and has not been qualified in any respect by the President or any other Minister in this House.  That policy is clearly seen and shown in the action of the Ministry in cutting down by a very large sum the Estimates that provide work and give relief to the unemployment problem from year to year.  I have been looking through the Estimate for this year, and comparing it with that Estimate which provides a State grant for housing, for drainage and for land improvement services.  I find that on the Board of Works Estimate, under the heading of &ldquo;New Works and Alterations,&rdquo; there is a decrease compared with last year of £208,110; for drainage maintenance there is a decrease of £1,000; for arterial drainage there is a decrease of £6,000, and for the Barrow Drainage there is a decrease of £55,000.  In the Land Improvements Schemes, which give considerable employment in the rural areas, as the President knows, there is a decrease of £161,550, and under the heading of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; Vote No. 62&mdash;there is a decrease in the labour charges in that particular Department of £128,565.</P>
    <P>Now, we hear a great deal in this House and outside about the saving of the one million in expenditure this year, as compared with last year, but out of that total saving of one million no less than £560,225 is saving at the expense of unemployed people in this country.  Added to that £560,225, there is a decrease in the Estimate under the head of Property Loss Compensation of £275,300, and under the condition under which the money was voted, employment to a certain extent has been given. Therefore, adding £560,225 and the £275,300, you find that the so-called saving has been at the expense of those who hitherto secured work as a result of the Votes passed by this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> I come to the other side of the balance-sheet.  In Vote 8&mdash;Local Loans Fund Grant-in-Aid&mdash;there is a large increase of £193,000 which, presumably, will give some employment and might be set aside for housing purposes in that way.  There is also under the head of Local Government&mdash;Vote 40&mdash;an increase of £59,915, which Vote is for the purpose of giving State grants at a considerably reduced figure to persons and local authorities for the purpose of building houses.  These are the only figures we have upon which we could give a considered judgment on the policy of the Government in the present financial year; in addition, we have it stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Government did not regard it as their duty to provide employment for the citizens of this State.  Their policy seems to me to be to shift the onus for unemployment from this House and the taxpayers on to those of the ratepayers. That is clearly proved from the policy of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, which, I presume, is approved by the President, and which, I hope, he will deal with when replying to the discussion on this Vote.  Compared with last year, I find there is an increase of 16 per cent. in the rates raised for road maintenance purposes, which shows that notwithstanding that there has been an increase in revenue to the Road Fund, there is a considerable additional sum to be borne by the ratepayers for the maintenance of the roads and in giving the employment which goes with ordinary normal road maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can add to my remarks or qualify them in any way he likes, but I am giving the figures he himself gave to the House in support of his own Estimate. I cannot understand why there should be an added liability to the ratepayers for road maintenance charges when we have a gradually <Col N="73" /> increased revenue coming into the Road Fund, but I quote it as an illustration of the policy of shifting the onus from the Ministry to the ordinary ratepayers.</P>
      <P>We have also this supposed indication, although I do not take it as such, of the policy of the Government on the housing question&mdash;a considerable decrease in the amount of the State grant hitherto given to persons and public authorities for the building of houses throughout the State.  Does the Minister really try to convince the House that that is a definite indication and prove that the Government are anxious to provide houses by way of State assistance so sadly and badly needed throughout the towns and the country districts of the State?</P>
      <P>On the general question of housing, I am very glad that Deputy O'Connell has put a very definite question to the President, and as this is his own Vote, I hope that the President will give us a straight answer to that question.  The President and the Minister, with the co-operation of other people who are interested in looking after the housing needs of the people, set up a particular committee to deal with the general problem of unemployment and that committee made certain recommendations.  Arising out of the proceedings of that committee, a conference was called both of employers and operatives in the building trade as affecting the City of Dublin.  As we all know, the President's outlook in regard to housing is confined entirely to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the President is senior representative of the City of Cork, I hope he will take an interest in the housing question in Cork as well as in Dublin.  That conference was called together under the auspices of the Ministry and, I believe, at the request of the President who, I think, knows more about the housing needs of the people in this country and the <Col N="74" /> finances of the housing problem than any other Deputy in this House.  I give him credit for that and I hope he will, when he comes to reply on this Vote, state whether he is satisfied that that conference has failed to bring in any recommendation that would enable him and the Ministry to proceed with a national housing scheme, which seems to be as far off as when it was promised three or four years ago during some particular bye-election or general election.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell was right in stating that the responsibility for dealing with the housing problem which calls for the immediate provision of at least 40,000 houses is not a responsibility which can be delegated by the President or the Ministry to any particular conference, whether employers or representatives of the building operatives.  If it has failed, let us hear from the President, whose Vote we are now discussing, the reason why it failed, and, what is far more important, let us have a statement of the Government policy arising out of the failure of that particular conference.  We talk a good deal about selective protection and of building a stone wall and a steel wall about the country, and of keeping out anything that could be made or manufactured in the country, but the President must be aware that there is coming into this country cement to the amount of £500,000.  My suggestion is, that if this problem is to be dealt with, it will have to be dealt with by using the raw material produced in the State and by having the brickyards that are idle opened, even if it adds an additional item to the cost of the housing scheme.</P>
      <P>If we are in favour of selective protection let us give the benefit of that policy to the people who own the brickyards. Let us open up the brickyards and give employment rather than continue to import cement to the value of £500,000 per annum.</P>

He has the returns that were supplied to all Deputies, and those returns will confirm the figure that I have quoted. It may not suit the President's particular purpose to turn up that very figure and say that it is correct.  I do not want to go into the question of the foreign policy of the Government, or the problem that is created by the deficiency in the Teachers' Superannuation Fund, or any of those other questions, because none of them, whether it has a bearing on the Estimate or not, has a direct bearing on the points we are raising under this amendment.  We all know that a good deal of employment has been given during the past few years by the Department, which provided large sums of money for buildings by the Board of Works and for drainage and land improvement schemes.  I want the President to submit any figures at his disposal which will go to show that the unemployment problem this year is less acute than last year.  The very fact that there has been a reduction of £560,225 in the Estimates which make provision for drainage, housing and building schemes generally, is proof that there must be a smaller number of men employed in that work than there were last year. <Col N="76" /> I will wait patiently and listen with the greatest attention to any figures the President may give when he is attempting to refute the statement contained in the Estimates which he asks the House to pass.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Connell informed us that the reason the Labour Party moved to refer the Estimate back for re-consideration was to enable the House to have an opportunity of discussing the policy of the Government in the matter of unemployment. The raising of the question of unemployment undoubtedly gave the Labour Party an opportunity of conducting a general assault on the Government; but from the two speeches which have been delivered from the Labour Benches, we cannot conclude that Deputies there have any very clear ideas on the subject.  Their conception of the manner in which the problem of unemployment appears to be dealt with would seem to be nebulous.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I disapprove of the way in which the case was presented.  The case is quite a good one, but it was not presented as it should be.  The whole trend of the case made by Deputies Davin and O'Connell was the giving of Government grants in one form or another. It must be quite obvious that we cannot find a permanent solution of the problem on the basis of Government grants.  We can tinker with the problem in that way, and we can give some temporary alleviation, but if the present unemployment evil is to disappear, it has to be tackled in some other manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not interpreting my statement as being entirely in favour of Government grants?  I made the point that a Government grant would be <Col N="77" /> necessary in the interval while a scheme was being prepared by the Government to provide a permanent solution.  My point was that a Government grant would be essential until such time as a permanent scheme would fructify.  Temporary schemes would, of course, have to be met by relief votes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in any scheme for the ending of unemployment which may be devised there will be a period during which temporary distress will have to be met and temporary expedients will be essential.  My criticism of the Labour Party is based on the ground that they have failed to face the fact that the main difficulty in ending the unemployment problem is the attitude of the Government.  They do not appear to have grasped clearly what the attitude of the Government is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to explain. The attitude of the Government is that the degree of unemployment which exists is normal.  They do not think that any special circumstances exist that would call for special attention or special measures.  They appear to hold that a large volume of unemployment, such as there is at the moment, is a necessary phenomenon and, therefore, they can proceed by the ordinary recognised methods adopted in other countries where there are no abnormal conditions.  The problem can only be considered in relation to its size.  For three years the Government has succeeded in suppressing the information ascertained by the census of production in 1926 as to the size of unemployment.  We could argue for hours as to the number of unemployed in the country.  A certain number there is.  It may be much larger than I think, and it may be much smaller, but on no occasion since we came into this House have we or the Labour Party, or anybody else, succeeded in nailing down any Minister to the definite statement that a particular number of unemployed exist in the country.  Let us <Col N="78" /> take a number that will not be so large as to call for the immediate contradiction of any Minister.  Let us say there are 50,000.  There are approximately 30,000 unemployed in insurable occupations&mdash;25,000 or 30,000.  The number of occupied persons in insurable occupations probably does not exceed 30 per cent. of the whole.  We know, in addition, that the particular period of depression through which we have passed has affected those engaged in uninsurable occupations just as severely as, if not more severely, than those engaged in insurable occupations.  We know fairly accurately that there are some 25,000 persons unemployed in insurable occupations.  The total number of persons in these not being 30 per cent. of the whole, we can safely assume there are 50,000 unemployed. That is a figure on which we can work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the economic situation that exists in order to see what are the possibilities of absorbing into normal employment 50,000 persons within a specified period. In the discussion upon the Estimate of the Department of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, certain figures were given by the Minister which will be of value to us in this connection.  He pointed out that the total net value of the agricultural produce of the country during the year 1926, as ascertained in the census of production, was £53,500,000, and the total net value of the new transportable goods manufactured in this country was £20,000,000.  He estimated that the net value of commodities produced by each person employed in agriculture in that year was £80, and the net value of the goods produced by each person in the manufacturing industry was £266.  I have examined these figures myself and I got somewhat different results from those of the Minister, but it is not unlikely that we worked on a different basis, and I am quite prepared to accept his figures.  It is quite obvious from the figures that if the existing unemployment, taken at 50,000 people, could be absorbed into agriculture the production of <Col N="79" /> wealth could be increased by £4,000,000 in the year, and if they were absorbed into industry the increase would be £13,300,000.  The increase was in the one case of 7.4 per cent., and in the other case of 66.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A calculation based on these figures would seem to indicate that if we worked from the opposite direction and concentrated upon increasing agricultural production by 7.4 per cent. and industrial production by 66.5 per cent., then we would have entirely ended the unemployment evil.  Judging from these figures, one would naturally concentrate upon agriculture as offering the greater prospects and ensuring quick results.  However, in that matter we have to take certain other things into our calculation as well. The low value of the wealth produced per year per head by persons engaged in agriculture indicates that many of those engaged in that industry are, as Deputy O'Connell described them, under-employed.  Of course under-employment is just as serious a problem for the nation as unemployment.  We could check that fact by reference to the figures published by the Ministry for Industry and Commerce in relation to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>We have in this country 51 permanent agriculture workers for every thousand acres under crops and pasture.  There are 31 in Denmark. We plough here 225 acres for every hundred permanent workers.  They plough 1,007 acres for every one hundred permanent workers in Denmark. We have here per one hundred workers 165 milch cows as against 308 in Denmark.  We have here 143 pigs as against 644 in Denmark. We have here 2,378 poultry as against 3,362 in Denmark.  It is only in cattle other than milch cows and sheep that we exceed Denmark, and it is in the production of these animals that the least amount of labour is required.  It is quite obvious from these figures that the agricultural production in the Free State could be increased by several <Col N="80" /> hundred per cent. before those engaged in that industry here would be employed to the same extent as those in that industry in Denmark are at present.  We could increase agricultural production by several hundred per cent. before we would have absorbed into that industry one single person mentioned as at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>If therefore we are going to find a solution of the unemployment problem we will find it in the stimulation of some other form of production than agricultural production.  I am not arguing against concentration upon increasing agricultural production, because under-employment is just as serious in agricultural production as in industry.  Anything that the Minister for Agriculture, the greatest Minister for Agriculture in the world, can do to increase production of wealth in the agricultural industry will be supported by us if for no other reason than that it will result in increasing the standard of living for those at present engaged in that industry.  We must, however, concentrate on industry if the 50,000 people who are without work at present are to be given work.  The task will, I think, be found not as difficult as it would appear at first sight.</P>
    <P>The figure of £266 per head given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce relates only to those engaged in the manufacturing of transportable goods and it does not include those engaged in such industries as house building, road making, electrical concerns, gas works and similar undertakings.  If means were found to employ the greatest possible number in the construction and repair of what I think could fairly be described as the Nation's fixed assets, the number left to be absorbed into productive industry would be very greatly reduced.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the matter of house building, and undoubtedly the construction of the houses which are at present urgently needed by our people, could be made a most hopeful avenue for the relief of the unemployment that is existing.  We are aware that in embarking upon any <Col N="81" /> scheme for the immediate provision of the 40,000 houses required, certain dangers and difficulties will be met with but none of them will be incapable of being surmounted.  We had the matter of the Local Loans Fund discussed here.  During the recent by-election in Sligo the Minister for Local Government made a statement before the poll that the Local Loans Fund was to be opened to local authorities for housing purposes. I wonder how many local authorities have succeeded in getting loans from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of building houses, or was that merely an election promise made to be broken as soon as it had served its puropse?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the question this way&mdash;will the President inform us the number of local authorities whose schemes have been approved but who have not yet succeeded in getting funds from the Board of Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case even the provision of money from the Local Loans Fund to the local authorities is not going to solve the housing problem, but it goes a considerable step, because the provision of cheap finance is one of the main difficulties. If houses are to be constructed to meet the present requirements and to cope with unemployment it should be done as a national scheme.  It cannot <Col N="82" /> be left entirely to the local authorities to do it.  That national scheme would involve the production within this country of as much as possible of the building materials required and which are capable of being economically produced here.  I am not arguing in favour of the production of materials which cannot be economically produced under present conditions.  Because if they could only be bought here at uneconomic prices then we should leave that aside until a more normal situation had arisen.  But I submit that it is in periods like the present that the Government should embark upon capital work, building up the credit of the nation and making the necessary funds available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not merely in the matter of housing but in a number of other matters a great deal of constructive work waiting to be done in this country, and that work, while not immediately reproductive, would, if done, increase the wealth and the wealth-producing capacity of the country to a very considerable extent.  This Government has followed what has been described as a very conservative policy in the matter of finance.  I think that the conservative policy of the Government in the matter of finance is as much responsible as anything else for the degree of unemployment which now exists, and for the volume of emigration which statistics disclose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, they occupy a strong position in the international markets.  They can point with pride to the position which they occupy upon the American Exchange, but these advantages are very small when weighed in the balance against 50,000 people and their dependents in dire need and 500 of the best of our citizens emigrating every week. I do not know whether the President will maintain that the credit of the State is not sufficiently strong to allow more extended borrowing. It is, I submit, in a period such as the present that borrowing should <Col N="83" /> be embarked on to finance constructive schemes and to enable the abnormal problem of unemployment to be dealt with.  If those who are at present without work can be given employment at a normal wage the whole industry of the country will be stimulated.  You cannot spend £1,000 in building a bridge and merely find yourself in the end when the bridge has been built with the completed bridge and a debt for £1,000.  That sum of £1,000 has been introduced and is in circulation in the country, and every form of commercial and industrial life receives the benefit of its expenditure.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the prospects of getting constructive work going and what the nature of such work would be.  There are very few towns in Ireland of any size which are provided with decent sewerage schemes or proper water supplies.  The absence of such conveniences has in many cases had serious effects on public health.  A very considerable amount of public good could be done, as well as a very considerable amount of unemployment relieved, if means were found available to make it possible for these towns to equip themselves with proper public facilities.  It is useless to say, as the Minister will no doubt say, that the Local Loans Fund is available for that purpose.  The provision of loans to local authorities will not meet the difficulty.  The question of the burden on the rates, the question of the difficulty which is generally experienced in regard to the area of charge, will still remain.  If we want such work to be undertaken now by local authorities it is not loans but grants that will have to be made available.  It is, I submit, only a matter of book-keeping whether the money is borrowed by the local or the national authority for national work.  The undertaking of schemes for the relief of unemployment is at present national work, and whether the loan has to be repaid by the taxpayer or by the ratepayer is a minor matter.  The one factor that really counts is the fact that if you can absorb 50,000 people <Col N="84" /> into work, the capacity of the taxpayer to pay will be increased and it will not be necessary to impose new taxes because the yield of existing taxation will raise more than sufficient to repay the interest and sinking fund charges on the money borrowed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other works.  There is, for instance, the matter of land reclamation.  I do not know if any survey has been carried out as to the possibility of undertaking big reclamation schemes in respect of tidal lands.  I think it will be found that there are many thousands of acres capable of being reclaimed from the sea at an expenditure which would be small in comparison with the wealth to be created by such schemes.  If the Government have carried out such survey I would be glad to hear it, but I do not think they have.  Such survey would repay itself.  Then there is the matter of erecting adequate defences against coast erosion, and also the matter of speeding up affairs in regard to afforestation.  On the Forestry Vote the Minister for Lands and Agriculture informed us that there are 200,000 acres capable of being planted, and that it was the policy of his Department to have them planted in forty years.  I submit that it is during an abnormal period like the present, when you have an abnormal number of unemployed, that such work should be undertaken, and not when the country is prosperous, and when workers have little difficulty in finding work from private employers.  It would, in my opinion, be better to double or treble the work of afforestation now and to stop it in better times than to carry out the mechanical programme of the Minister, which does not take into account the economic conditions of the country.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of reconstructing dangerous bridges which are unsuitable to modern traffic. There are a large number of such bridges, even on trunk roads.  It would be a useful way of providing work for the unemployed if the reconstruction of these bridges were <Col N="85" /> undertaken.  There is, in addition, the matter of the construction of decent schoolhouses.  In many parts of the country the schoolhouses are a blot on our civilisation, and are altogether unsuitable for the housing of young children.  A considerable amount of capital expenditure could be undertaken in that direction at present if the right policy animated the country.  There is plenty of work to be done, and it is sufficient to absorb all those who are without work at present, if only some means were found to enable it to be undertaken, and if money were available. In connection with all the matters I have mentioned, there is one outstanding fact which should be noticed, namely, that they are not dependent for completion on supplies of foreign materials.  The materials can be supplied within the country, and consequently there need be no export of wealth if we embark on such schemes.  As I have already said, if we embarked on such schemes we would give trade and industry the necessary fillip to get them out of their post-war depression. The whole industrial body would be rejuvenated and the workers who would find temporary employment on these schemes would be gradually absorbed into permanent and normal employment in private enterprise.  It would not, of course, be possible, nor would it be necessary, to absorb all of them into works of that nature, as the balance of them can and should be absorbed into industry.  I am not going to deal with the question of tariffs, as the Chair objects, except in a general way, and in so far as it bears on the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>Here is a quotation from the &ldquo;Motor Trader,&rdquo; dated June 19th, 1929: I am not advocating tariffs, but I am reading this for the information of the House.  It is entitled &ldquo;Britain's Best Market,&rdquo; and it goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Australia is maintaining its position as the principal buyer of British car chassis, having taken 4,270 valued at £491,135 of the 7,020 chassis which were exported from this country during the first five months of this year.  During the same period she took 218 complete vehicles worth £65,328.  The principal customer for complete cars is the Irish Free State which, by taking 2,705 vehicles valued at £435,553 in five months more than double her purchases during the same period of last year when 1,261 cars worth £228,013 were bought.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President will take these figures and make a simple calculation he will realise that we have paid something like 60 per cent. of £435,000 for goods that could be produced in this country and in respect of which we have established factories which are as good as any in the world, and we have workmen who were recognised all over the world as the most skilled in the trade.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the matter of unemployment, and I shall confine myself to the statement that 12,000 additional persons have received employment in tariffed industries since 1925.  That fact, as I have said in a previous debate, constitutes <Col N="87" /> a sign-post which points out, or should point out, to the Government, the direction in which they must move if unemployment is to be diminished in this country.  I believe we can find work for at least another 25,000 hands in existing industries in this country if the necessary steps are taken to protect them.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that 50 per cent. of the goods coming into this country were at present subject to tariffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to develop this argument.  From figures made available by the Minister of Industry and Commerce, he calculated that if we could increase the production of goods apart from agricultural goods in this country, by £13,300,000, we would wipe out unemployment.  If the production per head remains as at present we will have to increase industrial production by that amount in order to absorb 50,000 unemployed. We are at present importing £25,000,000 worth of goods which are not tariffed and £14,300,000 worth of tariffed goods, which are not excluded by the tariffs now in operation. I submit that either if the tariffs now in operation were increased so as to exclude goods to which they relate or if the non-taxed but taxable goods were submitted to the same process as the taxed goods, we would have in a short period completely wiped out unemployment in this country.  That is what all parties profess to desire, but the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as represented on the Executive Council, which is the only Party who can give effect to their desires are deliberately ignoring the only possible avenues for reaching that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other expedients that <Col N="88" /> can be employed in order to deal with the matter of unemployment.  I am not suggesting them here.  No doubt Ministers are taking a very keen note of the proposal advocated by the Labour Government in Britain who are giving very serious consideration to this matter of unemployment, although their problem in relation to their total population is less serious than ours.  We have a higher percentage of our population unemployed in relation to the number of occupied persons than they have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of it. You have succeeded in suppressing the figures made available by the Census of 1926 in this matter of the total unemployed.  We made a certain calculation based on the number employed in insurable occupations which we know, and related that to the number of occupied persons and we got 50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy added 50 per cent. to that we would still be under the English figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The last figure was 9.9 per cent.  In Britain, for example, they have suggested that the Old Age Pension should be given at 65.  That is done already in the case of certain classes of persons.  They have also suggested increasing the school-leaving age and increasing the facilities given to widows and mothers.  All that is to be done in order to keep them out of the employment market.  By these three expedients alone, they hope to decrease the number of unemployed in England by 600,000 persons.  That is a very substantial decrease, because if boys have to remain at school and if old men get pensions, vacancies will be created of which the middle-aged and other unemployed can avail.  I am not suggesting that these expedients should be adopted here, because the cost would be probably prohibitive, nor do I think it is necessary.  If we can do so, well and good.  Quite a number <Col N="89" /> of such simple expedients exist which can be utilised in order to decrease the volume of unemployment.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Government, like a great many people in this country, suffer from an inferiority complex in this matter.  There are a number of people, for example, who seem to think that Irish goods cannot possibly be as good as British goods although, as the facts prove, they are in many cases&mdash;in nearly all cases&mdash;better.  The Government do not see this country supplying its own goods at any time.  They lack vision in this matter.  They do not seem to contemplate the possibility of its being at any time a self-sufficing and a self-supporting country.  We, on the other hand, see Ireland not merely a self-supporting country but with a possibility of developing an export trade in certain goods.  There is no country in the world, as far as I can see, doing an export trade at present with advantages that so greatly surpass ours as to make it idle to hope that we will ever have such a trade.  We have, or will have, we are assured, in the very near future, available a supply of cheap power.  We have raw materials in adequate quantity, and they at present constitute the bulk of our exports. We have workers who are as good as any in the world.  I think all foreign capitalists who have come in here to start industries have testified to the good qualities of the workers available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of practically every application that came before the Tariff Commission the same testimonial was given to those engaged in industry here.  We have a large amount of surplus capital available for investment which at present is invested abroad because of the unsatisfactory conditions and the lack of suitable opportunities here.  The only thing we require is to have the co-ordinating influence of the Government brought into play so that all these various factors will be brought into line and welded together in support of a general forward movement to develop our industries. <Col N="90" /> The Government have treated this whole matter in such an indifferent and casual manner that we can only conclude that they have no desire to foster industry in this country or that they are utterly incapable of undertaking the task. The latter is the true explanation, I believe.  I hope that Deputies will support Deputy O'Connell's amendment to refer the Vote back for reconsideration, such action being, as the President said, a vote of no confidence in the Executive Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be too much to expect even in a debate of this kind, that we should escape the lecture with which Deputy Lemass commenced his statement here.  We have been accustomed to lectures of this kind, and considering the line he has taken previously I suppose we may be thankful for the mildness of his statement this evening.  I remember, before we had the advantage of having Deputy Lemass here to lecture us, reading a speech made by him in which he described the members of this Party as political mendicants. That was at a time when members of this Party, at least, were asking questions that now appear every day on the Order Paper from members of his Party in connection with roads, improvement works, and with the general line that should be taken in the matter of having better services extended to the people of the country generally.  I am not going to refer at all to the fact that the mendicancy of that Party in another direction was going on outside this country, and is still going on.  However, that, I suppose, is a side issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there should be any difficulty or doubt as to the policy of this Department in connection with unemployment, although I think it has been made sufficiently clear already, it is, perhaps, no harm to state again for the information of people who complain about the vagueness of the Labour policy in the matter of unemployment, that we have complained over and over again and felt that the responsibility for dealing with unemployment should <Col N="91" /> rest with the Government.  We have pressed, time and again, for the solution of this question on national lines.  We have made the claim repeatedly, which has been running through Deputy Lemass's speech this evening, that until that question is dealt with the interval should be occupied with producing the temporary methods to tide people over the situation that they would be confronted with in that interval.  We have reaffirmed repeatedly that it is the duty of the Government to take up that position.</P>
    <P>Dealing with a matter dealt with this evening, the question of housing, not many months ago the operatives engaged in the housing industry presented a concrete housing policy whereby for a certain number of years they would be prepared to deliver the goods.  In the face of all that, a debate of this kind is made the lever for charges that have been lightly, and with very little foundation, made time and again.  It was doubly strange, coming after the statement of the official leader of the Opposition.  That, in my opinion, was the most vague and disjointed series of generalities I have ever listened to in this House.  I want to congratulate Deputy Davin on bringing back this debate to something like reality by pointing out where the failure has come in, and where we can point, on the present Estimates, to the very things that have been done, not to help the question of unemployment but to make it worse in this country.</P>
    <P>On the Land Improvement Vote, a tremendous reduction was made in the sum available for improvement works.  In the Office of Public Works a tremendous reduction was made in the moneys available for work in the country.  We complain with very great reason, that instead of any contribution towards improving the situation, in the financial provisions that have been made, the situation has been considerably aggravated.  I would echo what has been said in this debate, that the real failure of the Government in this <Col N="92" /> matter is their failure to make unemployment a dominant issue in the country.  The people in England who are entrusted with the responsibility of Government have declared that they intend to make this a dominant question, and that as this question is dealt with other matters of smaller importance will right themselves in the ordinary way.  We want to urge that even now, after continuous neglect, an attempt should be made to give this question the place it is entitled to in the consideration national problems should get in this House from the Government responsible.</P>
    <P>I want to urge that the whole policy in connection with improvement work and marine works should be reviewed.  Even at the risk of being accused of continuously looking for doles here, we ought to point out the practical needs of large sections of the community and urge that a connected and national policy should be evolved, taking into account the whole question nationally and the many factors locally applicable to this question.</P>
    <P>I saw within the last few days a paragraph in an English newspaper referring to prosperity in Cork.  I am not enabled to speak on behalf of the citizens of Cork City but I did notice a paragraph referring to alleged prosperity amongst farm labourers in Cork County.  If it does exist, it exists in some portion of Cork County I never heard of.  In the rural areas of Cork County which I know anything about, there is no such thing as prosperity but there is acute poverty in the homes of the rural labourers and we, who have something to do with local authorities in that part of the country, are faced month after month with the task of trying to decide cases where able bodied men with families who, I am perfectly satisfied, are willing to work, come before the Boards making applications for assistance.  I want to ask the Government again the question asked by Deputy O'Connell this evening as to what their attitude on the question of unemployment measures is&mdash;for instance, the question of home assistance.  Is it suggested <Col N="93" /> that it is really reproductive or economic to pay home assistance to unfortunate people with no means of employment?  The Local Authorities are bound to make provision under the Local Government Act of 1925 for destitute people but is that the remedy or the proper way of dealing with it?  It has been pointed out, time and again, that there is danger in embarking on uneconomic schemes.  Could anything be more uneconomic than paying relief to people and compelling them to live in a state of semi-starvation with the few shillings they get from a local authority and denying them the right to live as decent citizens by giving them work that would enable them to do something for their homes and their children.  That seems to be the issue.  We have no doubts whatever as to how it should be solved or how we would attempt to solve it if we had the responsibility entrusted to us.  We have complete decay not alone in the rural areas, but in a good many of the towns in the constituency I come from.  I regret that year after year, during the four or five years some of us have been here, we should have to argue this question and point out complete failure to do anything in connection with it.  There is no substantial employment that I know of in any of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I was discussing a matter with a constituent of mine within the last week.  He pointed out a tract of country extending over several miles and said that in that large tract of country not one farmer employed a labourer.  Either they were too poor to employ a labourer or they were able to do the work with the labour of their own families.  I do not know whether the paragraphs that have appeared in English newspapers are inspired or not, but I do know that they do not represent the facts.  People who believe that things are prosperous in the rural areas are simply living in a fools' paradise.</P>
    <P>I want to urge again that something should be done in connection with the different matters mentioned here in connection with housing, and <Col N="94" /> greater facilities to local authorities to embark on schemes benefiting the public health and relieving unemployment. All that work should be encouraged, financed and developed, and we should have from the Executive Council a statement showing that they are willing to reconsider the whole position in regard to the moneys which they refused to make available this year in the Estimates for improvement works, and that as an alternative an estimate to deal with this particular matter should be introduced into this House.  The example has been set in another country of appointing a Minister specially to deal with this problem. Perhaps we are not able to do that, but we might do something in showing that we consider this matter seriously and in showing that we realise the responsibility that is and ought to be cast on the Government of dealing with it, not in a tinkering fashion but on a national basis, and on lines that are the only sound lines on which it can be tackled if there is a real desire to settle it.</P>

      <P>This debate has taken the turn of dealing with a subject which is perhaps the most serious subject that could have arisen in this house.  Naturally it arises on the Vote for the President, because he has responsibility for the policy, not merely of this year but of last year and of the whole period during which emigration has been so great and unemployment has been a continuing evil.  The quarrel which we have with him in this matter is based on his failure to strike out a national line, a line which would break away from conditions in England which are affecting Ireland.  He has been appealed to from time to time to find a common policy which would be a national policy.  If he found a really national policy in economics to-morrow he would find people throughout the whole country to back him up.  If he could cast aside his mere party timidities and look at the thing from a purely Irish point of view, and apply the principles of Wolfe Tone in the region of economies, the principle of complete <Col N="95" /> separation economically, he would not find many critics from this side of the House.  The atmosphere for which he is responsible in this country is an atmosphere of cynical reaction.  I ask him to compare it with the atmosphere which was in the country between the years 1918 and 1920 when we had succeeded in joining the ideals of James Connolly with those preached by Arthur Griffith, the ideals of a democratic advance with the ideals of Sinn Féin.  If we had got the Republic in the year 1919 we would have gone ahead with a set of principles of a progressive kind second to none in Europe.</P>

      <P>There came a time in England when the full flow of employment was changed into a condition of unemployment.  That followed upon the Cunliffe Report. Subsequent to that, men like J. M. Keynes and Reginald McKenna carried on a strong controversy against Churchill and others because of the effects which the change in the credit system in England was <Col N="96" /> producing, as a result of what Mr. Keynes called the economic consequences of Mr. Churchill; that is to say, the Government policy and the Bank of England's policy, which restricted credit and raised the rate of interest.  That was the beginning of the economic slump and of unemployment, and that affected this country just as much as it affected England.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because usually his interruptions are intelligent.  I submit that that is not.  I suppose he appreciates that the subject I am dealing with is difficult and that any interruption is sufficient to interrupt a line of thought.  The effect of the policy upon Ireland has been such that it could not possibly have escaped the mind of the President.  He must have realised and known, as we all knew, that certain things were being done to produce certain effects.  He has had ample time to see that the same causes in this country would not be allowed to exist, so as to produce the same effect.  In the meantime we have lost between 300,000 and 400,000 young men and women who have gone out of the country. The evil still continues, and we acquiesce in a policy which is producing the same effect as the causes of the famine produced.  There you had a British economic policy which glorified the rights of the individual and subjected the rights of the community to them.  At present, the attitude is that the interests of the big financiers in London must dominate and that the interests of the producers and ordinary people must be sacrificed.  And so the interests of the Irish people are being sacrificed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that the President should set out upon a very radical policy suddenly.  We have never suggested that.  What has been suggested is that at least we should go as far as men who are sufficiently <Col N="97" /> conservative-minded&mdash;such men as Reginald McKenna&mdash;have suggested, namely, that we should have a fundamental inquiry with a view to seeing what can be done in the matter of credit, as the root cause of unemployment. The President might even inquire as to what credit is, whether it is a mere plaything for the bankers, for the group of men who can ring the changes on the people's poverty generally, who can ring the changes on the rates of exchange, and so on, without there being any fundamental reality in the background.</P>
    <P>He could find out whether there is anything in the theory that credit depends ultimately upon the prosperity of the whole people, that it is the people themselves who supply the fundamentals of credit, and that financial credit is only a connecting link, a ticket system, something which can be created by a little book-keeping.  He could look back to see what had been done in the Great War when enormous loans were floated and the bankers were instructed by the Government to give individuals large overdrafts so that they could take up those loans. Where did that credit come from? So far as the finance end of it is concerned, it was simply created by a book-keeping transaction.  These are fundamental to us as much as they are to Great Britain, and so long as we allow our thinking to be done across the water we are not going to get any further.  We must try and inquire in relation to Irish conditions what are the effects of certain fundamental principles.  At present any little prosperity that comes to this country is largely due to gambling on foreign exchanges. So far as producing in this country is concerned, the farmer cannot make it pay, the ordinary small business man can hardly make his business pay.  With the exception of a few industries which have been protected, there is very little that is paying in this country.  Any money made is made by the rotten system by which men spend their brains thinking what is going to rise or <Col N="98" /> fall on the foreign stock exchanges. I think it is almost more degrading than betting on horses.</P>

      <P>If the President were to carry out the policy of making a real inquiry into credit he would discover on his way that there is an enormous amount of Irish money invested outside this country which should be invested in the country. He would be looking for ways and means not merely of increasing the prosperity of the country, but of removing the real source of demoralisation and degradation, which is this gambling on foreign exchanges. We have had one example in the House, where we have been able to get a common policy on the question of the Irish language.  There is no reason why the President should not have said to himself or to his Executive Council: &ldquo;We will find a national economic policy, and if we put up a strong national economic policy we may be sure that we will not be opposed by the other side.&rdquo; We on this side are only too willing and anxious to see the country saved.  It is not a question of moving the country up from one stage of prosperity to another stage.  It is a question of saving the life of the nation.  It is a question of saving it from the rot of emigration.  We must set out upon a policy which will create industries in this country.  Another fact which is staring us in the face is that we are too dependent upon English markets, and when there is a slump in England we suffer.  Unless we are prepared to face that fact, by the development of Irish industries, we are not going to do anything real to change the situation. Our quarrel with the Labour Party is that they will not take as fundamental a view on this matter as we do&mdash;that they will not take as <Col N="99" /> radical a view as men like James Connolly.</P>

      <P>I do not like the introduction of the name of James Connolly.  There is nothing in this Vote that goes back to James Connolly.  The real point we have to discuss is, what administrative measures the President could take now that would give some relief to unemployment.  I think that was Deputy O'Connell's line in his speech on the amendment.  That was the purpose in putting down the amendment. It is manifest that on a Vote which occurs every year for the expenses of the Department of the President of the Executive Council we could not have a discussion, for example, on the credit system, or any of these fundamental questions.  We are really dealing with whether the President, in his administration, could do something immediately, as distinct from fundamental or legislative changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the motion that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration I must express surprise that up to the present no Deputy has yet spoken from the Government Benches on this question of unemployment.  It is a big and vital problem which should be tackled by all parties, and which should not be left to the Labour Party or to the Fianna Fáil Party. On vital political principles let Deputies remain as uncompromising as they like, but when a question comes up affecting unemployment, Deputies <Col N="100" /> of all parties should throw off their coats in order to endeavour to solve it.  The Government have not approached this problem in the way that they should.  Instead of attacking the problem of unemployment, they have really attacked the people who are suffering by being unemployed. In order to prove that statement, I would point to the fact that this is the first year since the Government took office that they have not introduced any estimate for relief schemes. I am reminded that there was one other year in which they did not introduce such an estimate&mdash;this is the second year&mdash;but in that year a certain amount of money was voted for the purpose of building which helped, at any rate, in a small way to absorb some of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those persons who do not believe that relief schemes are going to solve the unemployment problem, but I do believe that half a loaf is better than no bread. Naturally one would infer from the fact that the unemployment insurance Estimate is reduced in comparison with what it was two or three years ago, and taking also into consideration the fact that no money is being voted for relief schemes this year one would come to the conclusion that unemployment was not so acute this year as in previous years. But it is no use for Ministers to try to bury their heads ostrich-like in the sands by saying that unemployment does not exist.  It exists not only in Dublin and Cork and Limerick but right through the twenty-six counties and especially in Co. Donegal.  The Government have not been paying enough attention to the problem.  They have paid attention to matters that do not matter so much, but they have neglected their paramount duty in regard to this problem which is of vital importance to the people of the country.  I believe that the principal duty of the Government is to look after the interests and welfare of the people. I believe that any Government that allows thousands upon thousands of men to be unemployed and to be in a state of hunger, and to have their wives and families hungry, is failing <Col N="101" /> in its primary duty towards the people.</P>
    <P>No doubt the President in his reply will refer to the fact that in recent years certain additional industries have been established, but I would point out that all those industries established, with the exception of the sugar beet and starch and the Shannon scheme, have been centralised in Dublin, and that the rural portions of the country are neglected to a great extent.  In confirmation of that statement I would point out that, as far as the County Donegal is concerned, there is not as much attention being paid now to the problem of unemployment as there was under the Congested Districts Board.  As far as the old Congested Districts Board was concerned, they did a lot to help rural industries, whereas the present Government, unfortunately, has done practically nothing to develop rural industries.  Some time ago I raised this question, and I referred to the fact that over two years ago the Government made a promise that they would endeavour to develop the hand-spun industry in Donegal.  Two years have elapsed since that time and still not one man or woman has been employed at the hand-spun industry.  As far as the old Congested Districts Board was concerned, it gave facilities to fishermen which helped them to provide a livelihood for themselves and their families, but as far as the present Government are concerned, they have absolutely neglected not only to help the fishermen in Tirconnell, but also right along the whole coast.  I believe if they did help, as they should do, a lot of employment would be found for people unemployed at the present time amongst the full-time fishermen and amongst the part-time fishermen.</P>
    <P>It is true that for the past few years emigration from this country has been great.  In that respect I would like to quote some figures. The numbers of natives of Ireland living abroad is out of all reasonable proportion to the emigration from other civilised and progressive <Col N="102" /> countries.  The percentages published by the Department of Commerce are: Ireland, 30.5 per cent. of her native population; Norway. 14.8; Scotland, 14.1; England and Wales, 6.3, down to France with .5. There are practically 26,000 people emigrating from this country every year.  These people do not emigrate to America or other countries in any spirit of adventure or to go and see their friends in far-off lands.  They emigrate because of the fact that they are not able to eke out an existence in the land of their birth.</P>
    <P>Let us take as a modest estimate that it costs £300 to rear a boy or girl up to the age of twenty-one or twenty-two years.  Seeing that 26,000 people emigrate out of this country annually, we export each year in human wealth £7,800,000.  Let us see, for instance, if we exported cattle to America or Australia or any other country to the value of over seven million pounds and got no payment for that, what an outcry there would be amongst the financiers, and I suppose in the dovecotes of the Executive Council.  I suppose efforts would be made to see that that outflow of wealth was stopped, but in this case this human wealth is emigrating owing to the fact that people cannot get an existence at home.  While all that is going on, I believe sufficient attention is not paid to the problem of unemployment.  To my mind, unfortunately, the Executive Council view this question of unemployment as a necessary evil which always must exist.  I do not believe that is so.  I do not believe it is a problem that would exist if properly tackled. I believe it is a problem that the Government should give every attention in their power to in order to cure it.</P>

      <P>An aspect of the unemployment problem that probably has not been dealt with up to the present is the fact that unemployment breaks down the health of the unemployed people.  In that connection I would point out that in the Estimates each year the Government vote a certain amount of money for <Col N="103" /> public health services.  I should like to quote an extract from a report made at a recent meeting of the Donegal Board of Health by Dr. Anthony Doherty, Acting Tuberculosis Officer for County Donegal.  I may be drifting a little from the strict lines of the Vote but I just want to prove the effect that unemployment has upon the health of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say that Dr. Anthony Doherty in the course of his report dealing with tuberculosis pointed out that while occurring amongst the wealthiest classes due to the inevitable hereditary influences, the vast majority of the cases of tuberculosis were from the poorer portions of the population who never would contract the disease if they were provided with proper food, clothing and housing conditions.  He said further that owing to poverty the staple diet amongst many of the people were potatoes and that meat was a very rare visitor and consequently the resistance of the poor people to the disease was thereby decreased.  Now this is a problem worth considering and I think it is a part of the question probably that enough attention has not been devoted to.  No doubt Deputies will realise that when a worker becomes unemployed and if he has been in an insurable occupation after six months he is cut off from Insurance Benefit, he has no way of providing food for himself or shelter for his wife and children and I submit that the health of that man and his children are affected by such circumstances.  No doubt the President in his reply will taunt Deputies who have spoken with not suggesting any remedy for this evil.  One of the ways in which a large number of the unemployed could be absorbed is by the Local Government Department offering long term loans to local authorities for the purpose of erecting houses. We have been promised for quite a considerable time that legislation will be introduced along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been promised for a considerable time that local authorities would be enabled to get these long term loans, but unfortunately up to the present time they have not received them.  We have also been promised that there would be a national housing scheme and we are still awaiting that.  In Dublin, Cork and Limerick there are thousands of families occupying single rooms in tenements and there are thousands of people unemployed. There is a necessity for thousands of houses, and the erection of them would help to absorb the unemployed. The housing scarcity is not confined to the cities and towns.  In the rural areas in Co. Donegal there are large numbers of labourers' cottages required.  If long term loans, together with subsidies, were given these cottages could be built, and it would help to give employment in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, we find that the Government have not dealt with the question of housing there although legislation has been promised.  If houses had been built in the Gaeltacht area, and they are very necessary, it would have helped to absorb some of the unemployed. Another way in which to absorb large numbers of unemployed in the rural areas is by the division of land.  We have been told that under the 1923 Act it will take 60 years to complete land purchase.  I suggest to the Government that if they would speed up this matter it would help to absorb at least some of the unemployed.  A lot of useful work could be done by paying more attention to the question of afforestation. We have been told on numerous occasions that as far as the Government are concerned they are anxious to improve the position in the Gaeltacht. We were told they were anxious to keep the Irish speakers at home.  They have spent thousands and thousands upon afforestation in the Midlands and the South of Ireland, but we find that as far as the <Col N="105" /> Gaeltacht area in Tirconaill is concerned not one halfpenny has been spent, not one tree has been planted, and not one acre has been acquired for afforestation.  The Minister for Local Government, as Chairman of the Gaeltacht Commission, will recollect that certain recommendations were made.  If those had been carried out I believe there would not be the same necessity, probably there would be no necessity, for referring to the question of unemployment as affecting the Gaeltacht.  In recommendation 55 the Commission suggests that a system of loans or grants be introduced for the improvement of housing.  That has not been done.  It was recommended also that a comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage should be proceeded with in the Gaeltacht.  That has been done to a very small extent, but there has been no comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage introduced at any rate in Tirconaill.</P>

      <P>The report also mentions that loans should be made available for the purpose of setting up carding and spinning mills.  That has not been done.  I submit that the Minister for Local Government should impress on the Government the necessity for putting into operation the findings of the Commission. If they did so, it would help to absorb the unemployed to a very large extent as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  Deputy Murphy referred to the steps proposed by the Government in Britain in order to cure the very important problem of unemployment.  I believe that the Executive Council are not paying enough attention to that problem here, and I believe also that the Deputies on the Government Party are not paying enough attention to it.  If they were they would have taken some part in the debate in order to impress on the Ministry the necessity for providing work for the unemployed. Until work is available it should be the duty of the Government <Col N="106" /> to provide maintenance in the way of food, clothing and shelter for the unemployed and their families.</P>

      <P>The President, during the course of Deputy Little's speech, asked if Deputy Little could explain certain things that existed, namely, the gambling of Irish money in ventures outside the country.  In answer to that question I say that we certainly could, because if the Executive Council established a state of things here whereby you would have stability of industry, industries would go ahead and the people here would find means of speculating their money instead of having to go abroad.  Until you have a Government that, by an adequate system of protection and a national system of credit, speeds up the industrial side, the people will gamble abroad.  As regards this problem of unemployment, I grant you that you cannot solve it out of taxation.  Even by increasing taxation limitlessly you will not solve the question of unemployment. There are other ways of solving it.  Somebody asked for a definition of credit.  Credit is the capacity to produce and deliver goods when and where required. With national economy the issue of credit should be related.  We find in connection with the Shannon scheme that the period of repayment, if there is an issue of credit, is so short as to be detrimental to the community. The machinery for the Shannon scheme, let us say, is capable of working for a period of 60 or 100 years.  Yet we find that the money advanced for that scheme must be paid within ten or twenty years.</P>

      <P>Take the Shannon scheme that the Ministry supports. When the Shannon scheme comes into operation hundreds and hundreds of workers will be knocked out of employment.  What provision is being made for these workers? There is no provision made for them. There you have natural powers for creating forces and you have no provision made for a national dividend to pay these workers who are displaced from work by this force which is created by natural means. There is no provision made for them. Until this Government and other Governments realise these facts, any benefits that are to accrue from the labour-saving devices thus created are in the air.  Take the question of machinery and applying it agriculturally. It is not so many years ago that the people went out and meadows were reaped with scythes and labourers were employed.  Now the reaper and binder has come in and so have various other labour-saving devices.  All this affects the local agricultural population in this way, that the labourers who would naturally get employment at home at this agricultural work have now to emigrate to Scotland, England and America.  With those labour-saving devices which come into existence there is no provision made for a national dividend to pay the workers who are displaced by forces which sometimes cost nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of this matter, I want to know will anyone on the opposite <Col N="108" /> benches deny this fact, that the potential material required for manufacture and production are there to a limitless extent, that there are willing workers there ready and prepared to manufacture the raw materials that are there, in whatever form they are needed?  All that is necessary is the linking up of these willing workers to the production with the raw materials.  That can easily be done by national credit through a national State bank.  The minute you do that you put purchasing power into the hands of the workers.  The minute purchasing power begins to operate a bigger demand starts in the factories, and so you increase prosperity.</P>

      <P>It is like the analogy on the part of the local authorities.  It is to their benefit to have these housing conditions in the rural areas.  Housing conditions in the rural areas have been condemned by the sanitary authorities for a period of over twenty years past, and there has been no loan got to replace these houses.  The sooner the Minister looks into the matter the better. I do not believe that the solution of the unemployment problem is going to come out of taxation.  We could talk here for months about schemes <Col N="109" /> and possibly the Deputies opposite could retort: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  Unless we have somebody ready to say where it is to come from we would be talking for years with no results.  My idea is that there are certain communal prerogatives, and one communal prerogative which will have to be established is that credit is a national asset, and that the benefits and profits accruing from that asset belong to the nation, and should be directed in a national way towards solving this problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Somebody on the Labour Benches spoke about the steps taken by the incoming Labour Government in England on this question of unemployment. I am going to tell them that they will get no further than Mr. Baldwin got in that matter unless they take up and tackle the question of national credit.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene, sir, to make clear certain aspects of Government policy on some individual items that were raised here.  Deputy Brady to-day, at question time, asked a certain number of questions dealing with the percentage to be allowed by the local authorities to Irish manufacture. The questions were along very general lines and the answers were along very general lines, and were, therefore, not so very satisfactory as either the Deputy himself or any other person in the House might like. The only contribution that can be made towards improving a situation like that is to take one particular item and to get thoroughly clear with that.  Because you cannot improve the purchasing of Irish-manufactured goods by local authorities, you cannot improve the position of Irish manufacture in the country by saying simply that local authorities may give a particular preference to Irish manufacture.  In the same way when dealing with the particular question of unemployment, Deputies on the far side are right to be extremely nervous of having it thrown up at them that they are simply talking in vague generalities.  The only <Col N="110" /> thing to do is to get one particular aspect&mdash;to get one type of work that can be done and state the case against the Executive Council here with reference to that particular class of work.  In order that Deputies may be in a position to attack more clearly the Executive Council in the matter, for that and for the general benefit I want to state the policy with regard to certain things. Housing has been referred to here. Deputy Murphy on the Labour Benches said that the Deputies of the Labour Party had declared that, given certain conditions, they were prepared to throw their whole weight in with a national housing policy.  The policy of the members of the Executive Council is this: that they are prepared to give the local authorities, in the matter of building houses for the working classes, a grant of £60 per house plus a long-term loan, a loan for 35 years at 5¾ per cent. forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they giving this for labourers' cottages, too?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, where the local authorities will strike a rate of 1/- in the £, the Executive Council is prepared to increase the grant in respect of the house to £72.  The Executive Council is prepared to give a grant of £45 to every private person building a house within the regulations laid down by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and it is prepared to give a grant of £50 in respect of houses built under the Labourers Acts.  Deputies have been charging us with promising that there was going to be a national housing policy.  Like some other quotations that have been mentioned here, I would like to see the quotation of a national housing policy given from these benches.  It is true, as Deputies on the other side have said, that it should not be left to the Labour Party or to the Fianna Fáil Party to produce this policy.  It has not been left to them.  What I would like to hear from the Deputies on the Labour Benches or the Fianna Fáil Benches is a criticism of the details of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Deputies have stated that the idea of giving long-term loans was brought forward in connection with the Sligo-Leitrim election.  Deputies ought not to be too sensitive in regard to elections.  I hope that Deputy Cassidy will not say, when he sees a circular to local authorities either to-day or to-morrow in regard to the whole position, that it was because of some remarks of his to-day that it was sent out so quickly. Unfortunately responsible Ministers dealing with such matters cannot get a vague and general idea and say that that is a solution.  They have to work out the details of it.  The details of the housing policy and of the assistance given to local authorities in the matter will, as part of the Government's policy, be based upon the summing up by the local authority of the housing needs of their districts and the shouldering by them of fifty per cent. of the cost over and above the amount due and which cannot be paid in rent by the tenants.  That is the Government's policy in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that part of the Government's policy in the matter of roads has been to throw on local authorities more responsibility for their cost.  That is not a fact. Every year since the end of 1924 the actual amount of work done by money provided by ratepayers, whether through rates or loans, has been decreasing.  It decreased in the year 1925 from £1,404,000 to £1,410,000 in 1926; from £1,336,000 in 1927 to £1,202,000 in 1928 and to £1,107,000 in 1929.  So far as the Road Fund is concerned, the road users are responsible for the employment of every one out of two men employed on trunk roads, for every three out of ten men employed on link roads, and for every ten out of eleven men employed on road construction.  It is not therefore a fact that the Government's policy with regard to roads is increasing the burden on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>As I explained on the Local Government Estimate, certain counties have been shirking their responsibility in the matter of roads. <Col N="112" /> These counties have been brought to heel this year, to a certain extent at any rate.  There are other counties which, compared with 1914, are contributing more in regard to roads than we might reasonably expect them to contribute.  The question of State policy in regard to assisting local authorities to carry out necessary public health works, such as water and sewerage schemes, has been mentioned, and it has been suggested that the total cost of that work should not be allowed to fall on local authorities.  It is not the policy of the Executive Council to make a State contribution to local authorities for that work.  At present I think that there is only one county for which the charges for these matters are county-at-large charges.  I feel that the first step in bringing about any change in the financing of these schemes must be to pass to a county-at-large charge. Deputy Everett shakes his head. At any rate, I am not prepared to subscribe to the suggestion that there should be a State grant for these matters.  You cannot, economically and efficiently, review the position of the country as regards public health services and safely deal with the financing of them until you have a County Medical Officer of Health standing over the health position in each county, taking such problems as those which exist, and putting them into their proper order of urgency and importance, considering the amount of money that may be required for the immediate solving of all these problems.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council plead guilty to having a policy of not giving State grants to assist local authorities to carry out such matters, but every possible encouragement is being given to them and they are being urged to solve these problems and the necessary loans are being given and have been provided for years past.  I do not at all subscribe to the suggestion which Deputy Lemass makes that if you put unemployed persons to mending bridges and carrying out works of that kind the cost will not <Col N="113" /> have to be met.  The cost will have to be met, and it is because the cost will have to be met that the Government's policy in these particular matters is what it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy and others spoke of the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Cassidy referred to the recommendations which the Committee made in regard to housing, drainage, and carding mills.  The Executive Council have already taken decisions with regard to additional housing facilities which have to be made available in the Gaeltacht.  The final administrative details of the matter have to be settled, but it is very near being an established fact that additional facilities will be available which will be on lines somewhat similar to those recommended in the Gaeltacht report. The position in regard to drainage is that you have an Act dealing with minor drainage schemes and another Act dealing with major schemes.  If the Deputy can point out, as perhaps it could be pointed out, that there are schemes of drainage to be done in the area he speaks of which do not come within the Acts, or, if they do, which have not received proper attention, it would be a definite contribution to the debate and it might be even a definite charge against the Executive Council. Until, however, the Deputy gets down to closer grips with regard to these districts, one is unable to give him a complete answer in regard to such arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the information at hand to answer the Deputy, but I ask him to recall that in the matter of minor schemes, in order to facilitate their being carried out, we cut out central interference entirely.  We embodied in the Act a definite percentage grant on the total expenditure and we left the carrying out of the schemes to the county councils and their machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask is <Col N="114" /> that it was admitted during the debate on that Bill that it was an experiment. I thought that, as the Minister mentioned it, we might be told how far it has been successful up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can get such information as we have in the Department by putting down a question.  Definite arrangements have been made in the Department for supervising to such extent as is desirable minor schemes in drainage but, in so far as interference with them or the holding up of schemes, there is no central machinery that can interfere with them. On the question of the woollen industry, I do not agree with the Deputy that nothing has been done in the matter.  I would like the Deputy to repeat what he said on the Estimate for the Ministry of Fisheries with regard to the woollen industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that as far as the hand-spun industry, as apart from the home-spun industry, is concerned nothing has been done up to the present time and no employment has been given in Co.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to answer the Deputy as completely as I can.  I have said all I can with regard to the questions of housing and drainage.  The matter of the woollen industry has been given a very great amount of consideration by the Department responsible for it.  As far as details are concerned, I would suggest that he could raise them on the Estimate of the Minister for Fisheries.  It has been suggested by Deputies on previous occasions that I said that the Government's contribution to the unemployment problem was that <Col N="115" /> there was home assistance to be got. The fact is that where it has not been possible to absorb the total number of unemployed in the work that the Executive Council by its help has stimulated in the country, the policy of the Executive Council has been to make such provision as it has made, so that the able-bodied destitute are entitled to home relief to which they were not entitled until the present Executive Council changed the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the housing grants were available under the Labourers Acts.  If they are available under the Labourers Acts, does he not take into consideration that labourers' cottages are in a different category from ordinary houses?  In the case of ordinary houses the citizen builds his own house, but in the case of labourers' cottages, land has to be acquired for the site.  I think the Department should take into consideration the advisability of increasing the grant.  The other question I want to ask refers to county-at-large charges for sewerage systems and water supply schemes.  Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation to bring that into operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned certain things to which the Executive Council would have to plead guilty.  He mentioned one specific thing, but I am afraid there are other matters to which the Executive Council would be compelled to plead guilty if they were only honest about their policy.  Of <Col N="116" /> course, as might be said in regard to myself, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the Minister's philosophy. What is the policy of the Executive Council in regard to all those things to which we should have been entitled under the Treaty or as a result of the Treaty?  Our past should have taught us that there were certain things to which we were entitled.  At least we thought we were entitled to those things, but when it came to putting the matter to a test, we discovered that they were not our property at all.  A few matters have arisen very recently which bring up the question of ownership of the territorial waters which we were led to believe were the property of the Free State. We were led to believe that the territorial waters not only around the immediate shores of the Free State but the territorial waters around the Six Counties were the property of the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a prosecution arising out of a case in Belfast Lough, and at that time the case was dismissed for the simple reason that the contention was put up that Belfast Lough was included in the territorial waters of the Free State.  Whether that is so or not I do not know.  It does not immediately concern us as the moment, but there is one thing which does concern us, and it is this: whether or not we are entitled to the territorial waters around the Free State we want to know the attitude of the Executive Council towards the things which are supposed to be their property and which were supposed to be our exclusive right according to the Treaty.  We have the case of the Derry Bridge.  We asked the Minister to oppose the erection of the bridge across the Foyle at Derry unless there was an opening span, so that the waters of the Free State should be kept exclusively for the Free State, and so that there should be a free pass for any boats that might come in there.  We never got any expression of opinion from the Executive Council as to whether they owned the territorial waters or not.  If they do not own the territorial <Col N="117" /> waters then all this talk has been humbug from the time of the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know whether we own the territorial waters this year or last year.  The bridge has been built this year.  Last week nets and boats were seized on the Foyle by armed people who came from the Six Counties.  If we owned the territorial waters this year we owned them last year and every other year.  If we do not own them this year we never owned them.  I want to know the policy of the Executive Council in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cassidy referred to the question of unemployment in Donegal.  For the past four or five years we have had nothing but rank humbug in regard to the Gaeltacht as a whole and Donegal in particular. The treatment of Donegal is so noticeable that it has been called by people who, one could not say, had any special sympathy with it, the Cinderella of the Free State.  It has been left even without the glass slippers.  There has been nothing but humbug in regard to the Gaeltacht, and in regard to everything that was supposed to have been done by the Commission set up to examine the whole question of the congested areas.  Certain recommendations were made, and we were informed two years ago, last year, and this year that all these things were to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have not been done yet.  Last October I was informed that in four months' time everything in regard to the cottage industries, the hand-spun and home-spun industries would be under way.  Not a thing has been done from that day until <Col N="118" /> this&mdash;not even a stamp, that probably would only have cost 2/-, for the stamping of home-spun cloth has been provided.  The Minister said that certain things had been done in the home-spun.  Not even in the home-spun has anything been done to relieve unemployment, to give poor people in the cottages an opportunity of eking out an existence.  The Committee in Ardara offered to put up £600 for the purpose of setting up breaking and carding machines, and dyeing vats, and the policy of the Executive Council as exemplified by the Minister for Fisheries is this. Let somebody else come in and do it. Let a Scotchman come in and do it, but we in the meantime must do nothing.  Humbug.  Since October last, nothing but humbug.</P>
    <P>Another important thing in connection with the Gaeltacht was the starting of navigation schools to teach the young how to fish and navigate. Those things would be eminently suitable to the districts in which those schools were to have been erected.  They would have provided young men with a good knowledge of navigation, if in the future we decide &mdash;at least if it be the policy of the Executive Council&mdash;to give some help towards the formation of a mercantile marine.  That has not been done and we are still waiting for something in connection with a report to materialise.  It has departed into the limbo of things forgotten, a Government pigeon hole.  The President is one of those who pretends to understand the psychology of the emigrant. His reading of it is this.  Those who depart from this country to a land across the sea go there for the express purpose of visiting their friends.  Others tell you no matter what would be or could be done for the congested areas and the people therein it would not prevent people from emigrating to the United States. They tell you that these people want to see life.  Things are too dull here. If I understand the psychology of the emigrants who go from Donegal&mdash; and I have seen enough of them to be able to do it&mdash;it is this, that they go because they have to go.  Far more would be going at present if they <Col N="119" /> had the money to go.  They go because it is a steady grind, if they have work, from morning to night. But then they are glad to do it. They go to Scotland and England where they have the opportunity of doing it because they cannot get it here.  They go because they cannot live here.  Young men and women go because they cannot bear to see their fathers and mothers, their young brothers and sisters starving and they send money home.  That money takes out the rest of the family.  As they grow up they all go.  The President's reading of the psychology of the emigrants is that they go to America to see their friends.  There is not as much money amongst the poor in the congested areas of Donegal as would take two people across to America to see their friends, not to mind taking 6,000 inside three or four years.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that when there is any pressing matter to be raised in regard to the condition of the people in the congested areas that the best way to deal with it according to the policy of the Executive Council is to form a committee.  The committee sits indefinitely.  Some of those committees you will find are covered with ashes, the same as if they had been overflown by Mount Vesuvius.  People will pick them out a thousand years hence and they will be still sitting.  We never can see any result from the Piers and Harbours Committee.  You ask for a report but there is nothing doing.</P>

The President always sets out to educate us on those benches, for which, O Lord, we return thanks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Vote there are a few matters I am anxious to bring to the attention of the House, particularly with regard to the unemployment problem.  I think it is very little use discussing unemployment here whilst you have a Bill of twenty-one million pounds odd to meet for the drones of the community, and whilst we have a generous Executive in office who are prepared to throw £250 a year to gentlemen having £1,000 or £1,500. I think there is very little use in discussing unemployment when that state of affairs exists.  You have a Minister for Local Government who coolly tells how he is doing everything and who has a grand Bill with regard to housing.  He tells us what the local authorities are doing, and when he is asked what it would cost to build labourers' cottages he is dumb and tells you&mdash;as cheaply as possible.</P>
      <P>You find the grant he is prepared to give under the Housing of the Working Classes Act is £60, while at the same time he has a special clause in by which the local authorities can only give loans not exceeding twice that amount.  So the total amount that would be available to build a house for a working man to-day would be £180.  When you compare that with the amount they consider necessary to expend on every house you become amazed.  I wonder would the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce explain to us whether, in his opinion, you could build labourers' houses for £180, provide a site and all, or if so, how it is that he has spent £1,700 for a police barracks at Dungourney?</P>

I can tell this House that in my constituency 40 per cent. fewer farm labourers are employed to-day than were employed four years ago, owing to the fact that the farmers are absolutely unable to pay them. I expected when the Budget was <Col N="122" /> introduced that the Executive Council would take some steps towards putting the Irish farmer on at least the same level as the farmers across the Border, or in Great Britain, seeing that they have to compete in the same market.  But no; we have millions expended here and we go abroad every second year for a loan of five millions more in order to pay a horde of officials and to see that our own salaries are saved.  At the same time, we cannot afford to give any reduction whatever in the rates to the Irish farmer.  We cannot afford to give him an opportunity of living or of giving employment, as it should be given, on the land.  I expected this year that the Minister for Finance, when introducing his Budget, would have definite proposals for de-rating.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the Dáil debate of the 23rd May, 1929.  When this matter was brought up on the Vote of the Office of Public Works it was stated by Deputy Bourke, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, that the question of British military graves was a matter of Government policy, that the question had been decided by British Government representatives and by the Executive Council.  As this is a question of policy, it is not a matter in which the Department is concerned; therefore I take it it is a matter which arises on this Vote.</P>

He would be able to tell us what he did with the money he got for a motor car, whether he expended it on the car in Ireland or whether he went across for one of these cars that Deputy Lemass alluded to a while ago.  I would like to get some information from him on that.  I would also like to hear from him whether he considers that the Secretary, for instance, should be paid £1,200 a year and I presume war bonus, while men are unemployed and hungry in the country, whether he considers that a fair sum to pay to one individual <Col N="124" /> or not.  I do not think, considering the manner in which this Vote has been treated, that there is much more that I can say on it. Apparently, there is nobody responsible for anything here.

      <P>Speaking on this Estimate, half an hour ago, the Minister for Local Government said that the Executive Council pleaded guilty to the fact that they would not contribute anything towards public health in the country.  The policy of the Executive Council in matters of roads, housing and drainage has been to make State contributions, and I submit that questions of housing shortage and any other State schemes are less important than the question of public health.  The Minister mentioned that the first step towards the improvement of public health schemes should be the fixing of the county-at-large as the area of charge.  I should like to point cut that it rests with the Government to fix the area of charge and not with the local authority. Until the Government makes some provision to fix the area of charge, other than the area at present specified, they cannot improve the public health services.  When Deputy Kennedy asked the Minister the question he was ruled out of order.  I should like to put the question in this way: I should like the President in his reply to state definitely if it is the policy of the Executive Council to introduce legislation to fix the area of charge as the county-at-large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government, in his speech, neglected altogether to deal with the issues raised in the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell.  He quoted his usual litany of what the Government had done, especially his Department.  I wonder will he deny that there is an unemployment problem, or are we to assume that the Government accept the present situation as normal?  In every part of the country demands are being made on various Deputies to bring <Col N="125" /> pressure on the Government with a view to having certain works carried out in different areas.  I admit that some of them are not works which could be called remunerative, but surely there are various schemes in different parts of the country which could be looked upon as remunerative and which, in the end, would benefit the country to a great extent. Whether we like it or not, there is a big unemployment problem facing the country.  The position to-day is very little better than it was two or three years ago, when the Government thought it absolutely necessary to include in their annual estimates a certain sum for the relief of unemployment. The Minister has spoken of the amount given by his Department in free grants to the various county councils.  A certain amount in free grants is given each year, but since 1927 it has been decreasing rapidly, with the result that only about 50 per cent. of the road workers employed in 1927 are employed to-day.  The Minister gave the proportion of men on the different classes of roads and mentioned especially that ten out of every eleven men employed on construction work are paid by the Government. That state of affairs may have prevailed about two years ago, but there is very little construction work being done to-day on the roads.  The greater proportion of the money paid to county councils is by way of maintenance grant and it is laid down as essential in the regulations submitted to local authorities by the Local Government Department that a certain amount of money must be budgeted for by the county councils in order to get a certain amount of money.  I do not disagree with that policy, because for the last three or four years a great many councils have been inclined to take advantage of the Government grant in order to reduce the rates.  I will give the Government the credit by saying that that was not what they intended&mdash;that they gave the grant in order to relieve unemployment and to build up the roads as they should be built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The matter of housing has been mentioned, and the Minister for Local Government in answer to an interjection of mine, stated that the money from the Local Loans Fund was available now.  The Minister for Finance a month ago gave me the same answer in reply to a question. I am beginning to wonder whether we are ever going to get the money.  The Wexford Corporation submitted a scheme to the Local Government Department almost a month ago.  It must be said to the credit of that Department that they accepted this scheme and recommended it to the Board of Works. Nobody can find out now whether it is with the Board of Works or the Finance Department.  One wonders whether this is going to go on until winter comes, when it will cost at least 20 per cent. more to build a house than it would now when we have the long days.  I would ask the President, who has always shown himself keenly interested in housing, to do something to have the money released at once.  Some of us think that if the Dáil rises before the money is forthcoming we will have to renew the agitation when we come back for the Autumn Session. There is no use stating in the House that money from the Local Loans Fund is available if, when a council tries to get the money, they are sent from one Department to another in a sort of Herod-Pilate fashion.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of unemployment, it is very hard for a Deputy who has not the ready access to statistics that the Government have to put up any scheme.  But there is one thing that ought to engage the attention of the Government. From time to time it has been suggested that there should be a national housing council.  To my mind, that is the proper way of dealing with housing, and when the Government see their way to approach housing from that angle and through that medium, I think it will become apparent to them&mdash;when that council is set up and if that council proposes to do anything&mdash; that we are importing a great <Col N="127" /> amount of material which is available in this country.</P>
    <P>In last year's returns, it is shown that we imported cement to the amount of half a million of money, notwithstanding the fact that in various parts of the Free State we have quarries capable of giving sufficient cement to cater for all the needs of the State.  I have time and again drawn the attention of the Ministry to the fact that in my own constituency there is a cement works that could be worked but which, in my opinion, was bought up by an English syndicate with a view to wiping it out in the interest of a ring on the other side of the Channel. Again, when we come to the question of slates, we find that practically every house built now is roofed with asbestos slates made on the other side of the Channel.  I am not objecting to that at present.  I recognise it is almost impossible to buy Irish slates and to let a house at an economic rent, because of the fact that there is no certainty in the demand for these Irish slates.  But I believe if the Government were to get into touch with the Killaloe quarry and to give them an idea of their requirements for the next two or three years and tell them what their housing programme was to be, slates would be forthcoming at a price that would enable the local authorities to buy Irish slates for their houses and thus save that amount to this country.  These are two ideas that I think the Government ought to investigate, with a view to keeping money in the country, which would go ultimately to the betterment of the general community and especially to the benefit of people who are now idle. I would seriously suggest that the Government should go into this housing question through the medium of the suggested national housing council and thereby do something to keep a certain amount of money in the country along with providing a large number of houses. I again suggest to the President that he should bring pressure to bear upon the Finance Department or <Col N="128" /> the Board of Works with a view to getting them to release the money that we were told was available a month ago, so that the local authorities could start building houses before the winter comes on.  I am sure the President will agree, with his great experience of housing, that if it is left very much longer houses will cost at least 20 per cent. more owing to the short day.</P>

I gContae Mhuigheo i mbliana, do réir mar a chonnaic mise, ní raibh níos mó daoine ag fáil cabhair phuiblí ó na rátaí o bhliaín an ghorta anuas.  Is mór an rud sin do rá agus is mór an náire don Rialtas agus don Uachtarán go bhfuil sin le rá seacht mbliana ó cuireadh an Saorstát ar <Col N="129" /> bun.  Ní ar lucht oibre atá an locht no ar Fhianna Fáil go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh.  Ní hé nach dtig leis an Rialtas an t-airgead d'fháil.  Ní h-é nach bhfuil na daoine sásta obair a dhéanamh gan bheith ag súil le cabhair phuiblí; ní h-é sin é.  Sé an fáth atá leis sin, an fhaid is gheibheann an Rialtas an t-airgead ó na rátaí agus ó lucht cánach ní chaitheann siad an tairgead sin ar mhaithe le daoine coitchianta na tíre seo.</P>

Nuair a fheiceann an Rialtas an méid seo gluaisteán ag teacht thar sáile, agus nuair a fheiceann siad go bhfuil daoine in ann íoc asta, nuair a fheiceann siad go bhfuil daoine in ann dul go dtí &ldquo;garden parties&rdquo; ag caitheamh cótaí fada, breatha, deireann siad go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar an tír.  Ba cheart do'n Uacharán no d'Airí, anois agus arís, nuair nach mbíonn togha ar siúl dul síos an tír agus an riocht atá ar na daoine d'fheiceál.

    <P>Sin é an locht atá agam-sa ar an Rialtas&mdash;go bhfuil faillighe déanta acu i ndaoine coitchianta na tíre seo. Má dhéanann aon bhall de Chumann na nGaedheal casaoid ag cruinniú den Phairtí no ag cruinniú puiblí, cuireann an tUachtarán 'na thost é le focal plámásach.  Má leanann don chasaoid, gheobhaidh sé &ldquo;job&rdquo; no rud éicint den tsórt sin.  Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire Cosanta&mdash;go sábháluighidh Dia sinn?&mdash;tamall ó shoin cé mhéid airgid a bhí ag dul do na daoine a d'fhág an t-Arm le bliain <Col N="130" /> anuas.  Dubhairt sé go raibh £300,000 no níos mo íoctha amach do na daoine a d'eirigh as an arm agus a dtig leo obair a dhéanamh agus a fuair obair, is dócha, in áit éicint eile.  Teasbánann sé sin nach easbadh airgid an fáth leis an Uachtarán agus an Rialtas bheith ag déanamh dearmad ar dhaoine coitchianta na tíre.  Chím, do réir an chláir annseo, go bhfuil Rúnaí Pairliminte ag an Uachtarán agus £1,200 de thuarastal aige.  Tá an dara Rúnaí agus £1,200 de thuarastal aige agus tá Rúnaí Conganta agus oifigeach eile agus tá thimcheall £800 acu.  Tá triúr no ceathrar rúnaithe agus leas-rúnaithe agus fó-rúnaithe agus chuile short eile rúnaithe, ag fáil ó £300 go £600 agus £700 sa mbliain.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh ganntanas airgid ar an Rialtas agus dhá dteastóchadh uatha £1,000,000 do shábháil tuige nar chuir an tUachtarán cuireadh do dtí Míchéal O hIfearnáin, Teachta, teacht isteach san oifig chuige agus cuid den airgead sin do shábháil?  B'fheidir go bhfaca an tUachtarán nach mbeadh móran maitheasa a leitheid sin de chuireadh do thabhairt don Teachta sin. Tá £1,200 a fháil ag Míchéal O hIfearnáin é fein ón phost atá aige agus ní bheadh sé ceart dó bheith chó cruaidh sin ar dhaoine eile atá cosamhail leis féin.  Nuair a bhí airgead le sábháil agus nuair a theastuigh uatha laigheadú do dhéanamh ar na costaisí is go dtí na daoine bochta a chuaidh an Rialtas leis an airgead do shábháil.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar sin agus ar a lán rudaí eile, tá mé ag cur i n aghaidh an Vótá seo.  Nuair a thainig an &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; rómhainn, bhí súil ag 'chuile dhuine go bhfeicthí an feabhas a bhí le feiceál sa tír; ach ní raibh aon laigheadú ar chán-acha nó ar chíosa na ndaoine go raibh an t-ualach ba thruime ortha le bliantaí agus tá sé níos truime indiu ná ariamh.</P>
    <P>Ar cheist na náisiúntachta, ón chéad lá a thainig an tUachtarán i gcomhacht ní fhaca me go ndeárna sé aon iarracht an cheist náisiúnta do phlé.

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Deputy O'Connell's amendment to refer this Vote back.  I confess I was rather surprised at the statement made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He mentioned a few of what he considered were the good things that were accomplished.  He also spoke of the policy of the Executive Council in connection with sewerage schemes, but he omitted to speak on the motion before the Chair, the question of unemployment.  He omitted to tell the House of the increase in the rates struck by public bodies in the Saorstát for home assistance.  In my own county of Wicklow, the assistance given to able-bodied men unable to procure work was for the year ending 31st March, 1923, £2,026.  The expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1929, was £3,397, notwithstanding that the amount of home assistance had to be reduced in the meantime from 10/-to 5/- a week in order to cope with the demand for it by the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that he himself put certain responsibilities upon local authorities.  He denied, when it was charged here in this House, that the Executive Council should be responsible in respect of the unemployment fund.  In two cases he went further.  He increased the liabilities on public and local bodies because the housing scheme of public bodies can only be gone on with when they increase the rates or levy a special rate of 1/- in the £1.  The Minister does not say if that applies <Col N="132" /> to rural houses or to boards of public health.  These bodies say that 35 years will not be a sufficiently long term to enable boards of health to avail of that Housing Act.  There are, however, large numbers of rural workers unemployed, and those who are in employment have a very small wage.  The result is that no local bodies can build houses which they can let at an economic rent because these men who are in employment are in receipt of very small wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that sewerage schemes should be a county-at-large charge.  Public bodies' liabilities have increased very much from 1919.  First of all, there was the increased cost of maintenance of the insane.  Then there was the increased cost as a result of the amalgamation scheme because of grants and pensions to ex-officials.  There was, further, the increased cost of roads, and there is no grant given by the Local Government Department this year for the new roads.  As Deputy Corish states, the only grants given are for road maintenance. In a large number of cases, the roads are maintained by contract, with the exception of trunk or link roads.  It has been said here to-night that the Labour Party are asking for doles.  I am asking for some scheme to be adopted by the Government to deal with the unemployment question.  Apart altogether from the question of Government, I submit it is a Christian duty to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to extend the unemployment insurance and not to ask public bodies to assist in solving the question of unemployment.  It is not really the duty or the function of public bodies to do so.  The rates are being increased two-fold, and these bodies will be unable to deal with the housing problem if they have to spend £5,000 or £6,000 a year in providing home assistance. There is no hope that the scheme that the Minister has announced for the building of houses to meet the demands or requirements of the Free State will be successful.  Deputy O'Dowd has asked that sewerage <Col N="133" /> schemes should be made county-at-large charges.  That would mean that congested areas that are paying for their own schemes would also have to pay for special areas that fail to grapple with these problems. That would mean that double burdens would be placed on those people.  Certainly if the Minister brings in legislation on those lines, he will meet with opposition even within his own ranks.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the President a question about a very serious matter. It is a national matter which would absorb a very large number of the unemployed in a number of places&mdash; the question of coast erosion.  The President has told us that this is being considered by an inter-departmental committee.  If it takes that inter-departmental committee as long as it took the departmental tribunal to deal with the question of harbours, then we can have no hope that there will be any relief for these people in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Public bodies are, in their own small way, unable to deal further with this question, and I certainly join in the appeal made by Deputy Cassidy.  That is not a question for the Labour Party or the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government Party.  It should be grappled with as a national question and not in the same way as it was by the Committee appointed in 1927 to make suggestions about unemployment. We have never heard, up to the present, that the Government adopted any of the recommendations made by that Committee.  The President will state, of course, when he is replying, that there is money lying to the credit of some local bodies in the matter of roads.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health made that statement during the last debate on this matter.  He omitted to state that, though the money may be lying to the credit of these local bodies, in many cases that amount had already been spent on the roads. Consequently that money would not be available for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Industry and Commerce has helped <Col N="134" /> Wicklow in connection with the mining in Avoca, still&mdash;notwithstanding that industry there, which we all hope will be a success&mdash;there was never so much unemployment as in Wicklow at the present time.  The Board of Health have been given overdrafts by the banks with the sanction of the County Council, and there is no use in making appeals to the public bodies that are already living on overdrafts.  There is no use in appealing to them to start house building that would only impose still further burdens on them. Notwithstanding objections made that certain people never pay rent and rates, I want to say that under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, even where the public bodies have power to exempt people in receipt of home help, these people are now forced under the Acts to pay rates, because the rents are increased. Therefore, they are paying rates in the increased rents.  Public bodies are finding a difficulty in trying to meet payment in these matters and it is no use for the Minister to get up and ask the public bodies to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Government asking public bodies to bear a further burden.  It is the duty of the Government to look after these matters.  There is nothing to prevent them doing so, and they can economise in other directions.  I observe that they can give big grants for amusements and races in the Phoenix Park, but they forget to come to the relief of the people who voted for the Government.  My own policy is, instead of making those appeals time after time to the Government, to take other action. Probably I have a different opinion to other members, but I am prepared to put my opinion into practice in order to try and achieve my ends. If appeals fail in the constitutional Assembly, then I say&mdash;Ministers may laugh at me for saying it&mdash;that men should use their powers in other directions.  Instead of making appeals in places like this, where they will fall on deaf ears, they will, if necessary, bring force against force. It would be much better for many <Col N="135" /> workers if they were obliged to go to jail, because there they would be entitled to three meals a day.  If they adopted such a course it would be a greater burden on the State, because they are doing nothing at the present time for those men.</P>

      <P>I want the President to explain a few matters arising out of this Estimate.  I notice that in the Estimates for this year there is a saving of £1,800,000.  The President, who might be expected to show a good example, has increased his Estimate by 7 per cent.  This year he has two higher executive officers in his Department, whereas up to the present one has sufficed.  Where is the necessity this year, as compared with last year, for two higher executive officers?  I notice that there is a staff officer who has taken control of four clerical officers.  Two of the clerical officers have special duties for which they are paid extra; and another of the four has a pension, so there is really only one clerical officer left.  A big saving was made in the Land Commission, but the biggest saving, perhaps, was made on the improvement of estates.  If money had been voted this year, as in previous years, the benefit would go to people of the country who were getting employment under the Land Commission.  Those people are badly in need of employment.  They have nothing else to replace the work they were getting in districts where estates were being divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Fisheries Vote a saving was made by curtailing loans to fishermen. Under the Forestry Vote, a saving was made in connection with the acquisition of land.  These are savings from which the country not only gets no value now, but the people actually lose the value that they were getting.  It is not to the advantage of the country to make savings on the improvement of estates when employment is so badly wanted.  It is not to the benefit of the fishermen to make savings by reducing the loans applicable to them.  It is certainly not to the benefit of the people in the country <Col N="136" /> who want employment to make a saving on the acquisition of land for forestry.  In such Votes, the money spent in former years was of direct benefit to the country as a whole. The situation now is that where Votes are increased, the people get absolutely no benefit.  I think, therefore, that an increase of 7 per cent. in this Vote is a thing that can be scarcely defended by the Dáil.  I would like the President to tell us the necessity for employing an additional higher executive officer this year.</P>

      <P>As far as the constituency which I represent is concerned, I must say that there is no visible sign of improvement in so far as unemployment goes.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated here last week that 17,000 persons had been employed during the year.  In my constituency there is no visible sign of any of the 17,000 who were employed being centred there.  A lot of the people in that constituency are out of employment and they include railway workers, who have been dismissed, and many road workers.  Road-work has not been progressing very favourably there.  Absolutely no drainage work has been done.  The Minister for Finance stated here some weeks ago that the drainage work that has been carried on is not giving good results. I was very sorry to hear the Minister saying that, but that was actually his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no visible sign of improvement in Westmeath and, to instance that, I will give some figures representing the amount of home assistance given.  The total amount of home assistance paid in County Westmeath for the year ending 31st March, 1927, was £8,829 12s. 8d.; in the year ending 31st March, 1928, the amount was £9,441 17s. 0d., and in the year ending 31st March, 1929, it was £9,808 9s. 10½d.  During the last two years I have been a member of the Westmeath Board of Health. I can state definitely to the House that I do not know anyone receiving home assistance in that county who is not absolutely entitled to it.  The <Col N="137" /> members of the Board of Health there are unanimous in the belief that they could give very much more deservedly in the way of home assistance if they had the money to do it.  There are large numbers of persons in the county entitled to home help who are not receiving it. These facts will go to prove that what I have stated is quite correct&mdash; there is no visible sign of improvement in the county.  During the last year or two, no doubt, conditions have become worse by reason of the fact that numbers of men have been discharged from the National Army. In many instances they have been obliged to seek home assistance.  I know for a fact that home assistance has increased considerably in Westmeath.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I would like to impress upon the President, and I am sure that he will use his influence with the Department responsible. I hope things will improve in County Westmeath, and I believe that in the coming year they will.  What I want to draw the President's attention to is this: where an industry is started and that industry is looking for a site, it would be very advisable if State lands were allowed to be utilised.  I hope that the President will use his influence with the Department concerned and see that that idea is carried into effect.  It would be very advisable if State lands were granted for the purpose of starting industries.  Industrial concerns could then build factories, stores and things of that sort, and all these things would ultimately tend to benefit the country.</P>
    <P>Where State land is needed for the building of houses sites could be granted.  I hope that the Minister will use his influence to have all these matters expedited.  I know that certain formalities have to be gone through, but I think that they should be pushed through as speedily as possible.  We hope, if that is done, not to be as bad in Westmeath as we have been for the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for <Col N="138" /> Local Government referred to the Government's housing policy which is in existence, and also to the policy which he contemplates putting into operation in the near future.  I am not in a position to say how far the present policy has been a success, but I can say that, so far as my knowledge in country districts goes, that policy has not attempted to deal with the situation there.  I have had some absurd experiences as to the working out of the Government scheme in my part of the country. I have known instances in which men attempted to improve their homes and had gone to the expense of pulling them down, so far as could be reasonably expected, in order to conform with the housing regulations required for the erection of new buildings.  They applied to the Department for grants but were told that they had not conformed with the regulations as they had allowed portion of the walls&mdash;to the extent of perhaps five feet&mdash;of the old building to remain.  Because they did not destroy what was sound and good work they technically fell foul of the regulations and were not given grants.  If such treatment as that be taken as an indication of the working of the Government's housing scheme I think it would be better described by leaving out any reference to a housing scheme, simply to refer to it as the Government's scheme for depriving people of money which was originally intended to help them.  If the new scheme which the Government propose to introduce does not deal more generously with the rural areas, then it may be said that the Government never intended to give them any advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of roads.  There again I must say that while the Department have endeavoured to spend a good deal of money on the improvement of roads there is a good deal of dissatisfaction at the manner in which the grants for such roads are allocated, and I would say that there is a good deal of justification for such dissatisfaction. The scheme of allotment of grants is based on the valuation <Col N="139" /> of the counties and on other details.  In my opinion what would be a more advisable course to adopt would be that those responsible for the allocation of grants would take into account the question of costs of construction and the cost of maintenance rather than the valuation or the amount of rates struck for such purpose.  For instance, where road material has to be carried a long distance it is more expensive to make roads than where such material is at hand.  It is also more expensive where the foundation of a road is of such a character that it is required to be made substantial.</P>
    <P>These are big items which should be borne in mind when considering the cost of maintenance.  There should also be taken into account the extent to which the people of the county use good roads.  In the poorer counties, where the ratepayers are called on to pay increased charges compared with the pre-war or pre-motor days, they take very little advantage of the improved roads as they do not own motor cars.  I have experience in County Leitrim where the Government spent a fair proportion of money on the improvement of roads. I have also experience where a strong application was made to the Government to allot money to improve a road in connection with the development of a coal mine.  After various applications and deputations had been heard on behalf of the county council they were told by the Department that no money was available for that purpose. That is hardly treating the matter in a serious way.  While the Department could find moneys for the improvement of roads for the benefit of motorists and to encourage tourist traffic, and while taxpayers are being taxed for improving such roads, surely when a substantial case is put forward for improving a road in connection with the development of a coal mine, thus giving employment, such application should not be turned down by the Department.</P>
    <P>Underlying all the schemes for the <Col N="140" /> improvement of roads and the building of houses to which the Minister referred, there is the fundamental question of the economic position of the people.  If you have a good and sound economic position the housing problem will, to a large extent, solve itself, and so also will the problem of roads.  When, however, you find the Department refusing to assist in the development of a service that offers decent employment you can say that such Department has not tackled the problem in the proper way.  The Minister also referred to the sanitary arrangements provided by local bodies, and he was emphatic that the county councils and other responsible bodies must strike rates for that purpose.  From the attitude of the Minister I can say that the likelihood of such bodies striking rates for that purpose is remote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use to my mind in stating that all these schemes for the improvement of houses, sanitary arrangements and drainage schemes have proved successful when the Minister responsible <Col N="141" /> must know from experience that his present line of action will not bring any beneficial results.  In regard to the relief of unemployment, I would appeal urgently to him and to those responsible, that some consideration should be given to the position of that section of the community who are not usually classed as labourers but who, when their conditions are examined, will be found to be mainly labourers.  I refer to the small farmers living in congested areas.  In the old days that section of the community were very keen in looking after their interests.  The old C. D. Board had at its disposal a sum of £231,000 annually and that was supplemented by other sums from the Government then in office.  As a result of that, a good deal of very beneficial work was carried out in the poorer areas.  The people in these areas, although nominally farmers, are people who derive their living from other sources of revenue. They are people who in the ordinary way spend three or four months of the year working on their farms. For the remainder of the year if they do not find suitable employment they are out of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Congested Districts Board did much useful work in dealing with these people.  They developed cottage and rural industries.  These cottage industries for the last three years of the existence of the Board earned an annual average income of £70,000. That branch of the service, initiated by that body, has to a very great extent been neglected.  It is surely permissible to suggest to the responsible authorities that some effort should be made to develop again the branch of the work formerly conducted by the Congested Districts Board so as to provide additional employment for small uneconomic farmers and their families.  If a serious effort were made in that direction the situation in the west might not be at all as it is to-day. Speaking of the people in the west of Ireland and of a general improvement in housing I must say that the schemes of the Board of Works are merely infuriating the people because they fully realise that <Col N="142" /> the present Executive are not in any way serious in their efforts.  Not very long ago people in Co. Leitrim had practical experience of the insincerity of those Ministers who talk about the fine work they have done and the fine work they contemplate for the farmers.  When recently these Ministers were down in Leitrim &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up much time of the House in this debate except to refer to two very important subjects that have already been dealt with.  These are the subjects of unemployment and housing.  Let me say at the outset that the Government have done fairly well in the way of providing houses for the people of the Free State.  I have listened to many of the speeches, but I think many Deputies have missed the real point. That is, the cost of building.  I maintain, as I have maintained for the last four or five years, that the question of housing shortage can be solved by the builders, the builders' operatives and the men who supply materials.  By the co-operation of these three parties, the housing question can be solved in a very short space of time.  I am not going into the question of the cost of building, but any man who knows anything about the business is painfully aware of the fact that it is impossible to build a house at the present time and let it at an economic rent.  The Government, I believe, have done very well by way of subsidies and other means in endeavouring to solve this serious problem, but I maintain that the housing shortage will never be solved by subsidies.  It is only by means of the co-operation of the three parties I have mentioned that this question of housing will be ultimately solved.  The same remark can be applied to unemployment. I say that unemployment will never be solved in this country, or in any other country, until the people of the nation as a whole are prepared to make sacrifices; in other words, a national sacrifice on the part of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are enjoying a standard of living in this country as if we were a rich country, which we are not.  It is about time that the fact was recognised that if the problem of unemployment is to be solved every man who can make a sacrifice should do so, because it is only by means of <Col N="144" /> a conservation of the wealth that will accrue as a result of these sacrifices that industries will be established and that those which exist in a languishing state will be resuscitated or enlarged.  Coming to the question of my own constituency, as far as unemployment is concerned I maintain that the Government could do much to relieve unemployment there, if the President would make representations to the Northern Parliament to have some of the inconveniences occasioned by the border removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Deputy raise that point on another Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, but I thought it was a question of general policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I only desired to ask the President to have some of these terrible inconveniences removed from the Border.  Dealing with the question of unemployment, as far as Dundalk is concerned, I must say that I am more or less inclined to lay the blame on the Government for the closing down of certain industries which formerly existed there.  One very fine industry existed there in the form of a distillery.  A very flourishing business had been carried on for years, but whatever happened in the negotiations between the Government and the representatives of that concern, the fact remains that the distillery has been closed for the past six or seven years, thereby throwing out of employment a few hundred men who were constantly engaged for a very long time in that distillery.  I think the Executive Council will admit that it is not good business to close down an industry in the Free State and to allow distilleries in other countries, particularly in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to send their products into the Free State free of duty.  I think it would be the duty of the Executive Council to take steps to prevent these people from having a monopoly of the trade in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I think it would be the duty of the Executive Council to take steps to prevent these people from having a monopoly of the trade of the Free State so long as they think it fit and wise to close down industries that formerly were carried on in the Free State.  Certain references have been made to the question of roads, and the Minister for Local Government said that his Department had done very well in the way of grants so far as roads are concerned.  I may tell the Minister that the farming community, as a whole, are not in a position to pay any increased rates in the future for the upkeep of roads. The Minister may state that the amount of money granted to the county councils is very large, but I would also remind the Minister that the revenue derived from motor taxation, as far as County Louth is concerned, is from £17,000 to £20,000 per annum, and that would pay interest and sinking fund on a very tidy capital sum.  So, after all, if the Minister makes a grant to the Louth County Council of £60,000 or £70,000 he is obtaining, by means of taxation on motors, the annual figure of £17,000 to £20,000.  I maintain if the Minister wishes roads to be kept up to concert pitch he will have to increase his grants to the county council, because the small farmer in the country will naturally say: &ldquo;The roads I was used to are good enough for me.&rdquo;  He is in a position to say: &ldquo;The old horse is good enough for me, and the ass and cart will take me to the market on any road.  I do not want these fine tarred roads.&rdquo;  If the Minister wishes to keep up these roads for the motorist he will have to increase the taxation on motorists, because I believe the farming community, and in particular the small farmer, judging by the price he has been receiving for his produce in the last three or four years, is not able to pay any increase.  In fact the natural tendency should be to reduce rather than increase, as it is at the moment, and has been for the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I would be <Col N="146" /> in order in referring to the question of drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <P>As it has been referred to, I would ask the President, or whoever is responsible, to speed up the question of the cleaning of the Rampart river.  This has been on the stocks for the last three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to drainage in general, and I was just mentioning this question of the river to draw the President's attention to it.  It would be the means of giving much-needed employment at the moment, and as I said before, it has been a long time in contemplation. As this is the proper season of the year for such work, I hope it will be started very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I have to state that if this question of employment is to be solved, all of us have to make a sacrifice, from the highest to the lowest, and if the provision of houses, as far as workers are concerned, is going to be speeded up, there will have to be a change also. We will have to realise that the cost of building at the moment is too high, that it is a financial impossibility for the present Government, or any other Government that may succeed it in the near future, to solve this problem.  The cost of house building must go down, and the sooner the better it will be for all concerned.  As workers at present are compelled to pay a weekly rent of 10/- for a single room, the sooner they will be provided with houses the sooner will the question of unemployment be solved.  The nation as a whole should consider it has a duty to give a hand in the <Col N="147" /> solving of this serious problem and not to leave it wholly in the hands of the present or any succeeding Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather reluctant to rise seeing that nearly everything that could be said on this Vote has been said.  I was wondering, and am still wondering, what is and what is not in order on this Vote. I think other speakers have so blazed the trail for me, that I can continue to be just as incoherent as many of the other speakers this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am urged to rise in any case because of the fact that I heard two speakers from the Fianna Fáil Benches making what I considered a veiled attack on the Labour Party, suggesting the Labour Party had no policy for unemployment. I want to suggest to the House that the Party which has stolen three-fourths of the Labour policy and programme and called it its own should be the last to upbraid the Labour Party for not having a policy for unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the most serious portion of my statement, I want to say, as far as Cork is concerned at any rate that whilst I agree there is some improvement largely, if not altogether, due to the great enterprise of Henry Ford, with the assistance of the Executive, who undoubtedly did something towards adding to the success of the firm's activity, still, there is a very large number of people unemployed.  One need only turn to the report of such institutions as the Vincent de Paul Society, and the returns from the Child Welfare League to understand the gravity of the situation.  In addition to what we might term the normal numbers of unemployed we have, owing to the reduction of personnel in the Army, a large number of young men turned adrift without any means of livelihood, largely made up of what is termed the unskilled class.  Many of them are not <Col N="148" /> trained to any occupation, the result being that they are in many cases in receipt of home assistance, and are, in my view, a menace to the community. I have before stressed the point on other Votes, particularly the Vote in connection with the Ministry of Finance, that something should be done by way of deferred pay or otherwise, so that these men, when leaving the Army, could maintain themselves for at least six months and could have a chance of getting trained in some useful occupation or, in the alternative, get into some of the unskilled trades.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by Deputy Coburn of a contribution and that should be made in the shape of a sacrifice, the sacrifice to come from all parties in the State.  As one who is always prepared to face up to economic facts, I would suggest that employers in the building trade should also face up to these facts. We, of the Labour Party, through trade unions in the building trades, have already submitted to a Commission set up by this House a very comprehensive programme which entails a certain amount of sacrifice so far as the workers in the industry are concerned.  Embodied in that programme was a suggestion which meant buying in very large quantities the materials used in the construction of houses.  Also embodied in the programme was a suggestion that you should have a continuous building policy for at least ten years, in order to house every person or nearly every person in this State comfortably and in hygienic surroundings. These proposals were placed before the Commission and many weeks elapsed before any contribution whatever came from the master builders of the twenty-six counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an answer to some suggestion made that a sacrifice ought to be made if we were ever to solve the housing difficulty in this country.  It is admitted also that if a national housing scheme was undertaken <Col N="149" /> in the proper spirit and on a scale that would meet the requirements of the people it would absorb a very large number of our unemployed. Another thing that makes for unemployment in this country is the large amount of imported wood work.  You have, in one of the suburbs of Dublin&mdash;on the Howth Road&mdash;building in progress.  On the woodwork which is going into these houses is the legend &ldquo;made in U.S.A.&rdquo;  No wonder we have unemployment.</P>
      <P>Not so very long ago we had to call attention in Cork to the fact that a Belgian or French firm got a contract for wheel-barrows.  The only thing Irish about them was that they were painted green, like our pillar boxes.  I have already said that I am not one of those people who want to set up a wail that this country is going to the dogs.  I am thankful and glad to say that the conditions in this country are improving and are going to continue to improve in spite of the lamentations and wailings of the grousers and grumblers.  Whilst saying that, I do believe that there is necessity, so far as this Vote is concerned, for the President to give very serious consideration to at least some of the views expressed in the course of the debate.  As I have already said, one does not know when he is in order or is out of order.  So many matters have been referred to and so many matters have been touched upon that I do not want to inflict upon the House many of the things that I would like to deal with.  I will reserve them for a future occasion. But I would urge upon the President that there were many things mentioned here to-night to which he should direct his very serious attention. The President is a man who has had very long practical experience of public work.  He has had very long experience of work in connection with Local Government and I believe that, party or no party, he will give the attention that is required and that is possible so far as this problem is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the case of imported woodwork.  I am not suggesting <Col N="150" /> that a tariff or anything of that kind should be placed on this class of imported woodwork.  At the same time it is one of the things that this House will have to take into consideration at a very early date. Numbers of our people engaged in that particular industry are being thrown out of employment from day to day.  We have again, as I have already said, hundreds of young men being cast adrift from the Army. Here again I want to come down to brass tacks.  We had, no later than last week, a discussion in this House as to the desirability or otherwise of continuing Haulbowline and of expending money on its upkeep.  We had people in this House who declared we want money on the one hand and we want employment on the other, and yet they voted for the closing down of Haulbowline which supported many families.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we want increased social services we should be prepared to foot the bill.  If the resources of the country cannot afford those extended social services then we should get ourselves into such a position by protective and constructive methods that we should be able to pay the expenses of those services.</P>
    <P>So far as the contribution of the Labour Party to this unemployment discussion is concerned, I think it will be admitted that nearly every speech delivered in this House this evening has been based on the utterances of the Labour Party for the last four or five years.  Nothing new has been added.  I do not want to suggest that I have added anything new.  I am simply making an appeal to the President, as the first citizen of this State, and perhaps, what is nearly as important, the senior member for Cork City, to take these matters into consideration.  I appreciate his valuable services to the public and social life of this country.  I believe he will take these things into consideration at a very early date.</P>

      <P>There are just two aspects of policy, and they are the aspects that have been dealt with most by the speakers here to-day, that I would like to refer to very <Col N="151" /> briefly.  Deputy Anthony referred to one of them and said that Fianna Fáil had stolen the housing policy of the Labour Party.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil have no policy.  If that is his defence of the Labour Party's policy on housing I hope his colleagues are satisfied with it.  Whatever our policy is or may be with regard to housing, I would like to put it to the President that, speaking of the area I know best and that he knows very well, that is the City of Dublin, I would certainly refute the statement of Deputy Anthony that there is any sign of improvement so far as this city is concerned.  I do not know what the conditions may be in Cork. Perhaps Deputy Anthony is right in saying that there has been a vast improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>And I hope he and his constituents are satisfied with the improvement, but I am speaking for the area I know, that is the City of Dublin, where the neglect of the poor, so far as housing is concerned, is a lasting disgrace to everyone, this House in particular, and by no means least to the President.  He knows the conditions here as well as anybody.  He knows them as well as any Deputy representing the city should know them, and the neglect that he in his official capacity as head of the State has shown for the conditions in which the poor of this city exist should bring a blush of shame to him every time he thinks about it.  He cannot think about it very often or else he would try to do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements of that kind are not new.  Like Deputy Anthony, I have not anything very new or original to bring to this debate.  But, in view of the conditions, when we are discussing a matter of this kind, it is the duty of a Deputy representing a constituency that is so badly hit <Col N="152" /> as the constituency I represent, to bring, in as forcible a manner as he can, before those responsible, the shameful conditions that he knows to exist.  It is a good number of years ago since the statement was made on official authority that there were twenty thousand families existing in one room in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

It is no laughing matter for the poor to have to exist under these conditions, and he ought to be the last to treat it in such a lighthearted way.  He can afford to treat it lightly now, when he has used the poor and their votes to climb into the position he occupies.</P>

      <P>I am on the question of housing and it is necessary to bring it, as forcibly as I can, to the notice of everybody who has any share of responsibility in the matter. In that way, I think what I have said is not out of order.  Twenty thousand families, and the number is on the increase!  Instead of decreasing under the Government over which the President presides, the number is on the increase in Dublin, at any rate.</P>

      <P>You will have your time to talk, and I will not interrupt you.  You can gibe at the poor if you want to, but I am not going to gibe at them.  The President did not gibe at them when he was using them.  The number is on the increase. I have it on authority that, instead of decreasing, the number is increasing year by year in Dublin. Seventy-eight thousand people living in one-roomed tenements in Dublin! And then we are told that Dublin is prosperous and that there are signs of improvement!  If that number had been decreased to any appreciable extent during the period that the President has been in control of all the powers, financial and otherwise, of this State, I would certainly be glad to give voice to any recognition that might be deserved by reason of such an improvement.  I do not take any pleasure in saying that instead of improving there has been anything but improvement in these conditions.  I wish it were otherwise.  I wish the President and his Government could tell us that that number had been reduced, even by one thousand or five thousand. It certainly would be something to their credit.  In 1918 the chief engineering inspector of the then Local Government Board told us that 29,500 houses were necessary in Dublin to house the poor properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 29,500 apartments or houses required to house properly the poor of the city.  Let the President change these figures any way he likes.  It is 29,500 residences required for the poor of the city.  What has been done in the <Col N="154" /> eleven years?  What has been done in the seven years that have elapsed since the President took control. without going outside the City of Dublin?  What has been done in the City of Dublin to improve these conditions? There have been, to give a generous estimate, 3,500 houses built out of the 29,500 residences necessary for the poor.  There has been an increased demand since that report was made.  If Mr. Cowan were reporting now, on account of the increase in the population of Dublin, it would not be an over-estimate to say that there were probably 5,000 more to be added.  Let us put it at 3,000 more.  That means that one-fourth of the population of the city are housed in unsanitary conditions. It is no credit to anybody responsible to say that in the capital, under the very eyes of the legislature, and under the daily notice of members of the Executive Council, the poor are existing in such scandalous conditions. In proportion to what is required, practically nothing is being done to alleviate these conditions. In the whole of the Free State, houses at the rate of 2,500 per year have been built in recent years. Probably 50,000 houses would be required for the whole of the Free State.  That is not good enough, considering how money can be spent on unnecessary luxuries.  Some of these luxuries were referred to in recent debates on the Estimates, but I would be probably out of order if I referred to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision of long-term loans for the building of houses.  During the last twelve months the question of long-term loans has been raised by different Deputies on several occasions, and we were told that it was impossible to provide the money.  The President, in referring to that subject and to the question of housing in general, said as recently as the 20th of March: &ldquo;It is the merest nonsense to say that money can solve the housing problem, and those who persist in saying that money can solve the housing problem know they are talking nonsense.&rdquo; Well, if money is not the principal <Col N="155" /> and the greatest obstacle I should like to know what is the greatest obstacle to the proper provision of houses, so far as this State is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations, I admit.  The cost of building enters into it to a large extent, but money is the primary consideration, and it is a very easy way to get out of it to say that money will not solve the problem.  If we had the money here, I think it would be very easy to solve the problem; and considering what we are spending money on, even in this State with the people taxed as they are, ten times the sum that is being spent at present could be spent on the provision of houses for the poor.  On the same date, or a day after, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health said, when he was speaking in the debate on this question of long-term loans and the provision of money for houses: &ldquo;We are invited to borrow at present a large number of millions of pounds at 5 per cent.  We would not be invited to do that by people shouldering any responsibility in connection with the actual borrowing or carrying out of the work.&rdquo;  Those of us who know the conditions and that have them up against our door in the City of Dublin know quite well what the responsibility is upon us in this matter. We know quite well what responsibility we would be shouldering, if we had the power and asked our people to borrow millions of money for housing.  We believe we would be doing the best work that could be done for the uplifting of the people by shouldering such respon-sibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at 5 per cent. for such schemes.  I believe if an earnest effort was made, the Government <Col N="156" /> stating the facts as they know them&mdash;and if they appealed to the people of Ireland for that money for the alleviation of the housing position alone&mdash;people would be prepared to give the money to the President and his Ministry to help to get the poor of the Free State in general, and of the City of Dublin in particular, out of the awful and disgraceful hovels they are obliged to live in at present.  I have that much belief in my own people.  I think an effort should be made to see what could be done in that direction, and put it in a way that would strike the imagination of those who could afford to put their hands in their pockets and help their helpless brethren out of the awful conditions in which they are exisiting at present.</P>
      <P>A statement appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; recently on another aspect of public policy, particularly in regard to the city of Dublin, one that the Ministry, no doubt, is fully aware of, and that is the &ldquo;startling increase,&rdquo; as the paper calls it, in the cost of outdoor relief in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; 6th June, says: &ldquo;A startling increase of £40,000 per annum in the cost of outdoor relief in the Dublin Union area was revealed to an &lsquo;Irish Independent&rsquo; representative who made inquiries on the subject,&rdquo; and the gentleman who gave the figures is Dr. O'Dwyer, Chairman of the Union Commissioners.  Presumably Dr. O'Dwyer, who has been in that office for a number of years, knows what he is talking about.  He said the chief cause is prolonged unemployment, which brings on sickness in family on account of want of nourishment.  That statement alone, issued by one of the officials appointed by the Ministry of Local Government administering Poor Law relief in Dublin City, is a condemnation of the present Free State Executive. They ought to have taken some drastic steps to meet the situation that is confronting them every day in the City of Dublin.  That statement alone is, to my mind, sufficient condemnation and proof of the ineptitude <Col N="157" /> of the Executive Council, presided over by the President.</P>
    <P>They have not made any sufficient effort to meet the awful situation that we here in Dublin know to exist.  If we were to speak out freely and candidly, we would have to bear out the statement of Dr. O'Dwyer and say that the conditions in Dublin are really appalling.  I do not know whether Deputies who represent Dublin in the President's Party are satisfied that the Executive Council and the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have done all that could be done for the last five or seven years.  I certainly am not.  I would give credit where credit was due if I saw an effort commensurate with the task made by the Government to meet the situation. Speaking of the conditions that exist in Dublin alone, the President and the Executive Council stand condemned and are proved to have neglected the task of relieving the poor or finding a method to give employment to the thousands of families that are now actually starving, or on the verge of starvation, in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the case that has been made by Deputies that improvement has taken place in the unemployment problem in this country, I contend the opposite is the case.  In my own county of Carlow, for instance, recently an industry has been closed down and a number of people have been thrown on the unemployed list. Then, again, the number of young men coming out of the Army owing to reorganisation has increased the numbers unemployed in the country. While we have this unemployment problem in the country, it will always be a source of weakness to any Government.  I believe, however, there are means at the disposal of the Executive Council, if they would only put them into effect, in connection with the development of rural industries and agriculture that would help to decrease unemployment. We could find, as a matter of fact, employment for all the people if we could break up the ranches, go <Col N="158" /> in for afforestation, drainage, road-making, and, of course, housing.</P>
      <P>We could employ all our own people around the country if we would only develop agriculture. It would not so much be the employment of hundreds as of thousands.  We could employ thousands in the production of our own butter, bacon, eggs, and those other things that agriculture is capable of producing. That would employ our own people instead of allowing all these goods to come in here and at the same time having our own people emigrating to other countries, the countries which supply us with these imports.  We, as a matter of fact, by our insane policies support these countries.  Unemployment is a source of weakness instead of a source of strength to any country.  While you have that problem in a country, you will never have that peace or contentment which is so much desired by every Deputy in this House.  Something will have to be done.  There is no use in waiting.  If you continue to wait, conditions will even get worse.  It is no good for a country to have people with no means to keep themselves and those dependent on them in any state of comfort.  I think the President will do well to look into this matter.</P>
      <P>There is no use in making points by one side of the House against another side of the House. There is nothing to be gained by political parties trying to score off each other in a question like this. We have had too much washing of dirty linen in this House for the last couple of years and it would be better if Deputies would discuss ways and means so as to meet this problem and get a solution.  I ask the President seriously to consider some of the things put forward in connection with agriculture which is so much neglected that it has become a source of weakness to the State and is not giving employment to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural worker is the worst paid and the hardest worked man in the country.  He is not getting a proper show.  Even when employed, he is not properly paid. <Col N="159" /> He does not get employment always because we have only 1,500,000 acres of land under the plough.  The unemployed are in a serious condition. Some of them are living in abject misery with nothing to eat and with very little clothing.  That statement of their position may appear farfetched but to any person who knows the real position in rural Ireland and who has some experience it is not an overdrawn picture.  Some consideration should be given immediately to this problem and the Dáil should not wait until it is too late.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy O'Kelly knows a great deal about the housing problem in Dublin &mdash;a great deal more than I know. One reason for this problem is that everyone in the country appears to think that the streets of Dublin are paved with gold.  They are all flocking up to Dublin.  The population of the Free State has not increased out of proportion to the increase in the building of new houses.  But I know that the population of Dublin has increased out of all proportion, and I do not know whether Deputy O'Kelly sees that that makes the problem, as far as the Dáil is concerned, and as far as every Deputy here is concerned, a very difficult one.</P>

      <P>However distressing this debate, which has extended itself over a long space of time and over a still larger variety of topics, is to those Deputies who are in a great hurry to have their holidays, it will have a valuable effect if it helps to improve the situation generally by getting the Government, during the rest from legislative work, to tackle the various questions that we have been discussing to-day.  It is true that a large number of the Deputies and the Ministers of the Executive Council are perturbed and worried by this constant reference to questions of unemployment. But the very fact that questions like them are brought up periodically here, and that you have had a number of Deputies speaking on them I think with sincerity and <Col N="160" /> with a belief that things can be done and should be done which are not being done&mdash;the very fact that you have that state of affairs after this Parliament has run two years of its life, and after all Parties except a very small section are now represented here, must give all true Irishmen cause for anxiety.  It must make us ask ourselves whether in fact this House is doing the work that the people expect it to do; whether, in fact, we and the Executive Council who rule here are worthy of the enconiums that we read so frequently in the Press, whether it is true this is a very prosperous country, that conditions are steadily improving, and that if people would only work hard, as they do in other countries, things would solve themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the slums of Dublin; Deputies have referred to the slums in the Gaeltacht; Deputies have referred to derelict farms in the country; Deputies have referred to industries that have closed down.  I say the Ministers who find themselves in contact with these different phases of the national life should get little charts hung up in their different offices, on which would be recorded the amount of employment given in the country and the number of industries, factories and workshops that have been closed down in their different spheres of activity.  The fishing industry has been almost completely blotted out; although two or three Commissions were appointed to investigate the whole question, nothing has been done.  The housing question has been held up by reason of the difficulty of long-term loans.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health believes he has found a new solution for that question by postulating a rate of 1/- in the £. I would remind the Minister, as Deputy Murphy has just reminded him, that the fact that you have a fairly prosperous population in the City of Dublin, drawing incomes out of all proportion to the incomes that persons in corresponding offices on the Continent draw, and that that and the number of motor cars which <Col N="161" /> have been so frequently referred to here, are not any indication as to what the conditions are down the country.  In fact, the more Dublin increases and prospers, the greater is the simple contrast between conditions here, as they appear superficially, and the conditions which Deputies on the opposite side, as well as on this side, know to exist in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>You have the small towns of Ireland, as a distinguished man of letters pointed out recently, threatened with extinction.  You have a Government here which insists on centralising, as I understand it, in its policy of selective protection, industries about the City of Dublin; in centralising in Dublin, as far as we can see, all the offices of the State and a great deal of the work which hitherto was carried out under local departments.  You have the transport of the country drawing the population and drawing the traffic of the country into Dublin.  Now, you have the Minister for Local Government and Public Health telling us, if the country towns and the farmers could only be got to face this question of 1/- in the £ on the rates, for housing, that perhaps subsequently that problem can be dealt with.  I say that you cannot increase the rates, or increase any other local charge until the Government that you have here first takes steps to increase the commercial activities down the country, until it takes steps to increase productivity, whether in agriculture or industry, and until it holds up its hands and says: &ldquo;We have this number of derelict farms in the country.  We are not going to have more.  On the contrary, we are going to see that every farm that is not worked will be, as far as we can help it, set to work within the next twelve months.&rdquo;  The same applies to the various offices and factories closed down.  We want to see the Government taking the attitude next session that these things are going to be remedied; that instead of having this centralising business going on the Government is going to say that <Col N="162" /> it is now time to give the country a chance.</P>
    <P>The country has the greatest sympathy with the problems of Dublin. Every Deputy here wants to see the slums removed and worthy dwellings provided for the poor.  But we have the fact that the rest of the country is threatened with depopulation. Certainly there is a wholesale exodus of the present population threatened.  We want to put a stop to that, and we want the Government to say, knowing they are going to get the co-operation and support of the House, that they are prepared to put their shoulders to the wheel and to remedy that state of affairs.  I do not want further to prolong this discussion.  I congratulate the various Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  I say that there is not a single Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, Local Government and Public Health, the Fisheries Department, or the President's Department, that is not deserving of censure.</P>
    <P>We want men of vision and imagination here.  We want men who are not tired and who do not make every effort at the end of a session in order that they may have a holiday or that certain supporters of theirs, as the daily Press tells us, may have a holiday during the month of July.  We are told that this House is going to close down and finish its labours just for that reason.  We want to have the feeling before we break up that these problems which are troubling every one of us and that we all have at heart are being attended to by the Executive Council, and we want to feel that the Executive Council is doing its best to remedy matters. One problem which, in my opinion, overshadows all others is how to establish some policy or some economy in the country that will give the rural population and the population in the smaller towns hope that there is some other place in the Free State besides Dublin, some other place worthy of consideration, and some other place for <Col N="163" /> which a genuine policy ought to be formulated here.</P>

      <P>I just want to state that some time this afternoon I mentioned that I would give certain references before the debate closes. I have those references now.  Deputy O'Kelly has given one reference with respect to the Minister for Local Government.  I know that the Minister mentioned five per cent.  I will make it quite clear that the Minister's objection was not based on 5 per cent., as he would like us to believe now, because immediately afterwards when the phrase was quoted he made another remark which, perhaps, I had better read for the House:&mdash;&ldquo;We are invited to borrow at present a large number of millions of pounds at five per cent. We would not be invited to do that by people shouldering any responsibility in connection with the actual borrowing or carrying out of the work.  That is the policy.  We must transfer a large portion of whatever loss there is going to be for the provision of houses for the working classes on to the shoulders of the ratepayers.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious from that, that it was not the five per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of five per cent. is material.  We were asked to borrow a large number of millions at five per cent. and to start building houses by means of State machinery at a time when the different sections in the House here argued that the whole business of house building was bankrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My only remark to that is that if that were in the Minister's mind on that occasion he would be just as well able to make his point then as now.  The fact is that he was not, and it was another point he was making.</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig stressed very much the fact that a large number of the Deputies on this side of the House were anxious to get away for their holidays.  If the Deputy is not aware of the fact <Col N="164" /> that a great number of his own colleagues on the opposite benches are very anxious to get away for their holidays, he is indeed making a great mistake.  Everybody else is aware of that fact, and everybody else knows that the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches are as keen on getting away as he declares Deputies on this side of the House are. Everybody knows that there is just as little anxiety for work on the part of the Deputies opposite as there is in any part of the country.  We have every evidence of that here.  The leader of the Party made two quotations, and when he was making the quotations he had neither of them before him.  The time of the House is therefore wasted in order to give Deputy de Valera an opportunity of making explanations at the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a statement which was a correct summary of a statement made by the Minister and I was then asked for the quotations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was asked for another quotation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he did not have it at his fingers' ends.  Neither did he tell the House that what he quoted was only portion of a statement made by the Minister.  He did not tell the House that the Minister went on at great length to explain the Government policy.  The mere quotation of a single sentence from a speech made here by the Minister was about as incorrect a method of giving expression to his view as it would be possible to get.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is meticulous in his exactitude with regard to his own statements and with regard to the interpretation put upon his statements by people outside, and very often he goes to great length in the columns of the newspapers, and by way of speeches here and elsewhere to give explanations of what he said on different occasions.  It would be well if the Deputy abided by the terms of the Gospel: &ldquo;Do unto others ....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly is another example of one of those who addresses himself to a subject without making any study of it.  Then when he is laughed at in respect of some faux pas he makes he declares &ldquo;You are gibing at the poor,&rdquo; the poor being represented by himself; he is the poor.  Nobody I ever heard of in this country, no Irishman, has ever gibed at the poor.  The Deputy's statement in that connection is not worthy of him, and not worthy of a representative of this City.  I will have a little gibe at the poor Deputy.  Speaking on the Housing Bill&mdash;and I overlooked this on the last occasion out of charity to the Deputy&mdash;he said: &ldquo;This Bill makes available a sum of £200,000.  That will not go very far in helping to solve the problem, and £50,000 along with it would be required, at least, in the next five years in Dublin City alone, to do anything like what would be adequate to meet the need of the next five years, at any rate, for housing the working classes and the poorer classes in Dublin.&rdquo;  Did anybody ever read greater nonsense than that?  £250,000 in five years! Deputy Lemass laughed when he heard that statement.  I looked across at him and shook my head and he smiled, as much as to say, &ldquo;Go easy with him when you are replying to this.&rdquo;  And so I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on, we had the Deputy's solution for the housing problem.  It really shows that he did not make a study of the matter, for he said: &ldquo;I suggest to the Government that within the next five years they should raise a sum of £2,600,000 a year. <Col N="166" /> That would be £13,000,000 in five years.  Of that amount, they should give one-fourth, £3,250,000, or thereabouts, in grants.&rdquo;  After telling us that we would require £250,000 for the next five years, and that that would be an adequate sum, he immediately multiplies it by fifteen, forgetting what he had told us a few minutes before.  I submit that this is the type of study reflected in these quotations.  If the Deputy thinks that I am doing him an injustice, he can read the book.  Sometimes in a circus, if there is any question of doubt about a matter, someone says, &ldquo;Let us see what the book says.&rdquo; The book in this case is against the Deputy.  I asked subsequently, if the Government were to give £3,250,000 during a period of five years and houses were erected at the Deputy's own computation of between £400 and £500 each, what sum would the municipality be asked to contribute towards the scheme.  The same amount, namely £650,000.  That would mean 11/- in the £.  That is the great national scheme for housing in the City of Dublin.  I hope that Deputy De Valera when looking for people to adorn his Front Bench will get people who will pay more attention to facts than has been shown by his second in command.  The Deputy spoke of 3,500 houses.  The actual figure is 5,394.  The Deputy was a member of the Dublin Corporation from about 1905 and, going back thirty years before that time&mdash;the first date on which the Dublin Corporation entered on housing&mdash;the total number of houses provided up to the year 1922 was 2,251.  If I am charged with having neglected the housing problem in Dublin I can show that in the seven years since we took office we have provided two and a half times more houses in Dublin than were provided in the previous forty years.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce on that occasion said: &ldquo;It is not the function of this Dáil to provide work, and the sooner that is realised the better.&rdquo;  Further on he said: &ldquo;To state broadly and definitely that the Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country is giving the Dáil a function which it has no right to take on itself.&rdquo;  I am speaking not only to the Leader of the Labour Party and to the Leader of Fianna Fáil, but also to the theologian who addressed himself to the subject last week, and I advise all persons concerned to read the whole speech made by the Minister on that occasion, and to read his speech made on the following day. The Minister stated on the 30th October, 1924, in regard to unemployment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unemployment was the problem, and the only cure for it, as I said previously in this House, is employment.  The question is how to increase production, how to increase the activity of industry, and how to increase it particularly in such a way that labour would be employed, not wastefully on roads and relief schemes, but in its normal occupations.  That problem faced us last Easter, and certain lines of attack were developed to meet that problem.  We have followed along these lines since.  The situation has, however, recently been complicated by one other event, that there has been, partially, we believe, a failure of the harvest and an almost complete failure of the fuel supply in the poorer districts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the following day, 31st October, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" />&ldquo;The other point raised by the Deputy was a very serious matter; it was founded rather on the ver balism to which other people object.  He took my phrase of last night when I said, and said very definitely, that I believed it was not the function of the Dáil or of the Government to provide employment, and I stressed that point.  It was a negative answer, and I stressed that negative answer.  I said it because I was answering a very definite statement made by Deputy Morrissey, who said that the population of this country was small and that the Dáil ought to be able to provide employment.  I want to stress this point, that there is no State control of industry here, and to that extent I have nothing to take away from the words I used last night.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is irrepressible. The Minister, continuing, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not the function of the Dáil directly and immediately to provide employment.  I did say that.  I used the same phrase last night to indicate that certain pressure could be put on people, that certain tendencies could be developed and that certain adjustments in the fiscal system could be made so as to ensure, as far as we could ensure without interfering directly with trade or enterprise, that there would be more employment; but beyond that we cannot go; we cannot for the moment enter into the field of State interference or State control of industry. There is a great deal of State interference at present, but you cannot go to the point of State control&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Johnson: Does the Minister repudiate any responsibility for securing that opportunities for employment shall be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: No.  I think I have already stated that anything <Col N="169" /> that can be done to see that employment will grow, and that employment will be provided for those eager and willing to work, that we will do.  I made a statement last night of the approach of my Department to the problem by unemployment insurance, relief schemes, and certain remedial measures to foster trade and industry, and if there is anything that is missing from the chain which I revealed last night, I would like to have the gaps shown to me, and I would like to have further links put into my hand to forge into the chain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very different statement from the two statements we heard from two responsible Deputies here, knowing that they were speaking to the Dáil and to the people of the country.  If I were a stranger to the country listening to the debate and hearing those statements I would say that it was either a poor House or a miserable country.  These are the statements which are impeding progress, industrial expansion and business here as much as anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall now refer to the methods adopted for providing employment.  Direct employment has been provided by:&mdash;(a) (1)  Office of Public Works on buildings, drainage, etc., provided employment during each of the past four years for an average of 4,000 persons.  This included certain special relief works, such as internal painting, to relieve seasonal unemployment. (2) Defence Department.&mdash;In addition to the 5,500 whole-time officers and men, and the payments to 7,000 reservists, the Army provides employment for 400 civilian tradesmen, chefs, waiters, and miscellaneous unskilled workers. (3) Department of Local Government and Public Health.&mdash;Roads: In the last five years grants to local authorities for the improvement and upkeep of roads, repair of damaged bridges, amounted to over 5½ million pounds.  In addition, the local authorities expended about 7 million during that period.  Returns for the period of 2½ years to-date show the number of men employed by direct labour on roads and bridges to average 16,113 per month.  The <Col N="171" /> State grants pay 1 out of every 2 men on repair of trunk roads; 3 out of every 10 men on repair of link roads; 10 out of every 11 men on improvement of all roads.  (4) Industry and Commerce.&mdash;On the Shannon scheme and the Electricity Supply Board, though there is considerable variation from time to time in the number at work, the average, over the first six months of the current year, was 5,500 men in continuous employment.  (5) Lands and Fisheries.&mdash;In the five years ended 31st March last, £1,371,000 was spent by the Land Commission on improvement of estates and on special works.  These works were largely undertaken in places where and at times abnormal unemployment prevailed.  The figure includes materials, but in work of this kind a very large proportion of the money goes in wages.  Fisheries.&mdash;Department of Fisheries have given direct employment to 87 men for about 20 weeks in each of the past five years. About 1,000 girls are given employment in knitting, lace-making, and embroidery in the 34 industrial centres maintained by the Department. Most of these are part-time home workers.  (6) Agriculture.&mdash; Forestry: The forestry operations of the Department provide employment, varying with the season of the year, from 240 to 520 workmen. The planting programme has been considerably extended in recent years.  It is anticipated that further contemplated extensions in the programme will afford continuous employment for an additional 50 men each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Indirect encouragement for employment has been provided by:&mdash; (1) Office of Public Works.&mdash;Under the Land Loan Service, loans amounting to almost £500,000 have been sanctioned.  It is not possible to obtain accurate figures as to the amount of employment afforded out of these encouragements to building farmhouses, out-offices, etc., but it is estimated that about 300 men per annum are employed on this class of work.  (2) Local Government.&mdash; Under the various housing grants to <Col N="172" /> private persons and local authorities approximately 16,000 houses have been provided in the last five years, the unexpended balance will provide a further 3,500 houses.  The number of persons given continuous employment during the period may be roughly calculated at 1½ persons per annum for each house built, say, 4,800 persons.  The opening of the Local Loans Fund for financing schemes for local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts will greatly stimulate the activities of these bodies and provide further employment.  If one takes Dublin City alone, 4,379 houses have been provided or are in course of being built.  About 1,700 people have been continuously employed in this work.  (3) Industry and Commerce. &mdash;It is estimated that the various tariffs imposed have increased the employment of Irish workers by about 12,000 persons, while the facilities afforded under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts enabled about 2,000 persons to secure employment.  (4) Lands and Fisheries.&mdash;In the last 5 years 600 fishermen have been assisted to obtain appliances such as boats, nets, and other gear.  Schemes are in contemplation to secure increased employment in inshore fishing and to contribute to the development of deep sea trawling, as well as for an extensive building programme in Gaeltacht areas.  Steps are being taken to revive the homespun industry in Donegal, to extend this to other parts of the Gaeltacht, and to put the rural industries in the Gaeltacht on a sounder and more extensive footing.  (5) Agriculture.&mdash; Schemes for improvement of agriculture provide employment for farmers and increase production generally. Beet Sugar in addition to the extra farm labour which it provides has given employment to approximately 600 men during the manufacturing season which lasts between 5 and 6 months, and to between 120 and 180 people during the off season.  Incidentally, increased employment is provided for carters, bag-makers, etc., apart from the employment afforded in the building of the factory.  The policy of the Government <Col N="173" /> Contracts Committee of giving preference to Saorstát manufacturers has resulted in many contracts being retained here which would otherwise go abroad.  The figures are not very large in themselves, representing perhaps, £100,000 in wages during the last five years, but the importance to small firms of securing these contracts to keep them going is considerable.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, for yourself, sir, you were not here during the whole of the debate.  It ranged over a long period.  I am held responsible for events so far back as the time of Wolfe Tone. Deputy de Valera did not go back so far as that but he criticised the policy of my predecessor in 1922.  I do not know that that is altogether within the ambit of my Vote on this occasion, but I venture to say that most of the charges made against us of having lowered the flag and having been on the run from the British, having surrendered, and so on, have come from a Party whose most distinguished characteristic in the last few years has been &ldquo;Cease fire&rdquo; or &ldquo;Haul down the flag.&rdquo;  I regret that.  I would like to see a Party opposed to me so that I could cheerfully leave office, satisfied that the dignity, the status, and the business of the country would be well maintained. and whose fighting spirit would be at least second only to my own.  That is one of the things which make me most depressed&mdash; when I consider what is going to <Col N="175" /> happen when this Ministry leaves office, and who will replace it. Amongst the criticisms of the Vote, it has been stated that the amount has been increased to £11,973. I was charged by Deputy Dr. Ryan with having an extra higher executive officer.  My impression is that the Vote is too low, that the office is not sufficiently manned, that the personnel is overworked from top to bottom, and that, if at any time there is a change, the Vote will be certainly largely increased.  There is no person in that establishment who has not done overtime without payment.  All the work in connection with the Department has increased from year to year.  We have lately been handed the baby of unemployment.  It is not our child at all.  It is handed round.  Deputy O'Connell fathered it this year, and Deputy de Valera will father it next year.  The office is undermanned and I anticipate an increase in the Vote.  My notes here are so voluminous that it would take a much longer time than I have at my disposal to deal with them.</P>

      <P>Deputies have all night.  I shall not occupy very much of it.  Deputy O'Connell says that our policy is too slow.  In connection with the same thing, we have the criticism that the Minister for Local Government when borrowing money last March, announced from the Ministerial Benches that we did not consider it good policy to borrow money.  There was every indication that the price of money was going to increase, that the discount rates would be increased. Occasionally, I see hangers-on of the Party opposite, or other people who do not know anything about finance, addressing themselves to the subject as if it were something which this or any other country could control. Last year, the Bank of England was most anxious to reduce the bank rate in order to help industry, but the fluctuations in the money market in Wall Street compelled an increase in the Bank of England rate in <Col N="176" /> England.  Was any Englishman small-minded enough to say, &ldquo;We are controlled by Wall Street&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I am thinking on Irish lines, and have been doing so all my life.  I am not by any means impressed by the fact that other people are depressed because things cannot go well; we must go to someone else.  We got views on all these matters by very expert bankers from as far away as the United States and Australia.  They considered our banking situation here and advised us.  If I were to take the advice of Deputies opposite on this question of banking, I think I would be advised in the first place to bring in an Act to restrict banks from raising the bank rate of interest when every other bank in the world is doing it.</P>

      <P>I think I qualified the statement I made by saying &ldquo;Some hangers-on or other persons like those.&rdquo;  One particular gentleman who was presiding at a meeting at which very distinguished members of the Opposition were present, stated that we were controlled by British finance.  Deputies opposite often make such a statement.  I heard Deputy Flinn say that there was a stranglehold here.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not there.  I did not see the report.  I do not read everything the Deputy says, and even if I did it would not change my view that the person who puts his money in a bank has as good a right here to get his rate of interest as a man in England or in America who puts his money into a bank.  Last March, every indication that could possibly be given was given in the money markets that money was tight and that there would be a difficulty in borrowing.  Directly that situation eased, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and myself had a conference in connection with local loans for housing.  It was the one thing that stopped it.  I believe, in a moment of weakness, I conveyed to a member of this House that he might not be uneasy in his mind, that it was possible we would be able to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exactly the same policy has been followed in the last four or five years with regard to the credit of this State.  It is established.  It is on a sound basis.  That basis can be very seriously affected in a very short time by any administration. Borrow in respect of a service from which there is no return and the credit of the country is diminished. Borrow in respect of services for which repayment will not be made and the same thing will happen.  All those things are known by financiers and to our own people who have their money in the banks and who cannot lend their money to any administration <Col N="178" /> which does not show that it is capable of using it to the best public advantage.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Coburn was the one that addressed himself most to the fact that in respect to any service one must get value for money spent.  Deputy Lemass said that we have to approach this thing in a straight line.  Money has got to be put into circulation.  Somebody has to pay for it.  If the ten thousand pounds or whatever it is cannot be met, if there is not good value for it, if the purpose of the expenditure is not justified, it will all come back and have its reactions.  In respect of our administration here for the last seven years, every possible attention was paid to getting value, as far as we could, for every service and those who addressed themselves lightly to housing ought to look back seven years and see what it cost to provide a house in the City of Dublin.  It cost £750 seven years ago, and we can get practically the same house to-day for a shade over £500.  Would it have been good business, when there was unemployment, to borrow and spend £750 and leave to people for the next fifteen or twenty years to pay back the service of a debt in respect of which value could not be shown.</P>
    <P>A great advantage to the Party opposite, as I often said, is that they have such an example before them in respect of administration and that if ever they do get responsibility for administration, they will have very few precedents that are not sound, sensible and creditable.</P>
    <P>The one person on the Fianna Fáil Benches who addressed himself very sensibly to this question of unemployment was Deputy Lemass.  He only went off the deep end where it was clear he had not experience of administration, and that is quite an understandable proposition.  It was not on this occasion alone but on other occasions that the Deputy laid it down that we should get value for money.  Seven years ago, building was at a standstill; practically no building was being done.  One need only go through any part of the <Col N="179" /> country at the present moment, as far north as Donegal, as far south as Kerry, and even to Wexford, where Deputy Corish said they were not able to bear the burden of increased housing, and one sees housing all over.  It took some time to nurture that and to improve it, and the situation now, compared with seven years ago, is one which is much more easily dealt with than was the position at that particular time.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera addressed himself to the question of imports and exports.  If his statement is read&mdash; and probably his own supporters occasionally read what he says&mdash;it will be entirely misleading.  There was a figure of £19,000,000 which he omitted from the exports and a figure of one and a half million pounds from the imports which he might reasonably have added.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and it was a matter which was corrected directly my attention was drawn to it.  The Deputy should remember that the first time he made a speech here he made a withdrawal when I pointed out to him his mistake. There was a full and complete withdrawal in my case.  I always put the true facts before the people.  If my attention is directed to any mistake in connection with any statement, written or otherwise, I will correct it like a man.  The Deputy will remember that after the facts were explained he said, &ldquo;I withdraw.&rdquo; The Deputy went on to say that there are 246 people in this country drawing £374,000&mdash;£1,300 each.  One does not get a position like that in the service of the State without certain qualifications.  If those positions are not available in this country, there is a market elsewhere for the most brilliant of our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If I heard them I would reply, but, unfortunately, they were made in the Deputy's own particular patois and I do not quite understand it sometimes.  Several Deputies have addressed themselves to the fact that this is a dominant question.  We know it is, but very few addressed themselves to the method of dealing with it in such a way that it would no longer be either a question or a problem with us.  The policy of the Government in connection with it has been to do whatever necessary public works there are and to make it easy for local authorities to do whatever necessary public works there are, to place the least possible burden on either the ratepayer or the taxpayer, to stimulate industry, to eliminate waste and, generally, to improve every service of the State in such a way that the wealth of the country will increase and that there will be, in consequence, more employment. We are invited to embark on schemes which are hastily conceived and ill-digested, and which are not likely to add to the <Col N="182" /> wealth of the country, and are merely palliatives.  The list I have read out of employment which has been given here is practically unknown to the man in the street, and practically unheard of by most electors of the country.  Yet it is a list which forms a very sound and sensible explanation of the Government's policy for the last five or six years.  We could have, perhaps, cut a much better figure if, instead of that a couple of millions per year were voted to the relief of unemployment, which, the Deputy knows, would be an expensive and wasteful method of dealing with it.  Unemployment is not peculiar to this country.  In proportion to the population, the problem in this country compares favourably with the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Both of these countries are more highly industrialised than we are, and nobody will deny, as far as Great Britain is concerned, that it is a much richer country than this is.  Taking the average number registered as unemployed in the months of March and April and May as a percentage of the total population, we find that the figure is .65 in Saorstát Eireann. as compared with 2.7 approximately in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I know as much about it as it is possible for me to <Col N="183" /> learn.  The average number registered as unemployed in this country during the months I have mentioned, March, April and May, is 19,428.  It is quite true that that figure does not cover the total number unemployed; there are people, such as agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and persons who have exhausted their benefits, to be added. The same is true of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, not, I will admit, to the same extent, but it is true nevertheless.  It may be agreed that the relative proportion of unregistered to unemployed is, for various reasons, smaller in those countries than here.  Definite figures as regards the total extent of unemployment will not be available until the Census Returns are complete. Even then, for various reasons, the Census figures will require adjustment before a proper figure can be given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We are probably dealing with different figures.  What I am dealing with is the total number of persons registered as against the total number unemployed.  Your figure is a percentage of the total insured persons.  An estimate was given in the Dáil from the Labour Benches that there were between 80,000 and 90,000 persons unemployed. They do not make wild statements.  These are the figures they mentioned within the last few years.  I am taking that number. Supposing we take the figure 85,000 for the purpose of argument, the percentage of unemployed as against the total population in Saorstat Eireann would be about 2.8 as compared with 2.7 for the registered unemployed only in Great Britain.  I hope I have made that point perfectly clear.  Agricultural labourers are not registered over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The 80,000 they mentioned included agricultural workers.  If it did not, of course, that will alter the situation.</P>
      <P>I believe that they made the biggest case that they possibly could make when they said between 80,000 and 90,000. Assume that the figure is correct and compare it with the register of unemployed in Great Britain.  The figures regarding the average number registered weekly as unemployed, while they cannot be regarded as giving complete information will, at least, serve as a basis for comparison as between one year and another in regard to the state of unemployment.  Deputies will admit that.  An examination of these figures shows that there has been a very material drop within the last four years.  These figures are borne out by the increase which has taken place in the total contributions in respect of workers in employment. Deputies, if they look at the Estimate for this year, will find there a sum of £5,000 more in the way of a contribution towards the unemployment fund and for special schemes.  It will be admitted, in dealing with the question of unemployment, that there will always be casual unemployment.  There will be certain people in a process of transition from one job to another, there will be a number of people drawing sick benefit who are unable for the time being to work through illness, and there will be the more or less vagrant class whose aptitude for work is not of a normal order.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a little beyond the scheduled time to-night. There will be seasonal unemployment in certain trades, and these aspects of the situation do not readily lend themselves to a solution. When you add an unusual number, that does become a problem of some magnitude.  In times of abnormal distress we have resorted to special relief works.  Deputies know that our experience has been confirmed even by themselves, and that special <Col N="185" /> expenditure so undertaken is generally unremunerative and uneconomic. Consequently, we have been more concerned to provide employment on constructive work calculated to produce permanent assets, or to facilitate the provision of new avenues for permanent employment. The measures which we have taken, most of which I have read out, such as the Shannon electricity scheme, the tariff policy which we have pursued, our large expenditure on roads and housing, have been dictated by these considerations.  There are other considerations which people are sometimes apt to forget in discussing the problem.  One is that there has been a considerable increase in the general standard of living since before the war.  In many cases, wages have increased more rapidly than the standard of living without a compensatory increase in output, and all these factors contribute in some degree towards sending the weaker vessels to the wall.</P>
      <P>There are just a few figures that I wish to give before concluding.  The average number registered weekly as unemployed in 1925-26 was 30,031; in 1926-27 it was 23,394; 1927-28, 21,841; in 1928-29, 22,500. At present the average number registered as unemployed amounts to 19,713.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we have not gone to the full extent of our quota.  I want to say one word on housing in conclusion. Deputy O'Kelly said that the sum of £250,000 was required for five years. In the last seven years Dublin has got the sum of £108,202 towards housing.  5,394 dwellings were provided at a very big cost and are not enough to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>I suggest in all seriousness that Deputies, by reason of their position, get the worst side of affairs in the country.  They naturally get complaints. Nobody who has been in a representative capacity ever had a call from a business man to say: &ldquo;Business is fine; I never did as well, but do not tell the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;  No, it does not happen.  My office is almost a refugium peccatorum with letters showing what hard cases there are in all parts of the country.  Deputies have had the same story.  There are complaints one way or another.  From what I have said to-night, Deputies can go back to the country and throw their chests out and say: &ldquo;We are proud to be Irishmen, although we forgot it for a long time.&rdquo;</P>

As regards the question raised by Deputy Davin, that was not my child.  I was asked to set up that Committee, which undertook to provide a solution.

Another point, the President suggested I said that £200,000 with £50,000 added was all that would be required in the next five years.  If the President will read my remarks again he will see that what I said was that £200,000 was being provided by the Bill introduced this year.  Bills have been introduced every year since 1925 for a number of years providing for houses.  This year the sum of £200,000 was provided.  I suggested that £50,000 more would be required. That is £250,000 per annum.  Was that £250,000 to be spent in the way provided by the Bill in 1929?</P>

      <P>Before the House accepts this Vote I would like to have an explanation of Sub-head CC. &mdash;Repayment to British Government of cost of audit of Royal Irish Constabulary Pensions, Civil Superannuation, etc., for which £600 is asked.  My recollection is that in dealing with the question of superannuation and allowances under Vote 16 last year the Minister informed the House that he had not any audit conducted of the British Government's accounts for the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions, that in fact no audit was made on his behalf; and now we find that there is an item of £600 here in respect of such an audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee is slightly misinformed.  Statements have been made and have been published in previous Reports of the Public Accounts Committee that the Comptroller and <Col N="194" /> Auditor-General has the right to investigate the audits of these accounts. With regard to the general question, on this Vote I would like to urge upon the Minister for Finance that there should be set aside every year during the Summer Session at least one day for the discussion of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee dealing with the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  We are now, I think, approaching a period of normality; the work of the Public Accounts Committee is concluded within the financial year and the Report is issued.  I think it would be advisable for the President or the Minister for Finance, if it could be done, to arrange that in the Summer Session of each year one day should be set aside for the discussion of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee dealing with the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I think some vague promise was given to Deputy Ryan some time ago as to discussion of the Reports of the Committee of which he was Chairman, but since then we have heard nothing more about it, and I would be glad if the Minister for Finance would give an assurance that in future years a fixed practice would be established with regard to the discussion of the Report of this Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of consulting a copy of Hansard of last year; but the position is that, in respect of these accounts and in respect of certain other accounts, we accept the report of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General and the British Treasury accepts the certificate of our Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I stated last year that we have the right to have these accounts examined by the officers of our own Comptroller and Auditor-General. That right has not been exercised, but it may be exercised at some future date.  In the meantime, the audit is done by the British Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, I have no objection <Col N="195" /> to using my influence to have a day set aside for the discussion of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, though personally I do not believe that such discussions, generally speaking, from the little experience we have had, are likely to be of very much value.  As a matter of fact, we would probably get on to some sort of controversial point connected with the matter, and time would be taken up in that way, and I think that generally it would be a waste of time.  That is my own personal opinion.  I am prepared, as one person, if Deputies want a day, to use my influence to have a day granted for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Minister has just said, I would like to point out that Deputy Ryan, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee last year, has already asked the President to set apart a day for the discussion of the Report of the Committee, and the President has agreed to set such a day apart as soon as Parliamentary time suits.  I do not think, as far as my recollection of last year goes, that the debate was conducted in any sort of partisan or controversial spirit, or in any spirit except that which was proper to the subject under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's statement as to the repayment to the British Government of the cost of the audit of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions, I do not think it completely justified him in making this payment to say that while officers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General here do not examine these accounts, but instead accept the certificate of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General, the British reciprocate by accepting the certificate of our Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of moneys which we expend on their behalf, because a very important difference in the accounts is involved. I think the amount which is disbursed over here by our Exchequer on behalf of the British <Col N="196" /> Government is comparatively small as compared with the amount for which we are responsible to them.  I do not think that what we have got to secure recoupment from the British Government amounts in all to a couple of hundred thousand pounds at the very most, whereas in our case, even under one sub-head in Vote 16, we have to repay them over £1,170,000, and under another sub-head over £120,000.  I do not think, in circumstances like those that the mere fact that the British and ourselves have a reciprocal agreement justifies the Minister in continuing that agreement, and in asking this House to repay to the British the cost of the audit of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions account.</P>
    <P>We have got to remember, as a matter of fact, that the whole attitude of the British Government in regard to the Royal Irish Constabulary at the time of the Treaty was a very peculiar one.  They did not allow that force to come under the control of the Provisional Government at all; they retained it under their own control.  Possibly they had good reasons for that.  Possibly they wished the members of that force to feel that they were still their servants and were still their agents, and that they would remain their servants and their agents when they were paying them their pensions, even though we are only an intermediary in this case for the passing of Irish taxpayers' money into the pockets of the British pensioners. It is quite possible that the British Government had very good reasons for the course which they adopted with regard to the Royal Irish Constabulary.</P>
    <P>It is just a possibility&mdash;I do not state it at all as beyond doubt&mdash;that the British are paying to ex-members of the R.I.C. pensions which are not justly due to them, even under the terms of the Treaty or any subsequent arrangement which the Minister may have made with the British Government.  I do not think, under all the circumstances, that we are justified in accepting the audit <Col N="197" /> of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General in this matter.  It is of the utmost importance that these accounts, considering the very large sum of money involved, should be subjected to an independent examination by an officer of our Government and not by an officer of another Government which, at any <Col N="198" /> rate, may be interested in expanding the amount to be paid to its pensioners. In view of these circumstances, we cannot, I think, accept the explanation of the Minister and, accordingly, we on this side of the House are prepared to vote against the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater part of my speech on the Report Stage of the Finance Bill dealt with certain aspects of income tax administration. I do not propose to keep the House very long discussing this Estimate, but I should like to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Finance, that it had not been the practice to impose penalties in cases in which false or incomplete returns of income had been made to the British authorities prior to the change of Government in 1922.  I accept what the Minister has said, that it was not the policy of his Department to impose penalties in such cases, but, at the same time, I must say that since he made that statement I have received from very many and very responsible quarters representations that the Minister's statement was at variance with the facts; that actually penalties had been imposed in regard to incomplete returns made prior to 1922.  It has also been pointed out to me that it has been the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to use the threat of penalties in regard to income tax returns to compel taxpayers to make a full disclosure of their income over a considerable number of years prior to 1922; going back in many cases to 1914, and, in one case, I have been informed, going back actually to 1886.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, there are a number of other aspects to which I think attention should be directed.  First of all, I should like to know what action the Commissioners have taken arising out of the High Court decision in the case of Spain v. the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  In that case the Special Commission, acting on what the High Court declared was an erroneous view of the law, refused repayment to a claimant.  The court held under the Statute that they could not override or reverse the decision of the Special Commissioners in the matter, but, at the same time, expressed the view that the Special Commission should reconsider its decision, although it could not be compelled to do so.  I should be glad to know from the <Col N="201" /> Minister what action the Special Commissioners have taken in regard to that case.  I ask that question because I know that in other cases the Special Commission has no hesitation in acting harshly and even illegally.  As an instance of that, I take a case which occurred in 1927 of a wine merchant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was prior to 1927, and I am anxious to know whether the Special Commissioners still persist in a course of action condemned, in no uncertain terms, by the judges of the Supreme Courts, for in that case the Special Commissioners overrode the ordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Estimate for 1928.  The Deputy cannot go back to what happened in 1927.  I think the Deputy is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  I was going to mention the case simply because I wanted an assurance from the Minister that a practice which was condemned was no longer carried out.  Of course, there may be the possibility that the Special Commissioners, owing to that judgment, have modified their attitude.  But I am informed by those having many dealings with them that the general view-point of the Special Commission is that it is a tribunal that has powers of overriding, and does habitually override, every statute in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am not allowed to deal with that, there is another aspect of income tax administration to which I think attention should be directed. In Section 202 of the Act of 1918, which is one of the special provisions applying only to Ireland, I think, any appeal to the High Court upon a decision of the Special Commissioners on claims of repayment is precluded.  Now, in the case of companies, particularly in such cases as Guinness, in respect of taxes paid by them on Irish profits, the Revenue Commissioners take the view, I believe, that although such companies <Col N="202" /> are registered in England, but earning their profits in Ireland, the tax paid by them on their Irish profits cannot be recovered by shareholders in Ireland who are entitled to exemption or abatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we will have to abandon that.  There is one other matter to which I think attention ought to be directed, and that is the attitude which the Revenue Commissioners adopt in connection with <Col N="203" /> Customs import duty.  I believe in some cases the Customs authorities have refused to accept the declared value of goods imported, and have required a deposit to be made to cover the disputed duty claim before the referee's court.  They are entitled to do it under Section 3 of the Customs Consolidation Act of 1836.  Under that section, as amended by the Finance Act of 1929, they are bound forthwith to refer the matter of disputed value to the decision of the Treasury referee, and to repay any excess of the amount deposited over and above the duty as so decided.  Cases have occurred in which, the deposits having been exacted, the Customs authorities have proceeded to a reference, and have withheld deposits for a period of years.  I understand that custom prevails, and I would like to know what justification there is for it.  The Customs authorities, having refused to accept the declared value of the goods, and having required a deposit to be made, proceed to take the matter before a Treasury referee, and to repay any excess of the amount deposited over and above the amount of the duty as determined by him. I am informed it is the custom of the Revenue Commissioners to act in the way I have described, and I would like to know from the Minister what justification there is for that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that a number of cases that I cited to-night, particularly the case which occurred in 1927, and also this question of the rejection of claims for repayment by small income tax payers, no longer hold, and that the position as described to me no longer obtains. At the same time it would seem among the general body of the tax-payers&mdash;I suppose it is natural that the taypayer should take this view&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners seem to have regarded it as their function to do more than merely collect the revenue to which they are entitled by law.  They would seem, as a matter of fact, to seek to increase the revenue by <Col N="204" /> straining any statutory provisions which would give them any advantage or a lever over a taxpayer.  I do not think that is a proper view for the Commission to take of its duty.  It should act in a more or less judicial capacity, and should endeavour to act justly as between the taxpayer on the one hand, and the State on the other.  It should act entirely within the law, and not in any way attempt to strain the statute as against the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The feeling among a considerable body of taxpayers is that the income tax authorities particularly are going to unjustifiable limits in their efforts to collect arrears of income tax.  I have in front of me a statement signed by a person who declares that in the present year a sum of £3,313 has been demanded from him by way of excess profits duty for the years 1916-1920.  Income-tax amounting to £865 has been demanded from him in respect of the years from 1914-1927.  In this case the Revenue Commissioners have demanded altogether from this taxpayer a sum of £4,178 17s. 0d., plus compound interest at 5 per cent. and a reasonable sum in respect of mitigated penalties.  My correspondent informs me that in 1927 he went to the income tax authorities and gave them particulars of all sources of income, and gave them authority to get his bank returns.  He states: &ldquo;As my premises and books were burned in 1920, I am unable to dispute the above figures.  I may also mention I was out of business for nearly three years, but I am taxed as if my business was carried on as usual.  I have offered to pay all tax due to the Free State since it was established, but this offer would not be considered, and I am still willing to pay them, but if the arrears demanded are recovered, I may close down my business.&rdquo;  It would seem to me the Commissioners are acting here with undue harshness.  This man's premises and books were burned in 1920.  Income tax and excess profits duty have been demanded from him for the years prior to 1921-22.  They have also demanded <Col N="205" /> from him interest at five per cent. and a reasonable sum in respect of mitigated penalties.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Commissioners feel themselves justified in going back to the years prior to 1921-22, particularly in view of the fact that the man's business premises and books were burned in 1920, and he was out of business for nearly three years.  Surely it is hard to justify going back prior to the date upon which this man's premises were burned.  The Minister told us that penalties are not being imposed for making false returns in respect of the years prior to 1921-22.  In this case, according to my informant, he went to the income tax authorities in 1927 and made a full disclosure of all his sources of income, and gave them authority to get bank returns, although he himself had no books available for the years 1920-21.  I think, having regard to the general view which the public take of the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners are acting at present, that they are straining the law.  In some cases, especially in the case taken to the Supreme Court but which I will not be permitted to refer to, they are over-riding the law, and their action has been condemned in no uncertain language by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>I think before we allow this Vote to go through we are entitled to have from the Minister some assurance that in collecting revenue the Income Tax Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners will give more consideration to the taxpayer than hitherto they have done.  He is generally, as we know, a very patient beast of burden.  But there are times even when the camel's back will be broken.  The Revenue Commissioners have proceeded with such extreme hardship that firms have been made bankrupt and have had to seek the protection of the courts, as Mr. Joseph Reed did some years ago owing to the demands of the Revenue Commissioners.  The purpose of the Revenue Commissioners is of course, to collect revenue.  At the same time they should not behave like the man who killed the <Col N="206" /> goose that laid the golden eggs.  They ought not to proceed to execute the taxpayer or the taxpayer's business in order to get the pound of flesh. I feel that in view of the very general complaints which we have received from taxpayers of all classes and of all political parties as to the present manner in which income tax is collected in this country, that we would not be justified in asking the Dáil to pass this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain activities of the Revenue Commissioners were reviewed on the debate on the Finance Bill.  There are certain activities which I am anxious to draw the attention of the House to now, and if I take some time in doing that, I think the cases I am submitting to the House demand that.  I want to know, first of all, whether the Minister is aware of what is happening in certain cases of which Deputies here are informed fairly regularly. I think that some of us, at any rate, have come to the conclusion that it is useless to make any representations whatever to the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the cases under their notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding very much further it seems to me that it is with difficulty that officials of the Revenue Commissioners are civil when representations are being made to them. It seems to me that certain activities of the Revenue Commissioners are nothing less than the systematic persecution of the people.  I am going to substantiate that statement by concrete cases of which I can give details here to-night.  The thing looks like an attempt to harass people.  I want to show the House that assessments that are illegal and unjust, and that could never be sustained, are enforced because the Commissioners are dealing with unfortunate people who have no knowledge of their rights, and have no means of employing assistance in order to assert their rights.  The first case I have here is that of an unfortunate constituent of mine who was assigned by an uncle of his a farm of 66 acres, two-thirds of which is not considered arable.  In the <Col N="207" /> assignment of this holding provision was made that during the lifetime of a sister of the man to whom the land was assigned maintenance should be provided out of the holding for that person.  The assignment was made several years ago.  I understand that the deed by which the assignment took place was drafted in a hasty and, I think, in a faulty condition. The result of that is that this man, in 1929, is being asked to pay £35 succession duty for suceeding to himself, because that is really what it amounts to, for several years ago the land was assigned to him.  During the lifetime of his sister she enjoyed certain privileges on the land.  The holding was really in the possession of the same individual during the whole of that time.  Eight or nine years afterwards the Revenue Commissioners come in and demand £35 succession duty.  I want the House to hear what the parish priest of the parish in which this man resides has to say about this case.  He writes: &ldquo;He is very poor; he has but two cows; all his stock and chattels are not worth the sum demanded by the Revenue Commissioners.  He has applied to the Agricultural Credit Bank for a loan to help him to stock his land.  The poor man has not the means to engage in a lawsuit against the Revenue Commissioners, but if he had he would probably be defeated on the technicality that he did not appeal against the assessment. He thought this claim was made because of some error in the office, because the claim is patently groundless.&rdquo;  In this case the Revenue Commissioners offered no solution except that a writ has been served on the unfortunate man and he is faced with the possibility of the wretched roof over his head at the present time being sold in order to satisfy a payment of this kind.  It seems to me, in view of the local opinions that I have heard offered in this case, that if this man were able to complete the appeal notice when he had an opportunity of doing so that there could be no foundation whatever even in law for a claim of <Col N="208" /> this kind.  I wish the Revenue Commissioners joy of the victory that they will achieve when they take the remaining cow off the wretched holding of an unfortunate man whose last penny is going in order to sustain his family on that particular holding.  That is one instance of the activities of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Within the last week the particulars of a case were handed to me where two constituents of mine purchased two houses in 1920.  Since 1920 they have discharged all their liabilities for the tax on the two houses concerned.  They purchased them under an assignment that contained a clause indemnifying them against claims on the property up to the date of the purchase.  Nine years afterwards it is discovered that the person who held the houses prior to the purchase by the persons I have mentioned owed property tax. The persons concerned, who have always discharged their obligations to the Revenue Commissioners, are now faced with the possibility of having their furniture and goods seized to satisfy a claim of that sort. I do not know that the legal aspect of that case would stand investigation either.  But whether it would or not, I think there is not equity or fairness in treatment of that kind. These are people who could not be considered people anxious to evade their responsibility in any way.  I grant you that the task of the Revenue Commissioners is not an easy one.  I do not expect very much humanity from the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with these cases; but one would expect people would get a fair deal, and that advantage would not be taken of their ignorance of their rights to mulct them.  It seems to me assessments are being made regularly by the Revenue Commissioners that could not be sustained in law, and there are certain activities on the part of the Revenue Commissioners that are nothing less than legalised blackmail of the people.</P>
    <P>I come now to another case, the case of a man who was recently decreed in the District Court in my <Col N="209" /> constituency for arrears of income tax.  I am in a position to know that the assessment was outrageous.  I made representations to the Revenue Commissioners, not that the sum should be reduced in any way, but that that particular person would get time to meet the decree against him.  I do not think that there was anything unreasonable in a request of that kind.  I complain of the fact that I had to address a second letter to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners before I got the courtesy of a reply.  The usual stereotyped answer was given that the Commissioners could not interfere, as the matter was decided by the court.  The Commissioners are in a position that they can put a respectable person, a decent citizen, into prison and can break him up.  They will not receive any revenue as the result of this action.  On the other hand, they can, as they ought to, arrange reasonable terms by which the money would be accepted over a certain period.  Is there any reason why terms of that kind could not be accepted and an adjustment reached in that fashion?</P>
    <P>The facts of another case were sent to me within the last few days, the case of a working man in West Cork.  So deserving was his case considered that the Winding-up Committee of the White Cross Association, in the last few weeks of their existence, granted him a certain sum, having regard to his condition and what he endured.  He has no means whatever. Again, the assessment of the Commissioners was ridiculous.  The man found himself in the District Court, and was mulcted for a sum which he had no way of meeting and which he should never have been asked to pay.  If the facts were known, it would probably be found that he was assessed because of certain local factors which I have no desire to bring into this discussion. The Revenue Commissioners have also something to do with old age pensions.  Deputies from West Cork are familiar with a case there which has engaged the attention of the Revenue Commissioners for some <Col N="210" /> time.  It is the case of a claimant who irregularly obtained an old age pension some years ago.  Portion of the money was refunded afterwards, but the claimant, on reaching 70 years of age, realised that a certain portion of the money was still unpaid, and so she refrained from making a claim.  She claimed a pension, however, when she reached the age of 73½ years, but the Commissioners held up the pension and seriously suggested that she should go on for 3½ years more, and they refused to give her credit for the time since she became legally entitled to the pension.</P>
    <P>Is there any real defence for an attitude of that kind?  Have the Commissioners any desire to approach matters of that kind from the standpoint of fair dealing to the parties concerned, or are they simply a machine anxious to grind the last farthing out by any means, proper or improper, legal or illegal, from the type of people I have mentioned? I have other cases, but I will not repeat them at the risk of wearying the House at this late hour.  In connection with the administrations of the Entertainment Tax, certain extraordinary anomalies in the decisions of the Commissioners come under my notice from time to time.  I was responsible for making an application to the Revenue Commissioners some time ago for exemption for a certain concert that was taking place on behalf of the local band.  I do not complain that that application was turned down, but I do complain that an application for exemption from the very same district on behalf of an entertainment which was got up to improve a certain building in the district I come from was granted.  I can prove that that entertainment was exempted.  I want to know where discrimination comes in or what facts, local or otherwise, impelled the Commissioners to refuse one application and to grant another. I raised the matter in the House.  The President was here to answer, and a deliberately evasive answer was put into his hand.  I <Col N="211" /> could not question the President, as he had no knowledge of the activities of the Revenue Commissioners. I was informed that if I supplied certain particulars the matter would be inquired into.  The Commissioners were aware of the point raised, because I had challenged them in the course of correspondence upon the matter.  I can prove deliberately that, whether at the instigation of a local officer or not, certain entertainments, not one whit different to the entertainment I referred to, were exempted.</P>
    <P>I suggest that before money is voted to the Revenue Commissioners to continue harassing people in this respect there should be a full inquiry into the whole position.  I know that the Minister is anxious to be fair in matters of this kind, and I think he should inquire into the case I refer to.  I have not exaggerated nor painted the case in any way.  I have confined myself to the facts.  I raise the matter not with any pleasure but because I regard it as a duty and because people from different parts of the constituency have urged me to bring forward cases of the kind.  I think there is a clear case for inquiry. I re-echo what has been said already, namely, that there is a tendency to override all considerations and all laws very often.  I do not know if the Minister agrees with that action.  I intend to vote against the Estimate in the absence of some satisfactory explanation or some assurance that the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in this direction will be reviewed and will cease, and that people will get an opportunity of making a fair case and getting a square deal when they come under the harrow of the Revenue Commissioners in future.</P>

      <P>I suppose nobody expects the Revenue Commissioners to be popular in any country.  They have work to do which is not pleasant, but I should like to know if they received special instructions in regard to income tax to export the last penny, and also in what percentage <Col N="212" /> of cases do they accept the returns honestly made by taxpayers. From my experience of cases that have been put before me, it seems to me that in a large percentage of cases the assessment is made much higher than is justified by the returns sent in by the taxpayers.  In some cases the extra assessment may be one pound or two pounds.  You can, of course, go before the Special Commissioners and plead your case. Many neglect doing so, while others might not think it worth their while losing one or two days by doing so, and they prefer to pay.  I have known cases in which that was done. There is one taxpayer whose circumstances I know intimately, and last year he paid £1 5s. extra rather than go before the Special Commissioners. He said it was better to pay than to have it questioned.  I am perfectly certain that the amount was not owing and that there was no justification for it.  I mentioned a case of assessment last year, and as it is still going on I suppose it would not be out of order to mention it again.</P>
      <P>That is the case of John Finn.  It was agreed by the representative of the Commissioners down there that he was not liable for income tax. The following year on the same income&mdash;I saw his books, and I went through them very carefully&mdash;he was assessed in a considerable sum. He demurred, naturally, but did not go before the courts in Galway and had to pay.  He is still being assessed on that figure.  He was assessed for a large amount of income tax when a new officer was appointed in the district.  I wonder whether there is any law or any specific basis by which a man should be declared not liable for income tax by one officer, and should be declared by his successor liable for £300.  It certainly seems strange.  It is perhaps necessary that the decisions of the Revenue Commissioners should be ineluctable, but in arriving at these decisions they should be very careful and be more inclined to deal justly with the taxpayers than it strikes me they are at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he has received resolutions from the Cavan County Council as regards a certain road in the county.  This question has been raised on several occasions before.  It has been going on since 1927.  This road is the old coach road from Dublin to Enniskillen via Belturbet and it has been the means of penalising the people of Belturbet town very severely.  The border line comes along half a mile outside the town and the people there are not allowed to bring across merchandise of any kind.  A shopkeeper some time ago was supplying cement for the building of a chapel across the border and because he was a trader, he was compelled to take a round of almost forty miles in order to get to this chapel which is only a mile outside the border.  I think that is unduly penalising our own people.  If it were done to prevent other people from coming in to trade here, something might be said for it, but here are our own traders who are not allowed to bring any stuff across the border.  In the same way, if a man in the town wishes to buy a sheep, he has to get the farmer from whom he purchases to bring it in.  He is not allowed to bring his cart across the border because thereby he becomes a trader.  That gives a lot of annoyance to many people, and we can ill-afford to annoy people in that way.  I would be glad if the Minister would do something in this matter because resolutions have been passed in reference to it, not alone by the County Council, but by the Belturbet Urban Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which I wish to call the Minister's attention is that at the present time a person has to cross the border line before nine o'clock unless he gives notice to the Customs officer beforehand that he will be crossing later when the Customs officer is generally willing to wait.  I think that during the summer months, at any rate, the time might be extended until nine o'clock. Supposing, for instance, my colleague. Deputy Major Myles, wished to go to Bundoran or to Ballyshannon, <Col N="214" /> and that he is kept here in the House until three o'clock or until a later hour in the afternoon.  He cannot cross the border after nine o'clock without giving notice to the Customs officer, because he has to pass two barracks&mdash;one at Clones and another at Ballyshannon.  I think the Minister might consider the advisability of making the time ten o'clock instead of nine, especially during the summer months.  Another complaint which has been brought up here by my colleagues refers to dealers coming across the border.  In the border counties we are dependent altogether on Northern dealers who come across the border.</P>
    <P>Attention called to the fact that a quorum was not present.  House counted and twenty Deputies being found present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that we in the border counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan are altogether dependent on Northern dealers who come in there.  If they are hampered in coming in to buy our cattle, the cattle will be left with us.  If it happens that they do not come in, the farmers can take their cattle home, the result being that the Land Commission cannot get their annuities from these farmers.  I think some consideration should be given to these men.  After all, they come in not to take money from us, but to leave us money.  Most of us know as business men, that when we are going to get money we should give every facility to the people who are giving that money to us.  I think it is a great drawback, and certainly means a considerable loss to the farmers in border counties that this tax is imposed on dealers coming in.  The question has been raised in the House several times before, but it is no harm to raise it again, and I hope it will get some consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the other side of the picture which Deputy Cole has presented to us.  I think the Minister should tell us whether it is not a fact that an altogether abnormal <Col N="215" /> amount of time is spent by the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the question of difficulties which arise in connection with the import of certain dutiable goods across the border.  To my own knowledge there has been a huge amount of correspondence during the past twelve months on that subject.  There is a great deal of money belonging to Saorstát traders in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners at present, some of it in the hands of the Commissioners for a very long time. What is the purpose of all this trouble?  Is it an effort to facilitate Northern Ireland and Great Britain in getting their own goods in here on the easiest possible terms?  Is it not an effort to carry out a Sinn Fein policy there to the detriment of Saorstát trading?  My knowledge is confined to motor-cars, and therefore I can see no excuse for these difficulties, if it is not covetousness on the part of the British manufacturers and traders in Great Britain and Northern Ireland generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual method with regard to the sale of these cars is to give the concession to one or two traders in the Free State.  Here we have in the case of several cars that are very popular here the concession for certain Free State counties given to a Belfast wholesale firm.  There can be no purpose in that except the merest covetousness-give as little as possible to the Free State trader and get as much as possible for our own people.  The assessment of cars because of claims made by the Free State importer causes a great deal of trouble and correspondence.  We here object to all that trouble.  We think there is no need for facilitating that traffic here.  It is bringing no good to the Free State, and, on the contrary, what ought to be done is to assert that the Free State has the right to the wholesale profits of these goods and not the traders in Belfast or Great Britain, as the case may be.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that he is not going to put up with any more of it; that there is a quick and ready method <Col N="216" /> of dealing with that, and a much less expensive method than the present method is proving.</P>
    <P>In the same connection, I think the Minister might tell us what is the system of checking claims for preferential duty on dutiable goods imported from countries, say, like Canada. I understand it must be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that 25 per cent. of the work done on such goods is done within the Empire.  It seems a bit of a mystery to some of us how the Revenue Commissioners can be in a position to prove that.  Is it their practice to accept the statement of the exporter, or have they any method of checking fraud in connection with this matter? It is asserted in another country that fraud is being carried on, and, of course, if that be the case, the revenue here is losing a certain amount.  We would like some information on that matter; and, again, we would like to know is it the intention of the Free State Government to adhere to the 25 per cent. basis which has heretofore ruled in regard to the giving of Imperial preference.</P>
    <P>I think during the past twelve months Canada has decided that there must be 50 per cent.  Empire manufacture in any goods for which the preference rate is claimed on import into Canada, and there would seem no reason why we should adopt lower rates.  Again, it has been suggested in connection with raising the woollen tariff that this method will be tried for securing the preference there.  A great deal of very cheap material is being imported at present from Germany and CzechoSlovakia, and possibly from one or two other European countries.  That material would be very likely treated in England and exported to this country, where the Imperial preference rate would be claimed.  Is it the intention in that case that a mere 25 per cent. would be sufficient to justify the granting of that rate? These are questions on which we would like some information, and I hope the Minister will give some satisfactory reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surprising what thrills one can get out of investigations in income tax.  For quite a time past everyone accepted the totally wrong point of view that what used to be called Crown debts could not be statute barred, and under this false impression the Revenue Commissioners collected an enormous amount of tax to which they were not entitled at all.  On looking up the law of the matter I discovered it in a book which has been accepted as an authority for a great number of years.  My edition of the book is 1916.  It is a book which has been satisfactorily used by many firms.  I refer to Pratt and Redman's book on income tax.  Dealing with claims for back duties we find this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Claims are sometimes made by the Revenue authorities for back duties which, through inadvertence or otherwise, have not been paid for a period of years exceeding three.  Such claims, since the power to make additional assessments or surcharges is limited, as above pointed out, are restricted to the three years preceding the year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to listen carefully to what follows: &ldquo;The sinister method of threatening proceedings or penalties for inaccurate returns and to enforce irrecoverable debts has been discredited by the courts.&rdquo;  Now, as to the first thing, of course the three years have been extended by the 1925 Act to six years in all cases except in cases of the estates of deceased persons. This shows the attitude of the people who first imposed income tax was that an income tax debt was not even on the same footing as an ordinary contract debt.  Whereas a man was obliged to pay contract debts going back six years he was only obliged to pay income tax debts going back three years. Now it became a sort of moral law that we had to go back nearly one hundred years if the Commissioners liked to take us back that distance until it came out the other day <Col N="218" /> in the course of a debate that the Commissioners could only go back six years.  It has worked some inequitable proceedings during the last three years, cases in which not merely were the people unfairly treated, because the Revenue Commissioners were acting on laws which did not exist, but also because the people themselves have been landed in a state of almost absolute poverty.  I know myself the case of a man who had a business in Dublin. He was very progressive before and during the Great War.  He was the only man, I think, in Ireland that time who was cutting gears for motor cars, and owing to be succession of wars in the country his overdraft became too great.  In the end his estate had to be administered, and one of his great difficulties at present is the claim for back duties made by the Revenue Commissioners. I hope the Minister will look into this particular case.  I can give him the name of the particular person.</P>
    <P>He has been extraordinarily brave through the whole thing.  Although in a state of absolute poverty, he has always managed to keep a courageous front.  He is a man who did some service of a curious kind for our common cause during the Black and Tan period.  He happens to be the man who gave the rifle to Kevin Barry.  I hope the Minister will look into the case of this man and see that no further claims are made against him with regard to the past, because it might make the difference ultimately for him of starvation or not, if these claims are not pursued.  One is struck by the iniquity of having collected an amount of income tax which was not due, but unfortunately the individual cannot proceed against the Revenue Commissioners because it has been a mistake of law.  Whereas he might recover if it was a mistake of fact, he cannot pursue it if it is a mistake of law.  At the same time, if there was a particular case where the Revenue Commissioners actually put a man in jail under their system of body-warrants for not paying taxes <Col N="219" /> which they had no right to claim, I am not at all sure that that individual has not got the right of action against the Revenue Commissioners for false imprisonment. Again, as regards income tax experts who misled people as to the law, it is not at all certain that individuals could not have rights of action against income tax experts for having misled them.  The situation is a serious one, and probably in a couple of years we will have the Revenue authorities bringing in an Indemnity Act to cover the situation.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Finance very sensibly agreed to arrange for a certificate to be given in respect of property which would be transferred where income tax had been paid, so as to prevent a recurrence of claims for income tax.  It was for the purpose of facilitating the sale and transfer of property.  It has not worked out very satisfactorily, because the certificate is delayed, sometimes for three months and sometimes longer.  I would suggest that the Minister should inquire to see if the machinery could not work a little more quickly in this matter, because, after all, where it is a question of sale of property rapidity is fairly essential.  The law is slow enough as it is, with examination of title and that sort of thing, without increasing the law's delays like this. Under the Finance Act, I meant to ask the Minister when he was bringing it in if he would undertake to have an examination as to the possibility of having drawbacks given on motor-parts which would be imported into this country to people who would undertake to make the motor cars.</P>

An official inquiry might be fairly considered an administrative matter.  I merely wish to know when he will be likely to say what he will do about this matter.  While it is a small matter, this question of delay is a very serious one.  For that reason I would like him, if he could, to limit the time which such inquiry would take, so that traders could know and make their arrangements accordingly as to when it would be likely that something concrete would be done.</P>
      <P>As regards the system of body-warrants, here again it is a matter of administration until the law is changed.  I would be glad to know whether he is going to instruct his Department not to exercise their powers with reference to body-warrants from this time onwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gave a direction that this power is not to be exercised it would certainly case the situation until such time as a law is passed to deal with it.  I would suggest <Col N="221" /> to the Minister also that he should give a direction to the Minister for Justice that a certain practice should be stopped, and that is that certain English firms dealing in bicycles make policemen the agents for those bicycles, very much to the detriment of Irish-manufactured bicycles.  I think it would fairly come under the province of the Minister for Finance to arrange with the Minister for Justice that if there are any such agencies they should be for Irish bicycles and for no others.</P>
      <P>Speaking generally, I would try to encourage the Minister not to be dominated by his experts.  Henry Ford gave very wise advice about that.  He said: &ldquo;I never ask my experts what I can do, because if I do they will always tell me I cannot do anything.  But I tell them what I want done, and I tell them it is their business as experts to find a way to do it.&rdquo;  I suggest if he would take up that line it would be greatly to the good of the country.  There have been discoveries, and there are prospects of discoveries in the region of finance which will be as surprising and of as great advantage as discoveries which have been made in the region of electricity.  One might sneer at that, but one can sneer at some recent discoveries in electricity.  As in the case of medicine and surgery, a great deal has been discovered in that matter during the war owing to war exigencies.  So a great deal has been discovered in the region of finance, and I would suggest that the Minister should open his mind to these discoveries and adopt the same attitude towards experiments in these matters and inquiries into them as the Minister for Industry and Commerce did in the matter of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see that the practice of using penalties in order to go back for taxation will be dropped altogether.  Really it is so unfair as to court illegalities on the part of the ordinary citizen, because the natural reaction in the average citizen, when he finds that laws are being administered in a harsh and tricky manner is that he will be as <Col N="222" /> tricky as possible; he will have no respect for the law and will try to defeat it at every hand's turn.</P>

      <P>When this discussion opened, I had not intended to take any part in it.  I thought, and still think, that it is hardly fair to shy a number of individual cases at the Minister for Finance, and ask him, without notice, to answer them straight off.  So as not to take him at a disadvantage while the House was discussing the delinquencies and shortcomings of the Executive Councill, I retired to the library and put down for the Minister five questions which I hope he will answer next Wednesday.  These relate to the shortcomings in regard to the collection of income tax.  I could have put down a great many more questions. I do not want the Minister to answer those questions now.  I am raising this question now because I do not want it to be said that I allowed this opportunity to pass of saying that the methods adopted by the income tax collectors in this country require very much to be improved upon.  They have given rise to universal dissatisfaction.  The clouds are gathering on the heads of the Commissioners, and the day is fast approaching when public opinion will force them to alter the methods they have manufactured and are now putting in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard my colleague from West Cork refer to individual cases, some of which I am personally aware of, I could not refrain from joining in this discussion to corroborate him as to the facts in the cases he dealt with and as to the truth of which there can be no answer whatever.  Deputy Murphy gave us a case founded on the state of the law.  Perhaps he will pardon me for saying that that case does give rise to difficulty.  From the letter of the parish priest which he read, it is apparent that the legal position is difficult, and it may be that in order to deal with it the Department of Finance will require to <Col N="223" /> have the law altered.  Therefore, I would not press that case beyond stating the fact that it is a very hard one.  As to the facts of the case, I have no doubt that Deputy Murphy has stated them clearly.  The Deputy referred to another case dealing with income tax.  This was the case of two occupiers who bought their holdings in 1920, and from 1920 to 1929 they paid their income tax regularly and without default.  What happened?  Let us get rid of all this talk about income tax being collected only over the last six years. At present income tax returns are being asked for over a period of 40 years, and in some cases over a period of 60 years.  I have seen some of these demands myself.  Let no one on the Opposition benches, or in any other part of the House, tell me that demands for the payment of income tax only go back over the last six years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene to correct the Deputy?  I never suggested that income tax had been demanded only over the years subsequent to the passing of the Treaty. As a matter of fact I mentioned a case in which the assessment had been dated back to the year 1886, and in which payment of the tax had been demanded in respect of all the years since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if unconsciously I did Deputy MacEntee an injustice.  At all events, at the present time, demands for the payment of income tax which go back, not over six years, but upwards of 40 and 60 years, are being sent out.  In the case to which Deputy Murphy refers, the demand was sent out a few months ago for the first time. It was made against the two people concerned in respect of the years from 1914 to 1920.  When my firm wrote to the collector begging him to wait for a few weeks until the matter was put before the Commissioners, the answer that came back from the collector was that he could not wait; to-morrow he would have to proceed to that particular town and destroy those concerned with <Col N="224" /> costs.  That was not enough.  He coupled with that the threat that he would issue a warrant to the sheriff. Even these two threats were not enough.  He made a third threat against these unfortunate people, who owed no income tax, by saying that he would have to take proceedings. These are acts of hardship and of oppression, and, though I dislike using the word, threats of blackmail. That is an unpleasant word; a word which ought not to be applied, certainly not to the Department of Finance, because I am satisfied, as I think everybody is, that the Department of Finance would be the last Department in this or in any other Government that would in any way sanction the methods that are being used if the facts were known to the Minister.  The Minister will know about them sooner or later. The time will come when they can no longer be suppressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister now, but I will ask him at another time whether by a motion before the House or in some other form, to state under what statute the collectors of income tax are authorised to send around threats to people for the payment of compound interest on arrears of income tax from the year 1914, and in some cases interest at 5 per cent.  When the Minister is answering that question I ask him not to take a mere denial until he has got someone in authority who will tell him that such demands have been made.  When he does that I will prove the charge home for him. I give him that undertaking.  I understand that there is no statute that authorises that.  If it comes out that an official has suggested or hinted at a charge of 5 per cent. compound interest, or even simple interest, on arrears of income tax, or on arrears of income on which tax is not chargeable, then I will ask the Minister for Finance, with every confidence, to deal with that official or with those officials in the only manner in which they should be dealt with, that is by clearing out the Augean stable and getting rid of them.  That is what should be done <Col N="225" /> if that has taken place, and I am afraid that the Minister will find that beyond any doubt it has taken place.</P>
    <P>There is one other method which the Commissioners for Inland Revenue have adopted, and which I hope to deal with on Wednesday next.  They have hit on a new method of torture.  This method is being peculiarly applied to the unfortunate taxpayers who live in my constituency and in the adjoining county of Kerry.</P>
    <P>They have established in Dublin Castle an inquisition for the interrogation of taxpayers upon whom they have designs, and forth from Dublin Castle go to the remotest portions of West Cork and the County Kerry summonses to attend for interrogation before the supreme inquisitor who reigns in Dublin Castle.  I want to ask, with very great respect, the Minister for Finance to make quite sure and take note as to whether that new method of procedure has been set up.  I ask him in fairness to these unfortunate taxpayers to find out under what statute, or by what excuse, this outrage has been committed on these people.  They have been dragged away from their homes and have had to travel up to 400 miles to sit for interrogation before an official in Dublin Castle. Who is going to pay them for the expenses they have incurred, and pay for the loss and inconvenience caused by being away from their homes and business when they should be trying to save up something to meet the next income tax demand.  I do not want to say anything unreasonable, but I do say that if a scandal like that is found to exist, then it ought to be dealt with very firmly and very quickly. The confidence of the public in the Commissioners of Inland Revenue ought to be restored, and it ought to be as strong as it is in the Ministry of Finance itself.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which, I think, is hardly fair.  I know an instance in which a trader has passed his accounts year after year.  He is frequently before the Special Commissioners <Col N="226" /> of Income Tax.  He has been there accompanied by his auditor.  I have seen them there.  The auditor has been interrogated.  His accounts have been passed, and his experience has been accepted by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, and yet in 1929, under the procedure followed, but which I could not follow, that unfortunate man has been told &ldquo;You must get another auditor.  We are not satisfied with the auditor, whom the Special Commissioners have hitherto accepted, and with whom they profess themselves satisfied, and we want you to get another auditor.  We are not satisfied with the academic qualifications of the first.  He must produce his degree, and go back to 1914.&rdquo;  They throw on this unfortunate man the burden of the expenditure of some hundreds of pounds for the purpose of producing accounts some fifteen years old, and which now would be at the best unreliable, and to a large extent a fake.  Deputy Murphy spoke of the difficulty he had in getting civil replies from some of the income tax officials.  I must congratulate Deputy Murphy, because he says he has succeeded in getting them.</P>

A month or two ago a notice of the hearing of appeals was sent around West Cork, stating: &ldquo;You have to come up here on the 5th June and attend at a place and hour to be notified later.&rdquo;  Every man jack of these appellants was there waiting in fear and trembling for the 5th June.  No other business could be taken on or around that date.  They were there in readiness to know at what hour and place they were to attend on the 5th June.  Lo and behold!  the 4th June came and the 5th June, but not having the same <Col N="227" /> confidence in getting the civil reply that my friend and colleague did, they started wiring to their solicitors begging them for God's sake to know what was to happen.  The collector would not take the trouble of telling these people that they would not be heard on the 5th June.  They are only ordinary taxpayers; why send them a postcard?  What harm did it make to issue summonses to people and then treat them with the utmost contempt?  I ask the Minister for Finance, if he finds that is the conduct which his Commissioners and the income tax officials are pursuing, to deal with it with a heavy and no uncertain hand.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the last period of just twelve or thirteen months, I have known two prominent West Cork men, and I have followed them to their last resting place.  They went there, according to medical opinion, as the result of unfounded and unjust income tax assessments made upon them.  I do not think income tax claims should be thrown around.  They should not be shied lightly at people.  They know these awful happenings have followed in their track.  Knowing that, they should turn over a new leaf.  I wish the Minister would ask them to stop bluffing.  I am a very old man to be caught out by bluff.  I assure the Minister they are not above trying to bluff me.  I am too old for that.  After all, it is not very complimentary to a man forty years in the legal profession, and who, during that time, has been constantly dealing with income tax, to find out that the income tax officials try to bluff by threats and nonsense.  It would be better for the revenue of this country that the income tax officials should treat the public with courtesy and civility as they were treated with, say, twenty years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make any comparisons of an odious description, but I would like to know why there is such a difference in the conduct of income tax officials in 1929 as compared with 1909?  There is no use hiding the fact, whatever the cause <Col N="228" /> of it.  I am not going to discuss what took place in the period between 1916 and 1921, or whether people were told to pay income tax or not.  I understand that some time in the year 1923 a notice was issued by the income tax people telling them that if they would stand on the stool of repentance and make a full confession, full absolution was awaiting them.  I must confess that until I heard it from the Minister I never before heard it.  I would like to remind the Minister that the early part of 1923 was a time when very few newspapers reached country districts, and when often and often people would be six days without seeing a newspaper.</P>
    <P>Not only was I in ignorance of that notice ever having been issued until I heard of it from the Minister, but people with whom I came in contact are ignorant of it.  The news would be more likely to reach me than the ordinary taxpayer, because I have received their instructions, but I never heard of any such thing.</P>
    <P>I would make this last appeal to the Minister: For the sake of the revenue of the State he should get rid of this unrest that has forced, and is forcing, millions of pounds of capital out of the country.  Let bygones be bygones, and give these people a clean sheet to the 1st April, 1923, or April, 1922.  If any of them do owe tax, let them come forward, and let threats of penalties, threats of compound interest, threats of various sorts that have been hurled at them day after day, be stopped if they pay the tax that they owe, and let it not be followed by threats of arrest.  If that were done it would be to the advantage of the State and of the public generally.</P>
    <P>There is only one other case that I will refer to.  Deputy Murphy has referred to a case relating to an old age pension, a singularly sad one, the case of an old lady who, really without any criminal lapse, and owing to what at the worst was an error, received the old age pension for some years when she was not entitled to receive it.  When the facts were discovered, out of a windfall <Col N="229" /> which came to her from a foreign country, she paid back a very considerable portion of the money she had received from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. She gave them practically her all, and when she reached the age of seventy years, destitute, forlorn as she was in every respect, she was entitled to receive the old age pension, but she waited year after year until the time came when, by not claiming the pension at the age of seventy years, the balance of what she had received was paid off.  She waited all those years so that she could remove the moral stigma of owing anything to the Revenue Commissioners, and at the end of that time she asked the Commissioners to wipe off the debt which morally she did not owe, because she had discharged it, and when she asked for the old age pension they turned her down.  That is not the way to administer the Old Age Pensions Act.  It should be administered in the way in which the Minister would wish to have it administered, in the way, I am glad to say, he is now seeing that it is administered by the officials who are more directly in contact with the matter than the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are.  Let him see that it is administered in a fair way in justice to those unfortunate people who are unable to protect themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to congratulate Deputy Wolfe on his powerful and eloquent speech.  The voters who sent him to the Dáil knew their business.  I would refer the Minister to the present forms that are sent out by the Revenue Commissioners to their unfortunate victims all over the country.  These forms are in the nature of a Chinese puzzle to the ordinary men and women who get them.  They do not know how to fill them.  I will give an instance which I came across some time ago. An unfortunate farmer in my part of the country came to me with an income tax form to fill up.  He had eleven children, but there was room in the form to put in the names of only five of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that these forms should be more simple, so that a man or woman of ordinary intelligence would be able to fill them up without having to go to an income tax expert or to a recovery agency to have them filled in and have to pay the income tax expert and the recovery agency, in addition, for that purpose.  There is a matter affecting my area I desire to deal with, I being a border Deputy.  I would suggest that more expedition should be exercised by the officials on the Customs posts in the vicinity of Derry, particularly on market and fair evenings.  We cannot change the geographical position of the area in which we live, and as a matter of necessity we have to use Derry City to a large extent as our principal market town.  On Wednesday evenings&mdash;Wednesday being the principal market day&mdash;and also on fair days, very considerable traffic passes into and out of Derry from and to Donegal, and more expedition should be used by officials, particularly in the winter season, in clearing the various vehicles that cross the Border.  I do not complain with regard to the courtesy of the officials. There has been a very considerable improvement in the last year or two in that respect.  They discharge onerous duties and they discharge them in the least objectionable way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Cole in asking that the time be extended to 10 o'clock for people to pass these frontier posts, particularly for people who have occasionally to go to Derry to look for a doctor or for a veterinary surgeon.  It is often necessary for a Senator who lives in my district, and for myself, to go to Derry at night, because we cannot get through the Border customs posts in the morning in time to catch the 7.25 train from Derry.  I think when we are doing the nation's business we should be facilitated as much as possible by the Customs officials and that we should be enabled to get through the Customs <Col N="231" /> posts without any objection in order to catch that train.  The extension of the time to 10 o'clock at the various Customs posts on the County Donegal border would not be, I think, any inconvenience to the officials.  It is citizens of the Free State who have to use these posts, and they are the only people who are penalised.  I would strongly urge on the Minister the desirability of keeping these posts open until 10 o'clock, at all events during the summer season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that every Deputy who has spoken on this Vote is in full agreement, that the bogey men of the citizens of this State are the Revenue Commissioners, particularly in connection with the collection of income tax.  Every Deputy who takes any interest in the affairs of his constituents, and who has occasion to look into matters relative to income tax, will certainly have verdicts to bring in on different points which will coincide with the views expressed by various members of the House, and particularly by Deputy Wolfe.  I am not criticising this Vote purely for the purpose of criticism.  I want to try, if I can, to suggest ways that might help to alleviate, even in a small way under the existing code, some of the difficulties which confront people.  First and foremost I must say that, with the exception of the Commissioners themselves, the average income tax official is certainly lacking in courtesy.  In fact, I have come to the conclusion that in some cases officials are chosen because of their bullying capacity. I do not say that because of the opinions that have been expressed. I raised the matter on a previous debate on this Vote in connection with an official of that department using third degree methods, not only to a man in arrears, but also to the professional gentleman who represented him, in my presence. That situation has not changed very much.  I was in an income tax office on Tuesday last, and the official there took up the attitude that he <Col N="232" /> was boss, that the citizen had nothing to say, and that what he said went.</P>
      <P>There appears to be some suggestion that not only must these officials keep their eyes on every penny that has come in or gone out, but that they must also have periscopes to view the future.  I know a case that happened only within the last few months, of a young lady who came here and resided in a hotel for the purpose of choosing a house which her father was buying for her, and which he was going to settle on her when she was married. She was in the hotel for a very short period, and spent her time here viewing property.  She purchased a house and many things to put into it.</P>
      <P>Attention having been called to the fact that a quorum was not present, a count was ordered.  Twenty Deputies being present,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was pointing out, this young lady was only a short time in this country, having come across from England for the purpose of settling down here.  She had no income whatever, and yet she came to me in a great flurry with papers asking for an income tax return. That is just an illustration of how keen the income tax people must be in watching hotel registers to see how long a visitor or a prospective resident remained in a hotel.  I presume, because in this particular instance she happened to stop at a fairly good class hotel, and because she happened to be spending money which she received from her father, they considered she was domiciled here after six weeks, and they proceeded to use their instruments of torture.  There is no doubt about it but that the Income Tax Department does attempt to extract, by any means whatever in their power, tax beyond a period of six years, whether or not the individual concerned is guilty of having concealed his income, or having attempted to defraud them in any way.  I am quite content with the reply given by the Minister for Finance on the Finance Bill last week, that any citizen who was being dunned for payment of <Col N="233" /> income tax for a period beyond six years, and who had not committed fraud, could tell the officials to go to pot.  I hope that, at least, the only means for conveying that to the public&mdash;the Press, which has been guilty of keeping that from the people&mdash; will convey that.  I hope that they will, at least, announce shortly, particularly before the next payments are due for 1929-30 returns, that they need not worry about income tax arrears due over a period beyond six years, especially in cases where there is no suggestion of fraud.</P>
      <P>With regard to business houses, the income tax department adopts a very peculiar attitude in connection with returns.  In the ordinary course of business, a trader who is stocktaking carries over stock which he has bought the previous year, and which, for some reason or another, is unsaleable.  Possibly it is defective, and possibly it is out of fashion. That trader in the ordinary way writes down that stock to have it sold at a cheaper price.  The income tax department does not allow that.</P>
      <P>Attention having been called to the fact that a quorum was not present, a count was ordered, and 20 Deputies being present,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The income tax department does not allow for the writing down of stock, and a concern has to make a return, for the purpose of income tax, of a balance sheet showing all goods at actual cost, irrespective of whether the articles have been damaged or unsaleable for any reason whatever.  They argue that the firm can show a loss at a subsequent date when it has sold the articles.  Now, if it never sells them it can never write them down, and I contend that some alteration should be made in the regulation which prescribes that method for the purpose of making returns.  I firmly believe that if instructions were given to this department to be more courteous, to be a little more friendly, to create some confidence in the minds of the people, and if facilities were given people to go to the department without finding themselves in a net that they would never get out of, the collection <Col N="234" /> of income tax would be made much easier.  It would also be much more comfortable for the people who get the forms and the subsequent letters which have been discussed here for the last few hours.</P>
      <P>There is an item I should like to refer to in connection with customs and excise.  I raised it on the Finance Bill, but I do not know whether anything has been done in the matter. It has reference to the irritating delays in connection with business generally.  Recently a tariff was imposed on cloth at a certain figure. Immediately imports were subject to that duty, and firms importing goods, although they had ordered those goods prior to the proposed tariff, because the goods only arrived on that day or the day previous and entry had not been made, were liable to duty.  I am not finding fault with that.  What I am finding fault with is that when the tariff was changed and a certain class of material was made free by the increase of the exemption clause, those goods when they arrived on that day, or the day previous, were also made liable to duty.  I understand that the matter was sent to the Attorney-General for interpretation.  I would impress on the Department that they should facilitate merchants by getting these things attended to as soon as possible and not be keeping people two or three weeks arguing and bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into individual cases in connection with income tax matters.  I must say in fairness to the Department, that when I approached them in the last few weeks I was met very fairly, and was given an opportunity to arrange, on behalf of certain people who were in difficulty, with the Commissioners.  As I said, the higher officials are not deserving of the criticism which has been offered.  It is evidently the official who is not in touch with the public as much as he should be who adopts the attitude of carrying in his hip pocket a bludgeon or a hammer which he threatens to take out every five minutes when discussing matters with citizens.  When people go themselves to the Department they should be assured of freedom of <Col N="235" /> speech and courtesy, so that they will be able to put their own affairs before the Department, instead of having to employ a solicitor or an accountant, which in many cases is impossible from the point of view of expense.  I believe that while the present regulations exist facilities should be given to the people who are worried and harassed.  At least they should be assured that they are not going to be frightened into making statements.</P>
    <P>Deputy White spoke of the income tax forms.  One clause on these forms says that the penalty for fraudulently concealing or untruly declaring any particular in making any claim for any allowance is £20 and treble the tax chargeable in respect of any source of income. Any Deputy filling in this form would find it hard to be able to swear that every single return was accurate as far as he was concerned. Yet the word &ldquo;untruly&rdquo; there covers erroneously, and he is liable to all these penalties, even if he makes a genuine mistake.  Of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce laughs and jeers and does not realise that some people are sincerely trying to do what they can for the people who sent them here.</P>
    <P>I spend my whole day in dealing with these matters.  The Minister is now in touch with the people.  If Ministers were more in touch with the people, they would realise some things could be changed so as to make matters work far better all round.  One other remark I wish to make, and that is with regard to the change in the regulations concerning financial matters which the Minister for Finance promised to have carried out some time back.  I would like to hear when these regulations will be altered, and whether it is proposed to alter them in the near future.  I do not believe that an Act is necessary, but rather that it could be done by the Revenue Commissioners themselves.  Perhaps some Minister on the benches opposite would bring this matter to the notice of the Minister for <Col N="236" /> Finance, who is not here at the moment, because otherwise I do not suppose we will hear any more about it for some time to come.  I have already spoken privately to the Minister for Finance about this regulation.  I believe that if these regulations are altered they will make things easier for the Revenue Department, and several other people think so as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions I want the Minister for Finance to answer.  We want a clear definition as to where Succession Duty is applicable.  It is laid down by statute that it is not applicable to estates under a valuation of £15,000.  Yet we find that, where certain administrative acts are neglected, it is made applicable in estates of £2,000 valuation and less. As well as putting on estate duty and legacy duty, they put on succession duty.  There should be legislation passed to do away with that.</P>

      <P>Another matter has been pointed out, and I want to ask a question as to whether it is right or wrong.  I could not read it into the Finance Bill, but it was pointed out by responsible persons that by some alteration made by the Finance Bill incomes arising out of investments outside the country are subject to income tax and super-tax in this way&mdash;that all appreciations of capital are treated as income even though there is no transmission of cash, and that when the draft does come over that appreciation of capital is also subject to income tax and super-tax.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am entitled under this Vote to discuss certain aspects of the old age pension regulations. I would like to make it clear at the outset that we are not in favour of lax administration of the Act.  We do not wish that people who are not entitled to receive pensions should receive them, because we think that would be condoning a fraud upon the State and the taxpayers, and very often upon the poorest of the taxpayers.  These pensions are intended entirely for those who other wise in their old age would be destitute, and any payments of the pensions wrongfully simply means that it becomes more difficult to pay pensions to those who are justly entitled to receive them.  At the same time, I think the general opinion prevails that pension officers, in administering the Acts, are too stringent, that they do not act in the spirit of the Act, that they are not animated by the feeling which inspired the Legislature when it decided to make this provision.  I think that belief is fostered, possibly, by the instructions issued to the officers.  It is also fostered by the attitude which the officers take when they are estimating the means of the claimant.  The practice of the officers in this matter invariably seems to be disadvantageous to the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small farmers, particularly, are hard hit by these methods.  The values put upon the land and farm produce, I am informed, are often unjustifiable and often quite thrifty people who keep their homesteads clean and who by their thrifty methods and their cleanliness maintain an appearance of comfort, are penalised.  I think it would be well to point out, and I think the pension officers ought to be reminded, that there is a very great difference between just administration and unsympathetic administration, between strict administration and obstructive <Col N="241" /> administration.  I am afraid a good many officers do not understand the difference and the distinction.  I have referred to the question of means and to the factors which are taken into consideration when considering means.  As the Act stands, the officer has to consider when valuing a holding the value of the buildings thereon.  I think it would be desirable if the Act were amended so that the valuation of the buildings should not be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I know.  I was counting upon your kind indulgence in the matter.  I know that generally when the debate is proceeding on useful lines you do not interfere. I do think this question of the valuation of buildings ought to be reconsidered by the Minister and the Department. There is another point. I said that very often the pension officers are over-stringent in the administration of the Act.  I think the rules as regards age are too rigid, and in that connection I think the Old Age Pensions Committee of Enquiry made several recommendations, including one to the effect that questions as to age should be referred to the Committee with specific inquiries where unsatisfied.  This would help particularly where there is difficulty in furnishing documentary evidence as to age.  The extraordinary thing about this Act is that when a claimant has lost his birth certificate a pension officer seems to think that he has discovered the elixir of youth, and simply because <Col N="242" /> the old man cannot produce a birth or baptismal certificate he can never attain the age which entitles him to a pension.  Many pension officers proceed on that basis.  We suggest that where a certificate cannot be produced the opinion of the committee should be the determining factor. I think as a general rule, if they are able to satisfy themselves by inquiry that the person is justly entitled to a pension or is not justly entitled, then they can decide whether they are or are not prepared to recommend the pension.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of blind pensions on which Deputy O'Dowd may have something to say.  The standard laid down is that the person must be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential. I hardly think that is a fair standard. If a man's previous occupation before he was afflicted by failure of eyesight was such that he required rather better than the average eyesight, then I think that any serious deterioration in his sight ought to entitle him to a pension. Take the case of a seamstress who requires, when doing fine needlework, particularly good eyesight.  Supposing her eyesight fails, and she is no longer able to earn her livelihood as before, she is practically destitute.</P>

      <P>This question of an amendment of the Old Age Pensions Act and Blind Persons Act was discussed at fairly considerable length in this particular Parliament.  But on the Estimate the Deputy will himself realise that manifestly the issue is how the money is being spent under the law as it stands.  The attack is, so to speak, upon the administration, and if the Deputy were to widen out into the question of a possible amendment of the statute under <Col N="243" /> which this money is to be paid there would be no limit to the discussion. I think we must confine ourselves in this case to how the Act is administered and not as to how the Act should be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the standard that a person must be unable to perform any work for which sight is essential is, I think, very possibly a question of interpretation so that any thing of the nature of work or any work which the person has obtained, or is able to obtain, should not preclude a person from getting the blind pension.  I am trying to argue that there are certain persons excluded under the present administration from the benefits of the Act who, if these requirements of the Act were interpreted in a rational way, would be entitled to benefit.  The Act says: &ldquo;Perform any work for which sight is essential.&rdquo;  The point about that is this: if a person has not the physique which is essential, if a person is to earn his livelihood by doing certain work for which eyesight is essential and if that person is not able to perform that work any longer by reason of his eyesight, and if he has previously been unaccustomed to work of that nature, then he should not be able to perform that work and consequently he should come in under the provisions of the Act.  Now, my information is that a person must be so blind that he is unable to do any work of any kind whatsoever before he is entitled to the pension; that that person must be so blind that the one defect and the one thing which prevents him from earning his livelihood is blindness, not that there is lack of physique or training.  The man who has been earning his livelihood as a clerk or a penman may find very great difficulty, or might be actually unable to perform the work of scavenger or navvy.  I should think that a proper reading of the Act would entitle the person in such a case to a pension.  But, as the law at present is administered, such a man is debarred from receiving a <Col N="244" /> pension.  I think this provision of the Act's, particularly with regard to people who suffer from blindness, which is an awful affliction, should be interpreted in a broad spirit and in a broad way, and that people who do suffer from blindness or whose eyesight is so bad that they cannot earn their bread in the way in which they had been accustomed to earn it, should be given the benefit of the Act.  It is not the custom of the Department to do so and I think it is unjust that such people should be excluded from its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no fault to find with the amount of money asked for in this Vote but, with Deputy MacEntee, I am dissatisfied as to the manner of the administration and the interpretation of the Acts.  It was the intention of the law that a person who had reached the age of 70 years and whose means did not exceed a certain amount should get the old age pension.  A person therefore has a legal right to a pension if he satisfies certain conditions as to means and age.  It appears to me to be impossible for a claimant whose claim had been objected to by the pensions officer, or appealed by the pensions officer, to establish his right under the Act, unless such a claimant is furnished with a detailed statement of the case that has been made against him to the Local Government Department by the pensions officer.  I have had a good deal of dealing with the old age pensions Department in the matter of appeals and I must say in justice to the officials of that Department that so far as it is possible within the interpretation of the law that has been laid down for them that they are inclined to be generous to the claimants.  But if the claimant does not know the detailed grounds of the objection made by the pensions officer to his claim he cannot make the case that would be sufficiently comprehensive to cover all possible arguments against him.  The vast majority of the claimants to old age pensions are uneducated people, and many of them are illiterate.  They believe that when an appeal is made by the <Col N="245" /> pensions officer against the award of the local committee that, for all practical purposes, the case has been disallowed and that they could not succeed in establishing a claim against that appeal without expert advice.  It is hard to see how these people can get the expert advice that they would require.  They cannot afford to employ a lawyer who could forward their legal case.  Anyhow, I have not met any lawyers who understood the details of the old age pensions enactments or the interpretations that are being put on these enactments by the Revenue Commissioners and by the Local Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The pensions officer estimates a half acre of oats and a half acre of potatoes or roots at so much.  He estimates that a cow is worth so much a year, and so on. If the claimant does not know exactly the values put on these by the pensions officer under these various heads he cannot satisfy the Local Government Department that the pensions officer has made a very serious error in his calculations.  I think it will be conceded at once that a very great difference exists in the value of crops owing to the conditions under which the crop was put in or a difference in the variety of the land.  It very often happens that poor people have to wait until their neighbours have put in their own crops before they can get assistance from them in the putting in of their crop.  It sometimes happens that a crop is put in late.  These are matters, of course, that are not brought before the Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way cows are sometimes kept at an actual loss to the claimants.  Poor people cannot afford to change their stock.  A cow is kept on as a rule until she dies of old age. Claimants usually occupy a small holding of inferior land, and even if they could afford to change the old cow and get a better breed, which might be a source of income, it would probably not thrive in the new surroundings. The same remark applies <Col N="246" /> to a claimant that may have a horse which is necessary to work a little holding.  That holding cannot be worked successfully without such a quadruped.  He is certainly a loss, but the amount of loss which the claimant is allowed for is a point which I have not been able to get clear on.  It is put down in many cases as an asset.  I think it would be a simple thing for the Department to supply the claimant with a copy of the pension officer's estimate of the claimant's means when there is an appeal.  If that were done the claimant would be in a position to put forward various points that should be put forward.  That would show that the pension officer cannot apply anything like a universal scale as to the value of cattle or a half acre of oats or potatoes.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Blind Persons Act has been mentioned by Deputy MacEntee.  In regard to that, there certainly is a much more liberal interpretation of the Act now than was in operation some years ago.  In my experience it is no longer necessary that the claimant should be stone blind to get a pension. So far as my experience goes, there has been a considerable change on the part of the Department in administering the Act.  Why the age limit is maintained at 50 I cannot understand.  I do not want to be called up by the Chair for being out of order, but I would like the Minister to indicate whether there is any likelihood of the age limit being reduced to 30 or 40.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the attitude of the British War Pensions Department in regard to old people in this country in receipt of British war pensions for their dependents who lost their lives in defence of the Empire.  It is the practice when these old people reach the age of 70 to discontinue their war pensions.  I think that the Minister ought to protest against that action of the British War Pensions Department.  If they are bound to give these people a pension up to the age of 70, they should not hand them over to Irish taxpayers when they reach that age, but should continue to bear the burden <Col N="247" /> and discharge their moral obligations to those people who have given their bread-winners in the Empire's defence.</P>
    <P>There is what appears to me to be an extraordinary interpretation put on some of these Acts, and great injustice is being done as a result. Under Section 7, sub-section (1) of the Act of 1924, a person can assign his property three years before he applies for a pension.  No matter how valuable that property may be, such person on reaching the age of 70 becomes entitled to a full pension.  It has been held that if a claimant applies one month before the three years has expired the claim is disallowed for all time, and can never be established.  It is a matter, I understand, of interpretation, but in cases where a person who is in possession of a small holding of a little over £10 valuation, assigns the holding and leaves himself almost destitute, and also if he applies before the three years have expired, he will never get a pension, no matter how great his destitution may be.  I would like to see a more liberal interpretation of that particular clause.  It was not intended that a man who was really wealthy, who knew the law, and who rid himself of his possessions, should after three years get a pension; neither was it intended by the Old Age Pension Acts that if a man assigned a small holding and did not know the law, and applied for a pension before the three years had expired, should be deprived of a pension.  As the Acts are being administered, a small farmer who has not assigned his place to anybody, but who has improved his holding by a strenuous life of toil and hardship, and who has got a home which is a credit to him, is sometimes deprived of his rights under the Acts.  On the other hand, a person who allows his place to go to ruin, and the land to run wild, is awarded a pension in proportion to his carelessness.  I do not think that that was the intention of the Acts.  The interpretation put on Section 2, sub-section (1) (d) of the Act of 1911 is one which I think cannot be justified.  This paragraph <Col N="248" /> enacts that in calculating the means of a person account shall be taken of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person.  As that section is interpreted by the Department, a Christmas box, money received in charity, or food received from the St. Vincent de Paul Society must be reckoned as income under the heading &ldquo;benefit or privilege.&rdquo; If that interpretation were followed to its logical conclusion, no one would be entitled to a full pension unless he or she was found on the road-side without food or shelter.  I know no person, however destitute, who is not in receipt of privileges in excess of the value of 6/- per week. Anyone in receipt of over 6/- a week, or benefits or privileges estimated as being worth 6/- per week, if the Act is interpreted in that sense, would not be entitled to a full pension.  I think it is obvious that such interpretation was never intended.  I submit that the Act intended that account would be taken of any yearly income from any benefit or privilege enjoyed by a claimant in his own right, but it was never intended to include under the heading &ldquo;benefit or privilege&rdquo; such benefit or privilege as is derived from charity.  The interpretation of that clause causes, I think, more hardship than any other clause in the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>In the case of an old person who has a son or daughter, perhaps in fairly comfortable circumstances, and who goes to live with that son or daughter in his old age, who gets his food and is kept free, he is deemed to have a privilege, though he has no legal right to it, estimated from 10/- to £1 per week.  Similarly, in the case of sons or daughters coming home from America, who take the old people to live with them, these sons or daughters may have made some money, and take their parents to live with them.  The very fact that such old people are not turned out on the road and left destitute, and that their friends or relatives provide them with food or shelter, is, under this section, interpreted as a barrier to obtaining a pension.  I submit that that was never intended by the Act.  Similarly <Col N="249" /> it very often happens that an old servant has been in a place for a number of years, practically all her life.  She reaches a certain age, and her employer does not like to turn her out on the road.  If such persons are kept, although they receive no wages, if they are not turned out destitute on the roadside, the pension authorities hold that they are in receipt of privileges or benefits sufficient to deprive them of the old age pension.  If they get any pension at all it is only a matter of a few shillings.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look into the interpretation of this particular paragraph, and I think if he examines it he will conclude that it has not been interpreted in accordance with the intention of the Act. For the purposes of comparison, I would refer him to Clause B of the same sub-section.  Clause B states that account shall be taken of the income which that person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year in cash.  It cannot be argued under that paragraph that a beggarman must keep account of the pennies he gets from house to house.  If that were the accepted interpretation of the clause, that the income which that person may reasonably be expected to receive during the succeeding year in cash should be taken into account, then a beggarman would not get a full pension if his accounts showed that he received more than 10d. per day. The Act never intended that.  If it was not intended that such cash received as charity should be included as income under that particular section, it was not intended that benefits or privileges received in charity should be estimated as income.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer the Minister to Section 7, sub-section (1) of the 1924 Act again for the purposes of comparison with this obnoxious interpretation of the sub-section to which I referred.  Under Section 7 a person can render himself entitled to an old age pension by assigning away his property.  It has always been held that if such a person has left himself without any property or without any legal right to maintenance he will be entitled to a pension.</P>

      <P>In the case of a person who for the purpose of qualifying for an old age pension assigns away his property three years before applying, if he has deprived himself of all means of livelihood he is entitled to a full pension.  The Act has been interpreted in that way and such persons are getting pensions. It has not been held that it was necessary for such a person to be turned out of the house.  So long as he has no legal right to maintenance, he is awarded a pension. That interpretation of Section 7 of the 1924 Act is altogether at variance with the interpretation put on Section D of the 1911 Act. Sub-section D hits at the very poorest class of the community.  I think if the Minister looks into this question that he will conclude that the present interpretation is altogether inconsistent with the intention of the Acts.</P>
      <P>I would just like to draw the Minister's attention to one other point.  That is the injustice of not paying arrears when a claim has been successfully established.  It often happens that years are spent in establishing a claim.  Frequently, appeal after appeal is turned down, and eventually some evidence is unearthed that establishes the fact that the person has been entitled to the old age pension from the date of the first claim.  In such a case when a person is certainly morally entitled, I think the law should be interpreted in such a manner as to leave such a claimant legally entitled to the pension from the date of the first claim. It is certainly a hardship, especially in very poor cases, where the claimants have been kept out of a pension for a year or two that when they are eventually successful in establishing their claims, these arrears are not paid.</P>

      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to a question in connection with the administration of the Act.  In doing so, I might say that I believe that in no county in the Saorstat is there such maladministration of the Act as in Donegal.  In that county many old people who are applicants for old age pensions experience very great difficulty in obtaining them. In my opinion that is due in very many cases to the fact that young pension officers are sent from Dublin City, from Cork and other parts who do not really understand the position obtaining in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as cities are concerned, it is quite an easy matter for applicants for old age pensions to obtain a birth certificate, whether it be Dublin City, Dublin County, or Cork; but so far as County Donegal is concerned very often great difficulty is experienced in the applicant's obtaining a copy of his birth certificate, owing to the fact that seventy years ago in many parts of County Donegal, and more especially on the islands off the coast, no proper records were kept. In that particular county persons so affected who cannot obtain their birth certificates in many cases have got affidavits signed by people who knew them in childhood and who themselves are in receipt of old age pensions.  These affidavits as a rule certify that they believe that the applicants for the old age pensions are seventy years or over and consequently are entitled to old age pensions.  When these affidavits are placed before the pensions sub-committee they grant pensions to the applicants, but in numerous cases the pensions officer, who does not understand the situation in County Donegal, appeals against the decision of the sub-committee, with the result that the applicant does not get his pension.  In very many cases he does not appeal to the Local Government Department in Dublin until a considerable time has elapsed, owing to the fact that he is not conversant with the wording of the Act.  That is a matter to which I think the <Col N="252" /> Minister should give serious attention. There is no doubt, as far as the ordinary layman is concerned, and more especially as far as the old persons are concerned, and even more especially as far as the old persons in the Gaeltacht are concerned, they find a great difficulty in getting over the appeals of the pensions officer.  I suggest to the Minister that, as far as his Department is concerned, he should get instructions printed and sent out to pensions sub-committees instructing these applicants as to what steps they should take in the event of the pensions officer appealing against the decision of the sub-committee.  I also think that such notices should be printed in both Irish and English. Another matter to which I think the Minister should pay attention is the question which Deputy MacEntee has referred to, that is, the unjustifiable assessment placed upon small farmers.  Very often these pensions officers to whom I have referred do not understand the remote areas of Donegal.  They go from Dublin or Cork with secret instructions in their pocket.  The Minister for Local Government or any other member of the Executive Council has never told Deputies what are the secret instructions imparted to the pensions officers.  As far as I understand these secret instructions they are that, whenever possible, they should not grant an old age pension; or, in other words, whenever they get a loophole to do an applicant out of an old age pension they should take advantage of it and deprive the applicant of what he or she is entitled to under the Act.</P>

      <P>Another matter I would like to refer to is that with regard to applicants who are living with relatives in most cases a pensions officer assesses the means of such applicants owing to the fact that they are living with their relatives at the sum of £26 per annum. It means that if such an applicant who has been living with relatives receives an old age pension he is only allowed a sum of four shillings a week.  I think that stipulation is most unfair, because where applicants are living with relatives in rural districts, those relatives, in many cases, are unable to support themselves and their wives and families in comfort, but, nevertheless, the pensions officers, who are backed up by the Department of Local Government, assess the applicant's income at £26 per annum, which I think is most unfair, with the result that the applicant does not receive ten shillings per week, but only the sum of four shillings per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, at the behest of this House, a Commission was set up to deal with the question of the sick and destitute poor.  As far as that particular Commission was concerned, they made reference to the question of old age pensioners who went into the workhouses or county homes.  In the course of that report it was mentioned that an old age pensioner is disqualified from receiving a pension while an inmate of a county home or workhouse.  The pension is withdrawn when he enters, and cannot be returned until he leaves and makes a fresh application for a pension.  If the pensioner is in receipt of relief in a county, district or workhouse hospital, the pension is withdrawn at the expiration of three months from the date of payment.  I will submit to the House, and the Minister especially, that such a stipulation is unfair, inasmuch as it throws the burden of maintaining the old age pensioner upon the ratepayer and relieves the taxpayer of such a burden.  At the time this Commission reported in the month of March, 1926, there were 2,113 old age pensioners inmates of <Col N="254" /> county homes and workhouses. Assuming that each of these old age pensioners had the maximum amount of pension when they entered such institutions, it would mean that the ratepayers are burdened with the annual sum of £50,000 that should be paid by the taxpayer.  I think that is most unfair, because as I said I believe even when a person is an old age pensioner and finds it necessary to go into a county home or workhouse that the State or the taxpayer should still bear the cost, and not throw it on to the ratepayers and put up the rates of the county where the old age pensioner has been.</P>
    <P>There is a matter that I think Deputy Dr. Ward has made reference to, and that is the fact that in England, Scotland, Wales and the Six Counties persons over 65 years of age are entitled to receive old age pensions.  In many of these parts I have mentioned there are people of 65 or 66 years of age in receipt of old age pensions who are natives of the Saorstát, and who are anxious to return to their native country, but who, owing to the fact that if they did return they would have to wait for some years before getting the old age pension, are forced to remain away.  There is no reason why an old age pensioner in the Saorstát should be placed at any disadvantage as compared with an old age pensioner in the Six Counties, or in England, Scotland or Wales.  The time has come when this House should take into serious consideration the question of granting old age pensions to people of 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to refer to is the question of appeal. When an old person makes an application to a sub-committee, and his application is granted, in many cases we find that the pension officer appeals against the decision, and the applicant, through want of knowledge of the Act, goes no further.  As a result he is done out of his pension illegally for a very long period.  That is one of the reasons why I believe the Local Government Department should issue printed instructions, both in Irish and English, so that <Col N="255" /> they could be circulated to the sub-committee and to applicants for the old age pension.  Some time last year, as a result of a motion which the Labour Party put down in this House, old age pensioners who were in receipt of 9/- a week became entitled to an additional 1/-, but I want to complain to the Minister and to the House generally, that many of these old age pensioners who were in receipt of 9/- per week and who should have received an additional shilling did not receive it, because the onus in most cases was thrown upon the old age pensioner.  That should not have been, because this House decided that those persons who were in receipt of 9/- per week should have restored to them the money which was taken from them some time previously.  In many cases they had not that money restored to them.  I would direct attention to that matter, so that these people may get what they are legitimately entitled to.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ward also referred to the blind persons pensions.  As far as the Act is concerned even though a person is completely blind he is not entitled to a pension unless he is over 50 years of age.  I believe that the time is much overdue when the age limit should be reduced.  I hope the Minister will give attention to that particular question.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer, in regard to the administration of the blind persons pension, is the fact, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, that a person in order to be entitled to a blind person's pension must be unable to perform work for which eyesight is essential.  I have in mind one particular case of an applicant for a blind person's pension.  He was qualified according to age.  The sub-committee to which the application was made was satisfied that the applicant was unable to perform any work for which eyesight was essential. A young pension officer who was sent up with his secret instructions in his pocket from Dublin appealed against the decision, with the result that the <Col N="256" /> sub-committee and I myself asked the Local Government Department to send up a medical officer to Letterkenny to examine the person's sight, in order to prove that the pension officer was wrong in appealing against the decision of the sub-committee. Although repeated applications were made to the Department of Local Government, over nine months elapsed before the Local Government Department sent up their Medical Inspector.  When the Medical Inspector was sent up, he discovered that the applicant satisfied all the stipulations that were laid down in the Act.  In other words, he was unable to perform work for which eyesight was essential, and they decided to grant him the pension; but because of the action of the pension officer and the delay on the part of the Department of Local Government in sending their Medical Inspector to Letter-kenny, the applicant only got his pension from the date on which he was examined by the Medical Inspector. The pension was not made retrospective. That is a matter to which I think the Minister and his Department should pay attention. When there are delays due to appeals by pensions officers, and to the Department of Local Government in not sending inspectors, pensioners should not be made to suffer.  The pension should be retrospective. These are matters to which I hope the Minister and the Department concerned will pay serious attention in the coming year.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee, when speaking on this Estimate, referred to the severity of the test imposed on the applicants for blind pensions.  He quoted the case of a seamstress who failed in eyesight in the ordinary way.  She is no longer able to earn her living as a seamstress, but because she has sufficient eyesight left to perform work as a charwoman, or follow some other occupation, she is disqualified from getting a blind pension.  It has been submitted by more than one Deputy that the Act was never intended to be interpreted in that way.  A Committee was set up by this House to <Col N="257" /> go into the whole question and put down a specific test.  While I thoroughly agree that some sort of rigid test should be imposed for the blind pension, I say on medical grounds that the test at present imposed is far too severe, and that it is only fair in so far as it applies to the rougher trades.  In so far as it applies to skilled trades, the test is far too severe.  I have the opinion of several of the leading ophthalmic surgeons in Dublin to that effect.  It is not necessary for me to say any more than that.  I have referred to it on several occasions here.  I think the Department concerned should examine the test that is at present imposed for blind pensions and see if it cannot be remodelled.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the difficulty that an applicant has, especially in country districts, in proving his claim.  Records are not available. In most of these cases the names of applicants are not in the parish register, or the records have long ago been destroyed through fire or other causes.  The applicant is told to get two affidavits.  These affidavits are generally got from people who are themselves in receipt of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the rural districts, the affidavits are so framed that they do not contain direct evidence. That is not because the applicant, as a rule, is not entitled to the pension, but because those making the affidavits do not understand them. What I would suggest is, that some form of draft affidavit, or an alternative affidavit, should be submitted, either to the peace commissioner who draws up the affidavit, or to the local pension sub-committee, so that the affidavit that people present with their claims will at least be of some use to them.  You are getting this type of affidavit presented&mdash;that so far as I know, John So-and-so has been 70 years of age since such a date.  You will be told in the Department that that affidavit is of no use.  You will be told that there must be positive evidence given that the person is 70 years, and that you must advance proof of that by stating in the affidavit that you <Col N="258" /> know that to be a fact because you went to school with him, and so on. This question of the admission of the age of applicants for the old age pension is one that should be seriously examined.  Last year I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government about a particular applicant.  I asked him a question about James Smith.  The question I asked was, why was it that James Smith was refused the old age pension?  I was told that he was refused it because he had not reached the statutory age for receiving the pension.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that this same James Smith, one and a half years earlier, was refused benefit under the National Health Insurance Act by one of the insurance societies because he had exceeded the age for receiving benefit.  One Department said that he was over 70 and could not get benefit.  The other Department said that he was under 70 and could not get the old age pension. This applicant, in support of his claim for the old age pension, submitted evidence from the insurance society to the effect that he was over 70.  When the insurance society turned down his claim for benefit they pointed out that, on entering the Society twenty years previously, his age was 51.  I cannot see why a man should say he was 51 twenty years ago, if he were not 51. Further proof in that particular case was that the man had a son aged 47.  The son's age could be found.  That was only one of many cases.  There is, undoubtedly, a great lot of hardship caused, especially in country districts, because no proper records are kept or are available.  I would also like to mention the case of a woman whose case was undoubtedly proved beyond yea or nay.  She is undoubtedly over 70 years of age, but because a young pensions officer went down and found a young girl in the house this woman did not get the pension. He asked this young girl what age she was.  She told him she was 21. She also told the pension officer that she was the daughter of the applicant. Immediately he came to the <Col N="259" /> conclusion that because the daughter was 21, the mother could not be 70. Well, that is not so unusual at all in Ireland, and there are probably many cases of the kind.</P>
    <P>While I quite agree that the officials in the old age pension section of the Local Government Department in Dublin do their best, and I am quite willing to admit that, as far as I know, they give an absolutely fair chance to all applicants, and while I thoroughly appreciate the impartiality which they show, yet it must be admitted that sitting in their offices in Dublin there is considerable difficulty in determining whether a claimant, say, in Connemara is entitled to a pension or not. If they send down an inspector he is generally inexperienced.  Oftentimes, when an inspector goes down and looks at an applicant, he concludes that the applicant is too juvenile looking to be entitled to the pension.</P>
    <P>Attention called to the fact that a quorum was not present.  House counted and 20 Deputies being present,</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these young inspectors live in Dublin and they are quite inexperienced, and perhaps it should not be left to them to decide whether a person, on appearance, is 70 years or not.  Some people look juvenile at 65.  Some people look juvenile, even at 75, while other people look old at 55 and 60.  There is the old saying, that a man is just as old as he feels.  I would like to say a few words on what I may term the severity of the test as regards means.  In rural Ireland the valuation of a small farmer's holding is generally taken as the index of a man's wealth.  It is absolutely no index in the West of Ireland, and especially in the case of new holdings.  In the case of a man put into a new holding by the Land Commission his valuation is generally very high.  He may have just about half the land that his neighbour has, but his valuation may be double that of his neighbour's. I have known several cases <Col N="260" /> in districts in the County Roscommon where that has occurred.</P>
      <P>The marriage register is also oftentimes taken as proof that a person has not reached the age for the pension.  It is an admitted fact, especially in the case of female applicants, that possibly 50 or 45 years ago they made themselves a few years younger when getting married. These are points that should be examined with a view to getting some fixed rule by which the questions of age and valuation could be put on a basis that the applicants could understand.  As regards the Pension Act, I would be satisfied if the test for applicants was relaxed somewhat and made a little less severe than it is at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an appeal on behalf of the class of applicant who has no visible means, but who is living more or less on the charity of his friends.  It may be in some cases that these people, in order to get this charity, have to work for it.  Because they happen to be living with some person who gives them shelter and supplies them with their food daily, the pension officer comes to the conclusion that they have no right to get the pension.  I suppose the Act allows the pension officer a certain amount of latitude in that way, but at the same time I think he ought to be reasonable.  In many of these cases, these old people have to do a certain amount of work.  It may not be very heavy work, but they have to do something to maintain themselves in the houses in which they are given shelter, or perhaps it may be that out of their life's savings they have a few shillings laid by out of which they contribute to their support. I think that there should be some reason in these cases. Generally, the Committee is reasonable enough and allows an appeal against the decision of the inspector. Would it not be a good idea if these inspectors were changed occasionally? They get into a groove.  Once having decided a case they probably have not the time or inclination to go back on it again.  I think it <Col N="261" /> would be well if they were moved about instead of being left in the one place all the time.  They discriminate too much.  I have three cases before me, and the figures are verified.  I discussed the matter with the pensions officer, and he agreed that the figures I have are correct.</P>
      <P>Number one was the case of a woman who had fifteen acres of land on which she was able to feed three cows.  The pensions officer decided she was not entitled to a pension. The second case is that of a woman who has 35 acres, and is able to feed six cows.  She is entitled to a pension. Another case is that of an applicant who has 16 acres, and she is entitled to a pension.  The idea of the pensions officer is that whether a person is entitled to a pension or not depends upon whether the person is poor or not.  If a person in a household makes the place tidy, if there is an energetic person who is prepared to go around earning some money by dealing in cattle, or in other ways, to help the household, and whose assistance helps to keep the place comfortable, the pensions officer thinks that there is no poverty there, and that the person is not entitled to any pension.  If the Act says a person is entitled to a pension because there is no means that person should get the pension. More discretion should be left to the local committee, because the committee understands the case better than the pensions officer.  I must say that when cases are brought before the Local Government Department, they deal with them in a very reasonable way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very few grievances in these matters.  I would like to follow on the lines of Deputy Cole.  I think that persons who are dependent on their friends for their support should not on that account be deprived of a pension.  I know of a few such cases in my area, and I put them before the authorities in Dublin.  I think that is an unfair way of treating, in their old age, these unfortunate people who have not one penny to spend on <Col N="262" /> themselves, and who have to depend on the charity of their friends.  They should not be deprived of the few shillings which the pension would give them, and which would be necessary to provide them with some snuff or tobacco, or &ldquo;a half-one&rdquo; if they wanted it.  The industrious small farmer is penalised if his house presents a clean appearance.  Also the small farmer whose valuation is high is deprived of the full pension. I know a case where 30 or 40 years ago there was a valuable wood on a certain farm.  This farm was valued very highly owing to having valuable timber and an orchard on it. Both of these have disappeared, and the farm now is merely a piece of rocky mountain land.  Because of the high valuation of the farm there will be trouble in getting that man a pension.  With the improvement that is going on from year to year, I hope that cases of this kind will be remedied before we are dealing with the next Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T. Sheehy Mr. T. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): I wish to say a word or two with regard to the manner in which the estimate for the old age pension is made out.  I wish to know is it on the annuity or the poor law valuation of the holding the estimate is based?  Down in West Cork farmers generally have small holdings.  When the old man passes on the farm to his son or daughter at marriage, it is extremely hard that the value of the holding is still kept up against him after a long life of hard work. It is sad to think that when he has handed over the farm to his son or daughter to carry on the work that he should be deprived of the little privilege the law allows, that is the old age pension.  I sincerely hope the Minister will give that point some consideration.  The pension is the only boon that the brave old people who stood the stress of battle during their lives have in their old age.  I think every consideration should be given to them as regards the operation of this Act, and that every point possible should be admitted in their case.  I must say that in a number of cases that have been heard on appeal in Dublin, <Col N="263" /> when the evidence was fairly put before the authorities here they agreed with the local pensions committee. I have in mind the case of a poor widow in my town who, unfortunately, was not able to get proof of her age.  Two old people who were 74 and 75 years of age made declarations that they were born in the same townland as this woman and that they knew her all their lives.  I myself went to the committee and stated, from my knowledge of this poor old widow&mdash; she was born and reared close to me &mdash;that I, having reached my 73rd year, was convinced that she was over 70 years.  The declarations of these two people and mine were accepted in Dublin, and the old lady got her pension and some arrears with it.  I would like that spirit to be shown here.  It would be a great assistance if the authorities, when cases were sent up to them, would be sympathetic towards those claiming the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea Deputy Sheehy has made, and to call attention to certain cases that came under my notice recently, and the manner in which they have been dealt with by the pensions officer.  I have in mind the particular case of a man with a small farm the valuation of which would be something less than £10. In that case the pensions officer adopted an extraordinary method of assessing the means of the claimant. It was apparent to the members of the old age pensions committee when dealing with this case that every effort was made to inflate the valuation and the means in order to debar that particular claimant from getting the old age pension.  By a subtle process of reasoning, the pensions officer reached a figure of something like £35, and apparently he was in difficulties as to how the means could be increased further.  As a result of inquiries made, and by inspiration, he discovered, by getting hold of a letter the claimant had in his home, that two years ago he got £5 from his daughter in America, and solemnly, for that reason, the <Col N="264" /> pensions officer proceeded to add £5 a year to that man's means.</P>
      <P>I suggest that is not playing the game.  I know the facts of the case, because the claimant in question came before the old age pension committee and admitted that he got one £5, but said it was the first he got for a number of years.  He was able to satisfy the committee that, so far from being debarred in the ordinary way from receiving a pension, he was in serious financial difficulty, and he was able to satisfy the committee by particulars that he brought to their notice that he was in debt to a considerable extent. When the question was brought to the notice of the Minister he relied on a section of the Act.  I could admit the justice of the Act if there was any proof whatever or any reason to assume that payments of that kind were made regularly, but it is ridiculous on the face of it, and nobody ought to know it better than a pensions officer, to think that money comes from children in America regularly.  Very often it is a question of the particular circumstances of children that determines whether they are in a position to assist their parents at all or not. That case was carrying meanness in the administration of the Act to a greater degree than I have seen since or before, and I would like to have a wider interpretation of the powers conferred upon the officer by the Act and a fairer method established for dealing with questions of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of my colleagues from West Cork are also aware of the fact that in certain districts it is the practice of officers to appeal cases to the Department where the applicants are labourers in receipt of ordinary farm labourers' wages.  Nobody will deny that the wages farm labourers receive in places like West Cork are exceedingly modest.  Cases of that kind should not be appealed, and there are no special circumstances in them which would warrant an appeal or an investigation into them, because on the face of it these are the people that the Act was intended for, and there ought to be no question <Col N="265" /> whatever of admitting claims of that kind, where a man is employed by a farmer and gets 10/- or 12/- a week and his food.  I am at one with Deputy Sheehy in saying that as far as my experience of the Department is concerned claims have been fairly dealt with.  But there has been a good deal of delay, arising out of what I consider to be frivolous and unnecessary appeals on the part of certain officers.  I am satisfied that since the Minister made a promise of a relaxation of the regulations that pertain to old age pensions appeals that relaxation has been carried out, and I admit that there is now much less ground for complaint than was formerly the case.  But still there is need for improvement, and I do hope that the plea that Deputy Sheehy has made, with whatever information I have been able to give the Minister on this point, will have the effect of ensuring that the Act will be administered not alone in the letter but in the spirit in which the Act was intended to be administered and in which it ought to be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in previous years, every attempt is being made to administer the Act liberally and sympathetically, and I believe that that is being done.  I believe in the case of the blind pensioners particularly that it is being done. After a good deal of consideration we came to the conclusion that we could not alter the standard of blindness without admitting a great number of people to the blind pension who really should not get it, and we decided, therefore, to take the line of giving the benefit of the doubt to the applicant in every case where there was defective vision.  That has been done so effectively that I believe there is very little ground for complaint. You cannot say because a person followed some particular occupation of a remunerative character and because of failing sight he cannot follow it, but that he might earn a living in another occupation, that person should have a blind pension. I think the number of people who are making complaints in connection <Col N="266" /> with that are going beyond anything that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>So far as old age pensions proper are concerned, as I say, everything is being done to administer the Act liberally and sympathetically.  I do not believe that we can go any further in that direction than we have gone.  There will be hard cases from time to time.  I do not see how we can avoid some of the hard cases, just as we cannot avoid letting some people have pensions when they ought not to have them, because we are not dealing with standardised things; we are dealing with doubtful factors of a variety of kinds.  The question of age is often a doubtful factor.  Just as some people who may be seventy years of age may fail to produce proof of their age, so other people who have not reached the age of seventy do succeed in persuading the pension officer that they have reached that age.  The officer has to try to act fairly on behalf of the general taxpayer on the one side and of the applicants on the other. The instruction to officers has been to be absolutely fair in the matter, and no officer gets any credit for refusing pensions, any more than he gets it for giving them.  He has no interest in refusing a pension which should be given.  I have no reason to doubt that officers, according to their lights, do the best they can to administer the Act fairly.  Officers have different temperaments. One officer may have a more suspicious turn of mind than another, and again you cannot standardise. There will be slight varieties of temperament and different outlooks in the case of different officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much the same thing applies to the means.  The question of the valuation practically does not come into it.  The officer takes into account the stock borne by the land, the tillage of the land, and so forth, in estimating the value of the holding. The valuation of the holding is only a minor factor.  The whole method of estimating the value of a holding has been, comparatively recently, the subject of prolonged <Col N="267" /> discussion with the Department of Agriculture.  The method was adopted in consultation with the Department, and I believe that it is the best than can be got.  At any rate, we attempt to do it fairly, but because there are so many varieties of cases and because there will be differences in the outlook of individual officers, there will be some difference in treatment, but I believe, taking it all round, that the thing is fair.</P>
    <P>The cases of people who have support from friends are difficult to deal with.  The Act undoubtedly requires the officer to take account of anything in the way of means that a person has, no matter what way he has got them.  One can only discuss individual cases.  It may be that some of the cases that Deputies put forward are hard cases, while on the other hand they may not be so if one heard the other side of them, and I could not undertake to discuss them.  Deputy Tadhg Murphy seems to be in a mood of hectic eloquence to-night on this and the other question of officers who inflate the means, but I do not agree with him.</P>

That would be to his discredit, and it would be officially harmful to him.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question dealing with cases where citizens of this State <Col N="269" /> lost sons in the Great War, and who are in enjoyment of pensions of fifteen shillings weekly from the British Government.  The British Government seems to have the happy knack of knowing when these people reach the age of seventy.  They notify them they should apply to the Free State Government for the old age pension, and the pensions are then reduced by that amount.  It happens sometimes that these people cannot produce their certificates of age, and they are denied the pension of 10/- in the Free State.  I think it is a very great hardship.  The British Government reduces the pensions by the amounts which in the ordinary course would be granted to them in the Free State, and, not being able to produce certificates of age, their income is reduced by ten shillings weekly.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would make any overtures to the British Government on behalf of such people to have the pensions restored until such time as they obtain the old age pension in the Free State.  There are numerous cases of that kind.  It is rather sharp practice, I think, on the part of the British Government to reduce the pensions until they are sure that these persons are in receipt of old age pensions.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be reduced by £300,000 in respect of sub-head B.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the amendment only relates to portion of the £600,000 which has to be paid under sub-head B of this Vote. That is, the annuity of £600,000 which is payable half-yearly under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  I am sure I need not inform the House that in view of the declared policy of our Party to re-open this Ultimate Financial Settlement when a favourable opportunity occurs, if it had not been for the fact that the annuity is payable half-yearly, and that the House has already voted in the Vote-on-Account the first moiety of that annuity, the amendment would be to refuse provision in respect of the whole sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask the Dáil not to agree to this payment on two grounds.  First, that the payment is inconsistent with Article 2 of the Agreement which was signed on the 3rd December, 1925, which amended the Treaty, and <Col N="271" /> that even if not inconsistent with that Article, no proper inquiry has been made to establish clearly the liability of the Free State in the matter, the amount of liability, if any, and until the liability has been properly established no payment should be made.  In dealing with the first point, it might be well to remind the Dáil of the purport of Article 5 of the Treaty.  That Article provided that the Free State should assume a proportionate liability for the service of the public debt, on what in the terms of the Treaty was described as the United Kingdom, as that debt stood at the date of the Treaty, subject to the condition that such a part liability was to be fixed upon a fair and equitable basis, and that in determining it due regard should be taken of any just claims on the part of Ireland, by way of set-off or counter-claim.</P>
    <P>It seems to have been accepted by both parties to the Treaty&mdash;by Mr. Cosgrave's Government on the one hand, and by the British Government on the other hand&mdash;that it was desirable that effect should not be given to this Article until the boundary of the Irish Free State had been delimited in accordance with Article 12 of the Treaty.  Accordingly, nothing seems to have been done in the matter until the Boundary Commission was about to issue its report.  Then an English newspaper, in the most unfriendly way, spilled the beans upon poor Mr. Cosgrave by publishing a forecast of the report which the Boundary Commission had agreed to, and was about to make, a forecast which obviously had authoritative inspiration, and which after events proved to be well founded.  That forecast put the country into a ferment and the Government into a panic.  The Government's representative upon the Boundary Commission, whose inactivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, in consequence of certain negotiations which took place in London in December, 1925, the President, as to whom one of his admirers at that time claimed he had won the greatest victory since Brian Boru, came back, and himself evaluated that victory, and, with his usual choice and happy felicity of phrase, stated that he had made a &ldquo;damn good bargain,&rdquo; that had left this country with a clean slate, such as no other country in Europe possessed. In due time, the President's &ldquo;damn good bargain&rdquo; was written into the Statute Book in the form of an Act entitled the Treaty (Confirmation of Amendment) Agreement Act, 1925, in the schedule of which it was declared, in Article 2: &ldquo;The Irish Free State is hereby released from obligation under Article 5 of the said Articles of Agreement to <Col N="276" /> assume the liability therein mentioned.&rdquo; I should like to return for a moment to Article 5 of the original Treaty, which is referred to in the second Article of the Amending Agreement.  Article 5 provided that in fixing the proportionate liability of the Irish Free State for the service of the public debt of what is called the United Kingdom, due regard was to be paid to any just claim on the part of Ireland by way of set-off or counter-claim.  What just claims might have thus been advanced? Quite obviously one of them could have been and, I hope, would have been for a share in the assets of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Such assets, in so far as they were tangible and real, had been created by the moneys of the taxpayer and the services of the sons and daughters of both countries.  On the dissolution of the United Kingdom or other change in the political relations between them, each country which was a party to that Union was entitled to its fair share of the assets thus created.  Such a fair share embraced, I hold, not only the treasure and credit of the British Treasury and the armaments in Britain's arsenals and her fleets upon the seas, but a share in every asset in her Empire, her Dominions, her Colonies, her territorial possessions, and above all, that vast, immeasurable asset, the good-will of her market in every clime and in every part of the globe. The treasure of Irish citizens, the valour and enterprise of Ireland's children had gone to the building and creation of these, and upon every one of them she had a just claim, and was entitled to a fair share.  As a matter of fact, the public debt referred to in Article 5 of the original Agreement represented, in great part, the treasure which had been expended in advancing the assets and territorial possessions and trade position of the United Kingdom, and in addition to the Irish money poured out in that way, there had also been poured out Irish blood.  If we were called upon by Article 5 of the Treaty to assume responsibility for the expense of defending <Col N="277" /> that Empire, then equally we were entitled to share in every possession of the British Empire.</P>
      <P>Now, the British Empire was not a bankrupt concern even when the Treaty was signed, and even at the time when the amending agreement was signed.  Its assets, if they could be realised, far exceeded its liabilities and, therefore, any claim which Ireland might have advanced under Article 5 of the Treaty for a fair share of these assets, certainly would have exceeded any liabilities that Ireland might have been called upon to assume under Article 5 of the Treaty.  And one of the best assets, because it had a real existence and because its real value was at least equal to its nominal value&mdash;and that could hardly be said with certainty with reference to any armaments or buildings or any other fixed assets&mdash;was this Local Loans Fund and the amounts due to that Fund on foot of the advances which had been received from it by local authorities, not only in Ireland, but in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Now, undoubtedly the local authorities had borrowed from that Fund, and undoubtedly, if the relations between Great Britain and this country had remained unchanged, they were bound to repay to that Fund every penny which had been borrowed and all the interest in respect thereof as it fell due.  But while the local authorities had been borrowing, our taxpayers had been providing&mdash;equally with the taxpayers of Great Britain&mdash;the resources out of which the moneys which our local authorities had borrowed had been advanced.  It is just possible that perhaps our taxpayers had provided even more than our local authorities had borrowed, and if, and whenever, the assets of the United Kingdom came to be divided, we should be entitled to a share of that part of those assets which might be represented by advances from the Local Loans Fund and the interest which thereunto might have accrued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, therefore, so far as this Local Loans Fund is concerned, <Col N="278" /> while this country might have liability in respect of the advances received from the Fund it has also a claim on the Fund in respect of that part of it which was represented by the moneys of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to Article 2 of the amending agreement signed on the 3rd of December, 1925.  The words of that Article&mdash;and I draw the attention of the House to this&mdash; whether by accident or design are very important and significant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Article states the Irish Free State is hereby released from the obligation under Article 5 of the said Articles of Agreement to assume the liability therein mentioned.  This Article quite clearly, so far as the Local Loans Fund and the Public Debt of the United Kingdom are concerned, releases Ireland from all liability, but it does not release&mdash;and this is an important point&mdash;it does not release and indemnify England against any claim which may be made upon her by Ireland under Article 5 of the Treaty.  It releases Ireland from all obligation to assume the liability mentioned in Article 5 of the Treaty, but it does not indemnify England against any claim which we may advance, and does not free her from the obligation to meet and satisfy those claims that we can show are justly due.  Now that is obviously the purpose of Article 5 of the Agreement.  It says that when the proportionate liability of Ireland in respect of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom and of War Pensions has been calculated, any just claims on the part of Ireland are to be taken into consideration in fixing the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 2 of the Amending Agreement wipes out the obligation upon Ireland's part to assume any part of the liability for the Public Debt of the United Kingdom, or for War Pensions, but it leaves Ireland's claims in their original position; it does not circumscribe or whittle them down.  The proof that Article 2 of the Amending Agreement did not affect Ireland's just claims under Article 5 is to be found in Article 10 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, which reads: &ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to make no claim in respect of any of the assets of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom including, inter alia, the Civil Contingency Fund and receipts on account of the Reparations and Inter-Allied Debts.&rdquo; Every single item referred to in Article 10 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement was an item in respect of which there was a just claim which <Col N="280" /> England would have to meet and satisfy under Article 5 of the original Treaty.  Not one of those claims was in any way wiped out by Article 2 of the Amending Agreement.  They still existed until this document known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement was signed secretly in London in March, 1926.  It was kept secret for over six months, and was only divulged at the end of that year.  The Minister has never justified that document to this House.  I say that the payment of £600,000 to which under Article 12 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement he has bound us, in so far as it lay within his power to bind this House&mdash; that obligation is not a debt of honour and is not an obligation that we are legally bound to assume. Until it is fully justified to this House, this House should not vote one penny piece to meet the obligations which the Minister for Finance accepted in his own name when he agreed to pay this annuity of £600,000 for twenty years in respect of advances to the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible the Minister may be able to justify that.  I do not see how he can justify it.  The President returned here in December, 1925, with white flags flying, and he told the House he had made a damn good bargain, had wiped out all our obligations under Article 5 of the Treaty, and that we were starting with a clean slate such as no other country in Europe possessed. He was deliberately deceiving this House and this nation. Article 11 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement is inconsistent with the statement that he made then, that we were starting with a clean slate, because Article 11 shows that we wiped Britain's slate for her, and she left us still with a responsibility under this one head alone of paying her £600,000 for twenty years. There is something very peculiar about this payment and about this whole document.  It was never submitted to the Dáil for sanction. When the matter was raised in another place and it was proposed that <Col N="281" /> an impartial and non-partisan committee should be set up to inquire into the whole question, the Minister for Finance opposed the appointment of such a committee.</P>

      <P>It may be a small part of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, but it is a part of it, and I must discuss it in relation to the whole matter.  I cannot see how I possibly could do otherwise.  We are asked to vote a sum which is payable under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, and I have referred to the whole of the settlement incidentally. I have now to refer to the fact that the Minister in another House refused to make any disclosure of the reasons for signing the Ultimate Financial Settlement, a <Col N="282" /> document which, among other sums, bound us to pay this £600,000 a year. Notwithstanding the Minister's attitude in the matter, the motion setting up this Committee in the Seanad was only defeated by the casting vote of the then Chairman.  We ask the Dáil before passing this sum to insist upon a full inquiry into this matter not, if you will, with a view to ascertaining how the sums yielded to Great Britain under the other ten or eleven Articles of the Ultimate Financial Settlement have been given away, but in order to ascertain how the sum yielded under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement has been given away.  I want the Dáil simply to get from the Minister before it votes this sum an explanation as to how he came to agree that it was rightly due to Great Britain and how he arrived at the amount in question.</P>
      <P>Even if it were held or could be shown that some payment was due to Great Britain in respect of the advances from this Local Loans Fund, surely we are entitled to know the basis upon which the amount was due or ascertained?  I ask the House to get the Minister to disclose that basis.  So far he has kept it a secret locked up in his own breast.  I think the Dáil is bound now to make him yield up that secret.  The Dáil controls the purse strings, and by tightening the purse strings in this instance they can compel the Minister, who has hitherto been dumb on this matter, to speak.  It can bend him because it can break him and his Government.  We ask him, in the proper discharge of his duty to the citizens of this country, and in the fulfilment of its obligations, not to pay one penny piece of the citizens' money where it is not rightly due. I ask Deputies not to pass this Vote until the Minister for Finance lays upon the Table of the House such papers and documents as will satisfy any impartial inquirer that we do indeed owe to Great Britain this annuity of £600,000 which under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement he has contracted to pay for a period of twenty years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider this sum here, and when we think of the debate that took place at an earlier stage to-night and a statement made by the President indicating how careful he was with public money, and how anxious he was that there should be somebody to come after him who would be equally careful and equally anxious, his speech seems to read as a huge joke.  The statements he made in the House, viewed in the light of subsequent events, seem to be rather comical. We are asked under this Vote to hand over £600,000 to the British Government each year, apparently under an agreement which has never been brought to this House for ratification, an agreement which has never been ratified by the representatives of this piece of an island. Then we are wondering where does the Minister keep all his carefulness that he is boasting about here? When we view this anxiety of the President to see that there was no money expended uselessly, and that there was no money expended that should not be expended, the President may remember the 50,000 unemployed&mdash;in fact he went as high as 80,000 to-night&mdash;when we think of the 6,000 houses towards which he could give a grant each year of £100 each if he could have kept this money at home and put it to the use to which a President and an Executive Council who were as careful of the public purse as he pretends to be, would put it, then we are left wondering still.  Why did he not devote all this money to the interests of those whom he claims to represent? I think the handing over of that £600,000 to the British Government is nothing more or less than scandalous, and it is nothing more or less than robbery of the Irish people by those who unfortunately have the handling of the purse-strings of the Irish people at the present day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how any Executive Council can coolly sit down here and propose to hand over this money to the British Government without having any authority to do so, no authority whatever, and at the same time tell the people that they have <Col N="284" /> no money for the relief of unemployment, and that they have no money for grants for the building of dwellings in rural areas, and that they have no money to give the farmers of the country any assistance whatsoever.  We are going abroad to borrow money and lend it out at 6 per cent., and at the same time we are handing out £600,000 every year ourselves to the British. That shows how generous the President and the Executive Council have always proved themselves to be except when dealing with those to whom they should be generous.  The people to whom they should be generous are our own people, who pay the piper.  The more we look at this matter, the more we come to the conclusion that the President, much as he might seek to throw dust in the eyes of the people, has by this big nought of his that he brought back from those deliberations in London, apparently got any amount of figures back of it, and on front of it, and behind it as well.  I think it is high time that the Dáil should consider this matter in a right light. The President of the Executive Council reminds me of a steward we would be leaving in charge of a farm and who would go into a fair to buy a cow to supply milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We would find that when that steward came home from the fair that we would be told about this cow and all the milk she was giving night and morning, and the milk she was giving in the evening too.  But perhaps we would after a time get into the stall, and at the end of six months or twelve months &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We would find at the end of twelve months when we would get into the stall that that animal was a bull.  That is like the President.  The President is like <Col N="285" /> that steward.  He insists all the time that he has got a good bargain, even though the good milking cow that he brought home has turned out to be a very bad bull.  That is the position of the President of the Executive Council when he comes here to us and says: &ldquo;I have got a good bargain.  I brought home a big nought, but in this Vote I am paying £600,000 every year.&rdquo; There is no doubt that the President has got a lot of good bargains for the Irish people, and they will want one day to make their regards to him for these good bargains in a way which he will have no difficulty in understanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few words which I wish to say on this Vote.  When the President this evening in his usual frivolous manner was dealing with the Vote of his own Department or Office I was rather amazed at hearing him talk about the unemployment question.  He said it was Labour's own child sometimes, and then again that it was the Fianna Fáil Party's own child.  I did not think at the time we were so near the President's disowning his own child. But coming into this House with this Estimate, it cannot be denied that this is one of the President's own children&mdash;it is rather a peculiar incident to find that so soon he had to take up the role of denying one of his own children in the most unexpected fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in view of that, we should be disposed to take a more charitable view of this Vote.  I would be in favour of having no division only for Deputy MacEntee pressing it to a division.  Because it must be admitted from all we have seen and heard and the whispering that we get on this matter of the secret financial agreement, that the President was in one of his weak moments, and that he made a mistake in coming home with that huge nought in his pocket, and that he meant well and thought he was stating the fact.  It was only afterwards he found that that huge nought was what Deputy Corry has <Col N="286" /> described.  I think that when we accept the rule of the Chair, as we are bound to on all questions, that we should take a charitable view of the President's previous statement on this matter of the financial agreement; and taking a charitable view of this thing we should, instead of voting against the President in this matter, sympathise with him on having gone once to London without having the financial experts about whom he talked so much a while ago.  One time he went as far as New Zealand for a financial expert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is wrong&mdash;Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little difference, but it is a pity that he did not go to New Zealand for some financial expert.  If he came to some Fianna Fáil Deputies at the time they would have been very charitably disposed to the President about that huge nought.  We had, in fact, such foresight in the matter that we knew that it was not a huge nought, even before the secret financial settlement was disclosed here by the Minister for Finance.  I would have been inclined to urge our Party and the Labour Party to take a charitable view of the President's mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote in respect of which there is an asset.  I find it hard to explain that to the Deputy who has just sat down.  If I took one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies to London, I would have taken one who said that we expect a sum of £19,000,000 annually to be charged.  So far as this is concerned, it is an asset to the State.  A public debt is a liability, but the Deputy will probably ignore the fact. It is a debt due in respect of the State.  This was due by the local authorities in respect of such services as labourers' cottages.  It was money advanced to the local authorities. The sum that will come in this year is about £617,000.  That will have to be paid in the ordinary way, as it is due by the local authorities.  We are discharged from the liability, and this is a gain.</P>

I said that I had a document which showed that the British Government were putting in a claim for £19,000,000, and, because I saw that they were putting in a claim for that amount, I knew the type that they had shown themselves in the past to be, and I expected that they were going to squeeze people like the President.</P>

      <P>When the President suggests that we on this side made ridiculous statements, that we expected that this sum of money would be paid, we are entitled to make clear what we did say, and to give the basis for our statement.  In the 1920 Act you have a sum of £18,000,000 mentioned.  This £19,000,000 referred to was the correction of that, and the amount was brought up to date.  That was for Ireland as a whole, of which 13.7 was to be our share.  Therefore we concluded that there was going to be a claim put in by England for a large share of money, and we warned the Irish people what would be the consequences, and what would happen unless strong action was taken by them to see that their representatives carefully guarded their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference somewhere in Article 5 of the Treaty to Ireland's share of the liabilities for the Public Debt of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  From these liabilities a later agreement freed us on certain considerations. Now here we are, having been freed from these liabilities to meet the Public Debt of the United Kingdom, contributing an annual sum for such purpose; money coming from the local authorities to the central authorities here; money coming in from local loans.  These are naturally the revenues of the State, and should be retained as such, and to hand them over is simply to hand over money which belongs to the Irish people&mdash;handing them over unnecessarily to England.  There is no justification for it.  As was pointed out by Deputy MacEntee, if there <Col N="290" /> was a basis of distributing liabilities with the assets, then you could simply take part of it and say: &ldquo;Oh yes, for this particular part you can have assets.&rdquo;  There should be a proper distribution of the assets and a proper estimate of the total assets and liabilities.  On such a basis we are not asked to pay this particular sum.  As I see it, the payment of this sum is not justified.  No member on the opposite benches has justified it.  We, at any rate, are not going to take any responsibility whatever for it, and we intend to vote against the Estimate.</P>

The moneys paid by the local authorities go into the funds of the Irish Free State, and are credited to the Free State.</P>

      <P>There are three different points involved.  The first question is whether the money was advanced to local authorities, and have they got value for it?  The second is whether they incurred any liability, and have they got the assets?  The third point is whether they have to discharge the liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This money was advanced under an Act of 1887 passed by the political unit called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  The money was due to the National Debt Commissioners acting under the Parliament.  That political unit ceased to exist when the Treaty came into operation.  The money would be no longer paid to the Exchequer of the unit.</P>

      <P>Exactly, if I took him into Court and satisfied him.  I say that we should take up that attitude in regard to the British Government. Here is money we have and no Government has a right to get it from us.  They have not proved their title to it.  I submit, therefore, that it is a very injudicious matter for the Government to concede its title to the money in this manner by voting this money either on this or any other occasion.  Let the money remain here until some liability to pay has been proved.  There is no international agreement under which we have to pay it.  No such international agreement exists. There is no law enacted by the Dáil directing the Executive Council or ordering the payment of this money, in this manner.  The ultimate financial agreement, which is the only document mentioned has no legal status.  It has no more binding force than an agreement between <Col N="293" /> myself and Deputy Sheehy to contribute £10 to the funds of Skibbereen Urban Council would have.</P>

For instance, with regard to the Economic Committee, I do not know whether there are any sittings at the moment.  I think the President did suggest to the House that he would call it together again.

      <P>That is rather regrettable, because we had a word to-day about that particular emanation from the brain of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That committee, which apparently had not been quite moribund, has been moribund at any rate since the famous North City Dublin Election. Of course we are not entitled to refer to that.  I have nothing more to say, except that I hope the President will be able to tell us when the Economic Committee is to meet again, and also possibly to justify the continuance of the Central Saving Committee.  There is a considerable sum of money being expended upon that particular activity. I should like the Minister for Finance to justify that to the House, to show whether the committee has really been productive of results.  I am inclined to think that if everything that we have been told about the growing credit of the State is true, that whatever moneys have been invested in savings certificates would have been invested independent of any action which this Committee have taken.  Before we could allow this Vote to pass unchallenged, we should have from the Minister for Finance some justification, at any rate, for the expenditure under sub-head B.</P>

It states &ldquo;the Irish Free State hereby assumes all liability undertaken by the British Government in respect of malicious damage done since the Twenty-first day of January, nineteen hundred and nineteen, to property in the area now under the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State, and the Government of the Irish Free State shall repay to the British Government at such time or times and in such manner as may be agreed upon moneys already paid by the British Government in respect of such damage or liable to be so paid under obligations already incurred.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two obligations assumed under that Article.  First of all there is a liability for the liabilities undertaken by the British Government in respect of malicious damage done since the 21st of January, 1919, and there is the obligation to recoup the British Government any sums which they had already paid in respect of such damage.  Looking at sub-head A of the Estimate, I see here that the compensation is in respect of damage to property during the period 21st of January, 1919, to the 11th of July, 1921, inclusive.  Surely some of the compensation there is paid in respect of liability which was originally divided between the Free State and the British Government and has now been assumed by the Free State in toto.  I would like to know from the Minister if I am right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed in toto because we are paying back what the British paid by the £250,000 annuity. <Col N="302" /> As a matter of fact they had already made arrangements which liquidated their liabilities in respect of that. Our assumption of the liability which they hitherto bore simply consists in paying them back.</P>

      <P>That is information that we were anxious to elicit. We were anxious to elicit whether any moneys granted under this Vote were paid because of the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925.  I think in view of that that we cannot allow the Vote to pass without challenge.  We do not think, as I have already explained to the House, that the President in first putting the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act before the House was quite candid and fair.  He said that we had made a damn good bargain, and that all our liability under Article 5 had been wiped out.  If that is so, the Ultimate Financial Settlement should not have been signed. It was signed, and the Government have come to this House and asked us to grant money for that financial settlement.  In view of that, we think that information which should have been laid before the House was kept from it, and that the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act was passed by the House in those circumstances. Accordingly we do not think we would be justified, as I said, in allowing without challenge the payment of any sum which arises out of that particular item, and we will have to oppose this Vote.</P>

      <P>In connection with sub-head B, I want to raise the case of seizure of cattle which took place in 1923.  The cattle belonged to a constituent of mine.  I think what happened took place between the 12th July, 1921, and the 12th May, 1923.  This man had cattle grazing on the estate of Colonel Chichester for some years before the Ministry came in 1923 and seized his cattle. He afterwards took an action against the Minister for Defence, but the case went against him simply because the Indemnity Act was pleaded.  The jury found that the man had a right to have cattle grazing there, and also that the amount he was claiming was the correct amount&mdash;namely, £484.  They also found that the Indemnity Act did apply in this case, but they recommended this man, Mr. Reynolds, of Renamore, in the County Roscommon, to the consideration of the Government. The counsel for the Government at the time was Mr. Lynch, K.C., and he said the wish of the jury would be conveyed to the proper quarter.  This man lost cattle to the value of £484, and he got £144 for them, and he had to pay £150 costs.  The answer he got from the Department of Defence to the representations made by the State counsel was that there were no funds to meet his case.  I think that was a shame in a case like that, where an illegal thing had been done that is only made legal by the Indemnity Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing this up now because this man told me that in addition to having lost his cattle that year he had been decreed for the rent.  Now he has to emigrate.  I think it is a disgrace to plead the Indemnity Act in a case like that, where a man was entitled to have his cattle there, and when he had been paying rent for a few years before that.  I had a communication from the Department of Defence saying they could do nothing in the matter.  I do not know whether anything can be done, but I think it is a great hardship that a man like that has to leave the country owing to a decree having been obtained against him after his cattle <Col N="304" /> had been wrongly seized.  The Indemnity Act was never meant to cover a case of that sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the manner in which these compensation claims have been met.  A Commission was sent over here to inquire into these cases, and it went to West Cork area.  A gentleman was sent down there, and he demanded in the first instance of the people whose property he came to examine that the body of his nephew &mdash;who he said was killed in the area &mdash;should be forthcoming, and if not they would get no compensation.  As a matter of fact, they got no compensation whatsoever.  I do not know who has the appointment of these gentlemen who are sent down as inspectors; but I know that in several cases they were the actual individuals who came raiding there before the Truce.  I do not think that the matter has been properly met at all, or that justice has been done to those people whose property was destroyed during those periods.  As to sub-head B, I think it is cheeky on the part of the Executive Council, after bringing over British 18-pounders here and shelling down a <Col N="305" /> couple of million pounds worth of property in Dublin, not to mind what they destroyed outside of Dublin, for the privilege of paying this Ultimate Financial Settlement to Britain, to come to the Dáil afterwards for money for the property they shelled and destroyed.  It is all very well to look for a lot of things, but I hope they will not get them.</P>
      <P>Then as regards &ldquo;expenses in connection with the investigation, defence, and discharge of claims in respect of damage to or loss of property between 21st January, 1919, and 12th May, 1923, inclusive,&rdquo; I presume that is for the payment of valuers and engineers.  The sum amounts to £920.  I wonder was it out of that fund expenses were paid to gentlemen like the gentleman I mentioned a few moments ago; a gentleman who was apparently sent down not so much to see the damage that was done as to find out other matters in connection with the activities of the I.R.A. during the pre-Truce period, and who went down there apparently paid by the Free State Government for that purpose?</P>

      <P>Sub-head A deals with compensation in respect of death or injuries sustained within the period 21st January, 1919, to the 12th May, 1923, in cases within the terms of reference of the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee. The provision made in this sub-head is intended to meet ex gratia payments made as a result of the recommendation of the Committee in respect of death or injuries sustained <Col N="307" /> within the period 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, inclusive. The provision represents almost entirely the annual amount of the periodical allowances made on the recommendation of the Committee. There are also ex gratia payments heretofore sanctioned by the British Government in respect of injuries sustained by certain non-combatants in Easter Week, 1916.  It is probable that the same body that makes claims under this Vote makes claims against the British Government.  I want to say that most of these claims are altogether fictitious and are exaggerated to a great extent.  There was a case where a man claimed £400 which was sent back by the Council to make the claim £4,000, and he got £3,000.  That is going on every day.</P>

They are cases that to my mind do not look well for any Government claiming to have national aspirations.  They are the cases of dependents of Volunteers who were killed during the fighting before the Truce.  Unfortunately some of them at present, to the disgrace of the Government that is in power, are absolutely destitute. They are in the position that they have to get home assistance from the Cork Board of Assistance.  That is a state of affairs that should not exist.  I do not like to be bringing it up here, but I have to do so when I can get no satisfaction anywhere else.  I consider that cases like that should not exist, particularly with a Government which is so generous in other directions.  Unfortunately we have several cases of that description in my constituency.  I would ask the Minister definitely to state whether these cases are going to be redressed or not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  In dealing with this Estimate I should remind the House that the amount charged against sub-head N has to be taken into consideration with the amount charged under sub-head LL, and also the amount voted under Vote 32, because they all more or less relate to the same thing. They relate to the true cost of maintaining the present police system in this country, because in order to arrive at that, we have not only to take into consideration the present cost of the police force, as it exists, but also the amount we have to pay for the steps which we took in order to bring that force into being.  If we take these two sums together, we find that the present cost of the police system is something like £2,839,008.  Having secured that figure we are able to institute a rather startling but illuminating comparison.  The year 1919-20 was not at all a normal year from the point of view either of the jailor or the policeman; it was the year, as a matter of fact, in which the British Government threw away the last pretence that the Royal Irish Constabulary existed here as anything else but an army of repression.  It was the last year in which the strength of that force in officers and men was disclosed to the public, and the strength of the force in that particular year marked a considerable increase over the strength of the force in 1918, and in 1917.  Therefore, as I say, we may take it from the point of view of ordinary police work, that as the strength of that <Col N="310" /> force was excessive so the cost of it was excessive also.  I find in that year the cost of the Royal Irish Constabulary and of the police magistracy for the area of the whole of the Twenty-six Counties, according to the British White Paper published in May, 1920, was £2,662,000, and if we deduct £100,000 from that as representing the cost of the police magistrates we find that the total cost of the Royal Irish Constabulary in the year 1919-20 was £2,562,000.  As I said, that cost was altogether excessive.</P>
      <P>But it is very much less if we take-into consideration the appreciation which has taken place in the value of money since then and what the present police system costs.  In view of that fact I submit that every element in that cost should be carefully scrutinised. Unfortunately, we are not, because the House has already passed a Vote&mdash;£1,596,000, I think&mdash; in respect of the Gárda Síochána, able to deal with the largest factor in the costs, but the one which we are dealing with now is a very large factor, and we should not pass this unless we are satisfied that we are clearly bound to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we bound to pay the amount charged against sub-head N of this Vote, and if so, how does that obligation arise?  The terms of the sub-head are as follow:&mdash;&ldquo;Repayment to British Government in respect of ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.&rdquo; You will note that there are two classes of pensions to be provided for&mdash;ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions.  Now, whatever may be said in regard to disbandment pensions, how does the Minister justify his assumption of an obligation to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of the cost of the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary?  There was not a word about those ordinary pensions in the Treaty, not a word about them in the Agreement dated the 3rd December, 1925, which amended the Treaty, and there was not a word about them until the Ultimate Financial Settlement which was signed on, I think, the 16th <Col N="311" /> March, 1926, a settlement which the Minister kept secret from this House, and which, either from a sense of shame or a consciousness of utter inability, he had refused to justify or even to discuss in this House.</P>
    <P>Under Head 11 of that Ultimate Financial Settlement, the Minister for Finance, of his own volition and in his own discretion, agreed to saddle the country with an obligation in respect of these ordinary pensions in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of the pensions and compensation allowances payable to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary under the Constabulary Acts (not under the Treaty), subject to the exception mentioned in Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first thing to note about this Agreement is that its terms differ substantially from the terms of Article 10 of the Treaty, the exact words of which are:&mdash;&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of police forces and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance thereof.&rdquo;  Article 10 referred to, therefore, and was applicable only to such members of the police forces who might be actually serving at the moment when the forces were taken over by the Government of the Irish Free State.  The 11th head of the Ultimate Financial Settlement was much more comprehensive, and covered not only the members of the police force retiring or discharged under the change of Government, but all ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, irrespective of the date of their retirement or discharge, and dealt with the pensions payable to them under the Constabulary Acts.</P>
    <P>What justification has the Minister to offer for that change?  Whatever <Col N="312" /> burden Article 10 of the Treaty may be considered to impose on us, quite clearly, as any Deputy who considers the Article as I have quoted it will be constrained to admit, it did not impose any responsibility, obligation, or liability in respect of ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who retired prior to the date of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to show me in the Treaty or in the amending agreement anything which compels him to accept any responsibility whatever, even to a farthing, for the pensions of members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who retired prior to the Treaty.  Yet the Minister for Finance, in the Ultimate Financial Settlement and in this Vote which he proposes to the House, accepts the responsibility for these pensions to the extent of 75 per cent. of them. Why?  The Minister may have very good reasons to offer, though in view of his attitude upon this matter some years ago I very much doubt it.  All I can say&mdash;and I think that every independent Deputy will agree with me&mdash;is that I can conceive no reasons which would justify the course which the Minister has taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>In all the long years since its establishment, what services did the Royal Irish Constabulary Force render this country that its members should receive such signal recognition from the Minister?  Sir Hamar Greenwood, Ian MacPherson, Lord Balfour when he was Mr. Balfour, Buckshot Forster&mdash;those gentlemen had a good deal to say for the Royal Irish Constabulary.  The Royal Irish Constabulary served them faithfully and well.  They were, as their English paymasters were often proud to state, faithful to their salt.  They allowed no claim of country, no call of kin, to deter them from carrying out the orders of their paymasters. We know that homes were not inviolate; that altars were not sacred to these men, if a raid upon the one or a desecration upon the other would advance them a step in the Judas-like service which they had undertaken.  And it is for the pensions of men like these that the Minister <Col N="313" /> took responsibility in the very years when he was paring and scraping away the miserable pittance which the State allows the poorest and neediest of its citizens.</P>
    <P>I say this action of the Minister in those circumstances cannot be justified; and that, upon that ground if upon no other, the House should refuse the amount asked for under this sub-head and should refuse the whole amount, because there was no allocation of the moneys as between ordinary pensions and the disbandment pensions.</P>
    <P>So far I have confined myself to the question as to whether or not we should not make the payment in respect of ordinary pensions which this sub-head covers.  I would like to ask the House now to consider its responsibility for the disbandment pensions in respect of which also a repayment is to be made.  How do we become responsible for these disbandment pensions?  Any responsibility we may have, that is, if we have any at all, arises from Article 10 of the Treaty, and to that Article I would again direct your attention. The Article reads: &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of the police forces, and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we omit the qualifying words and the words which do not refer to the police force, that Article may be read concisely in this way: The Government agrees to pay fair compensation to members of the police force who are discharged by it, or who retire in consequence of the change of Government.  Those words are very important.  It is plain that they relate to the one set of persons, and that they contemplate or envisage those persons under one and the same condition, and that condition is, in the service, and in the service only, of the Government of the Irish Free State.  It is obvious that the Treaty contemplated that <Col N="314" /> the Government of the so-called United Kingdom, as one of the parties to the instrument, shall hand over as a going concern to the other party, that is, to the Government of the Irish Free State, the whole machinery of government in this country, lock, stock and barrel.  That is a very important condition&mdash;that the whole machinery of government in this country is to be handed over to the Government of the Irish Free State absolutely without reservation. That is the primary, fundamental condition of the whole Treaty agreement, and it is a condition precedent to the operation of every other provision in that contract, for every other provision in that contract is secondary and, consequently, provisional only.  If the primary condition be not fulfilled in respect of any department or service of government administration in this country, then such department or service could not come within the scope of the secondary and consequential provisions, and those provisions could not in any circumstances apply to it.  That is quite clear from the words, &ldquo;discharged by it, or who retire.&rdquo;  Quite obviously the Government of the Irish Free State could not discharge any public servant unless the service in which he was engaged had come under its control by transfer or contract.</P>

      <P>That is a unique tribute.  I hope if the Deputy is awake that he is listening.  I was saying that quite obviously the Government <Col N="315" /> of the Irish Free State could not discharge any public servant, unless the service on which he was engaged had come under its control, by transfer or otherwise. No matter how desirous the Provisional Government may have been to discharge some members of the R.I.C., not a single one of these members could be discharged by it so long as that service was under the control of the British or Imperial Government. In order that he might be discharged by the Free State Government, a public servant would have to come under its control, whether by transfer of the service in which he was, or by changing into a service which had been transferred. If it had been ever contemplated that the provisions of this section would apply, irrespective of whether the service had been transferred to the Government of the Free State or not, the phrase would have been: &ldquo;who are discharged or who retire.&rdquo; If this obligation to assume responsibility for compensation allowances is to apply to a public servant, irrespective of whether he had been transferred or not, then the words would have been, &ldquo;who are discharged or who retire.&rdquo;  But in this case the words actually used in the Treaty are, &ldquo;who are discharged by it&rdquo;&mdash;the Government of the Irish Free State&mdash;or who voluntarily retire from its service. But just as the Irish Free State could not accept responsibility for a public servant discharged from the service of another State by that State, neither could it accept responsibility for a public servant who retired from the service of another State.  More patent still, nor could it accept responsibility for a public servant who was forced by that other State to retire from its service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing these facts in mind, let us investigate the position of the R.I.C. in 1922 and see whether that force fulfilled the conditions which would bring it within the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty.  In this connection we have to cite, first of all, the Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions) Order, which is dated 1st <Col N="316" /> April, 1922.  Clause 10 of this Order reads: &ldquo;Nothing in this Order shall transfer to the Provisional Government the R.I.C., or the administration of that force.&rdquo;  That is clear and definite.  At that date, when a considerable number of other services were being transferred, this service was withheld by the British Government, and there is no subsequent Order nullifying that reservation and transferring the R.I.C. to the control of the Provisional Government or any subsequent Government of the Free State.  Until it was disbanded in 1922 that force remained completely and unreservedly under the control of Great Britain.  There may have been very good reasons for not transferring the R.I.C. to the Provisional Government &mdash;reasons which overrode all other considerations&mdash;but if there were, they were reasons which affected Great Britain alone.  That country, for instance, may have thought it desirable not to part with the administration and control of the force lest the documents and records connected with it might pass into unfriendly and at that time rather dubious Irish hands, or lest its members, to curry favour with their new masters, might divulge the secret history and operations of the force during the few years which preceded the Treaty.  The British thought that possibly the then members of the R.I.C. might be faithful to their salt; that their allegiance and fidelity would pass from the salt-box, and, therefore, it was decided not to transfer the force.  So long as it existed its members were to remain under the old control and to receive their pay and, after disbandment, their pensions from their old paymasters. What other reason was there for the peculiar action taken in this case except to retain these men, even as pensioners, in their allegiance to the British Government; to make it appear to these men that these pensions came to them from the British Government?</P>
    <P>If Great Britain, for reasons, of policy decided to adopt that course, then Great Britain should be made <Col N="317" /> by this House to accept all the disadvantages of that course.  If she had transferred that force before disbandment, I might not, at this moment, be prepared to contest that this House and Government of the Free State would have been responsible for paying disbandment pensions to the Royal Irish Constabulary. But since the force was not transferred, and since, quite clearly, the provisions of Article 10 of the Treaty covered only those men or those public servants who are either discharged by the Government of the Irish Free State from its service, or who voluntarily retire from the service of that Government, and no other government whatsoever, what became of the force?</P>
    <P>As I have shown, the control was retained in British hands; the force remained a British force even after the Provisional Government was set up.  It never became an Irish service in the way other departments of the State became Irish services, it remained a British force until disbanded at a date in 1922 by an Act of the British Parliament dated 1922.  Section one of that Act is rather peculiar.  It provides that the Royal Irish Constabulary shall be disbanded at such date, not being later than the 31st August, 1922, as may be fixed by the Lord Lieutenant.  It is not the Provisional Government or any other Government of the Irish Free State which is to disband these men; it is the British Government acting through the British Parliament by an Act of that legislature which decrees that the Royal Irish Constabulary shall be disbanded on such a date, not being later than the 31st August, 1922, as may be fixed by the Lord Lieutenant.  And on or before that date, the Act goes on to say, &ldquo;every officer and constable shall retire from the force as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant, and shall, on his retirement, be entitled to receive such compensation as may be awarded by the Treasury in accordance with the rules contained in Part I. of the schedule to the Act,&rdquo; not by the Government of the Irish <Col N="318" /> Free State under Article 10 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to some of the words of that section which I have emphasised: &ldquo;Every officer and constable shall retire from the force, as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant.&rdquo;  That is compulsory retirement; it is not voluntary retirement as contemplated by the Treaty. These men had not the option to remain in this force or to leave; they were compelled to leave; they were forced to retire; there was nothing voluntary about the thing.  They were forced to retire, I repeat again, not by the Government of the Irish Free State, but by the Lord Lieutenant, the representative of the British Government in this country acting upon a British Act of Parliament. The officers and men of that force had no discretion in the matter; they had no option or election; they had to go when they were told to go and they were told to go not by the Government of the Irish Free State but by the Imperial Government acting through the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>To get back to Article 10 of the Treaty.  It is quite clear that when the words &ldquo;who are discharged by it or who retire&rdquo; were inserted in that Article only two positions were contemplated, the first position being that of a public servant who was discharged from a transferred service by the new Government, and the second, that of a public servant who left a transferred service of his own volition.  In the first case the individual had no option, and the essence of the whole matter lay in the coercion and compulsion which was used upon him.  In the second case, however, the case of the individual who retired, a complete right resided in the individual to continue in the service of the new Government or to leave it as he chose to elect, and the essence of his whole position was that the choice lay unreservedly with it.  No such choice lay with the officers and men of the R.I.C. when disbanded.  They were compelled to retire as required by the Lord Lieutenant; they had no <Col N="319" /> will, option or choice in the matter, and they were, in fact, discharged by Great Britain and not by the Government of the Irish Free State, and they did not retire within the meaning of Article 10 of the Treaty, and if they did not retire within the meaning of Article 10 of the Treaty how can this House be in any way responsible for compensating them in the manner provided under Article 10 of the Treaty?</P>
    <P>I have shown there was nothing in the Treaty and nothing in any subsequent document, with the exception of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, which compels us to accept responsibility for the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  I have, I think, likewise proved that the course of action the British Government followed in regard to that force definitely excluded its members from benefit under Article 10 of the Treaty, and, therefore, in no way, neither as a debt of honour nor as a contractual obligation, are we called upon to pay any sum now, in the present circumstances of the State, to the British Government in respect to the ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary. And as we are not compelled, either in honour or by contract, to pay this sum of £1,750,000 asked for under this sub-head, I submit that unless a clear, unshakeable case is put before this House to justify that payment, the House would be lacking in its duty to the people who sent us here if it allows the Vote contained under this sub-head to pass the Dáil this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by pointing out that the Ultimate Financial Settlement has nothing to do with the main question here.  In connection with this matter, in the discussions for the Ultimate Financial Settlement, I want to say that the only point under discussion was the percentage, whether the division of the charge as to the police responsibility as it were between Northern Ireland and the Saorstát was properly 25 per cent. and 75 <Col N="320" /> per cent. or some other percentage. The principle of making the payment was not under consideration at that time at all.  Deputy MacEntee is, of course, entirely wrong when he says that that was the first time he heard of it.  From the very first issue of our volume of Estimates, provision was made for this payment.  In the first volume, printed in December, 1922, a sum of £1,500,000 was provided for.  Article 10 had nothing whatever to do with the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 10 really provided for the protection of transferred officers.  These individual men were not transferred.  In the Treaty there is no provision for the actual taking over by the Saorstát of many of the arrangements that had to be made.  Actually all the details of the transfers are set out in the Transfer of Functions Order which was agreed to between the two Governments.  The principle of the Transfer of Functions Order was to transfer the assets and liabilities.  Very considerable assets were taken over, some of them of a very large amount.  The liabilities were taken over also.  Article 12 of the Transfer of Functions Order says: &ldquo;Any property assets, rights and liabilities, connected with the Functions transferable under this Order or connected only with those Functions to be transferred to the Provisional Government, and in connection partly with these Functions and partly with other Functions. shall be apportioned in such manner as may be agreed between the two Governments concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the police were transferred.  Part of the police force was transferred and part was not. The D.M.P. were transferred and the R.I.C. were not, but the functions of the police were transferred.  The R.I.C. were disbanded by agreement with the Provisional Government. Under that Article the pension liability which we had been discussing <Col N="321" /> became a liability of the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  It is one of the factors which was taken into account and which lies at the root of the agreement of December, 1925.  I will just quote again a short passage that I quoted from the President's speech of the 10th December, 1925.  That is the passage that I quoted when the land annuities were being discussed.  The President said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am proud to say, and let whoever likes make political capital out of it, that we met honest, just and generous people to make a case to.  The Irregulars can go out now if they like and sound that throughout the country.  I am going to tell the truth in connection with these negotiations&mdash;the whole truth.  We explained that we were paying out three and a quarter millions a year for land held by our people, more than half of them occupying uneconomic holdings.  We explained that we were sending out of the country a million and a quarter in pensions, and we told the British Ministers &lsquo;you can if you like assess us for ten, twenty, thirty millions; we will not be able to pay.  Is it any advantage to your country to make us bankrupt?  We are not standing for repudiation. We are prepared to bear our burden; we are bearing at present and will be bearing for a long time an undue burden and we are not honestly able to pay a single penny.&rsquo;  It was accepted in good faith, and that finished Article 5.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This lies at the root of the agreement by which Article 5 was wiped out.  Apart from any other factor, these payments could not be repudiated without reopening the whole settlement by which Article 5 was wiped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has just read out an extract of a statement made at the time when Article 5 of the Treaty was wiped out by the agreement of 1925. I got a few words of that statement. One was that he was going to tell <Col N="322" /> the truth, the whole truth about the negotiations that led up to the settlement called the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  I would like to know if that has been done, and that the truth and the whole truth has been told about that settlement. My recollection of the various discussions that took place was that the Minister refused to give any explanation whatever relating to the negotiations that led up to that settlement, and the remaining portion of the statement that he read indicated what did happen when this Ultimate Financial Settlement was made with Great Britain.  Instead of going to the British Minister, standing upon their obvious rights and putting their rights up in the proper manner the Government went with an ad misericordiam appeal and asked the British Ministers to deal lightly with them, and because they went in that way they &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When this Vote appeared upon the Estimates for the first time it was accompanied by a note to the effect that &ldquo;it has been agreed provisionally that the Saorstát will repay 75 per cent. of the pensions without prejudice to the Ultimate Financial Settlement.&rdquo;  We are now informed that that relates to the percentage as the Ministry had apparently given in previously on the matter of the principle.  I must confess I did think the justification we offered for the payment of the R.I.C. pensions was Article 10 of the Treaty.  I thought the Minister would rely on some misinterpretation of that Article in order to justify the payment.  I did not expect the explanation now offered because it seems to me so nonsensical as to be incapable of <Col N="323" /> having at any time received the serious consideration of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Functions Order definitely provided that the control and administration of the R.I.C. should be transferred to the Provisional Government.  It did provide the charges upon the Central and the Consolidated Fund, the assets and liabilities, and that the transferred functions would be transferred to the Provisional Government, and it also made certain other arrangements. But it did not state, nor could it have stated, that the principle was decided by the Treaty that the Free State Government would pay the pensions due in respect to the R.I.C. which were not transferred to that Government.  Even if the Transfer of Functions Order had stated that, it could not supersede the Treaty Confirmation of Agreement Act.  An Act of Parliament cannot be superseded by an Order in Council and there is nothing in the Treaty which places on the Free State Government the responsibility to pay 75 per cent. of the disbandment pensions or the ordinary pensions of the R.I.C. There is nothing in that Treaty or in the only other agreement extant between this country and Britain which has received ratification from this House and, because there is nothing, there is no obligation on the Dáil to make this payment.  We have the money and we should hold it.  If Britain can prove that the interpretation of the Treaty involves the payment of this money, let her prove it to our satisfaction and the payment will continue to be met so long as the Treaty continues to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why we should take it for granted that whenever a matter in dispute arises we are bound to get the worst of it I do not know. Apparently that has been the position in the Ministry.  When those who took an interest in the matter in 1923 thought it was provisionally agreed to pay 75 per cent. we knew the agreement was more than provisional. We knew that once the <Col N="324" /> English had got an arrangement it was a permanent thing.  Now we realise it is an entirely unnecessary arrangement involving payment to be made by the Irish taxpayer which that taxpayer is utterly unable to provide.  It seems to me that in this and in other matters the Executive Council were only too anxious to give in to every point raised by the British Ministers in order, no doubt, to strengthen the connection between the two countries and to show their love for the Imperial bond. They are, in fact, taking less from Britain than Britain was prepared to offer when she signed the Treaty. I know there is no use in asking the Dáil to reject this Estimate because the majority of Deputies will do just what the Ministers ask. We hope at some future time it will be realised that the Government are asking the Irish people to bear a burden which they cannot possibly bear.</P>

In opposing this Vote I have in mind an aged father and mother, one of whose boys died in order that the Ministers should occupy their present position. The father and mother are at present depending on 8/- per week home assistance.  The Executive Council hands over £1,750,000 to those who were the servants of a foreign State, while at the same time they are refusing to meet the requirements of our own people.  The Minister for Finance has refused an appeal on behalf of the dependents of those who died for their country.</P>

      <P>I will give a table of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1922-23 when, as Deputies are aware, conditions were abnormal, the amount voted was £220,000 and the amount expended £118,762.  In 1923-24 the amount voted was £50,000 and the amount expended was £39,236.  In 1924-25 the amount voted was £25,000 and <Col N="330" /> the amount expended £19,665.  In 1925-26 there was £20,000 voted and £8,995 expended.  In 1926-27 £14,000 was voted and £2,970 expended.  In 1927-28 £10,000 was voted and £6,649 expended.  In 1928-29 the sum voted was £10,000 and the expenditure £5,570.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amount expended last year was only half that voted and the amount spent the year before was three-quarters of that voted, I wonder why a vote of £10,000 is being asked for this year. Of course there has been, as the Minister has said, a great decrease in the amounts voted and the amounts expended since 1922-23, and it is not possible in any country to get an account of the method by which such moneys are expended.  I wonder could the Minister tell us what percentage of the amount voted is for criminal investigation and what percentage for political espionage?  We all agree that on criminal investigation work secret service is necessary in any country, but, when used in certain directions and on certain occasions, that money might lead to harm rather than to good.  There is one case, at least, about which we are not satisfied and that is the Seán Harling case, despite all references made to it here in cross-fire and otherwise and in the implications of certain kinds.  I do not think that the country is satisfied that that individual was not, for some time at least, an agent provocateur.  If the Minister could give us what percentage of the money goes to political espionage and what percentage to proper criminal investigation, also what amount is spent in the Free State and what amount is spent outside it, it might be some enlightenment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that the Minister could not make a clear distinction between what has <Col N="331" /> been spent on criminal investigations and what has been spent on secret service because neither of these services is very different.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of the State is a very different thing from the point of view of criminals and from the point of view of persons who might be foreigners, who might be in some way or another trying to interfere with the safety of the State, to use the words of the Minister, and it is due to the very fact that the two things are mixed up together that such deplorable acts have occurred.  For instance, the condition of the County Clare at present, if one might judge from the reports, is anything but what one would desire.  This body, which we cannot define exactly as one thing or another, is acting in a way which is undoubtedly causing a very considerable amount of trouble.  I think it is largely due to the fact that the Minister allows politics to get mixed up with, for instance, questions of criminal investigation.  There is no attempt to define some principle of distinction between political offences and crime in the ordinary sense. Things have been done by the officials, call them what you like or give them whatever functions you like.  Acts of violence have taken place.  References have been made to them on other Votes and the results have been most deplorable. I think that in view of the fact that the Minister will not make a clear distinction for us about these Votes it is necessary for us to vote against this Estimate altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said <Col N="332" /> he could assure the House that no money was spent on agents provocateur. Will he deny that in the case of Harling, he himself in his evidence admitted that he had suggested raids on certain offices and tried to organise them?  If that is not the action of an agent provocateur I do not know what is.  I suggest that the Government would be very wise if it reconsidered its whole attitude of employing touts and people like Harling.  I believe, and I said it 18 months ago, that the Government have deliberately gone out on a certain provocative policy with regard to certain people, this business of raiding for arms, for instance.  The other day I heard a story of an old Fenian who had a dump.  He would not tell anyone where it was.  For 40 years he kept the secret.  He died, and the dump remained there.  I believe if the Government adopted some policy like that the dumps would remain where they are and a lot of the arms would be rusted, but the very fact that they employ touts is a sort of stimulus to people to look after those arms and to keep them right. There has been trouble, shootings have taken place on both sides as a result directly of those people going around.  I really believe that a lot of them are paid out of this secret service money.  I have only the one case, the Harling case, that has come up.  I believe the Government have put people into those organisations, and I would not be surprised if they encouraged them to some activities. I have not any proof of that, but I believe that is one of the functions carried out by people provided with money out of this Secret Service Vote, and the Government ought to alter their policy in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that the Minister for Finance could not find anything to say in justification of this Vote, and that <Col N="335" /> he merely contents himself with moving it, hoping that the Dáil, in its charity, would pass it.  This is one of the few institutions established by the present Government which clearly reflects the ability of the Government to deal with the financial problems which confront the State.  The main objection which Deputies on this side of the House have to the passing of this money is because they believe that the institution for which the money is about to be voted was established to delay and not to facilitate the granting of protection to the industries of this country which require protection.  It only requires a brief survey of the history of the Commission since its establishment to realise the truth of that statement.  When it was established, in the year 1926, a number of industrial groups made application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the imposition of import duties upon goods in the manufacture of which they were concerned, and these applications were duly and automatically referred by the Minister to the Tariff Commission.  Up to date, four of these applications have been reported on, and, at the rate of progress made in respect of these four applications, we probably will be discussing the estimate for the Tariff Commission for the year 1939 before the last of these applications made in the year 1926 will have been finally disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the intentions of the Government are with respect to the Commission, and it would be well, I think, if the Minister for Finance would give us some information concerning it.  We would be glad to know, for example, if the Government consider that the operations of the Tariff Commission have been satisfactory, and that the machinery has worked smoothly and is likely to work smoothly in all cases. Towards the end of last year and early this year rumours were in circulation that the existing Commissioners proposed to retire when the period of their appointments expired. That period is now over, and it is <Col N="336" /> presumed that they have been appointed for another three years. These are three Civil Servants who occupy high positions in their respective departments, and it is to be assumed that they have duties to do in these departments that will occupy the greater portion of their time. Because of the fact that they have these duties to perform in addition to the duties which fall upon them as members of the Tariff Commission, we must only conclude that one or other of those conflicting sets of duties is bound to be neglected. From the evidence which we have had during the present session it is really the duties relating to the Commission which are being neglected. For the last two and a half years that Commission has been considering an application for a tariff on woollen cloth.  It produced its report in February and certain matters arising out of that have, we understand, not yet been settled.</P>
    <P>The work done by the Commission during last year at any rate is not such as to inspire Deputies with confidence in the members of it or in the effectiveness of the machine which they control.  As far as one can judge from the Estimates of this year, it is proposed that the work to be done during the financial year will be even less than the work done in the previous financial year.  In the Commission's Estimate it will be seen that the fees to be paid to expert advisers show a reduction of £200.  If there is one thing that Tariff Commissioners require above everything else it is expert advice, and if the fees are curtailed they cannot get the expert advice that would enable them to proceed with the applications that are at present before them in the course of the financial year.  That is if they intend to proceed to the consideration of any of the applications before them or rest upon their laurels and take a well-deserved holiday, after arduous duties in considering and reporting upon the application for a tariff on woollen cloth.</P>
    <P>It is to be noticed, however, that the travelling expenses show an increase, so it may be that the Commissioners <Col N="337" /> intend to take a holiday which members of the Dáil would be very glad to see them take, if they could be satisfied that the work of protecting Irish industry would not be held up in consequence of that. The cost of advertisements is to be reduced.  That is a matter of very minor importance because, apparently, nobody pays much attention to the advertisements they insert.  The Estimate for special reporting shows a very considerable reduction. It would appear from that that the number of public sessions&mdash; I presume that item of reporting relates to the public sessions&mdash;will be much fewer this year than they were last year, and that the greater part of the Commission's work, if any, will be done in camera.  I would be very glad if the Minister would inform us of the exact number of applications which are at present pending before the Commission, the number in respect of which some preliminary steps have been taken, and the number in respect of which nothing has yet been done, and whether any applications for tariffs have been referred to the Tariff Commission during the last twelve months, for example, or if there is any reason to believe that public confidence in the efficiency of the machine has broken down, and that those who were foolish enough to rush in at the beginning, thinking that the machine was workable, are still struggling to get their applications heard by that body.</P>
    <P>As far as I have been able to discover, when the present applications are disposed of it is not likely that many more will be forthcoming, except, of course, applications to amend and correct the mistakes made by the Tariff Commission in previous reports.  I suggested here, on a previous occasion, that a special abnormal situation existed when the Tariff Commission was first appointed. That special abnormal situation still exists.  By that I mean that immediately after the establishment of the Tariff Commission a comparatively large number of <Col N="338" /> applications came in simultaneously, with which, of course, it was not possible for the Tariff Commission, as constituted, to deal.  It is not likely, even if the Tariff Commission survives much longer, that the situation will ever again be repeated. When the first set of applications have been disposed of, future applications will come in individually and with considerable intervals of time between them.  It will be possible under these normal circumstances for a body like this to deal with the applications referred to it by the Minister for Finance, but as the body is constituted at present it is obviously incapable of dealing expeditiously with the various applications still pending.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would require an amendment of the Tariff Commission Act to enable the Minister to set up, as I suggested before, two or three such bodies, or quite a number of such bodies equal to the number of applications to be considered, to enable that preliminary work to be disposed of in a short period of time.  I know, of course, that the Minister has ideas on this subject which are somewhat in conflict with ours.  He seems to think that it would not be a good thing for the country if all the industries seeking protection, if favourably reported on by the Tariff Commission, should get it at once, because of the possible effect on the cost of living, although the possible effect on the cost of living would probably be in favour of the consumers and not against them, as our experience in relation to existing tariffs has shown.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the position of industrialists concerned in the matter, the number of those people who made application for protection in 1926 and who are still without it.  These people are not now able to make as strong a case for protection as they were three years ago.  The efficiency of their industry has declined, their resources have declined, and their ability to deal with the requirements of the country as regards the particular goods they manufacture has also declined.  In fact, I would go <Col N="339" /> so far as to say that very considerable damage has been done to industry in this country by the fact that this delay has taken place.  I made reference to the fact that in one particular industry some of the best equipped and mose efficient concerns have actually been driven to the wall in the period between the making of the application for the tariff and the present time, when the Report of the Tariff Commission on these applications is not available. I do not think that it is treating Irish industrialists fairly to have them handicapped by the existence of this institution.  Therefore I propose to ask the Dáil to vote against this Estimate in the hope that some Deputies who may be unduly sleepy at this hour of the morning may, by mistake, vote with me, and that therefore, if we get a majority, the Minister for Finance will be forced to reconsider his original opinions in relation to the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the very apex of cynicism that we should be discussing an important Vote like this under present conditions.  Last night we had a debate, and because of the subject of it, it might be described as painful almost.  It was on the Estimate for the President's Office on which arose the question of unemployment and the attitude of the Executive Council to that problem. After the most piteous speeches from every part of the House, and after numerous Deputies had appealed to the Government to say whether they could not do something to relieve the problem, the House had to come to the conclusion that it could do nothing to help that unfortunate class, and that the sooner they get out of life, or at least out of this country, the better for themselves.  But now when a subject that is very closely related to that, a subject which on the Minister's own statement can be proved to have been a most influential factor in connection with unemployment, comes up for discussion there is no Deputy in the House but is eager to get away, and no Deputy in <Col N="340" /> the House has energy enough to give the matter the consideration it deserves.  Generally, there is what may be called a somnolent attitude in regard to it.</P>
      <P>The feeling of cynicism is not lessened when we realise that the Minister did not think it worth his while, when introducing the Estimate, to describe what his attitude is with regard to the numerous applications before the Tariff Commission. He did not tell us what reports may be expected, and how soon they may be expected, or how far the reports on hands for years have got, or what arrangements have been made with regard to hastening the work, if there are any.  Yet the same Minister told us a few months ago, when introducing a tariff on woollens, that this tariff was expected to provide work for 1,000 additional hands.  Suppose the other applications before the Tariff Commission are going to provide work for one-half that number of hands, should we not get a little more information about them?  Should we not have this Estimate discussed under more reasonable conditions than it is being discussed now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would like to know something about such a simple application as that for a tariff on a particular kind of quilts.  It is now a long time since there were public sittings on that application.  It is surely not so technical and does not require such enormous inquiry that there could not be a report by this time.  Yet there is no information.  We do not know whether it will come this year or next year.  Then we are given no information on the question of a tariff on fish-barrels.  Yet I think it is stated that if the fish barrels for the miserable Irish trade were made in the Saorstát a considerable amount of employment would be given, and a valuable industry would be preserved to the Saorstát. Might not the Minister have told us whether it is not practicable in a case where very elaborate inquiries have to be made, to issue an interim report?  The Minister was questioned a few months ago as to <Col N="341" /> whether an interim report on the coach-building industry was not practicable.  He was reminded that the opposition to particular sections of the application was very small indeed and very uninfluential.  His reply was: &ldquo;Oh, not at all; there is a very big opposition, and the suggestion of an interim report cannot be acted upon.&rdquo;  Since then, I believe, some of the Ministers have had numerous deputations knocking at their doors, wanting to be heard on that particular portion of the application to which the section related. One would think, for his own peace of mind, that the Minister would ask the Tariff Commission: &ldquo;What can you do about this?  Have you made up your minds?  Could you give me any recommendation which would enable me to give a reply to these people?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was reminded in connection with that branch of industry that a very important works was closing down, and there was the reply, &ldquo;It is a common thing for works to close down, and we need not be alarmed at that.&rdquo;  It may be a common thing for factories to close down in other countries, but is this country in the position that she can afford a factory to close down which in reality means that the only industry in a fairly important town in the South of Ireland has ceased to operate?  I think if the Minister inquired about the opposition to that particular section of the coach-building industry he would find there was never yet evidence given so useless for any purpose.  I think any one of the Commissioners would have told him it was not worth while to report on it, that as far as the evidence against the application went they could report in ten minutes, that there was no opposition to the application.  I think the Deputies should realise that they are looking for trouble in connection with a lot of these matters, and particularly in connection with that matter.  There is a very influential section of the artisan population that is getting really heated and excited over the long delays, and the apparently callous attitude of <Col N="342" /> the Ministry in regard to that particular matter.  If to-morrow they get out of hand and begin to lose their tempers, and that their fever spreads to other sections, neither the Juries Bill nor any other measure the Dáil would pass would appease them.</P>
    <P>I am not one to issue threats or anything of that kind, but I think Deputies can go too far in their conservatism, and in their confidence that everything is going for the best in the best of all possible worlds.  If they look beneath the surface and realise the hardship that not merely the workers but the employers are going through at present because of this indifference on the part of the Government, they will see that there is a problem to be met, and they will see the necessity for exerting their influence for more expedition on the part of the Tariff Commission than there is at present.  When this question was raised in previous debates no reply was forthcoming, and I suppose one need not be surprised if no reply is given now; but I think the House should insist that a reply will be forthcoming, and that the system that is adopted by every country in the world of protecting its workers and its industries, to capture all the trade and all the work they can for its own people, ought at least to get fair consideration.  It does not get fair consideration in this country.  I would hope there would be a majority of the House on this occasion to show they are not satisfied with the Government's activities on this matter.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Lemass, the Government are satisfied with the work of the Tariff Commission. The three members who constitute the Commission did feel the strain of the work imposed upon them, and were anxious to be relieved of their duties, but as there were a number of applications which had been partly heard, and which would be greatly delayed if a change of membership took place, we pressed the members of the Commission to go on with the work for <Col N="343" /> another period.  They have responsible duties outside the Tariff Commission. As far as possible, special assistance has been given in their offices with a view to lightening their other duties, though we believe that as a result of the fact that they have still their duties in their other offices to attend to, some delay must occur in disposing of applications.  That delay is not very great, for it has been found that between the stages of an application considerable intervals must elapse.  When a sitting takes place further information has to be sought.  Sometimes it requires weeks to get that information, and on occasions even months.  Had the Tariff Commission nothing else to do it would not be really possible, even with the number of applications that have so far come in, to occupy it more than half its time, except it proceeded to carry out investigations of a more elaborate and fundamental character than are necessary. Consequently we do not believe that the constitution of the Tariff Commission by civil servants has appreciably delayed the disposal of any application that came before it. With reference to applications that are at present in and are in course of being dealt with, the coach and motor bodies is one of the principal that is being dealt with.  A great deal of time has been given to that, but the number of sittings has not been so great as in other cases. There have been nine sittings, but there were a great many delays in the early stages for which the Commission was not in any way responsible. A public sitting is to be held at a fairly early date to hear further evidence, but the Commissioners are arranging to visit factories, both here and outside the Saorstát, before the final sitting for the hearing of evidence takes place.  The down quilts application has been fully considered, and the Tariff Commission are now preparing their report.  The position is the same with regard to fish-barrels.  All evidence has been heard, and the Commissioners are preparing their report.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> There has been an application in connection with maize products, but the people concerned do not seem to be proceeding with that; at any rate, the detailed case has not been submitted.  In the case of sole, insole, and leather for the manufacture of harness, statements are awaited from the Irish Boot Manufacturers' Association and other bodies.  The people who have made the application in connection with picture frames do not seem to be proceeding; at any rate, the amount of the fee was fixed long ago but it has not yet been paid.  With regard to wrapping paper, the Commission have been visiting certain works in England, and there are just one or two points on which further evidence is awaited.  One of them is with regard to evidence of the ability of the British group which is involved to finance the Clondalkin Mills.  The application in connection with articles of gold, silver and electro-plate has reached the stage that the applicants were asked on 22nd May to lodge a detailed case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that there is any real justification for the delay in dealing with coach bodies?  Does he not think that the main facts could easily be ascertained and that such reaction as he fears could be foreseen very readily?  That has been in for two years.  Deputy Lemass yesterday pointed out how we differ from the people in Australia in dealing with this question.  I think that his estimate was that over £600,000 was being lost every year, particularly recently, in view of the rate at which these things are now coming in, and this money could very well be retained here.  Surely we cannot afford, when we have the unemployment problem as it is at present, to wait for an indeterminable period for a report on a matter that is so comparatively simple as coach-building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The applicants have been largely responsible for the delay.  The application was referred to the Commission on 31st January. <Col N="345" /> The detailed case was lodged by the applicants on 31st March.  The applicants were notified of the fee that would be charged on 22nd April; the fee was not paid until 6th August, and the stamped form was returned to the Commission on 23rd August.  Then the scope of the application was modified by the applicants which led to a further delay, so that the application was not announced in the Press until 4th November.  Then, in December, there was a further request from the applicants for a delay, and an amended application was put in on 3rd February, 1928.  There were hearings in August and October. There has been, perhaps, some little delay in this last month, but up to that there was no delay for which anybody could be held responsible but the applicants.  I am anxious to bring this to a conclusion as far as possible, and I have recently urged the Tariff Commission to do all they can to have it concluded.  I hope that the issue of the report will not be very long delayed.</P>

      <P>Does not this prove fairly conclusively that the Government are depending on the applicants? Has not the Government itself individual responsibility in this matter?  If there is £600,000 being lost to the country have not the Government a responsibility?  Surely even if there were no applicants whatever in a case of this kind they ought to take action.  It seems to me that this is simply a policy of blaming the applicants because they do not do this or that, and in that the Government is simply avoiding its own responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Tariff Commission Act we deliberately took up the point of view that we would not impose a tariff unless people who were either carrying on the industry already, or who satisfied the Tariff Commission that they could and would carry it on would make an application.  That is, we would not put on a tariff, as it were, in the void, in the hope that somebody might take it up, or that something would <Col N="346" /> happen.  It was really that people who knew the business, either because they were in it here or in it elsewhere, would make a case and would satisfy the Tariff Commission that a certain tariff would suffice and that the prospects of the industry were such as would justify that tariff.  That is implicit in the Tariff Commission Act.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister reconsider his decision not to ask for an interim report in the matter of bus bodies?  In the case of that application the only serious opposition was in respect of the ordinary private car bodies; there was no objection to the bus bodies at all.  If an interim report were submitted by the Tariff Commission I think it would be bound to be favourable, and a tariff upon that particular class of import would at least keep a number of important factories engaged in the industry in existence until the full application has been considered.</P>

The sum is required in respect of portion of the registration expenses payable out of monies provided by the Oireachtas under the Juries Act, 1927, Section 12 (1). The Minister might explain that somewhat cryptic reference.  What does this section imply?  I do not see exactly why the registration expenses should be provided by the Oireachtas under the Juries Act.

There is another item&mdash;recoupment of postage incurred by registration officers in university constituencies, Rule 17 of the Second Schedule of the Electoral Act, 1923.  There are a considerable number of matters that would warrant inquiry in connection with the general administration of the Act, and the methods under which contests for university constituencies are conducted.  First of all, I think that, despite the provisions of the Electoral Act, a considerable amount of dual voting takes place at these elections.  I presume the registration officers in these cases are also the returning officers, and I should like to know from the Minister what steps they take in order to secure that elections <Col N="351" /> for university constituencies are conducted in accordance with the law.

For that reason, it raises a principle upon which we must either accept or reject this particular Vote, and as it is connected with the application of the Juries Act, obviously we are obliged to vote against the Estimate, because it raises the whole question of the new Juries Act, as it will come into operation, I presume.</P>

      <P>That is all that is left to us.  We must form our own line of conduct upon what we anticipate is going to happen in the course of the next year, and if we find a sum of money voted now which is, in all human probability, going to be used for a particular purpose in the course of the next year, obviously we must vote against that particular Estimate.</P>

      <P>As it has been suggested from the benches opposite that I am muddled, may I say that I might have less cause for being so than some Deputies have?  There is a point upon which I desire information. I want to know whether this particular Vote has anything to do with the drawing up of jurors' lists and if so what control the Minister for Justice or any other Minister has over the registrars.  In view of the fact that £20 was the valuation throughout, I believe, 25 counties for being put upon the jurors' list and that £40 is the valuation in the County Wexford, is it considered that in Wexford a man is not respectable enough to be a juror except he has a valuation of £40? Who makes the regulation?  I would be glad if the Minister would give me information on that point.</P>
